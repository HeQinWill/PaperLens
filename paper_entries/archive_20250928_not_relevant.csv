10.1088/1748-9326/adf978,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注气候变化对飓风灾害后联邦援助分配的影响，特别是针对2017年飓风哈维在德克萨斯州哈里斯县造成的洪水灾害。研究通过洪水模型估算由气候变化引起的洪水损失，并分析这些损失与联邦紧急事务管理局（FEMA）的洪水保险计划（NFIP）和个人援助计划（IA）的资金分配之间的关系。研究发现，气候变化导致的洪水损失对联邦援助的分配有显著影响，尤其是在个人援助方面。论文主要探讨气候变化背景下联邦资金的使用问题，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,[],Kevin T Smiley;Ilan Noy;Michael F Wehner;Oliver E J Wing;KayLynn Larrison,Climate change and federal aid disbursements after Hurricane Harvey: an extreme event attribution analysis,"The role climate change plays in increasing the burden placed on governments and insurers to pay for recovery has not been extensively explored and is the focus of this study. This study examines the impacts of climate change attributed flooding on federal disaster aid disbursement in Harris County, Texas following Hurricane Harvey in 2017. Our approach uses flood models to estimate the amount of flood damages attributable and not attributable to climate change under two climate change attribution scenarios from peer reviewed studies: 20% and 38% increases in rainfall associated with the hurricane due to climate change. These estimates are combined with census tract-level disbursement data for FEMA’s National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) and the Individual Assistance (IA) part of the Individuals and Households Program. We employ spatial lag regression models with direct and spatial spillover effects to analyze the relationship between a tract’s flood damages—both attributed and not attributed to climate change—and federal disaster aid. We find that both types of flood damage shape federal aid disbursements, but that climate change attributed damages tend to have larger effect sizes (elasticities) especially for IA. Specifically, for a 1% increase in additional climate change attributed damages per household in a census tract (under the 20% scenario), expected NFIP levels in that census tract are 0.26% higher and IA levels are 0.3% higher. Implications center on federal funding in an era of climate change."
10.1088/1748-9326/adfa3b,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注的是气候变化背景下，北大西洋经向翻转环流（AMOC）的未来变化趋势。论文通过分析CMIP6气候模式的预测结果，发现高排放情景下，AMOC可能在2100年后崩溃，导致北大西洋深水形成的停止，进而影响北半球的热量输送和气候。论文重点在于海洋环流和气候模式预测，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,"['Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC)', 'Climate Modeling', 'Ocean Circulation', 'Deep Water Formation', 'Climate Change Projections']",Sybren Drijfhout;Joran R Angevaare;Jennifer Mecking;René M van Westen;Stefan Rahmstorf,Shutdown of northern Atlantic overturning after 2100 following deep mixing collapse in CMIP6 projections,"Several, more recent global warming projections in the coupled model intercomparison project 6 contain extensions beyond year 2100–2300/2500. The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) in these projections shows transitions to extremely weak overturning below the surface mixed layer (<6 Sv; 1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1) in all models forced by a high-emission (SSP585) scenario and sometimes also forced by an intermediate- (SSP245) and low-emission (SSP126) scenario. These extremely weak overturning states are characterised by a shallow maximum overturning at depths less than 200 m and a shutdown of the circulation associated with North Atlantic deep water formation. Northward Atlantic heat transport at 26°N decreases to 20%–40% of the current observed value. Heat release to the atmosphere north of 45°N weakens to less than 20% of its present-day value and in some models completely vanishes, leading to strong cooling in the subpolar North Atlantic and Northwest Europe. In all cases, these transitions to a weak and shallow AMOC are preceded by a mid-21st century collapse of maximum mixed-layer depth in Labrador, Irminger and Nordic Seas. The convection collapse is mainly caused by surface freshening from a decrease in northward salt advection due to the weakening AMOC but is likely initiated by surface warming. Maximum mixed-layer depths in the observations are still dominated by internal variability but notably feature downward trends over the last 5–10 years in all deep mixing regions for all data products analysed. This could be merely variability but is also consistent with the model-predicted decline of deep mixing."

Freshwater ecosystems are vital for biodiversity, water security, and economic systems, but often lose protection during droughts. Spain, largely under a Mediterranean climate, shows strong interdependence between ecological and socioeconomic systems, with agriculture, tourism, and energy sectors heavily reliant on scarce water resources. Spain’s economy has thrived on water-dependent activities yet increasing droughts and infrastructure limits are pushing ecosystems toward collapse, with severe biodiversity loss and irreversible damage. Furthermore, investments aimed at increasing water-use efficiency often backfire, leading to expanded irrigation without real water savings. Climate change, urbanization, and pollution exacerbate these tensions, posing risks to public health and economic stability. Transformative strategies are urgently needed: protecting and restoring ecosystems, promoting conservation agriculture, regulating water-intensive industries, and planning collective responses to illegal water use. Simply increasing supply or reacting to crises without systemic change of water demands will not ensure future water security. Spain’s experience highlights the urgent need for integrated management of natural and human systems to preserve freshwater resources, biodiversity, and economic resilience."

This study simulated the changing spatiotemporal patterns of the impacts of ship emissions on PM2.5 from 2017 to 2021 based on the updated emission inventories and mapping of chemical species in the CMAQ (Community Multiscale Air Quality). Fuel policies caused evident relative changes in inorganic and organic components of the shipping-related PM2.5 over China’s port cities. The driving factors of the interannual, seasonal, and diurnal patterns were discussed. 
 The issue of air pollution caused by ship emissions is becoming prominent with the increasing global shipping activities. China has carried out fuel oil policies in three stages in the past few years to meet the requirements of the global low sulfur regulation by the International Maritime Organization (IMO). However, the impacts of staged policies on air quality in China are not sufficiently understood. This study firstly updated the ship emission inventory including PM2.5 components based on field and on-board measurements under the staged fuel oil policies. Then, the impacts of ship emissions on PM2.5 and its gas precursors and primary and secondary components in China from 2017 to 2021 were revealed by using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. In the model domain, the 99th percentile of the shipping-related PM2.5 concentrations was reduced by 19.5 % and then by 35.6 % due to the policy shifts. Ship emissions increased the PM2.5 concentrations up to 3.8 µg m−3 in 2017 and 2.6 µg m−3 in 2021. The areas with high concentration levels widely distributed over offshore waters in 2017 and shrunk to some parts of China's coast in 2021. The contributions of ship emissions to the PM2.5 concentrations over China's main port cities ranged from 3.0 % to 17.4 % in 2017 and 2.5 % to 10.3 % in 2021. In these cities, the change rates of the concentrations of PM2.5, SO42-, NO3-, NH4+, carbonaceous aerosols, V, and Ni related to ship emissions from 2017 to 2021 were −32.7 %, −74.0 %, +11.0 %, −27.5 %, −76.9 %, −90.3 %, and −38.4 %, respectively. NO3- constituted 54.6 % of the shipping-related PM2.5 in 2021. Our findings suggest that it is important to consider both transport pathways and secondary aerosol formation mechanisms to combat the PM2.5 pollution caused by shipping in different regions."

By using advanced modelling techniques and incorporating sea surface temperature observations, it provides a consistent picture of long-term climate variability. The dataset captures key ocean, sea ice, and atmosphere changes, helping scientists understand past climate changes and variability. 
 Climate reanalyses are essential for studying climate variability, understanding climate processes, and initializing climate predictions. We present CoRea1860+ (Wang and Counillon, 2025, https://doi.org/10.11582/2025.00009), a 30-member coupled reanalysis spanning from 1860 to the present, produced using the Norwegian Climate Prediction Model (NorCPM) and assimilating sea surface temperature (SST) observations. NorCPM combines the Norwegian Earth System Model with the ensemble Kalman filter data assimilation method. SST, available throughout the entire period, serves as the primary source of instrumental oceanic measurements prior to the 1950s. CoRea1860+ belongs to the category of sparse-input reanalyses, designed to minimize artefacts arising from changes in the observation network over time. By exclusively assimilating oceanic data, this reanalysis offers valuable insights into the ocean's role in driving climate system variability, including its influence on the atmosphere and sea ice. This study first describes the numerical model, the SST dataset, and the assimilation implementation used to produce CoRea1860+. It then provides a comprehensive evaluation of the reanalysis across four key aspects, namely reliability, ocean variability, sea ice variability, and atmospheric variability, benchmarked against more than 10 independent reanalyses and observational datasets. Overall, CoRea1860+ demonstrates strong reliability, particularly in observation-rich periods, and provides a reasonable representation of climate variability. It successfully captures key features such as multi-decadal variability and long-term trends in ocean heat content, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation, and sea ice variability in both hemispheres. Furthermore, to some extent, CoRea1860+ agrees with the reference atmospheric datasets for surface air temperature, precipitation, sea level pressure, and 500 hPa geopotential height, especially in the tropics where air–sea interactions are most pronounced."

The dataset consisted in eddy covariance and meteorological measurements over four pairs of agroforestry and open cropland systems, and one pair of agroforestry and open grassland system. This is the first ever dataset compiling this type of data over temperate agroforestry systems. 
 Agroforestry systems are considered suitable nature-based solutions to mitigate climate change. Long-term measurements of CO2 fluxes, evapotranspiration and sensible heat fluxes are, however, largely still missing. Here we present a unique eddy covariance and meteorological dataset from a total of ten stations paired over agroforestry and open cropland or grassland agricultural sites located in Northern Germany. The data were harmonized to create a consistent dataset which includes gap-filled time series of meteorological and lower-cost eddy covariance measurements with identical instrumentation, accounting for a total of seventy eight site-years of data. The objective of this dataset is to provide observational data on the differences of meteorological conditions, carbon, water and energy balances of adjacent agroforestry and open cropland or grassland sites in five distinct climatic regions of Germany. This extensive, continuous dataset can be used to study ecosystem properties and the potential benefits of agroforestry. It can also be used to parametrize models on crop and biomass productivity, or to evaluate the response of such agroecosystems to climate change scenarios, among other applications.

However, the latest research has shown that FAC can be formed as a secondary oxidant in the ClO2 reaction with activated aromatic compounds, such as phenols. In this study, the reaction of ClO2 with aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycles (NCHs) is investigated as another possible FAC precursor. Six-membered aromatic NCHs showed low reactivity (rate constants <10–3 M–1 s–1) while five-membered rings, namely pyrrole and imidazole, were more reactive. Pyrrole reacted with a rate constant of (1.18 ± 0.3) × 103 M–1 s–1 and formed 7 to 45% FAC depending on the ClO2 to pyrrole ratios. The imidazole reaction was pH-dependent since its anionic species (pKa = 14.4) rate constant was (2.08 ± 1.4) × 106 M–1 s–1. However, the reaction at pH 7 is relatively slow (6.7 × 10–2 M–1 s–1). Imidazole also showed 37% FAC formation. Nucleobases, adenine, guanine, as well as the pharmaceutical dexmedetomidine, have imidazole moieties and show a very similar reaction rate constant, FAC yield, and ClO2 consumption in their reaction with ClO2, pointing out the relevance of aromatic nitrogen-containing heterocycles in ClO2 application."

Using a dynamic stock model, we measure the cumulative demands (2023–2060) for 17 metals across the entire hydrogen industrial chain under five scenarios. Results show that although the shift to green hydrogen reduces the demands for cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), and magnesium (Mg), it significantly increases the demands for lanthanum (La), lithium (Li), platinum group metals (PGMs), and titanium (Ti). In the baseline scenario, 87.4% of metals are sourced from primary resources, but the application of the circular economy could reduce such demands by 20–77%. Notably, even with aggressive recycling, there will be potential PGM supply shortages, indicating that it is urgent to obtain such supply through international cooperation.

In this study, we achieved an improvement in both activity and selectivity of Mn-based SCR catalysts by W modification and revealed the mechanism by which the formation of Mn–W dinuclear active sites enhances their performance. By combining experimental measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, the improved NH3-SCR performance of the MnW/TiO2 catalyst was attributed to the significant redox role of W, resulting from the formation of strongly interacting Mn–W dinuclear sites. The entire NH3-SCR reaction pathway over the Mn–W dinuclear site was elucidated at the atomic level, confirming that the W sites played a redox role in the reaction, specifically by directly participating in the oxidative activation of NH3.

Here, we demonstrate that the air–water interface in microdroplets can be strategically utilized to dramatically enhance PFOA (C0 = 20 mg L–1) degradation through a simple Fe(III)-Oxalate photochemical system, achieving complete destruction with 99% defluorination within 4 h at room temperature - a rate 2 orders of magnitude faster than conventional methods. Through comprehensive spectroscopic and computational investigations, we reveal that this remarkable enhancement stems from three synergistic interfacial effects: concentrated generation of superoxide radicals (O2·–) from earth-abundant Fe(III)-Oxalate complexes, significantly enhanced O2·- nucleophilicity due to disrupted solvation shells, and a strong interfacial electric field that catalyzes C–F bond activation. These molecular-level insights into interfacial chemistry not only provide an efficient and economical strategy for PFOA remediation but also establish a new paradigm for enhancing nucleophilic reactions in aqueous systems.

During surface water filtration, ZPM demonstrated high pure water permeance (about 1433 L·m–2·h–1·bar–1) and superior fouling-resistant ability compared with the commercial ultrafiltration membrane. The enhanced fouling control was attributed to the greater hydrophilicity and narrower pore size of ZPM. Molecular dynamics simulations and XDLVO analysis revealed that the reduced values of van der Waals energy during the interaction between foulants and ZPM were the main mechanism. Furthermore, the zwitterionic polymer underwent deformation under a NaCl solution (10 g·L–1) due to the antielectrolyte effect, causing ZPM to mechanical swelling. This mechanical effect alone can remove 70% of the membrane fouling resistance, comparable to the performance of pure water backwashing. The swelling of ZPM also reduced the membrane pore size, leading to a 56% increase in flux velocity, further removing membrane fouling resistance. This study provides new insights into enhanced membrane fouling control across the entire filtration cycle by implementing a dual strategy that combines high-efficiency membrane material with a cost-effective operational process."

Through laboratory simulations and analyses of natural riparian sediments, we demonstrate that the dark production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is essential for this process. Hydroxyl radical (•OH)-mediated oxidation emerges as the dominant dephosphorylation pathway, with superoxide (O2•-) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) acting as key intermediates. Redox oscillations enhance the mobilization of sedimentary OP into the dissolved phase, thereby accelerating its ROS-mediated dephosphorylation. Investigations of natural sediments confirm that ROS produced during redox oscillations drive abiotic OP mineralization, with reaction rates controlled by sediment electron-exchange capacity and iron speciation. These results reveal a previously unrecognized abiotic pathway for OP transformation that operates alongside enzymatic hydrolysis, photodegradation, and mineral-catalyzed degradation."

Soil organic carbon accrual dictated carbon removals and GHG emissions intensity. Many enterprises applied N fertilizer at rates higher than recommended best practices, suggesting that reduced fertilizer quantities may sustainably reduce GHG emissions without impacting yields. We conclude that many macadamia farms are net carbon sinks, which contrasts with other agricultural sectors that are often sources of GHGs. We illustrate how the adoption of bespoke interventions, such as optimization of N fertilizer use, improvement of intrarow ground cover, and avoidance of tillage, can abate enterprise emissions while also improving food security, enterprise prosperity, and environmental stewardship."

Herein, this study proposes a thermodynamic control strategy by introducing micro-nanobubbles (MNBs) into an aqueous Fe(II)/O2 system to stimulate its potential. Experimental results indicate that MNBs alter the electron transfer pathway from aqueous Fe(II) to O2, shifting the predominant mechanism from a one-electron transfer pathway to a two-electron transfer pathway; this can reduce energy loss and improve the overall electron utilization efficiency. Under optimal conditions, ·OH production and pollutant degradation reached 20 μM and 15%, respectively, compared to almost 0 in the system without MNBs. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that MNBs lower the oxidation–reduction potential (ORP) of the system and reduce the Gibbs free energy of key reaction steps, enabling efficient ·OH production. The aqueous Fe(II)/MNBs/O2 system demonstrates a broad applicability for the degradation of various pollutants with removal rates ranging from 25% to 36%, highlighting its potential as a promising approach for green and sustainable groundwater remediation."

However, there are limited data on the long-term aging of MPs in different natural environments. The natural aging characteristics of polyethylene MPs (PE-MPs) and polylactic acid MPs (PLA-MPs) exposed to air, soil surface, and subsurface conditions for 6 and 12 months, respectively, were evaluated. The results showed that PE-MPs and PLA-MPs exhibited distinct aging characteristics under identical conditions. Photolysis represents the primary aging mechanism for PE-MPs, and prolonged solar radiation significantly reduces their stability (p < 0.05). Notably, soil minerals (e.g., Illite and quartz) formed armor-like coatings encapsulating PE-MP surfaces through chemical interfacial interactions (C–Si–O, Si–O–C, and Al–O–C)─a novel mechanism enhancing PE stability in soils. However, the stable interfacial adhesion between soil minerals and PLA-MPs is minimal. Microbial degradation as the primary aging mechanism renders PLA-MPs in soil more susceptible to aging compared to those in air, consequently exhibiting lower stability. This study highlights the mineral-mediated aging of MPs in soil and demonstrates how mineral coatings enhance the stability of PE-MPs. This underscores the necessity of incorporating mineral-mediated aging processes into MP risk assessments for soil ecosystems."

However, how ARGs evolve during natural succession in pristine ecosystems remains poorly understood. In this study, we utilized metagenomic sequencing to investigate ARG dynamics across a 12,000 year sedimentary chronosequence in an intertidal zone. ARG abundance and diversity showed a significant upward trend with sediment depth, peaking in the deepest, oldest layers, as corroborated by compositional shifts linked to sediment age (PERMANOVA, p < 0.001). This trend reflects the natural evolution of ARGs dominated by stochastic process, as supported by the low detection rates of three human activity-related indicators and the robust fit to the neutral community model (R2 = 0.576). Furthermore, ARG evolution was mainly attributed to alterations in microbial communities, reflected in the growing complexity of ARG-microbe interaction networks and significant procrustes correlations between microbial taxa and ARG profiles. Specially, Proteobacteriota and Actinobacteriota were identified as the key taxa driving ARG evolution, with their succession patterns closely mirroring ARG enrichment trends. Interestingly, the enrichment of MGEs in deeper sediments and their closer association with ARGs during natural succession underscore an enhanced HGT potential, highlighting the pivotal role of MGEs in driving ARG evolution. This study reveals the natural dynamics of ARGs during sedimentary processes, providing an important reference for understanding their independent natural evolution and strengthening our insight into the progression of environmental antibiotic resistance development."

We investigated these associations and examined the mediating role of maternal and neonatal thyroid hormones in a Chinese birth cohort consisting of 501 mother-child pairs. We found that exposure to 2-hydroxy-benzothiazole (2-OH-BTH) in early pregnancy was inversely associated with childhood body mass index (BMI) (β = −0.041, 95% CI: −0.077, −0.005).

Hospital effluents contain both natural and synthetic hormones that might significantly contribute to endocrine disruption in aquatic ecosystems. In this study, HT-EDA has been implemented to identify the main effect-drivers (testosterone, androsterone and norgestrel) from hospital effluent using microplate fractionation, the AR-CALUX bioassay and an efficient data processing workflow. Through nontargeted screening, over 5000 features (ESI+) were initially detected, but our workflow’s prioritization based on androgenic activity prediction reduced the number of features requiring further analysis by over 95%, significantly streamlining the workload. In addition, the semiquantitative nontarget analysis allowed for the calculation of the contribution of an identified compound to the total activity of the sample without the need for reference standards. While this contribution was low (∼4.3%) and applicable to only one compound (1,4-androstadiene-3,17-dione), it presents the first approach for calculating such contributions without relying on standards.

This ocular accumulation significantly alters neurotransmitter levels critical to visual processing. Our findings reveal a previously overlooked mechanism of sensory disruption with potential consequences for fish behavior, ecological interactions, and population fitness.

Understanding their human exposure is critical for the risk management of these nanomaterials. Once released into the environment, metal nanomaterials are prone to undergo sulfidation. This process significantly alters the physicochemical properties of the nanomaterials and subsequently, dictates the extents and pathways of exposure. Here, we show that sulfidation of nanosized Ag, ZnO, CuO, and Cu2O affects their macrophage uptake to varied degrees, by differentially regulating protein corona compositions and aggregation states of the nanomaterials. Sulfidation-induced changes in hydrodynamic diameters determine whether macrophage uptake occurs through endocytosis or phagocytosis. For a given uptake pathway, the extents of uptake depend on macrophage recognition of protein corona, the compositions of which are largely influenced by sulfidation. Specifically, increased abundance of transferrin and low-density apolipoprotein C2 in the corona as affected by sulfidation promotes clathrin-mediated endocytosis, while the enrichment of complement factor H facilitates uptake by complement receptor-mediated phagocytosis. The findings advance our understanding on the nanospecific mechanisms governing environmental behaviors and implications of nanomaterials, and further underline the importance of taking into account the aging processes in the risk management of these materials."

However, knowledge about the MC concentrations in plateau lakes experiencing high solar radiation is scarce. This study investigated the spatial-temporal distribution of MCs in eight Yunnan Plateau lakes in China, focusing on their relationships with environmental factors. Water samples (n = 63) were collected during summer and winter seasons and analyzed for MC concentrations along with a suite of environmental variables. Results revealed significant seasonal and spatial variations in MC concentrations, with higher levels in eutrophic lakes Dianchi, Erhai, and Xingyunhu. Notably, mean MC concentrations in Lake Dianchi during summer and Erhai during winter exceeded the World Health Organization’s provisional guideline of 1 μg/L for drinking water. Seasonal analyses revealed distinct regulatory mechanisms: MC concentrations in summer were positively correlated with total phosphorus, total nitrogen, turbidity, and chlorophyll a, reflecting the influence of eutrophication on cyanobacterial growth. While solar radiation intensity (SRI) exhibited a dual role: moderate SRI in winter was associated with higher MC levels, whereas higher SRI in summer suppressed MC production, likely due to photoinhibition or MC degradation. Strikingly, water temperature showed no significant correlation with MC concentrations, suggesting that high solar radiation in the Yunnan Plateau may override temperature-dependent effects on cyanobacterial growth. These findings highlight the importance of nutrient management and the regulatory role of solar radiation in regulating MC production in high-altitude lakes. The study underscores the need for region-specific strategies to mitigate cyanobacterial risks, particularly in drinking water source lakes, by integrating nutrient control and the unique light regime of plateau ecosystems."

After 4 weeks of exposure, zebrafish ovaries exhibited polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS)-like changes, including polycystic ovaries, reduced spawning rates, and elevated androgen levels. Moreover, ETO was transmitted to offspring via maternal ovaries, significantly increasing larval mortality and deformity rates while reducing their locomotor activity. Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling revealed oxidative stress responses, disrupted unsaturated fatty acid and glutathione metabolism, and damage to ovarian granulosa cells and the zona pellucida, as confirmed by reactive oxygen species (ROS) fluorescence staining. Combined multiomics analysis demonstrated that ETO exposure exacerbated ovarian oxidative stress, impaired the functional structure of ovaries, and disrupted follicular cell maturation via hyperactivation of the mechanistic target of the rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) pathway. These changes culminated in PCOS-like effects in zebrafish.

Corresponding increases were observed in FeNO (13.9%; 95% CI: 3.5%, 24.2%), serum CC16 (20.4%, 95% CI: 1.6%, 39.3%), and serum YKL-40 (17.1%, 95% CI: 3.9%, 30.2%). Additionally, three pathogenic pharyngeal bacteria exhibited a higher relative abundance. In summary, acute heat exposure was associated with reductions in lung function and airway injury. Potential biological mechanisms may involve lung epithelial damage, airway inflammation, and disruption of the airway microbiota."

Environmental carcinogens induce mutations leading to tumors; pathogens relying on environmental media transmission cause infections; exposure to chemical or biological pollutants triggers toxicant poisoning. The mechanisms of xenobiotics work by abnormal expression of genes. Since their inception, genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 knockout libraries have been rapidly applied in vitro to dissect the mechanism of diseases. Genome-wide screening of CRISPR/Cas9 knockout libraries has helped to identify genes essential for tumor survival, combinations of genes for synthetic lethal effects, and genes associated with drug resistance or susceptibility. In addition, key host factors and complex toxicological mechanisms of viral infection have been elucidated, contributing to the development of antidotes and the reduction of the incidence of adverse effects. CRISPR/Cas9 library screening can be combined with single-cell sequencing and organoid technologies to identify novel gene interactions and more reliable preclinical data. Future trends in such screening aim to identify more potential molecular targets for more exogenous pathogenic factors, combine screening with other emerging technologies to expand its use in in vitro models, and develop more accurate, accessible, and cost-effective genome editing tools."

Due to the important role of the hippocampus for learning and memory, in this study, we systematically investigated the neural circuit, neuron structure, and function of the hippocampus after BPA exposure. First, by employing a virus tracing technique, we observed a decrease in the neural projection ratio of excitatory neural neurons from the “Entorhinal Cortex-Dentate Gyrus-CA3-CA1” and “Entorhinal Cortex-CA1” circuits. Furthermore, BPA exposure led to impairments of the branching complexity and electrophysiological properties of hippocampal neurons. Additionally, fiber photometry experiments revealed that BPA exposure reduces the level of real-time activity in hippocampal excitatory neurons (CA1, CA3, and DG) during the MWM task. To verify the role of hippocampal excitatory neurons in learning and memory impairment caused by BPA, the dorsal hippocampus CA1 neurons were chemogenetically activated, and the spatial memory deficits were rescued. Collectively, our results suggest that BPA exposure impairs the hippocampal neural circuits and neuronal real-time response, leading to the dysfunction of spatial memory in mice. This study expands our understanding of the neurotoxic mechanisms of BPA at the mesoscopic neural level and provides a potential strategy for rescuing BPA-induced learning and memory impairments."

Nanoscale chirality provides chances to improve efficacies through enantiomer-dependent interactions between cells and chiral cinnabar nanoparticles (HgSNPs). Herein HgSNPs with intrinsically wavelike chirality were prepared through a one-pot seedless method, exhibiting efficacious alleviation of inflammation in vitro and in vivo by HgSNPs with laevorotatory chirality (l-HgSNPs) rather than those with dextrorotatory chirality (d-HgSNPs). The mitogen-activated protein kinase as a crucial pathway involved in inflammation and immunity was directly blocked by l-HgSNPs through inhibition of p38 phosphorylation, so the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines were reduced significantly.

Mussels were the exposed subjects, and exposure concentrations of MPs and TCPP were set at 0.2 mg/L, 1 mg/L, and 0.5 μg/L, respectively. The ecotoxicity of PLA, aged-PLA, TCPP, and TCPP+aged-PLA was compared based on the result that aged-PLA could adsorb more TCPP. Biomarker assays revealed that mussels ingesting and accumulating contaminants underwent a severe oxidative (ROS) and immune stress response in the organism, with disruption of energy metabolism for energy supply, leading to apoptosis, resulting in tissue damage, and disruption of the homeostasis of the symbiotic intestinal microbiota. Comparisons showed that aging enhanced the adverse effects of PLA and ecotoxicological effects are further exacerbated by the adsorption of TCPP on aged-PLA.

The gas-phase oxidation mechanism of γ-terpinene is essential for understanding its influence on atmospheric chemistry and its implications for human health. Utilizing quantum chemical calculations and computational toxicology simulations, we examined the •OH-mediated atmospheric transformation and toxicological progression of γ-terpinene in the indoor environment. The results indicate that •OH additions are the dominant pathways for the reaction of •OH + γ-terpinene. The most favorable reactive intermediates formed from the •OH-addition reactions subsequently react with O2 to form hydroxy γ-terpinene peroxy radicals (OH-γ-terp-RO2•). The formed OH-γ-terp-RO2• follows concerted peroxy radical (RO2•) and alkoxy radical (RO•) modulated autoxidation, providing a new case for such a mechanism beyond the well-known only RO2-driven autoxidation mechanism. Our findings also reveal that the transformation of OH-γ-terp-RO2• demonstrates the competitive nature of the cyclization pathway indoors, with dicarbonyl formation, a rarely observed process in hydroxy terpene RO2 reaction systems. Toxicological evaluations further indicate that a significant proportion of transformation products (TPs) display higher mutagenicity, carcinogenicity, skin sensitization, and irritation to eyes compared to γ-terpinene.

All the substances are associated with various health outcomes, and many of them are classified as carcinogenic or probably/possibly carcinogenic with causal links. To quantify the health burden of the chemical substances included in the AAQD and DWD, we need information regarding population exposure, current baseline mortality/morbidity rates in the populations, and exposure–response functions (ERFs) or unit risks (URs) from previous epidemiological studies. During this study, we analyzed the availability of ERFs or URs and discussed their applicability in health impact assessments (HIAs).

The aim of this study is to derive ERFs, which will allow HIAs for a larger number of chemicals when exposure data and baseline mortality/morbidity data are available. Currently, HIAs have largely focused only on main ambient pollutants such as particulate matter (PM10), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), nitrogen oxides (NOX), and ozone (O3). In contrast, health risks related to exposure to chemicals are much more diverse, and the health burdens should be quantified to a much greater extent."

When men were categorized as having any depressive symptoms (score: > 10 vs ≤ 10), Poisson regression models showed an increased risk of depression across DPHP tertiles (Ptrend = 0.08). Further, we found stronger associations between urinary OPFR metabolite concentrations and depressive symptom scores among men with a higher waist circumference, waist-hip ratio, or waist-height ratio (Pinteraction < 0.15). The machine learning algorithm identified three different patterns of obesity, and the strongest association between urinary DPHP concentrations and depressive symptom scores was observed among men with a waist-hip ratio of ≥ 0.89 and a body mass index of <24 kg/m2.

Here, we utilize data from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) spacecraft to investigate the Martian bow shock, revealing its distinctive characteristics within our solar system. We find that unlike other planetary shocks, the reformation of Mars's bow shock driven by the ultra‐low frequency (ULF) waves is more global and less dependent on shock geometries. This distinct behavior is attributed to the broad distribution of ULF waves in the upstream region at Mars, generated not only by shock‐reflected ions but also by planetary protons. Additionally, during the reformation process, the amplitude of the ULF waves and the steepened structures are significantly large. This results in the newly reformed shock exceeding the original one, a phenomenon not observed at other planets under similar shock conditions. Therefore, the ULF waves significantly enhance the complexity of shock dynamics and play a more substantial role at Mars compared to other planets."

During the PAU crossing, DMSP observed both precipitating electrons and ions (protons) and a plasma drift up to ∼5,000 m/s with a strong shear. Simultaneous ground‐based all‐sky imaging at South Pole captured the dynamic behavior of the PAU that propagated in an anti‐sunward direction at a phase speed of ∼250 m/s. The solar wind conditions during the PAU were a high solar wind speed (∼700 km/s), an intense southward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF, approximately −40 nT), and a high density (37 cm−3).

Two damage pathways have been suggested to explain this relationship: that high temperatures directly stress crops and drive yield loss, or that high temperatures induce water stress in crops, which in turn drives yield loss. Here we explore a third pathway: that soil water stress limits both agricultural productivity and evaporative cooling, giving rise to the nonlinear relationship between temperature and yield. Determining which of these pathways underpins the yield‐temperature relationship is important for predicting future crop productivity because climate change is expected to alter the co‐variability between temperature and water availability. To examine this third pathway, we use cumulative growing‐season transpiration from an idealized land surface model as a proxy for yield. This approach reproduces the observed yield‐temperature relationship, even though the model includes no mechanisms that limit productivity at high temperatures. In experiments where the influence of temperature on soil moisture is suppressed, yields still decline during hot, dry periods in a manner consistent with the observations. We conclude that water stress, and its influence on evaporative cooling, temperature, and agricultural productivity, drives the yield‐temperature relationship found in crops that experience episodic water stress. This framework explains the muted sensitivity of irrigated yields to high atmospheric temperatures, and suggests that future yield outcomes depend more critically on changes in rainfall than suggested by estimates that attribute yield losses primarily to temperature variations."

Two distinctive aspects of Typhoon Khanun's ERC are (a) its ERC occurred during a 2‐day period (∼0600 UTC 1 to ∼0600 UTC 3 August) when its motion slowed down being sandwiched between the midlatitude and low‐latitude subtropical highs and (b) after replacing the inner eyewall, the radius of the outer eyewall expands instead of shrinking and the typhoon's intensity quickly decreased. As revealed in microwave imager brightness temperature observations, the phases of wavenumber‐2 disturbances on the outer side of the inner eyewall and the inner side of the outer eyewall during the ERC had opposite signs. After the ERC was completed, the absolute angular momentum decreased at the outer eyewall, causing expansion of the outer eyewall and a decrease in typhoon intensity. There were also wavenumber‐1 perturbations near both the primary and secondary eyewalls, with the negative phase being located on the left side of the vertical wind shear during most of the ERC period."

Previous studies have independently investigated lightning candidates reported by lightning location systems or space‐based instruments; however, we integrated data from both sources in our analysis. We found that the cloud‐to‐ground lightning ignition efficiency of fire‐igniting strokes with continuing current is slightly higher than that of cloud‐to‐ground lightning without continuing current. In particular, we report that strokes with continuing currents lasting more than 10 ms may have a higher potential to produce wildfires than cloud‐to‐ground strokes without continuing currents when the conditions for the initial spread of the fire are less favorable. Our results suggest that the polarity of the strokes does not significantly influence the likelihood of a fire."

This makes long‐range AR forecasts, specifically at subseasonal timescales, a valuable tool for both water resource and emergency management personnel. Ensemble forecasts of the system for high‐resolution prediction on Earth‐to‐Local Domains (SHiELD) model, configured with a CONUS nested grid, are evaluated for prediction skill relating to both weekly landfalling AR activity and AR‐related precipitation. Results indicate that SHiELD exhibits skillful prediction of landfalling AR activity and extreme daily AR‐related precipitation through week 2 with some skill even extending into week 3. Inspired by divergent outcomes regarding SHiELD's ability to predict two high‐impact ARs, successful week 2 forecasts of landfalling AR activity in SHiELD are found to be dependent, at least in part, on how favorably the large‐scale environment is preconditioned to the development and/or maintenance of AR activity during the preceding week. Our findings suggest SHiELD can skillfully predict AR activity and its related extreme precipitation at leads of 2–3 weeks, providing stakeholders ample time to monitor areas at risk for widespread flooding while also preparing them for potential impacts. Lastly, SHiELD is shown to under‐predict the frequency of AR activity over the southern half of the western US due to systematic mean state integrated vapor transport biases, a finding that highlights an avenue for further advancement of landfalling AR predictability in SHiELD."

In this study, we quantitatively diagnose these uplift mechanisms by solving the quasi‐geostrophic omega equation in Q‐vector form. To provide a process‐based assessment, Q vectors are decomposed into shearwise (i.e., along‐isentrope) and transverse components (i.e., cross‐isentrope), representing the Lagrangian changes in the direction and magnitude, respectively, of the potential temperature gradient following the geostrophic motion. The composite analysis reveals the upper‐ and lower‐tropospheric synoptic‐scale weather conditions which have been documented as being favorable for springtime MCS initiation. We find that shearwise ascent, induced by a baroclinically organized (i.e., westward tilted with height) trough‐ridge couplet, is the leading contributor to total dynamical ascent. The contribution of an upper‐level jet streak, which induces upward motion in its right‐entrance region through geostrophic frontogenesis, turns out to be secondary, as indicated by weak transverse ascent. The lower‐tropospheric transverse ascent, induced by warm frontogenesis at the exit region of the Great Plains low‐level jet, is also limited in magnitude. Furthermore, MCSs initiated under stronger shearwise ascent grow into larger, more precipitation‐producing storms. This study underscores the critical role of transient baroclinic wave amplification not only in the genesis but also in the subsequent evolution of springtime MCSs in the central United States."

 Subduction of oceanic lithosphere and delamination of continental lithosphere constitute the two predominant mechanisms by which the Earth’s surface is recycled into the mantle. Continental plate delamination typically occurs in collisional orogens by the separation of the lithospheric mantle from the overlying lighter crust, aided by weak layers within continental lithosphere. By contrast, oceanic lithosphere is generally considered to be sufficiently rigid to inhibit delamination. Here we show from seismic imaging and numerical simulations that delamination of oceanic lithosphere is occurring offshore Southwest Iberia. Specifically, seismic tomography reveals a high-velocity anomaly that we interpret as a delaminating block of old oceanic lithosphere, a process that we reproduce with numerical simulations. We propose that this process was triggered by plate convergence and assisted by a thick serpentinized layer that allows the lithospheric mantle to decouple from the overlying crust. We suggest that such oceanic delamination may facilitate subduction initiation, a long-unsolved problem in the theory of plate tectonics, and may be responsible for some of the highest-magnitude earthquakes in Europe, including the M8.5–8.7 Great Lisbon Earthquake of 1755 and the M7.9 San Vincente Earthquake of 1969.

Here, the authors report a NF-YA transcription factor gene SW14 regulates soybean seed traits without affecting other agronomic traits by inhibiting GmLEC1-mediated transcriptional activation. 
 Seed weight and oil/protein content are critical agronomic traits that determine soybean yield and quality. However, the key genes controlling these traits and the underlying regulatory mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we performed a combination of genome-wide association study and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping with seed weight variations, and identified a Nuclear Factor-YA (NF-YA) gene on chromosome 14 that positively regulates seed weight and protein content while negatively regulating oil content without affecting other agronomic traits, designated as Seed Weight 14 (SW14). SW14 physically interacts with GmLEC1a/b, the soybean orthologs of the central regulator of plant seed development, Leafy Cotyledon1 (LEC1), to disrupt the formation of a non-canonical NF-Y complex comprising GmLEC1, GmNF-YC2, and GmbZIP67, thereby inhibiting the GmLEC1-mediated transcriptional activation involved in seed development process. Natural allelic variations in SW14 affect the stability of the SW14 protein, which in turn confers varied seed weight and oil/protein content in soybean. Further analysis demonstrates that the elite SW14H3 allele has undergone artificial selection during domestication and holds potential for improving yield in soybean. Collectively, our findings provide insights into the molecular basis that specifically regulates seed weight and quality, offering a potential strategy for overcoming tradeoff effects and facilitating high-yield breeding in soybean.

 CRISPR-based transcriptional activation (CRISPRa) has extensive research and clinical potential. Here, we show that commonly used CRISPRa systems can exhibit pronounced cytotoxicity. We demonstrate the toxicity of CRISPRa vectors expressing the activation domains (ADs) of the transcription factors p65 and HSF1, components of the synergistic activation mediator (SAM) CRISPRa system. Based on our findings for the SAM system, we extended our studies to additional ADs and acetyltransferase core domains. We show that the expression of potent transcriptional activators in lentiviral producer cells can lead to low lentiviral titers, while their expression in the transduced target cells leads to cell death. Using inducible lentiviral vectors, we could not identify an activator expression window for effective SAM-based CRISPRa without measurable toxicity. The toxicity of current SAM-based CRISPRa systems hinders their wide adoption in biomedical research and introduces selection pressures that may confound genetic screens. Our results suggest that the further development of CRISPRa technology should consider both the efficiency of gene activation and activator toxicity.

 Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an ideal chemical feedstock due to its abundance, low cost, low toxicity and its role as a greenhouse gas. Telomerization with butadiene give rise to functional small molecules and polymers with significant CO2 content, but the fossil origin of the olefin offsets sustainability benefits.

Density functional theory calculations reveal reductive elimination as the rate-limiting and selectivity-determining step, preceded by isoprene dimerization.

 Clear elucidation of the connection between chemical structure and biological action mechanisms is the key issue preventing the successful development of nanomedicines.

The weak covalent Se-Se bond breaks down in response to redox stimuli, thus releases organic Se with stronger electron transfer ability to scavenge free radicals, and forms highly active inorganic Se, which further releases free Se atom to trigger selenoprotein synthesis and activation, ultimately reverses reperfusion injury in male-mice ischemic stroke, and improves neurological restoration. This work provides a unique Se atom reprogramming strategy to design highly bioactive hybrid Se species with clear chemical nature and action mechanisms.

 Boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) is a key component of tropical climate variability, characterized by eastward and northeastward propagation of organized convection across the Indo-Pacific region. BSISO influences weather and climate extremes through atmospheric teleconnections, but its future changes and related extremes remain unclear. Here, based on Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, we find that under a high-emission scenario, BSISO convection will shift eastward by ~3° (~300 km) in 2065–2099, driven by moisture profile changes associated with sea surface temperature warming over central-to-eastern Pacific. This eastward-shifted BSISO convection, along with a northward expansion of the westerly jet, strengthens the BSISO teleconnections that extend into broader areas of North America. These changes will increase the BSISO-related heatwave risks by 23% and wildfire risks by 3.5 times over northern North America compared to present-day conditions.

 Market-based instruments, including competitive tenders, are central to funding global environmental restoration and management projects. Recently, tenders have been utilised to fund Nature-based Solutions schemes for Natural Flood Management, with the explicit purpose of achieving co-benefits; flood management and reducing inequities. While multiple studies consider the efficacy of Nature-based Solutions for tackling inequities, no prior research has quantified whether the resource allocation for these projects has been conducted equitably. We analyse two national natural flood management programmes funded through competitive tenders in England to explore who benefits by considering the characteristics of projects, including socio-economic, geographical (e.g. rurality) and flood risk dynamics. Our results suggest that inequity occurs at both the application and funding stages of Nature-based Solutions projects for flood risk management.

Competitive tenders have the potential to undermine the equitable benefits of Nature-based Solutions.

 Biological carbon removal has been proposed as a ‘win-win’ for climate, sustainability and public opinion, but research on public perceptions is lacking explicit evidence on trade-offs between options. Here we explore perceptions using small group deliberation (n60) plus a nationally representative survey (n2027) in the UK’s four jurisdictions. We find a strong preference for carbon removal to play a substantial role in meeting national climate targets, stemming from persistent scepticism about emissions reductions and behaviour change. However, such support was tempered with caution about whether certain biological techniques - biochar, peatland restoration, and perennial biomass crops - would be “worth it”. In particular, concerns were raised about life-cycle emissions, as well as land competition with urgent housing needs, and scientific uncertainty around novel techniques such as biochar. While we find that responses to carbon removal tend to shift the burden of responsibility for climate action away from individuals, we also identify region-specific discourses, highlighting the importance of local context in shaping public views.

 Large Low Shear Velocity Provinces (LLSVPs) near the core-mantle boundary (CMB) are key yet enigmatic structures. Their origin is often linked to the accumulation of subducted mid-ocean ridge basalt (MORB), but computational models question MORB as the sole source due to its predicted high shear wave velocity compared to normal mantle. This uncertainty is compounded by the lack of direct sound velocity measurements at CMB pressures. Here we address this gap through ultrahigh-pressure shear wave velocity measurements on CaCl2- and α-PbO2-type SiO2, major phases in MORB, at pressures exceeding those of the CMB. Our results show shear velocities in dense SiO2 phases are ~ 7–14% lower than previous predictions under these conditions. Incorporating these values into MORB models suggests that the typical seismic anomaly of −1.5% (δlnVS) observed in LLSVPs can be explained by ~ 23–33 vol.% oceanic crust along a cold slab geotherm, without invoking extreme thermal anomalies (+1500 K). Considering a subduction history exceeding 2 billion years, this scenario supports long-term MORB accumulation at the lowermost mantle. These findings provide new constraints on LLSVP composition and offer critical insights into deep mantle dynamics and the evolution of Earth’s interior.

 Plant canopies are integrated units that coordinate their functional (e.g., foliar biochemistry) and structural properties. This coordination affects remote sensing observations of canopy reflectance and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). One key canopy structural property is leaf angle. Despite the fact that radiative transfer models have shown the crucial role of leaf angle in modulating remote sensing signals, methodological and technological barriers have prevented detailed investigations of how leaf angle covaries with canopy function and remote sensing observations. In this study, we employ a novel uncrewed aerial system (UAS) called FluoSpecAir to study the spatial patterns in far-red (FR) SIF (SIFobs,FR), near-infrared reflectance and radiance of vegetation (NIRV and NIRVR), normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), and chlorophyll:carotenoid index (CCI), across individual tree canopies during two separate time periods. Additionally, we collected 3D scans of individual tree canopies using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) and estimated foliar pigment content from leaf reflectance spectra. We used the 3D scans to calculate the leaf angle distribution (LAD) and leaf area voxel density (LAVD) of each canopy. We modeled LAD using a beta distribution, which is parameterized by μ and ν, and the leaf inclination distribution function (LIDF), which is parameterized by LIDFa and LIDFb. We found that ν and μ, which are inversely related to the variance in leaf angle, covaried with spatial patterns in peak growing season canopy CCI, NDVI, SIFobs,FR, and SIFobs,FRNIRVR, and leaf chlorophyll content. Canopies with greater variation in LAD, thus lower ν and μ, have larger values of NDVI, CCI, SIFobs,FR, SIFobs,FRNIRVR, and leaf chlorophyll content, while LAVD is not correlated with these remote sensing metrics. We found positive correlations between leaf chlorophyll content and canopy NDVI, SIFobs,FR, and SIFobs,FRNIRVR, as well. Together, our results show that across our study site during the peak growing season, spatial variability in remote sensing variables is driven by the coordination between LAD and leaf chlorophyll content. These findings provide important context for how we interpret landscape level variability in SIF and SIFobs,FRNIRVR, and how spatial variation in both can be used to infer differences in plant metabolism."

 Monitoring coarse-grained sediment is essential for managing riverbed stability, flood capacity, and ecological resilience in the Yellow River, where high sediment loads originate from the erosion-prone Loess Plateau. Although large-scale ecological restoration has been implemented since the 1980s, its long-term impact on sediment grain-size dynamics remains unclear due to limited field observations. This study developed a dual-layer random forest model that synergizes Landsat satellites reflectance (1986–2022) with multi-scale watershed attributes (hydrological information, vegetation coverage, erosion susceptibility) to remotely quantify particle size distribution (PSD) of suspended sediment. The model achieved high precision (root mean square error: 2.94–4.82 %; mean absolute percentage difference: 13.44–19.87 %), enabling the first basin-wide PSD reconstruction. Key findings reveal: (1) Medium-sized particles (0.01–0.05 mm) dominated the mainstream (63.96 %), while coarse (>0.05 mm, 67.80 %) and fine particles (<0.01 mm, 25.70 %) were concentrated in the Fen and Wei Rivers, respectively; (2) Median grain size decreased by 7.25 % during the 1980s–2020s, reflecting the cumulative effects of ecological restoration, though localized coarsening (1.27, 2.39 and 2.61 %) occurred in the Huangshui, Wei, and Jing Rivers; and (3) Vegetation expansion (8.50–51.23 %) and urbanization (impervious surfaces (12.90–17.04 %)) drove particle fining, while increased wind/water erosion increased the proportion of coarse particle. This study fills a critical gap in monitoring suspended particle size dynamics and provides a scalable framework for evaluating ecological restoration outcomes and informing suspended sediment management in large, sediment-rich watersheds."

 Agricultural droughts, driven by deficits in root-zone soil moisture, pose challenges to food security and economic stability in Africa, which is simultaneously vulnerable to frequent droughts and strongly relies on rainfed agriculture. Current Earth observation (EO)-based monitoring systems rely on a near-real-time assessment of vegetation conditions — often through monitoring the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)- and are thereby allowing for reactive rather than proactive drought management. This study presents a machine learning-based forecasting system to predict below-average NDVI anomalies as a proxy for agricultural drought impact, focusing on recently drought-affected and crises-prone countries. By integrating EO data, meteorological forecasts, soil moisture, and static environmental descriptors, we developed a system that forecasts below-average NDVI anomalies up to three months in advance and explicitly considers ensemble uncertainty. The forecast shows an improved accuracy over using near-real-time NDVI anomalies and similar temporal patterns during the 2021–2022 growing seasons, which was used for independent validation. Our forecasted results are comparable to existing NDVI-based monitoring products such as the Agricultural Stress Index System developed by FAO. Despite these advancements, the modelling system struggles during transitions between rainy and dry seasons, often coinciding with the start and end of the growing season. Uncertainties in meteorological forecasts burden effective estimates of important phenological dates such as emergence or harvest up to three months in advance. This study complements existing soil moisture forecasting tools with impact on vegetation and presents a benchmark for the potential of integrating predictive models into anticipatory strategies in existing drought management frameworks."

 Deadwood and decaying wood are the most important components for the biodiversity of boreal forests, and around a quarter of all flora and fauna in Finnish forests depend on them, with third of these species being red-listed. However, there is a severe lack of stand-level deadwood data in Finland, as the operational inventories either focus on the large-scale estimates or omit deadwood altogether. Unoccupied Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are a cost-effective method for remotely mapping small objects, such as fallen deadwood, over compartment-level areas, as even the most spatially accurate commercial satellites and aerial photography provide 30 cm ground sampling distance, compared to less than 5 cm that is easily achievable with UAVs.In this study, we utilized YOLOv8 by Ultralytics for detecting and segmenting standing and fallen deadwood instances from RGB UAV imagery. Our study consists of two geographically distinct study areas in Finland, Hiidenportti National Park and Evo. We manually annotated around 13 800 deadwood instances to be used as the training and validation data for the instance segmentation models. These annotations were also compared to field-measured deadwood data from Hiidenportti to assess the extent on how much of the deadwood can even be seen from UAV imagery. We also compared how the models perform on another area than from which its training dataset was from, and whether adding data from another areas to the training dataset improves the performance compared to training only with images from one location.The best performing model achieved test set mask mAP50 score of 0.682 for Hiidenportti and 0.651 for Sudenpesänkangas datasets. For both areas, including imagery from the another area improved the instance segmentation metrics, whereas using data only from another site to train the models produced significantly worse results. While methods utilizing UAV imagery cannot completely replace traditional field work, they should still be considered as an additional tool for field campaigns."

 Poverty is a pervasive global issue that adversely affects human well-being. Traditional socioeconomic censuses are time-consuming and resource-intensive, suffering from temporal delays, while reliance on nighttime light data with low spatial resolution is insufficient for fine-scale identification of impoverished regions. Furthermore, the spatial heterogeneity of nighttime light in different urban functional zones has been overlooked. To address these shortcomings, we proposed a novel approach by integrating high-resolution SDGSAT-1 nighttime light data (10 m) with urban functional zoning data using a spatial overlay tool. A random forest model was then applied to predict county-level poverty identification in Guangdong, China. For comparative validation, traditional NPP-VIIRS nighttime light data (500 m) were also incorporated. This method effectively explored the nonlinear relationship between nighttime light, urban functional zones, and the multidimensional poverty index (MPI, serving as the dependent variable). Our experiments demonstrate that the integration of urban functional zoning with nighttime light moderately improves the accuracy of poverty estimates. Among the models tested, the one considering functional zoning-based indicators of “number of light pixels” and “sum of pixel light values” increased the correlation coefficient by 0.0158 compared to the model without considering these indicators. Additionally, comparative analysis revealed that high-resolution data from SDGSAT-1 exhibited a better fit with the MPI when integrated with functional zoning-based indicators. Specifically, the correlation coefficient of this combination was 0.0086 higher than that of traditional NPP-VIIRS data. This highlights that SDGSAT-1 can delineate the boundaries between dark and light regions more precisely, leading to a more accurate reflection of regional poverty levels. Our findings facilitate fine-scale poverty estimation across large regions. This approach can inform policy design, such as dynamic optimization of resource allocation based on poverty estimates, thus enabling timely and accurate poverty alleviation efforts."

 Mangroves play a critical role in maintaining biodiversity, supporting global carbon and nitrogen cycles, and contributing to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Accurate estimation of their nitrogen and phosphorus content is essential for assessing the status of mangrove ecosystems. However, the spectral response characteristics of mangrove leaf nitrogen content (LNC) and leaf phosphorus content (LPC) remain unclear. These knowledge gaps hinder the development of robust predictive models across diverse environmental contexts. To overcome these issues, we collected 375 samples and 16,590 in situ full-spectrum hyperspectral data, and further proposed a novel Global-Fractional Order Sensitivity Analysis (G-FOSA) method. We analyzed for the first time the apparent and deep spectral characteristics of LNC and LPC for four typical mangrove species in China (Avicennia marina, Acanthus ilicifolius, Kandelia candel and Aegiceras corniculatum) using G-FOSA method. This study revealed that the LNC diagnostic wavelengths concentrated in the range of 697 nm–704 nm, while the LPC diagnostic wavelengths were mostly distributed between 691 nm–834 nm and 1869 nm–2236 nm. We developed a mechanism-guided retrieval framework based on these diagnostic wavelengths, and achieved the quantitative inversion from field diagnostic wavelengths to optical satellite (SDGSAT-1 and Sentinel-2) bands. Our experiment results confirmed that SDGSAT-1, the world's first science satellite dedicated to serving the 2030 Agenda for SDGs, performs better in estimating LNC and LPC (R2 = 0.63). Finally, we utilized the advantages of cross-scenario transfer learning technology to design a novel domain adaptive transfer learning (DTL) model, which realized the cross-scenario retrieval of mangrove LNC and LPC across three typical mangrove regions, reducing estimation error (RMSE) by 0.6 %–41.1 % compared to the traditional FTL model.

 Remote detection of plastic litter in both marine and freshwater environments using satellite measurements has become a hot research topic in the past decade, where numerous papers have shown “successful” algorithm development and applications. However, many of these results appear to need some revisits because, in logic, the causality of A to B (i.e., A  => B) does not lead to the inference of B => A unless A is the only reason to cause B. In practice, even though plastics can lead to a certain type of signal anomaly (e.g., spectral, spatial, backscattering) from controlled experiments, the same anomaly detected from the natural environments cannot be used to infer plastics unless other possible reasons can all be ruled out. This is especially true when considering that non-plastic floating matters are much more ubiquitous in the aquatic environments. Unfortunately, this logic has been missing in many, if not most, publications. Here, using spectral reflectances of various types of floating matters and through demonstrations of several examples, I show why such logic is critical in remote detection of plastic litter and why pixel averaging and subtraction are necessary steps to spectrally discriminate the signal anomaly in multi-band optical remote sensing imagery. It is argued that unless other possibilities are ruled out using imaging spectroscopy or other means, it is premature to attribute the detected signal anomaly to plastic litter. After all, not every anomaly pixel is necessarily due to litter, and not every litter pixel is necessarily due to plastics unless proven otherwise."

 Serving as a powerful proxy in remote sensing studies, spectral indices can generate meaningful environmental interpretation from either raw or atmospherically corrected spectral data, and characterise and quantify some important properties of various objects on Earth’s surface. However, while numerous spectral indices have been developed over time, since the very launch of civilian satellites until now, some critical issues in their usage, such as comparability, remain scarcely studied, which may lead to incorrect, inconsistent, and unreliable results.In this study, we collected 471 spectral indices of various environment components (vegetation, water, and soil) that might be leveraged for soil studies, and traced their popularity in scientific publications over the past decades. The bibliometric analysis revealed a growing interest and utilisation of spectral indices as Earth-observing satellite technology advanced.

 This paper shows the first demonstration of spaceborne L-band bistatic InSAR from the Chinese Lutan-1 mission for forest vertical structural information retrieval (in this work, namely, vertical profile, forest height, and underlying topography). With the single-polarization/baseline bistatic InSAR mode of Lutan-1, the measured few-look InSAR phase height histograms compare very well with the GEDI lidar waveforms, both capturing similar characteristics of the forest vertical structural profile. The ground finding approach based on the few-look InSAR phase height histogram is further adapted to incorporate spaceborne lidar measurements from GEDI and ICESat-2/ATLAS for more robust calibration. As for the DTM estimation, two ground finding strategies are developed: one using ample spaceborne lidar samples (with the lidar height as the feature), and the other using limited spaceborne lidar samples (with the few-look InSAR phase height standard deviation as the feature), both of which rely on the statistical model relating the underlying terrain elevation to the statistics of the few-look InSAR histogram. Then, forest height is inverted using the few-look histogram that mimics using lidar waveform to derive height metrics. The large-scale DTM and forest height mosaics of 2.74 million hectares are produced over tropical rainforest of the entire Hainan island of China. Through validation with airborne lidar data, the forest height is estimated to an accuracy of ∼5 m for tropical forest up to 45 m tall (relative error 10–15 %). The InSAR-derived DTM has a negligible bias (mean value of the radar-lidar DTM deviation) as referenced to airborne lidar DTM, with the uncertainties (median absolute deviation or MAD) being dependent on topographic surface slopes: 3 m (<2°), 4 m (2°-6°), 7 m (6°-25°), and 9 m (>25°). This approach sheds light on combining ascending/descending viewing geometries of spaceborne L-band bistatic InSAR data with single polarization/baseline (e.g. Lutan-1 and its follow-on) for large-scale wall-to-wall mapping of forest vertical structural profile, height metrics/biomass, underlying topography, as well as the changes of these forest parameters."

 Accurate river water level estimation is essential for effective flood monitoring and water resources management. However, traditional techniques and single satellite observations have low accuracy and resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance river water level estimation by fusing Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery based on advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. SAR provides high-resolution, all-weather surface imagery, while the GNSS-Reflectometry from the eight-satellite CYGNSS mission offers frequent and wide-coverage observations. Dynamic river water levels are obtained at a daily temporal resolution by extracting changes in Sentinel-1 backscattering coefficients and integrating them with the CYGNSS data's high temporal resolution feature. To guarantee the model's robustness, a ten-fold cross-validation (CV) procedure is used with incorporating 15 uniformly distributed gauge sites. Experimental results show that the data fusion method significantly improved the temporal resolution, and more importantly the precision of water level estimation. As opposed to the model without data fusion, the optimized fusion algorithm achieved a 50.74 % reduction in RMSE from 0.341 to 0.168 m, while the R was improved from 0.876 to 0.936. An improvement of over 35 % in RMSE was observed at 8 out of 15 stations. To further validate the model's generalizability, we tested it using data from 8 spatially and temporally independent hydrological stations. The fusion method reduced the RMSE from 0.479 to 0.202 m and increased the R from 0.848 to 0.927, further confirming its effectiveness in enhancing water level estimation.

 Permafrost degradation has been recognized for decades due to climate warming, wildfire, and infrastructure development. However, a large-scale characterization of permafrost thaw status has not been attempted before due to difficulties in ground data collection, inherent complications and heterogeneity of thaw in ecosystem-protected permafrost, and constraints of remote sensor observations and process-based modeling techniques. Here we made a first effort to map the status of permafrost thaw across a large ice-rich lowland fire-influenced landscape (2500 km2) in interior Alaska by developing a new protocol and combining decades of field measurements, repeat airborne lidar, spaceborne WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, Landsat time series products, and a terrain elevation dataset. The repeat lidar and fine-resolution imagery offered a key to solving the bottleneck issue of thaw reference data collection, which further provided an opportunity to track post-fire thaw caused by six large fires in the past 25 years in four stages over time: old thaw, lateral thaw, vertical shallow thaw and vertical deep thaw. The developed protocol achieved an overall accuracy of 79 % in classifying these thaw stages and generated a reasonable thaw pattern mainly controlled by fires and locally modified by other drivers. Identifying degradation patterns can help understand the permafrost-fire-climate system. The protocol is a valuable alternative to current thermokarst mapping techniques."

 The future of InSAR applications will undoubtedly involve data-driven solutions to predict deformation across space and time. Recent advancements in subsidence research have already integrated such approaches, primarily in flat to near-flat landscapes. However, in mountainous terrains, space-time InSAR modelling has so far focused mainly on individual slopes or small catchments. Here, we propose a modelling protocol based on a deep learning architecture capable of predicting InSAR-derived hillslope deformation. This approach is developed primarily using morphometric and meteorological variables over extensive mountainous areas (∼15,000 km2) and extended time windows (∼7 years). By aggregating the deformation signal at the Slope Unit scale while maintaining 12-day temporal intervals consistent with Sentinel-1 acquisitions, we achieve high modelling performance (PCC = 0.7). If validated in other regions, this method could represent a crucial step towards a large-scale, consistent, and highly effective scenario-based warning system for hillslope deformation."

 The remote-sensing reflectance (Rrs) varies with the illumination and viewing geometry, an effect referred to as anisotropy, bidirectionality, or bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF). In the aquatic environment, bidirectionality arises from the anisotropic downwelling illumination, scattered by water and particles in varying proportions as a function of the scattering angle, and modulated by the two-way interaction with the sea surface. For remote sensing applications, it is desirable that the reflectance only depends on the inherent optical properties (IOPs). This process implies transforming Rrs into a “corrected” or “normalized” Rrs,N, referred to the sun at the zenith and the sensor zenith angle at the nadir. A recent review study (D'Alimonte et al., 2025) compared published BRDF methods, showing the better performance of that developed by Lee et al. (2011, henceforth L11) with respect to those proposed by Morel et al. (2002) and Park and Ruddick (2005). This article presents a new method starting from L11's analytical framework, named O25 after OLCI, the Ocean Colour sensor on Sentinel-3 satellite. O25 has been calibrated with a recently published synthetic dataset tailored to its needs (Pitarch and Brando, 2025). A comparative assessment using the same datasets as in D'Alimonte et al. (2025) concludes that O25 outperforms L11 and hence all pre-existing methods. O25 includes complementary operational features: (1) applicability range, (2) uncertainty estimates, and (3) a demonstrated reversibility of the bidirectional correction. O25's look-up tables are generic to any in situ and satellite sensors, including hyperspectral ones. For sensors such as Landsat/Sentinel 2, the IOPs retrieval component of O25 can easily be reformulated."

 Surface soil moisture (SSM) is a critical state variable for water cycle research, and the advances in satellite remote sensing technology have provided a novel means for acquiring large-scale SSM data. While satellite microwave remote sensing-based SSM retrieval has emerged as the dominant approach for global SSM product development, offering numerous advantages, it still faces significant challenges. These include the trade-off between model accuracy and generalizability, the limitations of applying uniform retrieval models across diverse environments, and the inherent complexity and computational demands of the retrieval process. To address these common issues in microwave remote sensing-based SSM retrieval studies, this study proposed a cloud-based intelligent retrieval framework for global high-accuracy SSM estimation. This framework integrated physical mechanisms with machine learning models to ensure robust generalization and high retrieval accuracy; additionally, a model selection module was incorporated to enhance the overall retrieval accuracy by providing environment-specific retrieval models. In an assessment based on global validation sites for 1-km resolution SSM retrieval, the proposed framework performed well, with an R value of 0.851 and an ubRMSE of 0.058 m3·m−3. Furthermore, to mitigate the computational resource demands and time-consuming of the retrieval process, the SSM retrieval framework was implemented in a cloud environment utilizing Google Earth Engine, Drive, and Colab, thereby enabling seamless online operation of the entire retrieval process. This cloud-based intelligent retrieval framework facilitates real-time point-scale SSM retrieval on a global scale and rapid production of high-accuracy SSM products at the regional scale (SSM products for China at 1 km resolution can be accessed via https://tinyurl.com/SSMproduct). The SSM retrieval framework can significantly contribute to agricultural, environmental, and other related fields, and serve as a reference for the retrieval of other environmental variables."

 Long-term river discharge time series are essential for assessing water availability, seasonal variability, and the impacts of climate change. However, in-situ data do not ensure continuity and large-scale availability, as they are constrained by the limitations of monitoring networks, which are affected by high maintenance costs, geopolitical factors, and the remoteness of many river basins. Satellite remote sensing offers a valuable alternative, with multispectral data providing information on river discharge dynamics. Nevertheless, also satellite data suffer discontinuity, being periodically decommissioned and substituted by sensors with different characteristics.This study applies and refines the Calibration-Measurement (CM) approach across 54 river sites worldwide, using 10 different multispectral satellite products from 8 satellite sensors to examine long time series of data. The methodology optimizes the selection of reflectance indices based on local hydrological conditions, evaluating the best procedure to obtain river discharge proxies according to the specific flow regimes and climatic condition. Multi-mission data are then combined to improve temporal coverage and accuracy, obtaining long-term timeseries of river discharge proxies. A new uncalibrated procedure is also introduced to extract river discharge information in sites with decommissioned stations or to obtain the CM proxies in ungauged basins.Results demonstrate that integrating multiple satellite sources substantially improves river discharge estimation, due to factor such as the superior performance of high-resolution sensors (e.g., Sentinel-2) over coarse-resolution datasets (e.g. MODIS) in narrow rivers, and the complementary value of MODIS finer temporal resolution. The proposed merging approach enhances data consistency and reduces gaps while maintaining good performance values, while the uncalibrated method proves effective in many cases but remains challenging for frozen rivers, cloud-prone regions and areas with a low ratio between river width and satellite sensor spatial resolution. Specifically, after the application of a Cumulative Distribution Function Merging (CDF) matching to obtain river discharge estimates from CM proxies, the average and maximum value of Spearman's correlation for the calibrated approaches are respectively 0.78 and 0.92 whereas for uncalibrated approach are 0.55 and 0.89; in terms of Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) the average and maximum value are 0.41 and 0.85 for calibrated approach and 0.29 and 0.8 for the uncalibrated one.These findings highlight the potential of multi-sensor approaches for global river discharge monitoring and lay the groundwork for future operational applications."

 Due to its ability to provide day-and-night profiling and high depth resolution, ocean lidar has become an important tool for marine remote sensing. However, a lidar system provides time-based measurements of backscattered photons, where the distance (or depth for vertical profiling) is a product of light speed in water and the time photons pass. When there are significant contributions of multiple scattering in the backscattered signals of ocean lidar, the perceived depth of these measured photons will be deeper than the real depth. Therefore, if the objective of a lidar system is to sense the vertical profile of particles, the present time-based depth profile will not match the real depth profile of particles in the water column. To address this discrepancy, we carried out semi-analytical Monte Carlo simulations for a wide range of water properties (represented by scattering coefficient, b), focusing on Case-1 water, with platforms including spaceborne, airborne, shipborne, and underwater. In the simulation process, it is assumed that the water column is vertically homogeneous, and the influence of sea surface fluctuations is ignored. Based on the simulated data, relationships between the discrepancy and b, as well as the radius of the received footprint on the water surface (rs), are established. Sensitivity analysis indicates that the discrepancy is more sensitive to b than to rs. Further, the impact of the absorption coefficient, scattering phase function, rough sea surface, and vertically non-uniform inherent optical properties on this discrepancy is discussed. Our results not only highlight the significance of considering multiple scattering, particularly for airborne and spaceborne platforms, in sensing the vertical profiles of particles but also provide guidance for interpreting backscattered signals in ocean lidar applications."

 Mangroves, as cradles of biodiversity and blue carbon reservoirs, are facing survival challenges due to climate change and anthropogenic disturbance. Precise and rapid mapping of mangrove forests has thus become highly relevant, which can provide essential information to support the conservation practices of such blue carbon resources. Existing machine learning algorithms for mangrove mapping are incapable of delivering precise cartographic solutions under dynamic tidal conditions because of poor transferability. This study developed a generalized approach for large-area mangrove mapping using a hybrid neural network integrated with a vision transformer to effectively capture representative features. To adapt mangrove mapping to the variety of tidal conditions, a vision transformer architecture was developed by encoding the fusion of three Sentinel-2 bands: Green, NIR, and SWIR. The ground truth dataset for the year 2021 was created from the composited Sentinel-2 images after interpreting Google Earth and drone images, which comprised 88,645 training samples (256 × 256 pixels per sample) and 24,969 test samples. We selected 30 coastal counties as test dataset in China to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed network and produced a 10 m mangrove map that reported a total mangrove area of 28,006.24 ha in China in 2021, yielding an overall accuracy (OA) of 95.91 %.

Despite fluctuations in tide levels captured by Sentinel-2 imagery, the proposed method consistently yielded robust mangrove mapping results, highlighting effective derivation of tidal information. In comparison with previous mapping methods, the superior efficacy of the proposed network is distinctly discernible in distinguishing and delineating mangrove ecosystems in mixed tide regions, presenting prospects for improved monitoring of mangroves at regional and global scales."

 While numerous studies have evaluated precipitation products by comparing them with in-situ observations, the suitability of these products for closing the water balance budget in Africa remains largely unexplored. This study assesses the performance of eight latest precipitation products, namely MSWEP v2.8, CRU v4.07, CHIRPS v2.0, ERA5-Land, CPC, NOAH, IMERG v7, and MSWX v1, in closing the water balance budget over Africa. We begin by assessing the general consistency among these precipitation products using rain-gauge measurements and multiple linear regression analysis, followed by the generalized three-corner-hat (GTCH) method applied to estimate the relative uncertainties and signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios of the eight precipitation products, which help identify the potential causes of the water balance non-closure over Africa. To evaluate the suitability for closing the water balance budget, we compare the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) and its follow-on (GRACE-FO, hereafter GRACE) satellite missions’ derived total water storage changes (TWSC) with those of the water balance equation using each precipitation product. The influence of climate zones and terrain on these evaluations is also examined. The results reveal significant discrepancies in precipitation trends among the eight precipitation products. The GTCH analysis indicates that MSWEP achieves the lowest uncertainties and highest SNR values in most cases, followed by MSWX and CHIPRS. Regarding closing the water balance budget, NOAH exhibits the highest consistency with GRACE-derived TWSC than other products, followed by IMERG, whereas CPC achieved the lowest suitability. The performance of these products appears to be more influenced by climatic regimes than by terrain. All precipitation products indicate approximately 20% non-closure in the water balance budget over Africa, likely due to the underestimation of annual signals, as revealed by the principal component analysis (PCA). This study underscores that utilizing precipitation derived from the same data source as runoff and evapotranspiration demonstrates high consistency with GRACE-derived TWSC data. These findings suggest that precipitation estimates should merge multi-source datasets and consider the water balance budget, which can help reduce uncertainties and provide a more reliable foundation for hydrological studies in Africa."

 This study evaluates the efficacy and cost-effectiveness of different Earth Observation (EO) products for assessing olive trees’ health in a 6.2 ha orchard. We developed a digital crop mapping approach using high-resolution multispectral imagery from three sources: unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) at 2 cm spatial resolution, Mohammed VI satellite at 50 cm, and Sentinel-2 satellite at 10 m. Leaf chlorophyll content, measured for 75 trees using a SPAD meter, served as the dependent variable for predictive modeling and a proxy of trees’ health. Furthermore, three machine learning algorithms, Random Forest (RF), Cubist, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were employed to predict chlorophyll content. The RF model showed superior performance across all datasets, achieving the lowest RMSE values. While UAV data provided the highest spatial detail, capturing fine-scale health variations, it came at a significantly higher cost. The commercial Mohammed VI satellite data offered a balance between detail and coverage, potentially cost-effective for areas approaching its 100 km2 minimum purchase requirement. However, the free Sentinel-2 data showed competitive performance, particularly with the RF model (RMSE: 7.773, RPIQ: 1.251), suggesting its viability for large-scale monitoring. Spatial chlorophyll maps revealed distinct capabilities of each EO product in capturing orchard variability. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between EO product costs, resolutions, and predictive accuracy, providing crucial insights for selecting appropriate remote sensing approaches based on specific monitoring requirements and budget constraints. This research underscores the potential of integrating diverse EO products with advanced ML techniques for cost-effective and scalable olive tree health assessment, with implications for precision agriculture and sustainable orchard management.

 In most West African countries, water authorities face real challenges in monitoring and managing lakes. These challenges include the limitation of resources for continuous field-based data collection for the assessment of both the ecological status and the implementation of regulations measures on these water bodies. In such a context, remote sensing-based monitoring could provide a sustainable solution. The current study used EO data Sentinel-1 SAR to develop a classification approach for detection a traditional fish method using dry branches (called acadja), and water hyacinth (which mainly occurs in acadja) in Lake Nokoué (Benin). The employed method analyses the distribution of VV and VH polarisation values to determine the boundary (threshold interval) between acadjas and water hyacinth objects on one hand, and open water on the other. This analysis, referred to as a ’quartile-based threshold analysis’, was conducted from 2019 to 2023, taking seasonal variations into account. The study results show that VH polarisation is a more stable method for detecting acadjas and water hyacinths. The overall accuracy of object detection is 87%, with a confusion rate of less than 5% throughout the study period.

This study evaluates the potential of fused Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8/9 data, generated with the Sen2Like processor, for retrieving key phenological metrics at field-scale in a multi-cropping agricultural system of the Nile Delta. Forty-two fields were analysed over six years, focusing on wheat, maize, rice and clover in El Gharbia Governorate. Phenological metrics were derived using the Decomposition and Analysis of Time-Series Software (DATimeS) and were evaluated based on a reference crop calendar. Results showed that 91% of crop seasons were detected using the Sen2Like fused product compared to 88% using Sentinel-2 alone. For both datasets, the Start of Season (SOS) for summer crops presented a root mean squared error (RMSE) of about 35 days from the calendar date, while the SOS for winter crops had an RMSE of about 14 days. Due to its daily temporal coverage, PlanetScope data was used for additional evaluation. Metrics extracted with Sen2Like and PlanetScope presented a good agreement, with an RMSE of 1 day for metrics occurring during spring months and an RMSE of 6 days for winter metrics. Moreover, mapping key phenological stages provided insights into the crops’ spatial and temporal distribution across the study area. This study demonstrates the value of Sen2Like in capturing field-scale phenology with implications for improving agricultural practices and farm sustainability."

 The radiometric temperature of the plants is known to be a good indicator of their level of water stress. The use of thermal cameras on board UAVs allows operational monitoring of the canopy temperature in orchard plantations at the single-tree level. The radiometric processing of the flight data becomes critical in this task to maintain the accuracy provided by field measurements using proximal thermal radiometers. This work focuses on evaluating the Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI) as a good indicator of the plant water status in almond orchards. This study compares the performance of CWSI by three different techniques: i) using proximal high-precision thermal radiometry (CWSI_CIMEL); ii) by UAV thermal flights for canopy temperature assessment (CWSI_UAV) and iii) combining multispectral and thermal data, also by UAV, to run a simplified two-source surface energy balance for the traditional formulation of the CWSI in terms of canopy transpiration (CWSI_STSEB).This study was conducted on two commercials almonds (Prunus dulcis (Mill.) D.A. Webb) orchards located in Albacete (SE Spain), one of them with 3 irrigation treatments (well-watered, moderate water stress, and severe water stress). Periodic measurements of stem water potential (SWP) were carried out around noon throughout 3 experimental campaigns from 2019 to 2021. Canopy temperature measurements were made with a high-precision thermal radiometer, the CIMEL CE312-C2. In addition, six flights were carried out using a DJI-M600 drone equipped with a FLIR Tau2 thermal sensor and a Micasense RedEdge camera. Maps of the CWSI were performed during these dates, showing temporal and spatial variability. The three different techniques showed similar CWSI trends across dates and treatments. When treatments were pooled within the same date, the assessment with SWP measurements showed correlations (R2) of 0.86, 0.68, and 0.70 for CWSI_CIMEL, CWSI_UAV, and CWSI_STSEB, respectively. These results reinforce the potential of accurate measurements of radiometric canopy temperatures using both proximal and remote sensing techniques to reproduce the crop water status in almond orchards. However, this study points to the necessity for accurate sensor calibrations and an appropriate methodology for the treatment of both canopy temperature and meteorological data. Monitoring CWSI serves as an operational tool for the early detection of water deficits in almond trees and meets farmerś needs to improve water use efficiency and optimize irrigation scheduling at the plot level."

 Northeast China is one of China’s most important rice production bases, contributing about one-fifth of the country’s rice production. In recent years, several agricultural policies have been implemented in Northeast China to adjust crop structures, driven by economic and ecological benefits. Timely monitoring of the changed pattern of rice cultivation is a prerequisite for policy assessment. Current paddy rice mapping methods are experiencing uncertainties due to confusion with wetlands and are highly parameter-dependent. To these, in this study, we developed a paddy rice mapping framework that integrates automatically generated training samples, time series features from key cultivation stages, and a deep learning model to improve paddy rice identification accuracy in Northeast China, which is a typical rice-wetland coexisting area. We produced 10 m paddy rice maps for 2019–2023 in Northeast China and examined their changes under agricultural policy implementation. The resultant paddy rice maps have high accuracies, with overall accuracies >0.97, producer’s accuracies >0.94, user’s accuracies ≥0.93, and F1 scores of ≥0.95, respectively. Our proposed mapping method effectively identified small patches of paddy rice and reduced confusion with wetlands. Paddy rice areas in Northeast China estimated in this study continued to decrease annually from 71.1 × 103 km2 in 2019 to 56.4 × 103 km2 in 2023. Hot spots of rice conversion to other crops were found in the Sanjiang Plain, mainly due to the Soybean Revitalization Plan.

 Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), a perennial legume forage crop, is valued for its high yield and quality. However, its survival during winter can be affected by several factors, and its mortality significantly impacts alfalfa production, necessitating timely and spatially detailed monitoring. This study aims to propose a framework for estimating alfalfa stem density using satellite imagery and machine learning (ML) algorithms, which can lead to winter mortality detection early in the spring and provide a better understanding of potential total dry matter. Three ML models—support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), and extreme gradient boosting (XGB)—were applied to Harmonized Landsat Sentinel (Landsat only, which is HLSL30) and Sentinel-2 datasets, accessed via the Google Earth Engine (GEE) Python API. Two scenarios were evaluated: 1) single-date data, capturing satellite images within a 3-day time window to the date of field sample measurement, and 2) time-series data, in which three satellite images were collected for the measurements during the first growing cycle. Both classification and regression models were used in both scenarios to estimate and classify alfalfa stem density. ML Classification models categorized stem density into four groups (bare, low-density, medium-density, and high-density), achieving an accuracy of up to 85 % using Sentinel-2 data and 84 % using HLSL30 data. The results also indicated that alfalfa stem density can be estimated with an error of ∼ ±6-9 stems/foot2 (1 foot = 30.48 cm) using ML regression models. RF outperformed XGB and SVM in classification and regression tasks, showing superior accuracy in classifying density and lower root mean square error (RMSE) in estimating stem density.

Existing methods align visual and textual features through cross-modal fusion but often fail to capture object dependencies, hindering complex visual reasoning about relationships and contexts. To address this, we introduce the Luojia-VG dataset, a benchmark enhancing visual reasoning with scene knowledge, including object-level annotations and contextual descriptions of relationships, functions, and activities.

 Multi-view reconstruction of real-world scenes has been an important and challenging task. Although methods based on Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have made significant progress in rendering quality, there are still some limitations regarding the fidelity of geometric structures. To address this challenge, we propose a novel 3D reconstruction approach within the 3DGS framework, integrating lidar point clouds and multi-view images, named LiDGS, which achieves high-fidelity 3D scene reconstruction by introducing high-precision geometric a priori information and multiple geometric constraints from lidar point clouds, while guaranteeing efficient and accurate scene rendering. Specifically, we adopt an adaptive checkerboard sampling strategy and multi-hypothesis joint view selection (ACMP) for whole-image depth propagation, generating a high −precision dense depth map that provides continuous and accurate depth prior constraints for Gaussian optimization. Then, we design an adaptive Gaussian densification strategy, which effectively guides the geometric structure of the 3D scene through geometric anchors and adaptively adjusts the number and volume of Gaussians to more finely characterize the geometry of the object surface. Finally, this paper introduces a depth regularization method to correct the depth estimation of each Gaussian, ensuring the consistency of depth information from different viewpoints, which, in turn, improves the reconstruction quality. The experimental results show that the method achieves superior performance in both the new view synthesis task and the 3D reconstruction task, outperforming other classical methods.

 Co-occurrence can improve the perception and prediction of traffic entities by predicting another traffic entity in automated driving based on a known entity. Existing traffic entity co-occurrence relationship construction methods use a bottom-up approach that relies on labeled datasets. However, the limited nature of datasets constrains the capture of long-tail scenarios. High-definition (HD) maps define the concept of traffic elements and their classifications, and can be used for scene simulation and real-time updating of digital twins. Based on this, this paper proposes a knowledge graph construction method for traffic entity prediction, employing a top-down approach and introducing HD maps. This method establishes a co-occurring semantic network between entities, utilizing prior knowledge. The objective is to reconcile the finiteness of datasets with the infinity of long-tailed scenarios, thereby providing a theoretical basis for the safety calibration of autonomous driving. The experimental results show that the knowledge graph constructed by the top-down method has a complete ontology type in the schema and takes into account the co-occurrence relations of the long-tailed scenarios, which provides a basis for the standardization of the co-occurrence relationships of the long-tailed scenarios, and also provides semantic support for the dynamic simulation of the digital twins in traffic scenes."

 Vegetation leaf area index (LAI) data with continuous spatio-temporal coverage are crucial for monitoring vegetation growth, predicting crop yields, and studying global environmental changes. However, due to limitations of recent satellite observations and retrieval algorithms, the prevailing operational LAI product is of low spatial resolution, which is insufficient to support fine-scale detection of land surface vegetation changes. To overcome these challenges, a novel data assimilation approach, the ENKF-NDVI (Ensemble Kalman Filter-NDVI) model, was developed to estimate LAI data with 10-m spatial and 5-day temporal resolution. Time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with 30-m spatial and 5-day temporal resolution were used instead of 500-m resolution LAI data to depict vegetation change trends and solve the patch effects caused by the scale differences.

 Sufficient abundance and variety of field site sampling are crucial for obtaining an accurate reach-scale river classification of a regional stream network in support of scientific research and river management. However, many studies still randomly select field sites or only visit accessible streams. This leads to an inadequate exploration of stream characteristics, resulting in incomplete or inaccurate classification. Machine learning has been recognized for discovering and extracting streams’ geomorphic patterns efficiently and accurately from data, but its application in field site sampling design is still in its infancy. This study developed a general and practical field site selection framework by incorporating machine learning in a human-in-the-loop manner. This framework includes three steps: (1) initial field site selection via machine learning from prior datasets, (2) selected field site accessibility evaluation and observation, and (3) additional field site decision and selection via an iterative learning process. In an example application to the San Francisco Bay Area (California, USA), our framework extracted representative geomorphic characteristics of (i) previous known stream types from prior labeled and geospatial datasets and (ii) previously unrecognized stream types based on uncertainty information obtained by machine learning. Moreover, we propose methods for replacing inaccessible sites to ensure sufficient information is retained in the selected field sites. Results revealed clear differences in variable distributions between the 148 high‐certainty sites and the 51 high‐uncertainty sites, a pattern that was validated by our field surveys. Furthermore, the 41 newly identified high‐uncertainty sites were found under-represented in the initial surveyed sites and thus their selection for the next round of field surveys will help fill the important feature gaps left by the initial survey.

 Forest ecosystems underpin global ecological security, yet China’s forest landscapes are subjected to dual pressures of restoration and degradation, with complex spatiotemporal dynamics that remain insufficiently understood. While existing studies focus on static landscape metrics, the nonlinear interactions between natural and anthropogenic drivers of forest fragmentation and connectivity remain elusive. This study addresses this gap by introducing the Ecological Land Evolution Index (ELEI) to quantify patch-scale forest dynamics, integrating multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) with XGBoost-SHAP analysis to dissect driving mechanisms across China from 2000 to 2020. Key findings reveal distinct spatial patterns: Ecological Land Restoration (ELR) processes with high connectivity potential concentrated in northeastern China, the Qinba Mountains, and southwestern regions. “Connection-type” patches (comprising 48 % of ELR area) dominated low-elevation plains (e.g., Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau), while “infilling-type” restoration prevailed in hilly/mountainous areas, driven by shrubland-to-forest conversions. Ecological Land Degradation (ELD) driven by cropland expansion caused severe fragmentation in the Sichuan Basin and Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau.”Enclosing-type” ELD dominated high-relief mountains, while “fragmentation-type” patches thrived in lowlands under agricultural/urban pressures. MGWR analysis identified slope, elevation, and the Grain for Green Program as key positive drivers of ELR connectivity, while urbanization and agricultural expansion emerged as dominant ELD fragmentation forces with pronounced spatial heterogeneity. XGBoost-SHAP further revealed nonlinear interactions: road density (>0.5 km/km2) exacerbating fragmentation in depopulating peri-urban zones, and climate-topography thresholds shaping restoration efficacy (e.g., precipitation > 1,300 mm).

 The Leaf Area Index (LAI) is an essential parameter for assessing vegetation growth. LAI derived from optical data can suffer from gaps caused by cloud cover. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) presents a solution with its all-weather observation capability. To address these issues, this study proposes a new deep learning approach for reconstructing time series LAI using SAR and optical data in two steps. Firstly, the two-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network-Transformer (2D CNN-Transformer) is applied to bridge SAR and optical data. Secondly, the 2D CNN-Transformer predicted LAI and the Sentinel-2 LAI are input into the Enhanced Deep Convolutional Model for Spatiotemporal Image Fusion (EDCSTFN) model to further improve the accuracy. The novelty lies in a two-step framework combining a 2D CNN-Transformer for spatiotemporal feature extraction and a deep learning fusion algorithm refining accurate LAI reconstruction. Results showed that the 2D CNN-Transformer achieved a higher accuracy (R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.38 m2/m2) in establishing a relationship between SAR and optical data, compared to 1D CNN, 2D CNN-LSTM, and 1D CNN-Transformer. In the second step, the EDCSTFN reconstructed LAI achieved the highest accuracy of an R2 of 0.81 and an RMSE of 0.22 m2/m2, with an average R2 of 0.61 and RMSE of 0.37 m2/m2 across croplands and forests in millions of pixels, further improving the accuracy based on the first step. The approach effectively fills gaps in spatial details and achieves a more continuous spatial distribution. The proposed approach demonstrates good generalizability in millions of pixels under frequent cloud cover and complex surface conditions and provides a new strategy for the fusion of optical and SAR data."

 In the context of global urbanization, urban expansion significantly affects urban thermal environment. As a key indicator of urbanization, impervious surfaces are widely used to monitor urban growth. However, most existing studies examining thermal environments through impervious surfaces are limited to pixel-scale. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of urban land cover, pixel-scale analyses often fail to accurately capture the thermal effects of impervious surfaces. To address this issue, we propose a universal impervious surface percentage (UISP) model based on Landsat imagery for subpixel-scale impervious surfaces monitoring. We evaluated the relationship between impervious surface percentage (ISP) and surface urban heat islands (SUHI) in four representative Chinese cities—Beijing, Kunming, Shenzhen, and Wuhan—from 2018 to 2023. Results indicate that UISP significantly improves the accuracy of impervious surface estimation over heterogeneous urban landscapes. The deviations of estimated ISP are as much as 0.2 lower than pixel-scale results. In SUHI areas, ISP values exceeded 0.4 to 0.6 higher than in non-SUHI regions. The ISP difference between SUHI levels 1 and 2 was 0.12, and between levels 5 and 6, it was 0.08, suggesting ISP saturation in high SUHI zones. This study introduced UISP for subpixel extraction of impervious surfaces and thermal environment analysis, offering a novel approach for precise quantification of urbanization and insights into thermal environment research."

 Continuous winter cover on croplands reduces soil erosion and enhances soil organic carbon, making it essential for climate-smart agriculture and greenhouse gas mitigation. However, spatially and temporally explicit data on winter cropland cover remain limited across Europe. We present a national-scale assessment of winter cropland cover in Germany from 2017 to 2023 using spectral unmixing-derived fractional cover time series from Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery. Four winter cover types were distinguished: winter crops, green cover (including cover crops and spontaneous vegetation), residue cover, and no cover (bare soil). Phenological metrics were derived for green cover to assess vegetation duration, biomass accumulation, and termination type.Our results reveal an increasing share of green cover, rising from 17 % in 2017/18 to 21 % in 2022/23, and a decline in bare soil from 20 % to 12 %, indicating a shift toward more protective winter management. Green cover was most frequent in northwestern and southern Germany, while bare soil remained prevalent in central and eastern regions. Classification results showed good agreement with Integrated Administration and Control System (IACS) parcel-level records of winter cover crops (F1-Score = 0.68) and agricultural census data at the federal state level (R2 = 0.82, MAE = 5 percentage points). Remote sensing estimates consistently exceeded reported cover crop shares, reflecting the presence of non-subsidized or spontaneous vegetation.

 Rock glaciers are debris landforms formed by long-term creep of ice-rich permafrost. Their kinematics provide critical insights for climate change and permafrost studies, mountain hydrology, and hazard assessment. Previous studies have measured rock glacier velocities using field-based terrestrial geodetic surveys, repeat photogrammetry, and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). However, these methods have typically been confined to local regions, leaving the large-scale velocity characteristics underexplored. In this study, we developed a multi-temporal and multi-geometry InSAR framework for systematically generating rock glacier velocity fields. We rigorously validated our approach by comparing the InSAR-derived velocities with those derived from very-high-resolution optical imagery (Pléiades satellite imagery and aerial imagery) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements. The mean relative difference is approximately 20 % when compared to velocities from Pléiades and aerial images, increasing to 50 % for GNSS point measurements. Applying our method, we produced the first large-scale regional rock glacier velocity dataset, encompassing downslope velocity fields for 19,727 previously inventoried rock glaciers in the Tibet-Pamir-Karakoram region. We found a velocity contrast between different climatic domains: rock glaciers in the westerlies domain move on average faster (median = 30 cm/yr) than those in the monsoon domain (median = 13 cm/yr). Our study presents a methodological framework for assessing rock glacier velocities using InSAR and demonstrates its capability for large-scale applications. This approach can be readily adapted to other regions worldwide to support the assessment and monitoring of rock glacier dynamics in a changing climate."

 Delineating clear scene boundaries in remote sensing images remains a challenge despite their ability to visually present landscapes. This study introduces a novel Scene Boundary Visual Perception (SBVP) method designed to identify scene boundaries in remote sensing images that conform to human visual perception. SBVP first computes the image’s average state as a fundamental unit for perception, guiding upscaling segmentation for initial scene targets and superpixel segmentation for object-level refinement. The hypothesis that the average state of the image scene can effectively guide upscaling segmentation and superpixel segmentation was tested on 16 large-scale remote sensing images with varying spatial resolutions and land cover types. SBVP was compared against eCognition and the Segment Anything Model (SAM) and further applied to suspicious target detection and the delineation of arid-humid and global biogeographical boundaries. Experimental results validate the hypothesis, showing that SBVP outperforms eCognition and SAM, achieving a mean IoU of 0.90, representing a 20 % and 23 % improvement over eCognition and SAM, respectively (P < 0.01). Additionally, SBVP effectively detects suspicious targets and enhances the delineation of arid-humid and global biogeographical boundaries.

 Alpine zones, located above the treeline in high mountain areas, are highly sensitive to global warming. Topography modulates land surface energy, mass and momentum fluxes and thus can largely influence vegetation growth under a warming climate. However, little is known about the topographical effects on vegetation changes during recent decades, especially in alpine vegetation at the global scale. Here we utilize 30 m spatial resolution Landsat imagery to quantify trends in vegetation greenness and vegetated areas during 1984–2023 in global alpine ecosystems and quantify the effects of topography on vegetation changes. Our results reveal that more than 99 % of the global alpine zones show concurrent significant (p < 0.05) vegetation greening and increasing vegetated areas. Yet, the effects of topography on the two vegetation metrics diverge in 85.49 % of the regions where the magnitude of the rate of vegetation greening decreases with higher elevation whereas the expansion rate of vegetated areas is faster with higher elevations. Moreover, vegetation dynamics also covary with the slope aspect, with polar-facing slopes experiencing higher trend magnitude in vegetation greenness (72.59 %) and vegetated areas (64.50 %) compared to the equatorial-facing slopes.

 Landsat series data (Landsat-5 Thematic Mapper (TM), Landsat-7 Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+), Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), and Landsat-9 OLI2) hold significant potential for detecting temporal changes of underwater terrain in optically shallow waters resulting from earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, waves, and human activities due to their extensive time series (nearly 40 years) and medium-spatial-resolution (30 m). However, different Landsat series images have different band sets and signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) which may impact the consistency of the bathymetry inversion results of optimization-based bathymetry inversion models. Therefore, this study initially quantitatively evaluated the consistency of Landsat series data-derived bathymetry data over the South China Sea, which has a notable distribution of coral islands. The results of 12 images indicated that the root mean square error values of the estimated water depth are generally less than 4 m at Qilian Yu and less than 2 m at Dongsha Dao at depths shallower than 10 m. At depths greater than 10 m, OLI/OLI2 obtained higher accuracy in water depth inversion than did TM/ETM+. The inter-comparison results and temporal results of different geomorphic zones indicated that the Landsat series-derived water depth values in the reef flat and shallow lagoon, where water depth is shallower than 10 m, exhibit high consistency. However, because TM and ETM+ have lower SNRs, for deep lagoons and fore reefs where water depth is greater than 10 m and the substrate is dark, the OLI/OLI2- and TM/ETM+-derived water depth values substantially differ. Then, Landsat series data were applied to detect bathymetric changes in the Nanwei Dao. The temporal results of Nanwei Dao show that the depth of the new port has increased from approximately 2.00 to 10.00 m, whereas the new land in the northeast region has changed from a depth of approximately 7.50 m to land.

Overall, the Landsat series data can be used to detect temporal changes in the underwater terrain of coral islands in the range of approximately 0 to 10 m over the South China Sea for nearly 40 years, and achieving reliable 40-year long-term monitoring of water depths exceeding 10 m remains challenging."

Monitoring these tillage dynamics requires accurate spatial and temporal data, and satellite observations offer a valuable tool for this purpose. However, their accuracy varies, and the role of ground datasets in improving that accuracy is not well-characterized.

Annually, 4,269 ha (16 %) disadopted low-intensity tillage, but this was offset by an increase in adoption, with fields totaling 5,878 ha under low-intensity tillage in 2022 that had been under high-intensity tillage in 2011. The second component tested the ability of remote sensing to align with this detailed, human-labeled survey of tillage intensity. We extracted 14 spectral indices from Harmonized Landsat Sentinel-2, texture metrics from the Grey Level Co-Occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and environmental factors from the Digital Elevation Model (DEM) and SSURGO soil dataset.

The proposed method is evaluated against different baseline approaches across various LLMs based on the benchmark dataset designed for geospatial modeling, and a representative application scenario is presented to illustrate its practical effectiveness. Our experimental results demonstrate that the injection of graph-structured knowledge improves both the efficiency and interpretability of LLM-based geospatial modeling, thereby confirming the effectiveness of our proposed approach. GeoGraphRAG represents the first attempt to introduce graph-based RAG into geospatial modeling and provides novel insights for future research and practical applications in this field."

 Concentration and sources of PM2.5 components especially black carbon (BC) in Beijing have changed significantly in recent years under the influence of numerous air pollution prevention and control policies. To evaluate the influence of control policies as well as the long-term variation of BC sources, hourly time-resolution BC measurements, with simultaneous measurements of multiple chemical species of PM2.5, were performed continuously from 2016 to 2019 in Beijing. Here, six major sources of BC including aged BC were resolved by Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) with BC and other 18 species of PM2.5. The aged BC source resolved by PMF was validated by BC data from single-particle soot photometer (SP2) and single particle aerosol mass spectrometer (SPAMS) for the first time in Beijing. The results showed that BC concentration decreased significantly from 2016 to 2019 with approximately 46 % of the decrease attributed to coal burning reduction. The sources of BC apportioned by PMF were compared to the emission inventory of BC and the best correlation was found between coal BC from PMF and residential BC from emission inventory. However, the contribution of traffic BC (from 40 % to 53 %) and aged BC (from 12 % to 15 %) increased during the study period. The major source of BC pollution episodes has shifted from coal combustion to traffic source. This study provided observation-based evidence for the effectiveness of air pollution control policies on BC, and provided guidance for future BC source control in Beijing."

 Long-term observation at different environmental sites is crucial for accurately tracking PM2.5 trends and formulating effective pollution control strategies. This study conducted PM2.5 sampling and component analysis at urban and suburban sites in Shenzhen in 2014, 2019, and 2024, using machine learning models to assess the impact of meteorological and source emission changes on PM2.5 trends and receptor model to identify PM2.5 sources. The results show that Shenzhen's PM2.5 levels declined by 47 % from 2014 to 2024, mostly due to long-term emission cuts, with meteorological impacts accounting for a minor 11.9 % of the change. Urban PM2.5 concentrations consistently surpass suburban ones, with both experiencing approximately 30 % declines in Phase I (2014–2019), whereas in Phase II (2019–2024), the urban site shows a greater 29 % drop compared with a 17 % drop at the suburban site, narrowing their gap. The source apportionment results show that in Phase I, the urban site's PM2.5 decline stemmed mainly from reduced vehicle emissions and secondary sulfate, while the suburban site's drop resulted from decreased secondary sulfate, ship emissions, and secondary organic aerosols. In Phase II, fugitive dust reduction is the primary driver of PM2.5 declines at both sites, though other sources also play a contributing role. Emission reductions from sources in Phase II are smaller than those in Phase I, coupled with a narrowed concentration gap between the two sites and a rising relative contribution from secondary sources, highlighting Shenzhen's need for stronger regional coordination and secondary pollutant control to lower PM2.5 levels."

 Although the association between PM2.5 and anemia is biologically plausible, involving the iron regulation disruption by chronic systemic inflammation following particle exposure, existing epidemiological evidence is limited, especially among workers or considering particle components.We selected 372,290 workers in Guangdong Province in 2020 and used the yearly PM2.5 concentrations and its chemical components’ annual concentrations around their workplaces as the exposure. We employed the use of mixed-effects models to assess the associations of PM2.5 and its components with hemoglobin and anemia, further investigating the interaction between stratified variables (demographic characteristics and occupational variables) and the five components on anemia.For each interquartile range increase in the concentration of PM2.5 and its components (BC, NH4+, NO3-, SO42-, OM), the hemoglobin concentration decreased by 0.993 (95 %CI: 0.927, 1.059), 0.747 (0.681, 0.812), 0.939 (0.871, 1.007), 1.237 (1.167, 1.306), 0.982 (0.916, 1.047), and 0.798 (0.735, 0.862) g/L, respectively. Except for BC, PM2.5 and the other components were associated with a significant increase in the prevalence of anemia, with ORs ranging from 3.0 % to 14.8 % per IQR increase in the exposure. NO3- had the most significant effect on both outcomes. In addition, we found that interactions between stratifying variables and concentrations of the five components were predominantly significant for the prevalence of anemia (P for interaction <0.05), with different susceptibilities observed across age groups, genders, and subgroups of occupational variables.The study offers an in-depth examination of the potential impact of PM2.5 and its components on the prevalence of anemia among workers."

 Triplet excited states (3C∗) of organic compounds and singlet oxygen (1O2) are important oxidants in the atmospheric aqueous phase, yet their roles in the degradation of phenolic compounds (PhCs) remain poorly characterized. In this study, we investigated the aqueous-phase photochemical reactivity of five substituted phenols-eugenol, 4-ethylphenol (4-EP), 3-methylcatechol (3-MC), 4-nitrocatechol(4-NC) and 2,6-dimethoxy-4-methylphenol (DMMP)-in the presence of four triplet-state photosensitizers: 3,4-dimethoxybenzaldehyde (DMB), benzophenone (BP), vanillin (VA), and 2-acetonaphthone (2AN). The contributions of reactive oxidative species (ROS), including 1O2, •OH, and 3C∗ were systematically examined using quenching and chemical prober technique. The second-order rate constants (kPhCs,3C∗)for reactions between PhCs and 3DMB∗ ranged from (1–6)✕109 M−1 s−1, following the reactivity order: 4-NC > DMMP > EUG>4-EP>3-MC. However, no consistent reactivity trend was observed across different triplet sensitizers, indicating that different triplet-state photosensitizer exhibit varying reactivity toward phenolic compounds. Contribution analysis confirmed that 3C∗ was the dominant oxidant, accounting for 60–89 % of the observed photodegradation. The steady-state concentrations of 3C∗ and 1O2 were estimated as [3C∗]ss=(5.6–9.6) × 10−14 M and [1O2]ss (1.3–3.4) × 10−13 M, respectively. The quantum yield coefficient (fTMP) of 3C∗ ranged from 90 to 3000 M−1, while the 1O2 quantum yield (Φ1O2) varied between 1 % and 50 %. A strong correlation between fTMP and Φ1O2 suggested that 1O2 is primarily produced via energy transfer from 3C∗.Quantitative structure–activity relationship model showed a moderate correlation between kPhCs,3C∗ and oxidation potentials of PhCs (r2 = 0.34–0.72), while Hammett plots revealed stronger correlation with substituent constants(r2 = 0.61–0.93), highlighting the dominant influence of electronic effects of substituents. Increased substituent numbers appeared to suppress the reactivity of PhCs toward 3C∗, suggesting a combination of steric and electronic inhibition. These results provide new insight into the 3C∗-mediated degradation mechanisms of phenolic compounds in atmospheric aqueous-phase."

 Atmospheric amines have gained significant attention for their role in new particle formation, nitrogen cycling, and climate change. To investigate their formation mechanisms and sources, year-round PM2.5 samples were collected in Xiamen, a coastal city in southeastern China. Samples were analyzed for methylamine (MA), ethylamine (EA), and dimethylamine (DMA) using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Total measured amine concentrations were higher in spring and winter than in summer and autumn, with an annual average of 24.9 ng m−3, dominated by MA (40.1 %). The dominant formation pathway of particle-phase amines varied seasonally. In summer and autumn, a strong correlation between amines and acidic ions highlighted the importance of acid-base chemistry in amine salt formation. Conversely, increased relative humidity (RH) and enhanced aerosol acidity in spring and winter favored direct dissolution. While atmospheric oxidation generally enhanced the gas-to-particle conversion of amines, evidence of amine degradation by oxidants was also observed in spring. Five sources of amines were identified using positive matrix factorization (PMF): biomass burning, secondary products, industrial emissions, coal combustion and agricultural emissions, and marine and dust emissions. During summer, autumn, and spring, secondary products were the primary contributors to amines, accounting for nearly or over half. However, in winter, combustion sources played a larger role. Although the dominant sources varied by season and episode during different high concentration episodes, combustion activities and secondary formation were generally identified as the major contributors. Backward trajectory analysis showed that pollutant transport from the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) and Pearl River Delta (PRD) regions significantly influenced amine levels in Xiamen. The PRD region showed substantial contributions from biomass burning and secondary products, whereas the YRD region was mainly linked to industrial emissions as well as coal combustion and agricultural emissions. These findings improve understanding of amine processes, offering valuable insights for targeted emission control strategies."

 BackgroundAlthough the link between air pollution and lung cancer is well established, recent evidence from low-pollution areas is mixed. We investigated the association of long-term exposure to air pollution with lung cancer incidence in Denmark.MethodsWe analyzed data from 28,731 female nurses in the Danish Nurse Cohort, followed from 1993/1999 until 2020 for lung cancer incidence. We estimated residential annual mean concentrations of particulate matter (PM10 and PM2.5), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), black carbon (BC), and ozone (O3) using the DEHM/UBM/AirGIS modelling system. Time-varying Cox regression models evaluated the associations between these exposures and lung cancer incidence.ResultsAfter excluding participants who did not meet the criteria for our study, we were left with 23,706 participants, 450 of whom developed lung cancer during the study period.

 To quantitatively characterize atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition in a key agricultural region, dry and bulk N deposition were measured at five sites (Fuzhou, Taining, Shanghang, Changting, and Wuyishan), in Fujian province of southeastern China over the past decade. Dry deposition of ammonia (NH3) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) was estimated using the influential method, multiplying gaseous N concentrations by the deposition velocity simulated using the GEOS-Chem model. For bulk deposition the amounts of NH4+-N and NO3−-N were obtained by multiplying the N concentrations in rainwater by the precipitation amount. Long-term in situ observations (from 2010 to 2020) indicated that bulk N deposition decreased by 17.4 % during the monitoring period. Notably, from 2016 to 2020, total N deposition significantly decreased by 22.2 %, with an average value of 27.5 ± 1.23 kg N ha−1 yr−1. This was mostly caused by a reduction in reduced N deposition. N deposition exhibited distinct seasonal variability, determined by the amount of precipitation: dry deposition reached its peak in autumn, whereas bulk deposition was at its highest in spring and summer. The ratios of reduced to oxidized N in dry deposition, bulk deposition, and total N deposition were 3.23, 1.03, and 1.39, respectively, indicating a strong influence of agricultural sources. Our results show that atmospheric N deposition is a significant source of N to cropland and surrounding forest ecosystems in Fujian province. As such, it should be incorporated into N management strategies for crop cultivation to achieve sustainable agricultural and ecological protection."

 Fresno, California, has some of the worst air quality in the United States, with PM2.5 exposure contributing to increased asthma-related emergency department (ED) visits. This study assesses the relationship between PM2.5 exposure and asthma ED visits in Fresno from 2005 to 2015, with a focus on vulnerable populations, including children, racial minorities, and those living in commercial areas. A time-stratified case-crossover design was used to analyze the impact of PM2.5 on asthma ED visits. Data on ED visits were sourced from California's Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI), and air pollution data from the EPA's Air Quality System (AQS). Statistical models were adjusted for meteorological variables and additional pollutants (NO2, CO, and SO2). The study identified 7778 asthma-related ED visits. PM2.5 exposure was significantly associated with an increase in ED visits (Lag 0–14, OR = 1.135) during the cold season (November–February) when concentrations of PM2.5 were the highest. Stratified analyses showed elevated risks for individuals in commercial areas, females, and Hispanic and Black populations. Children aged 2–5 years were particularly vulnerable, while older adults showed lower sensitivity. The dose responses analysis found that PM2.5 exposure of 9 μg/m3 or higher for a 14 day period significantly increased the risk of asthma-related ED visits during the cold season. PM2.5 exposure during the cold season significantly increases asthma ED visits, particularly among vulnerable populations that live in commercial areas. These findings highlight the need for targeted public health measures to mitigate the effects of PM2.5 in high-risk communities."

 Peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN), a key secondary pollutant, plays a vital role in atmospheric chemistry and photochemical smog formation. In this study, PAN concentrations were measured at an urban site during the peak photochemical pollution period in June 2022. The study examined PAN's production, loss processes, regional transport, and sensitivity to precursors within the context of photochemical pollution events. Two distinct photochemical pollution episodes were identified, with average PAN concentrations of 1.4 ± 0.7 ppbv and 0.9 ± 0.5 ppbv in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively, both exceeding those on clean days (0.8 ± 0.4 ppbv). The diurnal variation of PAN exhibited a typical unimodal pattern, indicating enhanced photochemical activity during pollution episodes. Conditional probability analysis revealed that peak concentrations of ozone (O3) and PAN predominantly originated from the north-to-east sector, whereas nitrous acid maxima occurred near the observation site under low wind speeds. PAN thermal decomposition was more pronounced on clean days, resulting in a shorter atmospheric lifetime compared to pollution events. Observation-based model simulations further demonstrated that PAN production and loss rates were significantly higher during pollution episodes than on clean days. Temperature emerged as a key factor driving PAN's diurnal pattern. Additionally, relative incremental reactivity analysis indicated that PAN formation was highly sensitive to anthropogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs), particularly alkenes. This study provides valuable insights into PAN behavior under severe photochemical pollution conditions, contributing to a better understanding of urban air quality and photochemical smog formation mechanisms."

This study investigates long-term hospital utilisation following the Hazelwood mine fire (Feb–March 2014), in a cohort of children exposed during infancy.MethodsBirth records of all children born in the Latrobe Valley, Australia, and aged under two during the fire (n = 1788), were linked to emergency department (ED) presentations and hospital admissions for a five-year period immediately following the event. Associations between modelled terciles of fire-specific particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) and presentations/admissions, for all causes as well as for specific diagnostic groupings (respiratory, infectious, allergic), were assessed using a recurrent events survival analysis approach.ResultsChildren with medium (HR 1.16, 95 %CI 1.06–1.28) or high exposure (HR 1.11, 95 %CI 1.01–1.21) had higher rates of overall presentations to the ED than those with low exposure. Children with medium exposure still had marginally higher rates of presentation to the ED, after exclusion of diagnoses unlikely to have a clinical connection to smoke (HR 1.13, 95 %CI 1.00–1.27).ConclusionsWe observed an increase during a five-year period in overall ED presentations in children with higher exposure to smoke during infancy, although these results were attenuated after adjusting for the distance between the residential area and the hospital.

The present study demonstrates the results of an ensemble modelling approach for assessing the impact of shipping emissions on current and future air quality concentrations and exposure in the coastal Mediterranean region.Ensemble model means were calculated based on the results of three regional or global dispersion models (EMEP, SILAM and CMAQ) to simulate annual and seasonal atmospheric pollutant dispersion patterns in the Mediterranean region, under the baseline 2018 scenario and two 2050 future scenarios developed within the EMERGE (Evaluation, control and Mitigation of the EnviRonmental impacts of shippinG Emissions) project. The selected scenarios examine the impact of a) the designation of a Mediterranean Sulfur/Nitrogen Emission Control Area (SECA/NECA) and the extensive use of open-loop scrubbers, Exhaust Gas Cleaning Systems and Selective Catalytic Reduction systems on future shipping emissions (Scenario 3 - S3) and b) the increased use of methane and methanol as alternative fuels in 2050 (Scenario 8 - S8).Ensemble model results were combined with population data for calculating population-weighted concentrations of legislated atmospheric pollutants for 30 Mediterranean coastal cities, representing exposure of city inhabitants to current and predicted future air pollution levels.The findings of the present study reveal significant annual city average reductions of SO2 and PM2.5 shipping related exposure for both S3 (89.78 % reduction) and S8 (96.22 % reduction), while shipping induced NO2 city-average exposure levels were efficiently controlled in S3 (42.74 % reduction) but not in S8 (4.39 % reduction). The reported results need to be specifically considered in the development of policy recommendations on shipping emission control for the Mediterranean region."

 The development of state-of-the-art analytical techniques for organic tracers and the application of receptor modeling, such as positive matrix factorization (PMF), provide a robust framework for source apportionment of organic aerosols. This study presents a detailed examination of both biogenic and anthropogenic secondary organic aerosol (SOA) tracers in the Greater Bay Area. The inclusion of a diverse suite of molecular markers in PMF analysis has enabled the identification of six secondary source factors, including specific SOA factors derived from various precursors, demonstrating superior source resolution compared to traditional methods. The study also compares SOA estimates from chamber-generated mass conversion factors with PMF results, highlighting qualitative consistencies and discrepancies between the two approaches that suggest further refinement in tracer-based methods. Our findings indicate a need for additional tracers to further delineate mixed factors, underscore the importance of comprehensive tracer data in enhancing source apportionment capabilities, and provide crucial insights for air quality management and policy formulation in the region."

 Ozone (O3) pollution is a critical environmental issue, especially in rapidly developing industrial regions such as Dushanzi, an oil and petrochemical hub in northwestern China. This paper investigated the first 4-day ozone pollution event in Dushanzi in June 2023. Meteorological parameters, O3 and its precursor concentrations were utilized, combined with the Observation-based model (OBM), Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), and backward trajectory analysis, to investigate the causes of ozone pollution in the region. The OBM-MCM model assesses the sensitivity of ozone and its generation-loss mechanisms, revealing that O3 is mainly generated through the HO2+NO pathway and lost via the NO2+RO2 pathway. On polluted days, the region falls into the VOCs-NOx collaborative control zone, with an optimal VOCs to NOx reduction ratio of 1:2. Under this reduction ratio, focusing on emissions reduction from the petrochemical industry, particularly controlling OVOCs, would be beneficial for reducing ozone pollution. Based on OFP and PMF analyses, petrochemical emissions were identified as the primary source of O3 pollution, with OVOCs contributing the most to O3 formation. Meteorological data revealed that high temperatures, low humidity and low wind speeds are external triggers of ozone pollution in the region. Meanwhile, the impact of long-range transport in the eastern Shihezi-Changji region cannot be ignored. This study provides important scientific basis for local governments to formulate O3 pollution control strategies."

 Biodegradation of small organics by bacteria in the atmosphere efficiently competes with chemical losses despite the low number concentration of metabolically active bacteria. We measured biodegradation rates of formaldehyde by three bacterial strains isolated from fog water (belonging to the genera Comamonas, Pseudomonas and Methylobacterium) as a function of pH (4.8–6.8), with invariably highest rates for each strain at the highest pH. We also investigated the potential impact of formaldehyde biodegradation in the presence of sulfite on hydroxymethanosulfonate (HMS), an adduct of formaldehyde and S(IV) frequently detected in fog and cloud water. Our observations show that HMS formation reduces the rate of formaldehyde biodegradation by acting as a formaldehyde reservoir. The newly determined biodegradation rates were incorporated into a state-of-the-art atmospheric multiphase chemistry box model that realistically considers a small fraction of fog droplets contain bacteria to simulate for the first time the effect of biodegradation on formaldehyde and HMS concentrations under typical conditions of night-time radiation fog. The model results suggest that biodegradation decreases the concentration of formaldehyde by ∼1 % and that of HMS <0.1 %, i.e., likely below detection thresholds needed to confidently attribute changes in aqueous phase concentrations to biodegradation. The loss by biodegradation may contribute as much to the total loss of aqueous phase formaldehyde as chemical reactions since during night-time also chemical losses are small. The discrepancies between high biodegradation rates measured in laboratory and the low impaction on atmospheric chemistry from modelling findings can be attributed to differences in timescales (72–84 h in the lab vs. ∼1-h fog droplet lifetimes) and oxidative conditions, which result in rapid S(IV) oxidation in fog, thus limiting HMS formation."

 Urban air quality is a major concern due to high population density and pollutant levels. To develop effective mitigation strategies, distinguishing between local and external emission sources is crucial. In Polish cities, residential heating is the primary source of particulate matter emissions, with transportation also playing a significant role.This study assesses the impact of the transport sector on Warsaw’s air quality by analysing PM10, PM2.5, and NO2 concentrations. A comprehensive approach was applied, integrating emissions from traffic, road dust resuspension, and residential heating. These emissions were estimated using a bottom-up approach based on detailed road and point source data. The ATMO-Street model chain was employed, combining the GEM-AQ model for background concentrations with the IFDM bi-Gaussian dispersion model and the OSPM street-canyon module. Model validation using data from nine monitoring stations demonstrated that including the OSPM module significantly improved NO2 predictions at the traffic station, enhancing GEM-AQ and IFDM model performance by 62% and 46%, respectively. The results showed that traffic contributes 84% of NO2 concentrations at this location.Furthermore, incorporating the street-canyon effect and resuspension emissions—previously excluded—improved model accuracy for PM2.5 and PM10 by 34% and 55%, respectively, compared to GEM-AQ. The study revealed that traffic contributes up to 41% of PM2.5 and 42% of PM10 at the traffic station. These findings underscore the importance of including road dust resuspension and street-canyon effects in urban air quality modelling."

 Source apportionment of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) provides scientific basis for the prevention of ozone (O3) and particulate matter pollution, while bias exists in the receptor model based on the measured concentration. We conducted online measurement of hourly ambient concentrations for multiple VOCs species in January and July 2023 in Lianyungang, a city with fast growing industry in east China, and five major sources of VOCs were identified with an improved application of the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model by considering photochemical losses and formation potential of secondary aerosols (SOAP) and O3 (OFP). For January and July, the total VOCs (TVOC) concentrations were measured at 23.7 ± 10.8 and 12.0 ± 7.5 ppbv, and the averaged consumed VOCs due to photochemical losses in daytime reached 3.12 and 3.08 ppb, respectively. The concentrations were generally lower than those in Chinese mega cities. As the important emission from industrial sources, Oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were found to occupy a significant position in the concentration structure of TVOCs and photochemical losses in Lianyungang. Inclusion of photochemical losses avoided underestimation of contribution from solvent usage and overestimation of vehicle emissions in summer. There was a significant difference between source contributions based on concentrations and environmental impacts (SOAP in winter and OFP in summer). For the latter, coal burning was identified as the most important source in January, and industrial emissions and solvent usage in July. Indicated by the backward trajectories, local emissions were the dominant contributor to the VOCs pollution, mainly from the large ports and industrial parks, while industrial emissions from nearby provinces (Shandong and Anhui) were also important. The analyses provide scientific evidences for determining the priorities of VOCs emission controls for cities with fast industrialization."

 Residential solid fuel combustion is a significant contributor to air pollution in Hungary, particularly in rural areas. This study aimed to assess air pollution attributable to residential solid combustion by monitoring the spatial and temporal variability of PM2.5 mass concentration and other specific air pollutants. Sampling campaigns were conducted at rural and urban sites with differing heating habits, comparing heating and non-heating periods in 2020.Significant differences in air pollutant concentrations were observed between the two periods. At the rural site, the mean PM2.5 mass concentration was 1.7 times higher during the heating period compared to the urban site. Biomass burning markers (e.g. levoglucosan, potassium, organic carbon in PM2.5) showed a significant associations during the heating period. Additionally, the universal waste burning marker 1,3,5-triphenylbenzene was detected on 93% of the measurement days at the rural site during the heating period, indicating continuous waste burning. The results of 14C analysis and multiple diagnostic ratios further supported source identification. The annual target value for benzo(a)pyrene (1 ng/m3) was exceeded in 100% of samples collected at the rural site and 64% of samples at the urban site during the heating period. Detailed chemical analysis of PM2.5 accounted for an average of 85% of total mass.These findings highlight the urgent need for robust national and local air quality strategies to mitigate emissions from residential heating and protect public health."

 Atmospheric ammonia (NH3) emissions and depositions have been linked to negative effects on human health and biodiversity. National monitoring networks have documented large spatial variation of NH3 concentrations related to agricultural activities, including livestock pollution. Little is known about spatial and temporal variation of livestock-related ammonia concentrations in areas where residential and nature areas are located nearby intensive livestock farming. The objective of this study was to assess the spatial and temporal variability of ambient ammonia in such a mixed land-use area within the Netherlands.A dense air quality network was set up with 71 sites spanning over 1027 km2 within rural and semi-urban (small towns) areas, and nature reserves. Ambient ammonia concentrations were measured monthly with passive samplers from March 2022 to February 2024.Ammonia measurements showed large spatial and temporal variation. Spatial variation was related to the number of livestock farms in a 3000m buffer around sites and inverse distance to the nearest farm. Mean concentrations were 13.6 μg/m3 (rural), 9.6 μg/m3 (semi-urban) and 5.1 μg/m3 (nature sites). Seasonal patterns, highest in spring and lowest in winter, were similar in rural, semi-urban and natural sites. The highest concentrations were observed in March 2022, coinciding with manure application and stable weather conditions. Temporal variability related to temperature, rainfall, manure application, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity. Multivariate models explained 52–80 % of the temporal variance component, depending on time period. Our spatial and temporal analyses provide further evidence that farming emissions impact NH3 concentrations both locally and at greater distances."

Aerobiome samples were collected using standard Hirst type volumetric approach and the SASS2300 high volume wetted wall cyclone sampler (300 l min−1) coupled with the SASS4000 concentrator (4000 l min−1). Real Time PCR was used to confirm presence of bacterial, fungal, and plant DNA in total eDNA extracted from aerobiome samples. A targeted long read amplicon approach was used to recover airborne bacterial and fungal diversity in high volume air samples. In total, 741 bacterial and 1210 fungal OTUs were identified. Gammaprotebacteria and Agaricomycetes, with relative abundance over 50 %, were the most dominant bacterial and fungal classes, respectively. Cladosporium was the most abundant fungal genus.

 Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) are generated through the oxidation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and constitute a significant fraction of atmospheric particulate matter. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are primarily derived from anthropogenic sources, undergo oxidation processes that generate less volatile products. These products subsequently partition into aerosol particles, thereby contributing to SOA formation. This review synthesizes key findings from laboratory investigations regarding SOA formation from oxidation of PAHs, outlining the reaction products and mechanisms under diverse oxidation conditions, as well as the factors influencing SOA yields. Radical adduct formation and H-atom abstraction are pivotal in reactions involving hydroxyl (OH) radicals, nitrate (NO3) radicals, chlorine (Cl) atoms, and ozonolysis. SOA yields are notably affected by the conditions of photooxidation and the characteristics of the precursor compounds. Additionally, the review offers insights into the human effects and the mechanisms of cellular toxicity associated with SOA derived from naphthalene. Overall, this review elucidates the role of PAHs in SOA formation and provides critical information for the modulation of PAH-SOA to mitigate air pollution."

 From July 17 to 22, 2021, Zhengzhou City and its surrounding areas in Henan Province, China, experienced the strongest precipitation event since the inception of modern meteorological records in the country. Using daily precipitation data from China Meteorological Administration stations spanning 1951–2024 and daily gridded reanalysis data from ERA5 over 1979–2024, we investigated the relationship between zonal baroclinic Rossby wave packets (RWPs) and this extreme heavy precipitation event in Zhengzhou. The results demonstrated that during the extreme precipitation event in Zhengzhou, no noticeable cyclone but cyclonic curvature of streamlines was observed at 850 hPa, while a “moisture tongue” provided rich water vapor necessary for the intense rainfall. The activities of the zonally baroclinic RWPs were closely linked to the onset and cessation of the heavy precipitation. Throughout the period of the extreme precipitation event, there consistently exhibited more pronounced daily activities of Rossby waves with wavenumbers 5–7 in the Eastern Hemisphere as compared to those in the Western Hemisphere. The RWPs influencing the extreme event originated in the upper atmosphere from Western Europe and propagated to the Zhengzhou area over a period of approximately five days. The zonal baroclinic RWPs at 300 hPa contributed to negative vorticity over Zhengzhou, facilitating the development and maintenance of extreme precipitation events there.

 Coking industries are an important source of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Coking emissions are characterized by diverse emission points, species and intensities, leading to inconsistencies in emission profiles. This complexity complicates the accurate identification of coking-related pollutants in the atmosphere. To obtain a distinct VOC fingerprint from coking emissions, 57 VOCs were detected based on a comprehensive sampling campaign conducted at three strategically placed sites (one in an area with intensive coking activity and two downwind sites) and one control site. We found a positive correlation between the contribution of coking emissions to total VOCs (TVOCs) (between 10.4 % and 44.2 %) and the severity of VOC pollution (TVOC content ranging from 28.75 to 49.28 ppbv). Furthermore, increases in the contribution of coking emissions to TVOC content resulted in increases in the proportions of alkenes (from 10 % to 19 % in summer and 13 % to 20 % in autumn) and aromatics (from 6 % to 18 % in autumn) in TVOCs. Ethane, ethene, propene, benzene, toluene, and acetylene were identified as dominant VOC species in coking emissions. Their concentrations increased as coking activity increased and were highly prevalent in the coking source profile, as indicated by positive matrix factorization analysis. The ratio of benzene to toluene, alongside the relative proportions of benzene, toluene, and ethylbenzene and of ethane, propane, and ethene was effective diagnostic indicators for identifying coking sources. The PMF-resolved factor profile from our field campaign could accurately represent coking emissions. Photochemical aging led to an underestimation of the coking-source contribution but had little effect on the ranges of the diagnostic indicators or the chemical profile of VOCs from coking sources."

 This study examines the modeling uncertainty of wind resource data stemming from the use of various planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations available in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. WRF-based wind simulations spanning 20 years at 3-km resolution using 11 different PBL schemes are used to objectively investigate the uncertainty in modeling wind speed for land-based wind (LBW) and offshore wind (OSW) locations in Puerto Rico. The uncertainty in the wind modeling for the 20-year dataset is quantified using the spread index (SI) and standard deviation (SD). For virtual LBW and OSW sites, the SI and SD values are analyzed as calculated across various spatial and temporal scales. Because the PBL's atmospheric stability conditions can be characterized into two dominant categories, the study focuses on analyzing the SI and SD for daytime (mainly unstable PBL conditions) and nighttime (mainly stable PBL conditions). For wind shear (10 m–200 m) at the OSW and LBW sites, WRF-based numerical experiments indicate the following SI (or SD) ranges: 39 %–94 % (0.74 m/s–1.44 m/s) during the daytime for OSW, 50 %–75 % (0.68 m/s–1.19 m/s) during the daytime for LBW, 37 %–60 % (0.73 m/s–1.12 m/s) during the nighttime for OSW, and 57 %–143 % (0.65 m/s–1.43 m/s) during the nighttime for LBW. While a high SI is observed when modeling LBW during the nighttime, there are notable modeling uncertainties during the daytime on the leeward side of the orographic barriers for Puerto Rico."

 The Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) is one of the most important regions with rapid urbanization in China. The research employs the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) to investigate the influences of urbanization on precipitation patterns and intensities of predecessor rain events (PREs) induced by Typhoon Khanun (2017) in the YRD. The results indicate that using land use data during the precipitation event can improve the model simulation performance. Although the total regional precipitation remains relatively unchanged, urbanization significantly alters the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall, resulting in enhanced precipitation in the coastal urban regions near the heavy precipitation center regions, with a maximum increase up to 52 %. In contrast, rainfall near the inland outer region of the heavy precipitation center is reduced, with a maximum decrease up to 50 %, exhibiting a prominently uneven distribution pattern, which requires adaptive zoning in flood management. Mechanistically, around the coastal urban regions near heavy precipitation centers, urbanization enhances water vapor convergence and atmospheric instability, necessitating revised stormwater infrastructure design standards for these high-risk zones; while it suppresses water vapor transport, enhancing atmospheric stability in the inland outer region. Further analysis of the cloud microphysics reveals that urbanization significantly strengthens the processes of raindrop accretion of cloud water and water vapor condensing into raindrops, thereby promoting increased rainfall in the coastal urban region; in contrast, it may weaken the processes of snow melting and water vapor condensing into raindrops, leading to reduced precipitation in the peripheral inland outer region. These findings offer scientific support for climate-resilient urban planning, demonstrating how urbanization shifts precipitation patterns, necessitating coordinated regional adaptation for flood resilience."

 Polar regions exhibit distinctive irradiance characteristics driven by their high-latitude location, yet these features have been scarcely investigated. In this study, we present and analyze surface irradiance measurements from two sites around Longyearbyen (78.2° N) in Svalbard: Adventdalen valley and Platåberget (456 m above sea level). The Adventdalen measurements span 10 years (2013−2022) of longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) horizontal irradiance, while SW irradiance measurements, both horizontal and tilted, cover the sunlight seasons of 2021 and 2022 at both sites. Key findings include unique irradiance features, such as downwelling SW irradiance is maximum in late May—earlier than the solstice—due to a relative low cloudiness and the snow involving an irradiance enhancement (terrain reflection and albedo enhancement). Upwelling SW irradiance, influenced by snow cover, peaks in early May but may shift with prolonged snow seasons. Albedo values from May 2012–2017 were lower than 2018–2022, suggesting earlier snowmelt and potential long-term impacts on upwelling SW irradiance. Comparatively, SW irradiance is generally higher on Platåberget, with snow cover differences leading to discrepancies in downwelling and upwelling SW irradiance, in part due to an irradiance enhancement with high albedo. The LW budget is consistently negative, averaging −34 W m−2 annually, while the SW budget drives the surface energy balance, becoming positive from late April to mid-September. These findings underscore the importance of in-situ measurements for understanding Arctic irradiance processes, which are crucial for advancing solar energy applications and climate research in polar regions."

 Extreme precipitation plays a critical role in the development of hydrological extremes with severe socio-economic and environmental impacts. Over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), extreme precipitation events have increased in frequency and intensity and are projected to rise further under climate change. However, simulations of such events in this region remain challenging due to uncertainties in the representation of cloud microphysics. While previous research has exposed the sensitivity of climate models to microphysics schemes, the atmospheric processes driving discrepancies in precipitation simulations are still not fully explored. In this study, we analyse two extreme precipitation events over the TP region using six different microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). We assess how precipitation and related processes are represented across these schemes and identify key sources of uncertainties in precipitation simulations. Our findings reveal substantial variations in the location, intensity and timing of precipitation, with differences in accumulated amounts reaching up to 40 % depending on the microphysics scheme used. Further analysis shows that the timing and strength of convective activity are closely linked to precipitation patterns, leading to significant discrepancies across experiments. Additionally, the representation of horizontal water vapour transport plays a critical role in determining the location and intensity of precipitation by influencing moisture availability. Lastly, the modelling of cloud composition – particularly of solid-phase hydrometeors – emerges as a crucial factor in precipitation evolution, contributing substantially to the variability in simulated precipitation location and intensity."

 The present study characterizes the pre-monsoon convective clouds (PMCC) observed in the monsoon core zone and a hail-producing storm during the pre-monsoon month observed using C-band dual-polarization (CDPR) radar at the IITM's Atmospheric Research Testbed (ART) facility in Silkheda, 60 km north of Bhopal. The composite analysis of PMCC has shown that the maximum height of 35- and 50-dBZ echo tops (ETHs) is around 13 km and 11 km, respectively, indicating intense and deep convection. The mean value of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is also high for the pre-monsoon season. The composite contoured-frequency-by-altitude diagrams (CFADs) of PMCC show a high frequency of smaller values of differential reflectivity (ZDR ∼ 0 dB) and specific differential phase (KDP) above the melting layer, indicating that intense convective updrafts dominate the PMCC, causing hail/graupel particles to be rimmed heavily above the melting layer and reach greater heights. The wider distribution or higher values of ZH, ZDR, KDP, and small values of correlation coefficient ρHV (<0.95) near the surface indicate the presence of a rain-hail mixture during the pre-monsoon month.The microphysical characteristic of a hailstorm event that produced hailstones over Bhopal on 30th April 2023 is explored. It is found that the CAPE value was building up before the hailstorm event, and it was high just before the hailstone was observed over Bhopal. Time evolution of storms indicates the dominant presence of graupel/hail at 5-11 km. Graupel/hail will form due to the riming or accretion processes of cloud droplets, supercooled water, or ice particles. It has been observed that the riming process is dominant during the storm's evolution, which produces very low values of ZDR and KDP. The high value of ρHV (>0.99) at these altitudes suggests that the graupel/hail is dry. The updraft associated with a convectively unstable atmosphere exaggerates the growth of ice crystals by a rapid collection of supercooled water droplets. That ultimately led to forming graupel/hailstones through the riming process. The wet hailstones and large raindrops signatures close to the surface are also observed and are characterized by higher values of ZH (> 50 dBZ), enhanced ZDR (∼ 3–4 dB), and a depleted ρHV (< 0.95). Additionally, a KDP exceeding 1.8°/km near the surface indicates the process of hail melting/hail coated with water."

 Deep moist convection significantly disturbs the evolution of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) through its convective cold pools (CCPs). This study investigates the statistics of CCPs and their impact on PBL turbulence as observed at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) site. To obtain a large dataset of CCPs, we adapted an existing CCP-detection algorithm for use in multilevel, micrometeorological data. Application of the algorithm to ATTO observations collected from August 2021 through December 2023 resulted in a dataset consisting of 410 CCPs. CCPs occur nearly every other day at the ATTO site, although they are most common from April through September and are least common from December through March. The occurrence of CCPs is linked to the diurnal cycle of the PBL, with more events around 1800 UTC and the less events around 1100 UTC. The strength of CCP perturbations varies strongly as a function of the distance from the canopy. Above the canopy (approximately 37 m), CCPs exhibit well-defined gust fronts, marked by sharp drops in temperature and humidity, gusting winds, overturning circulations, and pressure rises. During gust front passages, sensible (latent) heat fluxes are briefly enhanced and subsequently invert sign (weaken) in the CCPs, as previously unstable (moister) PBLs become stable (drier). Turbulence is stronger and more anisotropic during gust fronts and just above the canopy due to mechanical drag. Anisotropic turbulence may be transported upward to 200 m by the gust fronts. Below the canopy, CCPs and attendant perturbations are drastically damped, except in high-end cases."

 Diurnal temperature range (DTR) is an important climate indicator that exerts substantial effects on society as well as the environment, particularly on karst landforms where the ecosystem is vulnerable and sensitive to DTR. However, the space-time pattern of extremes of DTR and their relationship with wind speed over global karst regions remain poorly understood. In this study, we defined DTR extremes and investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of warm-season extremes and their relationships with wind speeds across global karst regions during 1980–2022. Our results reveal that arid zones such as the Middle East and northwestern China exhibit large long-term mean DTR and DTR extremes. There is an increase in the frequency of DTR extremes for most regions, though pronounced regional divergence of DTR trends exists. The intensity of DTR extremes show apparent increasing trends in North America and Europe, but in other regions decreased trends are prevailing. For most regions worldwide, declining wind speed trends are discerned, though slight increases are observed in the western United States. Moreover, wind speed is generally strengthened along with larger DTR. Daytime DTR extremes dominate North America, Europe and south China, while nighttime extremes are likely to occur in the Middle East and Asia. These findings advance the understanding of DTR extremes in fragile karst ecosystems, which could help for region-specific climate adaptation strategies."

All running versions perform significantly better in the Indochinese Peninsula compared to the Southern Asia Archipelago. (2) Fog adversely affects the accuracy of IMERG precipitation estimates.

 The positive Indian Ocean Dipole (pIOD) acts as a key precursor to La Niña formation, yet the dynamical interactions between pIOD and concurrent El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) phases remain insufficiently understood. Through an analysis of reanalysis datasets and simulations from the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LENS), this study demonstrates that 64.2 % of observed pIOD events coincide with concurrent El Niño, aligning with a frequency of 57.1 % in CESM-LENS simulations. The probability of subsequent La Niña development following pIOD-El Niño coexistence reaches 54.7 % in reanalysis data and 59.0 % in CESM-LENS simulations, escalating to 75.6 % for intense pIOD episodes and 82.5 % under conditions of concurrent strong El Niño events. Spatiotemporal analysis reveals distinct transition mechanisms governed by Pacific background states. During periods of pIOD-El Niño coexistence, oceanic advection (51.7 %) works synergistically with surface heat flux (22.2 %) to collectively dissipate warm anomalies. In contrast, under pIOD-Neutral conditions, intensified zonal advection (61.7 %) predominantly facilitates cooling processes. Two key findings emerge from this analysis: (1) The intensity of the pIOD directly modulates both the likelihood and magnitude of subsequent La Niña, with stronger initial pIOD substantially enhance development probabilities; (2) Concurrent ENSO states determine the dominant physical drivers at play—El Niño coexistence enabling a multi-mechanism cooling while Neutral conditions necessitate accelerated advective processes. These findings demonstrate that combinations of pIOD-ENSO phases create distinct thermodynamic pathways for initiating La Niña events, carrying significant implications for seasonal forecasting. The identified intensity-dependent relationships and phase-specific mechanisms provide a framework for improving climate predictability, particularly under evolving climate conditions that may alter tropical basin interactions."

 The rainy season in South China is predominantly influenced by monsoon and tropical cyclone (TC) weather systems. However, due to the lack of long-term observational data, the microphysical characteristics of raindrop size distributions (DSDs) associated with these systems remain insufficiently understood. This study utilizes five years (2016–2020) of 2DVD observations to analyze the differences in DSD characteristics of monsoon and TC rainfall. The results indicate that monsoon rainfall exhibits higher concentrations of medium to large raindrops (diameter > 2.1 mm), along with larger mean rainfall rates (R) and mass-weighted mean diameters (Dm), but lower normalized intercept parameters (Nw) compared to TC rainfall. Distinct differences in the mean normalized DSDs are observed between monsoon and TC rainfall. Convective rain under both systems shows the characteristics of maritime convective rain. Additionally, the relationships between kinetic energy (KE) and R, KE and Dm, as well as radar reflectivity (Z) and R, differ between monsoon and TC rainfall. TC events have relatively humid atmospheric conditions and higher wind speeds, resulting in the presence of a large number of small raindrops. These findings enhance understanding of the DSD characteristics under different synoptic regimes and provide valuable implications for improving rainfall KE estimation, DSD retrieval, and quantitative precipitation estimation over South China."

 This paper presents a new three-dimensional (3D) adaptive lightning progressing stochastic model (ALPSM) that incorporates the adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) method to enable a compatible simulation of large-domain intracloud discharges and near-ground lightning leader attachment processes. A new self-consistent charge neutrality maintenance algorithm is proposed, which considers the internal electric field of the lightning channel and ensures synchronized adjustments of the channel potential with the ambient potential. The model successfully reproduces the reported leader connection scenarios during the negative cloud-to-ground (−CG) lightning attachment process and analyzes the spatiotemporal evolutionary process of leader propagation and channel potential variation. The simulation results reveal a series of interesting phenomena in leader propagation before grounding: initial bidirectional vertical propagation during channel potential rapidly adjusting from the initial value to the average of the positive and negative charge regions; horizontal multibranch propagation within charge regions where the most concentrated height of horizontal propagation corresponds to the vertical electric field zero-crossing points; and downward negative leader vertical propagation during the rapidly increasing channel potential period. The ALPSM model advances the lightning stochastic model simulation owing to the charge neutrality constraint and adaptive mesh refinement in large three-dimensional domains, which provides a further method for the lightning attachment process simulation."

 The assimilation of radar reflectivity plays a crucial role in improving the initial fields of numerical weather prediction (NWP). This study employs a one-dimensional (1D) Bayesian scheme to retrieve pseudo-humidity observations from radar reflectivity, which are subsequently assimilated within a three-dimensional variational (3D-Var) framework. The results demonstrate that under dry-biased background field, the joint assimilation of radial velocity and pseudo humidity observations more markedly enhances moisture condition compared to radial velocity assimilation alone, resulting in improved quantitative precipitation forecast skills. Additionally, a valid-time-shifting (VTS) method is implemented to augment a priori database in 1D Bayesian retrieval by introducing sub-ensembles before and after the analysis time, aiming to mitigate temporal and spatial displacement errors in the NWP system. Two assimilation experiments are conducted to evaluate the impact of the VTS scheme on severe convection prediction.

America and N. Asia. •Humidex anomalies amplify ∼2.9× in JJA from SSP1–2.6 to SSP5–8.5. •Air temperature dominates Humidex rise; humidity plays a secondary role. 
 This study investigates future projections of the extreme Humidex, a compound index integrating air temperature and relative humidity, as an indicator of heat stress under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP1–2.6 and SSP5–8.5). Using multi-model ensemble simulations from 15 high-resolution CMIP6 models, we examine seasonal variations in the extreme Humidex at both global and regional scales across 21 land regions. The historical simulations from CMIP6 models were validated using ERA5 observational data, ensuring reliability and accuracy in model projections. Additionally, the climatology of Humidex values derived from MME simulations was compared with the climatology of the Heat Index obtained from MME simulations, revealing consistency between the two heat stress indicators. To quantify heat-related hazards, we calculate the number of seasonal Dangerous Humidex Days (DHDs). Furthermore, we assess the relative contributions of air temperature and relative humidity to projected changes in the extreme Humidex. The results reveal a marked intensification of heat stress under SSP5–8.5, with late-century (2080–2100) increases in the extreme Humidex reaching approximately 5 to 9 °C across most land regions, compared to around 1.5 to 3.5 °C under SSP1–2.6. The JJA season exhibits the greatest intensification, particularly over Eastern North America and Northern Asia. On average, DJF shows a 2.78-fold increase in Humidex anomalies, while JJA demonstrates an even larger amplification of approximately 2.90-fold when transitioning from a low to high-emission scenario. The number of seasonal Dangerous Humidex Days also increases significantly, with an additional 60 to 80 days during DJF across many tropical and subtropical regions of the Southern Hemisphere, and more than 80 additional days per JJA season in most tropical regions under the high-emission scenario. Sensitivity analyses indicate that air temperature is the dominant driver of future changes in the extreme Humidex, while relative humidity exerts a secondary but regionally important influence."

 Evaluating the efficacy of cloud-seeding operations presents a complex challenge in atmospheric science, due to the multifaceted interactions between artificial nuclei, natural cloud processes, and local meteorological conditions. In this study, to assess cloud-seeding effects, several field experiments were conducted at Dongyanshan site (elevation 840 m) in northern Taiwan during northeast monsoon seasons from 2019 to 2022. The experiments utilized hygroscopic cloud seeding, leveraging the site's advantages of well-established instrumentation and a semi-closed, in-cloud environment. Our observational results indicate that the seeding agents can strengthen the competition effect, which causes an increase in liquid water content (LWC) and a decrease in water vapor mixing ratio, as well as the tail effect, which widens the drop size distribution (DSD). This important phenomenon of increased raindrop number concentration after cloud seeding was further confirmed by DSD observations at the upstream neighboring site, Xiayunping (elevation 340 m), where no cloud seeding was executed. Additionally, real-case model simulations were performed to further investigate the microphysical processes of cloud seeding. Simulation results indicate that cloud seeding enhances the cloud activation process (Pcact) while leading to the development of smaller cloud droplets, which decreases the auto-conversion process (Praut) of rain. Concurrently, an intensified accretion process (Pracw) increases raindrop diameter. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of cloud seeding, potentially improving the design and implementation of future weather modification strategies in similar atmospheric conditions."

 sUnderstanding the dynamic evolution of dry-wet transition events (DWTEs) at different time scales is significant in water resources planning, agricultural development, and disaster risk reduction in a changing climate. The   southeast coastal region of China has been identified as a hot spot; however, the evolution of DWTEs at different time scales is unclear. This study identified DWTEs in China's   southeast coastal region at monthly, seasonal, and semi-annual scales from 1961 to 2020 based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) over 30-, 90- and 180-day moving window, and the spatiotemporal evolution of the DWTEs' frequency, duration, and magnitude are explored. The potential influence of large-scale climate oscillations, including the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) on the magnitude of DWTEs at the 30-day scale was assessed using Bayesian quantile regression. The results reveal (1) Extreme dry events were more prevalent and intense in the southern coastal area, whereas extreme wet events occurred predominantly and were more intense in the northern area. (2) High-frequency, high-magnitude DWTEs occurred along the coast at all time scales, and as the time scale increased, events with short duration shifted from the coast to the inland region. At the 30- and 90-day time scales, frequency generally decreased while magnitude increased, with the duration shortening in most regions. This indicates that the risk of DWTEs at short time scales has intensified over the past 60 years. (3) Strong large-scale climate oscillations significantly affected the DWTEs' magnitude. The NAO primarily impacted inland area, whereas ENSO and PDO exerted stronger influences on coastal area."

 The formation and scavenging of secondary aerosol under extremely high humidity conditions (relative humidity >80 %) remained as an issue in subtropical urban areas. In order to evaluate the effects of aqueous-phase oxidation and wet removal on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) composition and dynamics, a field campaign, which mainly used a time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ToF-ACSM) to characterized the non-refractory PM2.5 (NR-PM2.5) composition, was carried out during autumn fog-rain periods (FRPs) in Chongqing, Southwestern China. The chemical composition of PM2.5 was characterized, and the factors impacting SOA formation were analyzed. The effects of regional transport on SOA were also investigated. The results showed that SOA, which included less oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (LO-OOA) and more oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA), dominated OA, contributing 80 % to total OA and 36 % to PM2.5. LO-OOA and MO-OOA concentrations increased with liquid water content (LWC) and oxidant levels (Ox), indicating aqueous-phase and photochemical pathways jointly promoted SOA formation. Compared to PreFRPs and PostFRPs, MO-OOA concentration decreased by 62 % and 1 % during FRPs, highlighting efficient wet scavenging. Notably, SOA exhibited higher removal efficiency than primary organic aerosol (POA), and MO-OOA tended to be more easily scavenged by fog and rain droplets than LO-OOA. Diurnal O/C ratios revealed enhanced nighttime oxidation under high humidity, while backward trajectories identified southern Chongqing as a key SOA source region. This study quantified the distinct scavenging efficiencies and formation processes of MO-OOA and LO-OOA under fog-rain conditions, bridging gaps in understanding SOA evolution in subtropical high-humidity environments."

 This study presents a comparative analysis of the regional climate models COSMO-CLM (CCLM) and ICON-CLM (ICLM) over Italy, focusing on the year 2023. Given the widespread use of the high-resolution dataset VHR-REA_IT, produced by downscaling ERA5 reanalysis with CCLM at ~2.2 km over Italy, and the transition from CCLM to ICLM within the scientific communities (as the Consortium for Small-Scale Modelling COSMO and Climate Limited-area Modelling CLM), this work aims to assess the added value of using ICLM at convection-permitting scale over Italy during the recent impactful year 2023. Evaluation results and objective metrics, highlight a reduction in the warm bias of ICLM compared to CCLM with respect to the E-OBS gridded observation dataset, especially during the warmer months. Although CCLM shows a general good performance, ICLM improves the representation of daily accumulated precipitation in spring over territories with a complex orography and reduces the bias of wind speeds. Also, the diurnal cycles are generally improved. The ICLM added value is further proven by the analyses focusing on impactful events (two flooding events, a heatwave and a windstorm) hitting the Emilia-Romagna region during the year 2023. The evaluation indicates a general good agreement of ICLM outputs with gridded observations, supporting its adoption for future high-resolution downscaling reanalysis over Italy."

 A self-organizing map (SOM) was employed to classify extreme precipitation events (EPEs) in Pakistan into six types with distinct characteristics and spatial distributions. Types P1–P3 were concentrated in the southern regions and types P4–P6 were concentrated in the northern regions. We further illuminated the multiscale interaction mechanisms involved in the development of key synoptic systems that generate the six types of EPEs (P1–P6). Cross-scale transfers of kinetic energy (KE) and available potential energy (APE) occurred in P1, resulting in baroclinic and barotropic instability in the basic- and intraseasonal-scale windows. The development of an anticyclonic anomaly over western Russia and the South Asian High (SAH) anticyclone system led to the most intense and protracted EPEs. P2 was characterized by a cyclonic anomaly over western Russia and anticyclonic anomalies over Central Asia and eastern Russia, persisting over local areas in the original and intraseasonal-scale fields to promote the synoptic transient wave train activity. The basic scale being dominant in the baroclinic instability led to the westward shift of the EPEs. The SAH and an active synoptic cyclonic dominated P3, with convergence and diabatic heating, which intensified the EPEs. Although the distributions and driving mechanisms of P4–P6 differed, their energy flows were similar to those of P3, dominated by synoptic-scale spatial transport and diabatic heating. Notably, the intraseasonal-scale baroclinic instability occurred in P6, leading to the most frequent EPEs. Our study investigates the multiscale dynamic mechanisms of EPEs, providing valuable insights for advancing its understanding and prediction in Pakistan."

 Changes in Arctic sea ice have been shown to affect the climatic variability of the Tibetan Plateau (TP), but it remains unclear whether this Arctic-TP link has been stable over the past century. Using multiple reanalysis datasets (1900–2021), we found an interdecadal reversal in the relationship between winter Barents-Kara Sea ice concentration (BKSIC) and TP surface air temperature (TPSAT). In response to BKSIC loss, an out-of-phase pattern of “warm Arctic-cold TP” occurred during 1950–1975 (P1), while an in-phase pattern of “warm Arctic-warm TP” occurred during 1985–2021 (P2). The reversal of the BKSIC-TPSAT link is associated with changes in the position and strength of the subpolar and subtropical jet streams and quasi-stationary Rossby waves. During P1, the TPSAT was influenced by two distinct zonally oriented wave trains, associated with sea ice loss over the Greenland-Barents Kara Seas, the negative phase of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), and the positive phase of the Arctic Oscillation (AO). The north branch of the wave train propagates eastward along the intensified subpolar jet stream, while the south branch of the wave train originated from the North Atlantic and propagates eastward through the subtropical jet stream into the southern TP. In contrast, during P2, prominent BKSIC loss with positive AMO leads to a weakened subpolar jet stream, which favors the meridional propagation of the wave train into the southern TP. This study highlights the potential role of BKSIC in driving differing TP atmospheric thermal conditions in the context of distinct AMO phases."

 The occurrence of severe convective weather (SCW) often poses significant threats to socio-economic stability and public safety. Monitoring the evolution of convective clouds can provide critical support for timely severe weather warnings. We utilize Himawari-8/9 geostationary satellite imagery to identify severe convective clouds (SCCs) within large-scale regions through a multi-threshold sliding window (MTSW) algorithm, with validation using ground-based radar reflectivity data and real-world weather cases. Additionally, 507 SCW events were analyzed using Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) datasets to investigate their relationship with the identified 12,177 SCCs. Finally, deep learning methods were further introduced to explore the quantitative correlation between SCCs and SCW. Key findings include: (1) Strong consistency between satellite-identified SCCs and high-reflectivity zones observed by ground-based radar; (2) The algorithm effectively detects convective clouds at various developmental stages, achieving an identification accuracy of 85 %; (3) Spatiotemporal analysis reveals that more than 90 % of severe convective weather (SCW) occurs within the coverage of SCCs and a 40 km buffer zone surrounding their boundaries, although the presence of SCCs does not necessarily lead to SCW; (4) By applying deep learning, the model attained a mean Intersection over Union (MIoU) score of 78 % in segmenting severe convective weather within SCCs.

 This study uses ground hail reports in the United States and Global Precipitation Measurement Core Observatory data from 2014 to 2022 to analyze the spatiotemporal evolutions of precipitation microphysical parameters (mass-weighted mean diameter (Dm), and generalized intercept parameter (Nw)) and its relationship with convective parameters during the two hours around hail. The results indicate that at 3 km above ground level, the regions with large raindrops, high reflectivity (Ze), high storm height and strong updrafts moved from northwest to southeast, indicating a typical hailstorm movement pattern. Vertically, the variations of Ze and Dm correlate well with their spatiotemporal variability at the 3 km. Regardless of altitude, Dm and Ze exhibited higher values in the northwestern sector prior to hail report time, while higher values shifted to the southeastern sector post-hail. Notably, Nw showed minimal temporal differences below 5 km, whereas above 5 km pre-hail Nw values were lower compared to post-hail. This suggests that different microphysical processes of precipitation particles may occur across different time periods and regions. Convective precipitation in hailstorm was primarily influenced by the collision-coalescence process, while stratiform precipitation primarily involved both break-up and collision-coalescence processes. Meanwhile, the height of 20/40 dBZ echo top (HT20/40) revealed nonlinear relationship with microphysical parameters. For example, the Dm at 3 km increased with HT40 when HT40 is less than 6 km, but changed a little when HT40 is larger than 6 km. These findings provide new insights into the microphysical processes surrounding hailstorms and contribute to improving hail prediction models."

 Vertical wind shear frequently occurs in complex terrain (basin and sloped terrain). However, compared with thermodynamic (temperature inversion) variables, the modulation of dynamic (wind shear) variables on air pollution is poorly understood due to scarce in-situ observations at complex terrain. In order to reveal the issues, we conducted the first collaborative field experiment of Boundary-Layer Meteorology and Pollution at western Sichuan Basin (BLMP-SCB) at a rural site from December 2018 to January 2019. A clockwise turning of the wind with the height was more frequent, especially for the rotation smaller than 20 degrees, which corresponded to the heavy air pollution near the ground surface. The surface heavy air pollution was jointly influenced by both low-level wind-directional shear and speed shear above that layer, especially the configuration of southeasterly winds below 1.0 km above sea level (regional transport) and increased southwesterly winds with height above the height (subsidence motion). The elevated wind-directional shear enhanced mechanical turbulence to transport downwards secondary pollutants to upper atmospheric boundary layer from the higher layer of air. The increased wind speed with height more easily triggered subsidence motion to trap more pollutants inside the basin. The work was helpful for fully understanding the role of meteorological variables in the formation and development of heavy air pollution at complex terrain, which will be favorable for making targeted pollution prevention and control measures at complex terrain."

 Climate change has intensified extreme droughts and strong winds in arid and semi-arid regions, accelerating soil wind erosion, dust emissions, and related environmental problems. Wind is the primary driver of soil wind erosion, with both speed and cumulative duration determining the intensity of the erosion process. Accurately characterizing regional wind speed and its cumulative duration is therefore essential for understanding the spatial distribution of soil wind erosion. Previous studies have mainly relied on weather station observations; however, their limited coverage, low temporal resolution and uneven spatial distribution have introduced significant uncertainties in regional assessments. To address these limitations, long-term reanalysis wind speed datasets have been developed, though their accuracy still needs further evaluation. In this paper, wind speed data from weather stations and from the ERA5-Land reanalysis product in the wind erosion region of northern China were collected to develop a predictive model for cumulative wind speed hours above the 5 m/s threshold, based on the XGBoost method combined with SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis. The results showed that, compared to the cumulative wind speed hours derived from the ERA5-Land product, the model predictions more closely aligned with corresponding weather station measurements. Across different months, the explained variance for cumulative wind speed hours in the test set increased from an initial range of 10–53 % to 60–75 %, accompanied by reductions in mean absolute error (MAE) by 0.15–0.67 h and root mean square error (RMSE) by 1.11–2.14 h. The model also performed well in both cross-time and cross-location applications, explaining 72 % of the variation in cumulative wind speed hours in the validation set. This outperformed the ERA5-Land product, which accounted for only 59 % of the variation, and significantly reduced the associated prediction errors. The constructed XGBoost model was further used to simulate the cumulative wind speed hours in the study region in 2020.

 Autumn in Korea, following the peak rainy season in summer, is of a great importance as it coincides with the intensive harvesting of crops and fruits. Hence, autumn rainfall critically affects agricultural production in Korea. This study shows the emergence of new rainfall peaks in autumn, leading to potentially significant agricultural damages. In the monthly period from September 10 to October 10, the total rainfall in the recent period (150 mm for 1998–2023) has increased by 44 mm compared to the previous period (106 mm for 1979–1997), averaged over 61 stations. Heavy rainfall days (≥ 100 mm day−1) have also occurred more frequently. The most plausible mechanism for these changes is the delayed retreat of the western North Pacific subtropical high in autumn which results in westward shift of tropical cyclone (TC) tracks and increased number of days on which Korea is affected by TCs. In addition, rising sea surface temperatures (0.5–1.0°C) in the western North Pacific and the South China Sea appear to be related to increased TC-induced heavy rainfall in Korea. Enhanced low-level moisture transports from these warm oceanic areas toward Korea, combined with upper-level wind divergence, are likely to have intensified the conditions for the TC-induced heavy rainfall. This study highlights the need for further research and public awareness of the changing autumn rainfall patterns and their impacts on agriculture and infrastructure."

 Heatwaves are documented to exert significant impacts on both ecosystems and human societies. Ground-based observation of temperature could provide fundamental data to acquire heatwave characteristics like intensity, frequency and duration, but are challenging to get information about event-based spatial area. Meanwhile, Spatial and temporal gaps in observational heatwave records also receive increasing attention, but quantitative approaches remain lacking. Here we use the high-resolution air temperatures from the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset (0.1° × 0.1) from 1950 to 2024, to acquire spatial scale of heatwave events using a spatiotemporally contiguous events tracking method. We compare spatial scale of heatwaves and the average distance of weather station network, which depicts the density, to address whether the station network is sufficient to capture heatwaves. The representativeness ratio was introduced as a metric describing how well the network density at a station captures nearby heatwave events in a given summer. We find the heatwaves at smaller scale (< 100 km) exhibit significant increase from 1950 to 2024, especially at nighttime. Meanwhile, there has been a continuously increase in the spatial density of worldwide weather stations. The coupling of these two trends drives spatially heterogeneous temporal evolutions of representativeness ratios in regional networks. The contiguous United States and Europe have consistently maintained high representativeness ratio (> 80 %), while some regions in South America and Africa exhibited poor representativeness ratio in the 1850s (< 20 %) but show significant improvement in recent periods (> 60 %). In these regions, the temporal changes in representativeness ratio may lead to overestimation of observed trends of heatwaves."

 The increasing demand for freshwater resources has intensified interest in precipitation enhancement technologies, particularly in arid and semi-arid regions such as the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Traditional cloud seeding methods that utilize crewed aircrafts have limitations in terms of safety, cost, and operational flexibility. Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) offer promising complementary platforms by providing enhanced maneuverability, reduced risks, and cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, UAS can gather in situ high-resolution atmospheric data that are currently inaccessible via remote sensing techniques or crewed aircraft. This article provides a detailed introduction, history of UAS usage, and recent advancements in small UAS for cloud seeding, as well as presents the impacts, challenges, and future prospects. It then examines the different types of aircraft used for cloud seeding and discusses their specifications, functions, and sensors, as well as their pros and cons. Subsequently, it provides a comprehensive analysis of the small UAS used for precipitation enhancement, focusing on the types of small UAS suitable for cloud seeding, onboard equipment and sensors, ground station equipment and software, communication protocols, and methodologies, such as cloud seedability algorithms (CSA), path planning, and control autonomy. The integration of the Rapid Evaluation of Convective Cell Environments for Seeding (RECCES) algorithm built on top of the Lidar Radar Open Software Environment (LROSE) is also discussed for real-time cloud data acquisition and analysis, which are important for UAS cloud seeding missions. Advanced control-and-command communication systems between the UAS and ground stations are discussed, along with the regulatory requirements of the UAS for cloud seeding. The advantages, advancements, and challenges of UAS in precipitation enhancement are highlighted, and future prospects such as swarm technology, advanced sensor integration, centralized autonomy, de-icing technology, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning, regulatory framework development, and environmental and ethical considerations are proposed in detail to pave the way for more efficient and effective UAS-based precipitation enhancement for cloud seeding operations."

In this study, we developed global maps of soil carbon change that reveal carbon gains and losses with forestation, primarily in the topsoil. Constraining land availability to avoid unintended albedo-induced warming and safeguard water and biodiversity (389 million hectares available for forestation globally) would sequester 39.9 petagrams of carbon by 2050, substantially below previous estimates.

Bison stabilized net aboveground production while accelerating nitrogen turnover, increasing aboveground nitrogen pools while carbon pools remained stable, which improved landscape nutritional quality. Effects were strongest in wet, nutrient-rich habitats that received higher bison densities and grazing than is recommended in rangeland management, while soil and plant conditions suggested landscape resilience.

The effectiveness and sustainability of these CDR approaches depend on the persistence of added alkalinity, since exceeding certain Ω-thresholds for a given water composition may lead to carbonates formation, causing the loss of previously added alkalinity. In this research, stability of alkalinity was tested using incubation experiments with Elbe estuary freshwater from two seasons (March and August). Alkalinity was increased up to 4000 μmol kgw−1, with varying salinity from 0 to 16. This study shows that the stability of alkalinity depends on the presence and quantity of suspended particles, seasonality of water chemistry, and salinity. Based on the experimental data, the Elbe estuary may take up additional alkalinity in the freshwater part, corresponding to ∼3.0 MtCO2 yr−1 being transported towards the North Sea. Estimates of alkalinity additions from the 1970s to 2010s show a decreasing potential due to changes in pCO2 and pH. The upper geochemical limit for transporting additional alkalinity through estuarine systems serves as a critical boundary.

During this period, firms create value across a broad set of products related to hardware, software, and services. We conceptualize this as a nascent value chain, operationalize this concept by identifying a set of product clusters, and explore the patterns of innovation within and across them. Specifically, we analyze 14 climate-tech sectors using a dataset of 12 929 early-stage private investments in 3662 North American firms between 2006 and 2021. Descriptions of these firms reveal that innovation occurs in five distinct product clusters across the value chain. Within this dataset, only 15% of firms develop end products (i.e., downstream products bought by consumers), while 59% support these end products through components, manufacturing processes, or optimization products, and 26% develop business services. The temporal evolution of investments in these product clusters reveals three patterns of innovation among climate-tech sectors: maturing innovation (e.g., energy efficiency), characterized by coalescence around the dominant design of an end product with an increasing share of investments in optimization and services; ongoing innovation (e.g., energy storage), characterized by multiple waves of investments in evolving products enabled by flexible policy frameworks; and emerging innovation (e.g., agriculture), characterized by recent growth in investments across most product clusters and spillovers from other sectors. These patterns of innovation indicate ways that firms can add value to new climate-tech as it develops from the formative phase to the growth phase. An understanding of nascent value chains can inform policy design that supports climate-tech scaling by identifying underfunded product clusters and supporting development of a full value chain rather than only end products."

While conventional wisdom holds that oxidation is slow under these conditions, field measurements find oxidized products in particles. To explore this, we measured oxidants in aqueous extracts of winter particles from Fairbanks. We find high concentrations of oxidants during illumination experiments, indicating that particle photochemistry can be significant even in high latitudes during winter. 
 Subarctic cities notoriously experience severe winter pollution episodes with fine particle (PM2.5) concentrations above 35 µg m−3, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) 24 h standard. While winter sources of primary particles in Fairbanks, Alaska, have been studied, the chemistry driving secondary particle formation is elusive. Biomass burning is a major source of wintertime primary particles, making the PM2.5 rich in light-absorbing brown carbon (BrC). When BrC absorbs sunlight, it produces photooxidants – reactive species potentially important for secondary sulfate and secondary organic aerosol formation – yet photooxidant measurements in high-latitude PM2.5 remain scarce. During the winter of 2022 Alaskan Layered Pollution And Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) field campaign in Fairbanks, we collected PM filters, extracted the filters into water, and exposed the extracts to simulated sunlight to characterize the production of three photooxidants: oxidizing triplet excited states of BrC, singlet molecular oxygen, and hydroxyl radical. Next, we used our measurements to model photooxidant production in highly concentrated aerosol liquid water. While conventional wisdom indicates photochemistry is limited during high-latitude winters, we find that BrC photochemistry is significant: we predict high triplet and singlet oxygen daytime particle concentrations up to 2×10-12 and 3×10-11 M, respectively, with moderate hydroxyl radical concentrations up to 5×10-15 M. Although our modeling predicts that triplets account for 0.4 %–10 % of daytime secondary sulfate formation, particle photochemistry cumulatively dominates, generating 76 % of daytime secondary sulfate formation, largely due to in-particle hydrogen peroxide, which contributes 25 %–54 %. Finally, we estimate triplet production rates year-round, revealing the highest rates in late winter when Fairbanks experiences severe pollution and in summer when wildfires generate BrC."

 The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the Roof of the World and the Water Tower of Asia, has the largest number of lakes in the world, and, because of its high altitude and the near absence of disturbances by human activity, the plateau has long been an important site for studying global climate change.  Hydrological stations cannot be readily set up in this region, and in situ gauge data are not always publicly accessible. Satellite radar altimetry has become a very important alternative to in situ observations as a source of data.  Estimation of the water levels of lakes via radar altimetry is often limited by temporal and spatial coverage, and, therefore, multi-altimeter data are often used to monitor lake levels. Restricted by the accuracy of waveform processing and the interval period between different altimetry missions, the accuracy and the sampling frequency of the water level series are typically low. By processing and merging data from eight different altimetry missions (Envisat, ICESat-1, CryoSat-2, Jason-1, Jason-2, Jason-3, SARAL, and Sentinel-3A), the developed datasets provided the water level changes for 361 lakes (larger than 10 km2) on the TP from 2002 to 2021 (181 lakes for the time series from 2002 to 2021 and 180 lakes for the time series from 2010 to 2021). The lake level change series shows good consistency with in situ measurements, demonstrating a median root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.19 m across eight validation gauges. The dataset further exhibits robust agreement with established satellite altimetry products (DAHITI, Hydroweb, and G-REALM), with median RMSE values below 0.30 m in all cross-validation comparisons. The present datasets and associated approaches are valuable for calculating the changes in lake storage, trend analyses of the lake levels, short-term monitoring of the overflow of lakes and flooding disasters on the plateau, and the relationships between changes in the lake ecosystems and changes in the water resources.

However, debris data are scarce. We present the Debris Database (DebDaB), a database of debris thickness and physical properties of debris, with data from 84 glaciers in 13 global glacier regions compiled from 172 sources and including previously unpublished data. DebDaB serves as an open central repository for the scientific community to do research on debris-covered glaciers. 
 Rocky debris covers around 7.3 % of the global glacier area, influencing ice melt rates and the surface mass balance of glaciers, making the dynamics and hydrology of debris-covered glaciers distinct from those of clean-ice glaciers. Accurate representation of debris in models is challenging, as measurements of the physical properties and thickness of the supraglacial debris layer are scarce. Here, we compile a database of  measured and reported bulk physical properties and layer thicknesses of supraglacial debris that we call the supraglacial Debris Database (DebDaB) and that is open to community submissions. The majority of the database (90 %) is compiled from 172 sources in the literature, and the remaining 10 % was previously unpublished. DebDaB contains 8741 data entries for supraglacial debris layer thickness, of which 1770 entries also include sub-debris ablation rates, 179 thermal conductivity of debris, 160 aerodynamic surface roughness length, 79 debris albedo, 59 debris emissivity, and 37 debris porosity. The data are distributed over 84 glaciers in 13 regions in the Global Terrestrial Network for Glaciers. We show regional differences in the distribution of debris thickness measurements in DebDaB and fit simplified Østrem curves to 19 glaciers with sufficient debris thickness and ablation data. The data in DebDaB can be used for energy balance, melt, and surface mass balance studies by incorporating site-specific debris properties or for evaluation of remote sensing estimates of debris thickness and surface roughness. They can also help future field campaigns on debris-covered glaciers by identifying observation gaps. DebDaB's uneven spatial coverage points to sampling biases in community efforts to observe debris-covered glaciers, with some regions (e.g. central Europe and South Asia) well-sampled but others having gaps with prevalent debris (e.g. the Andes and Alaska). Debris thickness measurements are mostly concentrated at lower elevations, leaving higher-elevation debris-covered areas undersampled and suggesting that our knowledge of debris properties might not be representative of all elevations. The aims of DebDaB, as an openly available dataset, are to evolve over time, to be updated, and to add to community submissions as new data on supraglacial properties become available.

We present a large global dataset of images and information collected from 2008 to 2018 using specialized underwater camera (UVP). This publicly available dataset will support more accurate ecological models and help train artificial intelligence tools, improving how scientists track ocean biodiversity and monitor environmental changes. 
 Plankton and detritus are essential components of the Earth’s oceans influencing biogeochemical cycles and carbon sequestration. Climate change impacts their composition and marine ecosystems as a whole. To improve our understanding of these changes, standardized observation methods and integrated global datasets are needed to enhance the accuracy of ecological and climate models. Here, we present a global dataset for plankton and detritus obtained by two versions of the Underwater Vision Profiler 5 (UVP5). This release contains the images classified in 33 homogenized categories, as well as the metadata associated with them, reaching 3,114 profiles and ca. 8 million objects acquired between 2008–2018 at global scale. The geographical distribution of the dataset is unbalanced, with the Equatorial region (30° S – 30° N) being the most represented, followed by the high latitudes in the northern hemisphere and lastly the high latitudes in the Southern Hemisphere. Detritus is the most abundant category in terms of concentration (90 %) and biovolume (95 %), although its classification in different morphotypes is still not well established. Copepoda was the most abundant taxa within the plankton, with Trichodesmium colonies being the second most abundant. The two versions of UVP5 (SD and HD) have different imagers, resulting in a different effective size range to analyse plankton and detritus from the images (HD objects >600 µm, SD objects >1 mm) and morphological properties (grey levels, etc.) presenting similar patterns, although the ranges may differ. Therefore, recommendations are provided for the appropriate use of this data when conducting studies. A large number of images of plankton and detritus will be collected in the future by the UVP5, and the public availability of this dataset will help it being utilized as a training set for machine learning and being improved by the scientific community. This will reduce uncertainty by classifying previously unclassified objects and expand the classification categories, ultimately enhancing biodiversity quantification.

 A new version of an internal solitary wave (ISW) model, Internal Solitary Wave Numerical Model-Northern South China Sea version 2.0 (ISWNM-NSCS v2.0), is presented. Background currents and horizontally inhomogeneous stratifications are implemented in ISWNM-NSCS v2.0 to better reproduce ISW properties, including arrival time, mode-1 wave amplitude, wave-induced velocity, characteristic half-width, and propagation direction. Optimized viscosity and diffusivity coefficients (i.e., 1.0 × 10−2 m2 s−1 in the horizontal and 1.0 × 10−5 m2 s−1 in the vertical) are also introduced to maintain stable stratifications within the model domain, thereby prolonging the model's valid forecasting period. A mooring station around the Dongsha Atoll is used for model evaluation and numbers of sensitivity experiments are implemented to illustrate the individual effect of the major updates. In comparison with ISWFM-NSCS v1.0, ISWNM-NSCS v2.0 significantly enhances model accuracy in forecasting ISW characteristics, with a 37 % improvement in arrival time, a 34 % improvement in mode-1 wave amplitude, a 25 % improvement in wave-induced velocity, and an 85 % improvement in half-width."

Assessing the toxic effects of the LCM mixture and individual components is critical for risk evaluation. Organoid models, characterized by highly biomimetic crypt-villus structures and cellular heterogeneity, serve as the preferred in vitro platforms for risk assessments. Our results reveal that exposure to the LCM mixture inhibits organoid expansion rates and induces abnormal crypt branching. Specifically, four machine learning models predicted that 4-cyano-4′-ethoxybiphenyl (EBCN) significantly contributes to intestinal toxicity. Exposure to EBCN alone reduces the proportion of viable cells, impairs intestinal barrier function, and disrupts stem cell homeostasis. Specifically, upregulated expression of the intestinal stem cell marker olfactomedin 4 (OLFM4) aligns with molecular signatures of inflammatory bowel disease patients in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) data set. Additionally, the application of the Adverse Outcome Pathway framework identifies complement component C3 as the initial event, with downstream immunosuppression mediating EBCN-induced intestinal toxicity. In conclusion, this study highlights potential adverse effects of LCMs on gut physiology and emphasizes the urgent need for comprehensive health risk assessments for both the LCM mixture and individual LCM constituents."

Experimental results and simulation studies unravel the formation of LSPR on the catalyst surface upon visible light irradiation, which promises the conversion of photon energy into localized heat, contributing to remarkable catalytic performance and high utilization rate of H2O2 (40%) in Fenton-like reaction. Achieving comparable Fenton-like activity is possible only when the catalytic system is subjected to energy-intensive heating at 80 °C, highlighting the feasibility of the LSPR effect initiated at an ambient condition with mild light irradiation. The Fenton-like system also comes with superior catalytic performance and appreciable durability in a continuous-flow reactor, as reflected by the 100% degradation efficiency over consecutive operation.

Herein, we demonstrated, for the first time, the dechlorination of Cl-PFAS by nanoscale zerovalent iron (nZVI), and we revealed that such dechlorination can induce indirect defluorination when Cl is substituted at the middle of the perfluorocarbon chain. The carbanion (−⊖CF–CF2−), generated via two successive single-electron transfer steps, is the key intermediate enabling defluorination through β-elimination of F– to form alkenyl products (−CF═CF−). The extent of defluorination was governed by the competitive reactivity with proton abstraction of carbanion to form hydrogenolysis products (−HCF–CF2−). Through this novel pathway, an indirect defluorination of up to 25.3% was achieved for the investigated polychlorofluorocarboxylic acids within 120 h using nZVI. The reactivity for dechlorination at varying positions and subsequent β-elimination of F– can be theoretically described using dissociative electron transfer and transition state theories, respectively. The lack of defluorination in ωCl-PFAS was attributed to the much higher activation energy required for β-elimination from the carbanion (⊖CF2–CF2−) compared with proton abstraction. The alignment of theoretical calculations with experimental results provides a theoretical framework to predict dechlorination and defluorination reactivity of Cl-PFAS, facilitating the design of rapidly degradable alternatives."

The obtained catalyst demonstrates significantly enhanced catalytic activity, durability, and stability for C3H6-SCR across a broad temperature range compared to conventional Ag/Al2O3. The incorporation of TiO2 strengthens the Ag-support interaction through facilitating electron transfer from Ag to the TiO2/Al2O3 support, leading to the formation of highly dispersed Agnδ+ clusters as the dominant active species. Mechanistic studies reveal that Agnδ+ clusters effectively accelerate the partial oxidation of C3H6 to reactive enolic species, which in turn trigger a new pathway for NOx reduction via the formation of –CN intermediates. This change in reaction mechanism induced by TiO2 modification was also confirmed by a lower activation energy barrier for NOx reduction compared to that of Ag/Al2O3. By simultaneously optimizing both the density of active sites and their intrinsic reactivity, this approach delivers a substantial enhancement in C3H6-SCR performance, offering new insights into catalyst design for hydrocarbon-SCR applications."

However, quantifying the energy consumed by major dissipative processes remains a challenge. In this study, we investigate energy partitioning during laboratory earthquakes (“lab‐quakes”) by performing general shear stick‐slip experiments on synthetic granitic cataclasites at elevated confining pressure. Using ultrasound, microstructural, and novel magnetism‐based thermal analyses, we independently quantified the energy allocated to seismic radiation, new surfaces, and heat dissipation. These estimates showed good agreement with far‐field measurements of mechanical work during the lab‐quake. Our findings revealed that under the experimental conditions the majority of the released energy (68%–98%) is dissipated as heat, while seismic radiation accounts for 1%–8%, and the creation of new surfaces consumes <1%–32%. Microstructural observations indicate pre‐failure deformation, which includes comminution and development of the principal slip zone, significantly influences energy partitioning. This effect is further evident in the measured shear stress drops, where events with higher stress drops proportionally emitted more energy as seismic waves. This study is the first to constrain the full energy budget of lab‐quakes from an observational standpoint, providing critical insights into the dynamics of fault rupture and energy dissipation processes."

However, in Cascadia, the absence of recent megathrust events limits available seismic evidence. Tectonic tremors occurring downdip of the megathrust provide valuable insights into stress accumulation and propagation and can help constrain stress states and rheology. We build upon a previous method to extract tremor migrations in a large catalog of ∼330,000 tremors, addressing location errors and temporal resolution of the catalog, which are particularly crucial for this region. The spatiotemporally dense tremor activity identified by our improved method, along with the greatly increased number of extracted migrations (∼13,700), facilitates a more quantitative analysis. Our findings suggest that tremor migration is primarily controlled by stress diffusion in a medium exhibiting viscous behavior rather than fluid diffusion. The observed relationship between migration speed and duration implies a diffusivity of 103–105 m2/s, and aligns with a simple model indicating an approximately 30‐km‐wide zone of slow slip and tremor propagation. Additionally, we identify three along‐strike barriers to tremor migrations, consistent with previously identified segments persisting from shallow to deep. Notably, the barrier near 48.5°N consistently decelerates, terminates, or initiates large tremor episodes, likely due to geometric distortions, including flattening and bending of the slab. In contrast, a barrier near 42.5°N abruptly halts migrations and accumulates stress, but can be breached by sufficient stress perturbation. Thus, tremor migrations can constrain geometric segmentation and diffusive behavior of tremorgenic regions from a dynamic perspective."

We attribute the long‐term evolution of mudstone K/Al to the competing weathering inputs between continents and seafloor. Much of pre‐Phanerozoic mudstone is characterized by high K/Al relative to continents, indicating low weathering input of K and Al from continents relative to the hydrothermal input of K from seafloor alteration to the global sedimentary mud reservoir. A quantitative assessment indicates over one order of magnitude increase of weathering partition into continents during the Phanerozoic. The Phanerozoic onset of massive continental weathering reflects a fundamental evolution on the Earth's surface linked to an interactive feedback network consists of mountain building, atmospheric oxygenation, and land plant colonization."

Using historical ocean data, Deep Argo observations, and atmospheric reanalysis, we assess the residual of this balance—water mass volume trends—and its role in the transformation budget of the Subpolar North Atlantic and Nordic Seas on interannual to bidecadal timescales. On long timescales, volume trends in deep convective seas can be large but the volume expansion or contraction of the upper and lower AMOC limbs remain minimal, suggesting that water mass transformation and AMOC intensity may be interchangeable. Conversely, interannual trends are larger across all regions and all density ranges. The volume of the AMOC limbs is significantly impacted so relationships with transformation rates can only be established when considering the timescales of the southward export of transformed water masses out of the subpolar domain."

To that end, we perform coherence analysis on time series of ocean heat transport, AMOC strength, and Arctic climate metrics across a large number of models from the CMIP6 ensemble.

However, our results do not support the narrative that heat transport anomalies at lower latitudes propagate northward toward the Arctic.

We propose a Bayesian hierarchical model for the simultaneous estimation of a target reconstruction season and reconstruction of local climate. We estimate the target reconstruction season through the introduction of latent monthly weights, whose priors can be adjusted to reflect expert knowledge. Model behavior is explored using pseudoproxy experiments and applications to tree‐ring chronologies with known seasonal biases.

 Vascular calcification, a key risk factor for cardiovascular diseases, is driven by the phenotypic transition of vascular smooth muscle cells from a contractile to an osteogenic phenotype. NEXN, a protein highly associated with heart function, has also been implicated as a potential susceptibility factor in the development of coronary artery disease, but its role in the progression of vascular calcification remains unclear. In this study, multi-transcriptomics analysis and various animal models of male mice were used to explore the cell-specific roles and molecular mechanisms of NEXN in vascular calcification. Here, we show that vascular smooth muscle cell-specific NEXN knockout exacerbates calcification, while NEXN overexpression alleviates it. Mechanistically, NEXN interacts with SERCA2, enhancing its SUMOylation, stability, and function, thereby protecting against calcification.

 In solids, the crystal field couples the electronic orbital degree of freedom to the lattice. This coupling suggests that an excitation of lattice dynamics could trigger the dynamics of orbital angular momentum of electrons, thereby generating orbital currents—a flow of electronic orbital angular momentum. However, the interplay between orbital currents and lattice dynamics has been elusive. Here, we report the observation of the acoustic orbital Hall effect, demonstrating the generation of orbital currents by lattice dynamics. By investigating the acoustoelectric properties of Ti/Ni bilayers induced by surface acoustic waves (SAWs), we demonstrate the generation of an orbital current polarized transverse to the SAW propagation direction. This phenomenon is reminiscent of the electric orbital Hall effect, which generates an orbital current polarized transverse to an applied electric field. We also show that acoustically driven ferromagnetic resonance generates an orbital current in the Ti/Ni bilayer, demonstrating acoustic orbital pumping.

 Large floods, which affect multiple regions simultaneously, pose substantial risks to lives and economies. In a warmer climate, increased precipitation extremes and reduced snowmelt are expected to alter flood characteristics, but how the dynamics of large floods across Europe will evolve under climate change remains unclear. By jointly assessing projected changes in the timing, spatial extent and volume of large floods in a warmer world, here we show that earlier snowmelt generally leads to earlier floods, while increasing precipitation contributions attenuate flood seasonality. Although continental-scale averages suggest limited change, they mask substantial regional heterogeneity. In western Europe, projected increases in heavy precipitation result in larger flood extents and volumes. In contrast, reduced snowmelt dominates changes in the largest floods in northern Europe, with localized shifts from snowmelt-driven to rainfall-driven floods. These regionally diverse responses of large floods to climate change should be considered in transnational flood risk management across Europe.

 Marine heatwaves, characterized by extremely high ocean temperatures, significantly impact marine ecosystems. To date, the vertical structure of phytoplankton responses to marine heatwaves remains poorly understood. Here we use 17 years of global profiles from Biogeochemical-Argo float data to show that marine heatwaves drive distinct phytoplankton responses at different depths, with subsurface signals sometimes stronger than surface ones. These responses are classified into intensified, weakened, and subsurface-reversed chlorophyll-a types, each showing distinct latitudinal patterns and driven by changes in light, temperature, and nutrient supply during marine heatwaves. Intensified responses dominate high latitudes, while weakened and subsurface-reversed responses are more common in mid-to-low latitudes. Marine heatwaves also promote the development of deep chlorophyll maxima and reshape subsurface chlorophyll-a distributions. Our findings highlight the critical role of vertical marine heatwaves in shaping phytoplankton dynamics and underscore the need for enhanced subsurface monitoring to better assess ecological and biogeochemical impacts under ocean warming.

The results indicated that the ground subsidence has partially compromised the flood protection capacity of rivers, elevating flood risk in this region by 28.24%. Additionally, the subsidence has also damaged the flood control dam, leading to a breach and a secondary flooding disaster. Our work demonstrates that it’s possible to characterize the inundation risk of large-scale subsidence funnels by spaceborne remote sensing in advance. This approach could enhance the capacity to cope with extreme weather events in similar ground subsidence regions worldwide. Ground subsidence partially compromised the flood protection capacity of rivers and damaged the flood control dam resulting in a 28% increase in flood risk and secondary flooding disaster in the Liaohe plain, China in 2022, according to a retrospective analysis of the disaster event and its impacts."

 Maritime activity in the Arctic is increasing, and climate change projections suggest that commercial vessels may soon have seasonal access to high-latitude waters. Accurate assessments of Arctic marine access are essential, yet the ability of climate models to reproduce historical navigability remains underassessed. Here, we show that the multi-model mean of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) underestimates overall Arctic navigability, despite capturing historical changes in summer navigable areas. Since the early 21st century, the multi-model mean underestimates the length of the shipping season in many regions of the Arctic Ocean, following a dipole-like pattern for moderately ice-strengthened vessels, with underestimates in the East Siberian and Laptev Seas, and overestimates in the Kara and Barents Seas. Moreover, inaccurate ice thickness simulations hinder the identification of trans-Arctic routes through the Northwest Passage. Improved simulation of ice concentration has a greater impact on assessing the length of the shipping season for ordinary ships, while improvements in ice thickness substantially improve the assessments for ice-strengthened ships. Better simulation of ice thickness is critical for accurately identifying trans-Arctic routes for both types of vessels.

 Gross Primary Productivity (GPP) estimates from terrestrial biosphere models (TBMs) are often uncertain due to limited constraints on vegetation biochemical and biophysical properties. Remote sensing offers promising opportunities to reduce these uncertainties, yet its full potential remains understudied. Here, we conducted model-data fusion experiments, including Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs), and Observing System Experiments (OSEs) at the Harvard Forest site, using the Terrestrial Ecosystem Carbon cycle simulator (TECs) with an embedded spectral invariant theory-based radiative transfer model. In OSSEs, we assimilated synthetic hyperspectral reflectance, multispectral reflectance, and Leaf Area Index (LAI) into TECs to evaluate their effect under the ideal conditions. In OSEs, we assimilated PRecursore IperSpettrale della Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) hyperspectral reflectance (620–1000 nm), MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) multispectral reflectance (broadband red and near-infrared), and MODIS-derived LAI to optimize model parameters, including several key vegetation traits such as leaf chlorophyll content (Cab), maximum carboxylation rate at 25 °C (Vcmax25), and LAI. Results show that hyperspectral reflectance consistently outperforms multispectral reflectance and LAI in improving GPP estimates and reducing uncertainties, with RMSE decreasing from 2.68 to 1.18 μmol CO₂ m−2 s−1 in OSSEs, and from 6.74 to 5.42 μmol CO₂ m−2 s−1 in OSEs. This is because hyperspectral information better constrains seasonal variations in canopy structure and Cab. Meanwhile, both hyperspectral and multispectral reflectance outperform LAI, with information from both canopy structural parameters and leaf biochemical properties, thus offering a joint constraint on GPP simulations. Our findings highlight that remotely sensed reflectance data, particularly hyperspectral reflectance, have great potential to improve photosynthesis modeling and reduce uncertainties in GPP estimates within TBMs."

 Effective policy to reduce urban air pollution requires the identification of appropriate solutions to achieve it. Where funding is limited, interventions should result from a previous analysis of strategic effectiveness. In this work, an air pollution forecasting system was used to assess the effectiveness of strategies for reducing emissions from domestic furnaces; the system facilitates forecasts of average hourly concentrations of pollutants, down to street scale (pedestrian level). The analysis was carried out for a city in which exceedances of the PM10 concentration are recorded, due to emissions from domestic furnaces burning solid fuels. A criterion for identification of local pollution hotspots was proposed, determined as part of the calculations for current emission data (base scenario). The effectiveness of four potential emission reduction scenarios was evaluated. The first two scenarios concern the elimination of a specific centile of the highest emitters among domestic furnaces. Two further scenarios included a reduction of the same total number of sources; however, the distance from the pollution hotspots areas identified in the baseline scenario was used as the emitter elimination selection criterion. The results indicate that for the study area the implementation of any of the scenarios considered would allow the elimination of all existing hotspot areas. Nevertheless, the results indicate variation in the effectiveness of individual scenarios on a city-wide scale in terms of the reduction in the number of exceedances of hourly and daily concentration limits, the impact on air quality and the population exposed to excessive levels."

 This study compares the performance of two versions of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Double-Moment 6-class (WDM6) microphysics scheme—one additionally incorporating the prognostic hail mixing ratio and the other additionally including the predicted graupel density—in terms of cloud morphology based on Contoured Frequency by Altitude Diagrams (CFADs) of radar reflectivity and simulated precipitation. The WDM6 scheme incorporating the predicted graupel density is based on the scheme of Park et al. (2024). The WDM6 scheme incorporating a hail category is newly developed in this study. The new hail properties include the size distribution, fall velocity–diameter relationships, mass–diameter relationships, and density with relevant hail microphysical processes. Thirteen precipitation events—including winter snowfall, summer rainfall, and hail—are evaluated to investigate the effect of the prognostic hail mixing ratio and predicted graupel density on the vertical distribution of radar reflectivity and simulated surface precipitation. The CFAD analysis reveals that, in most cases, the scheme with the predicted graupel density better simulates the reflectivity patterns compared with observational data, while the scheme with a hail category tends to overestimate the frequency of strong reflectivity due to the hail generation; additionally, the latter scheme simulates unrealistically high reflectivity of up to 60 dBZ. The analysis of vertical profiles of mixing ratios and associated microphysical processes indicates that, in the scheme incorporating the predicted graupel density, the reduction in the graupel mixing ratio is a key factor in improving the simulated radar reflectivity. Although the revised scheme incorporating the hail mixing ratio shows a reduction in the graupel mixing ratio, the incorporation of the hail mixing ratio leads to the overestimation of radar reflectivity compared to the observed values. These findings suggest that representing the properties of solid-phase hydrometeors is more important for simulating realistic vertical radar-reflectivity profiles, which implies the simulation of more realistic microphysical processes, than increasing the number of solid-phase hydrometeor categories."

 A total of 11,646 convection initiation (CI) events (CIEs) were identified during the warm seasons (May to September) from 2016 to 2020 in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River Basin (MR-YRB), using a CI identification method and composite reflectivity (CR) data. CI occurs more frequently in July and August, accounting for 62.7 % of the total CIEs, and predominantly between 11:00 to 16:00 Beijing Time (BJT), representing 62.2 % of the total CIEs. These events are distributed across different terrains, including mountains (elevations exceeding 400 m), foothills (elevations ranging from 100 to 400 m), and plains (elevations ranging from 0 to 100 m). The spatial distribution of high-frequency CIE regions is closely associated with mountains within the MR-YRB. Mountains experience twice as many CIEs as plains, even under conditions of weaker instability and vertical wind shear, although these events tend to be smaller and short-lived. In contrast, foothill CIEs exhibit the largest convective areas. A single peak in CI frequency occurs at noon (12:00–13:00 BJT) across all terrain types, coincides with the highest initiation elevations (400–600 m) and largest convective areas under conditions of maximum thermal instability. Heterogeneity in soil moisture (SM, 0–5 cm) and surface heat fluxes (SHF) has potential to play a crucial role in the triggering of noontime CIEs. Mountain CIEs exhibit the highest degree of heterogeneity. They typically occur in regions with higher SM than surrounding areas and proximity to areas with enhanced SHF. Higher SM may provide favorable conditions for CI by increasing low-level moisture and moist static energy at mountain CI sites. Pronounced SM heterogeneity may further promote CI by facilitating either latent or sensible heating processes, which can generate mesoscale thermal circulations in the vicinity of pronounced SM gradients."

Functional gain-/loss-of-function studies in murine kidney disease models demonstrated a substantial renoprotective function of tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR. Mechanistically, tRNA-Asp-GTC-3′tDR assembled stable G-quadruplex structures and sequestered pseudouridine synthase 7 (PUS7), preventing catalytic pseudouridylation of histone mRNAs. The resulting pseudouridylation deficiency directed histone mRNAs to the autophagosome-lysosome pathway, triggering RNA autophagy. This tDR-induced RNA autophagy pathway was activated during murine and human kidney diseases, suggesting clinical relevance.

This led to the hypothesis that the rise of vegetation triggered river meandering. Recent studies of barren, meandering rivers challenge this notion, but the Paleozoic shift in the geometry of river deposits remains unexplained. Here, we suggest that it occurred because vegetation changes how river bends move through space. Using satellite images to monitor river migration, we found that bank vegetation alters the orientation of point bar accretion, resulting in a 62% increase in the inferred variance of flow direction.

Besides the Immunoglobulin M (IgM) BCR, lymphoma cells can also express non–IgM (IgG) BCRs; however, the role of IgG BCRs in malignant B cell is not well understood. Here, we report poorer disease outcomes in diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) expressing high IgM versus those expressing IgG1. Using isogenic lymphoma cells expressing distinct BCRs, we found that IgM expressing cells strongly outcompete their IgG1 counterparts. Mechanistically, IgG1 BCR is associated with a dysfunctional mitochondrial state and reduced cell survival. We show that mitochondrial dysfunction is triggered by accentuated calcium responses downstream of IgG1 BCR. Genetic reversal of IgG1 to IgM, pharmacological dampening of calcium signaling, or treatment with interleukin-21 can correct mitochondrial defects and rescue IgG1 survival. Our findings demonstrate that distinct BCR isotypes are inherently unique and can differentially affect B cell lymphoma pathogenesis."

Here, we present a strategy for artificial antigen-directed immune labeling of bacteria, capitalizing on residual bacteriophage capsids on bacterial surfaces, which enable immune cells to achieve quicker bacterial recognition and clearance. Specifically, Mn2+@Man-phage anchored on bacterial surfaces and provided artificial recognition sites that enabled macrophages to phagocytize via mannose receptors, accompanied by enhanced bactericidal activity triggered by manganese ions in response to an infectious microenvironment. Moreover, immune labeling–activated macrophages enhanced antigen presentation at infection sites, further boosting specific T cell–mediated adaptive immune responses and infection eradication effects.

Some mutations impart a selective growth advantage to HSPCs, which expand and contribute to mature blood cells. This expansion is termed clonal hematopoiesis (CH). Inhibitor of DNA binding 1 (ID1) protein is a transcriptional regulator of proliferation/differentiation of hematopoietic cells. HSPCs express low levels ofId1that is induced by growth factors and other mediators of inflammatory during stress to promote HSPC expansion. Since chronic inflammation is associated with the progression of hematopoietic malignancies, reducingId1expression may reduce CH. Genetic ablation ofId1inTet2−/−HSPCs reduces HSPC expansion/CH, extramedullary hematopoiesis, myeloid skewing, and genetic instability and delays the onset of disease.

This study explores the functional role of a recently identified mitochondrial microprotein, SLC35A4-MP, in the brown adipose tissue of mice. Our findings reveal dynamic regulation of SLC35A4-MP expression during primary brown adipocyte differentiation in vitro and during cold exposure or high-fat diet (HFD)–induced obesity in mice. Using a knockout mouse model, we show that loss of SLC35A4-MP disrupts mitochondrial lipid composition, decreasing cardiolipins and phosphatidylethanolamine in brown adipose tissue from HFD-fed mice. SLC35A4-MP deficiency also impairs mitochondrial activity, alters mitochondrial number and morphology, and promotes inflammation. Knockout mice accumulate acylcarnitines during cold exposure, indicating defective fatty acid oxidation. These findings reveal SLC35A4-MP as a previously unrecognized microprotein in regulating mitochondrial function and tissue lipid metabolism, adding to the growing list of functional endogenous microproteins."

It is accepted that most STAT3 variants causing AD-HIES are dominant negative. Whether haploinsufficient mutations cause a phenotype in humans is still debated. We report on a family with a heterozygousSTAT3nonsense mutation that led to rapid decay of the mutant mRNA and protein, leading to haploinsufficiency. To explore STAT3 heterozygosity, we created aStat3haploinsufficient (Stat3+/−) mouse model in which we found thatStat3+/−mice had increased IgE serum levels, reduced TH17 cell differentiation, and were susceptible to a cutaneousStaphylococcus aureusinfection. Together, our findings provide mechanistic evidence for the impact of haploinsufficiency inSTAT3with residual protein expression as an important cause for immune deficiency.

We apply this methodology to generate conformal printing toolpaths for replicating the structure and directional mechanics observed in native tissue within 3D printed tissue simulants. Further, a method to embed fluid-filled capsules within the infill structure of these tissue simulants to mimic blood is also presented. The improvements in simulation quality when using 3D printed anisotropic tissue simulants over conventional tissue simulants are demonstrated via a comparative acceptability study.

Here, we mapped the chromatin contacts along nuclear radial axis and built radial score by factoring in contact frequencies. The chromatin high-order structures exhibit rich diversity along radial axis. Furthermore, the proximal trans contacts retrieved by radial score reveal conserved active/inactive chromatin segregation across intra- and interchromosomal interactions. Ablation of CTCF proteins disrupts chromatin loops with mild changes to chromatin radial positioning. By acutely perturbing multiple transcription factor (TF) occupancy, chromatin loop dissolutions are often accompanied by radial dissociations between two anchors.

Phytoplankton frequently experience a limiting supply of multiple nutrients simultaneously (colimitation). Ocean warming is predicted to exacerbate marine nutrient limitation. Yet, how phytoplankton adapt their physiology and regulate responses to colimitation is poorly understood. Here, we show that when the crucial macronutrients nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) colimit growth of globally abundant phytoplankton, the diatoms, cellular resources are diverted to prioritize N uptake over P sensing and acquisition. Regulatory mechanisms for responding to fluctuating P supply, including Phosphate Starvation Response 1 (PSR1) and P-resupply sensing via Ca2+signaling, are strictly nitrate dependent. Further, P-Ca2+signaling is impaired inpsr1mutants, suggesting that PSR1 is necessary for this response and coordinates adaptations to colimitation. Our study demonstrates a hierarchy of resource allocation during colimitation that points to N starvation mechanisms overriding those of P and could lead to N-P colimitation being masked in many marine ecosystems."

Compensated ferrimagnet spintronic devices with both a large anomalous Hall effect and a high coercivity would be simultaneously easy to read and difficult to erase. The kagome ferrimagnet TbMn6Sn6has been reported to host a large intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. Here, we demonstrate that doping the Mn sites with Cr drives the system toward magnetic compensation. For nearly compensated compositions at low temperatures, giant coercive fields exceeding 14 T are observed. Additionally, Cr doping markedly enhances the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect, which can be attributed to a shift in the Fermi level.

Here, we demonstrate tunable SHG enhancement using virtual coupling effects between quasi-bound state in the continuum (qBIC) optical resonances and tunable excitons in high-index WS2metasurfaces with crescent meta-atoms. These metasurfaces promote a magnetic-type qBIC resonance, enabling control over nonlinear optical processes in the visible spectrum. The used qBIC resonance at half the exciton energy increases SHG efficiency by 98-fold compared to monolayer WS2and by four orders of magnitude relative to an unpatterned WS2film.

The ratio of cell mass to volume defines the cell mass density (CMD), which is also a measure of macromolecular crowding and concentrations of all proteins. Using the fluorescence eXclusion method (FXm) and quantitative phase microscopy (QPM), we investigate CMD dynamics following sudden changes in media osmolarity. We find that while cell volume and mass exhibit complex behavior after osmotic shock, CMD follows a straightforward monotonic recovery over 48 hours. This recovery is cell cycle independent and depends on coordinated adjustment of protein synthesis and volume growth rates. Unexpectedly, the protein synthesis rate decreases when CMD increases. We observe that nucleoplasm-cytoplasm transport is CMD dependent, which contributes to negative regulatory feedback on CMD.

However, the lack of historical data has hampered estimation of this effect at a global scale. We overcome this hurdle by using genetic admixture and shared geohistorical location as a proxy for population contact. We find that language pairs whose speaker populations underwent genetic admixture or that are located in the same geohistorical area exhibit notable similar increases in shared linguistic patterns across world regions and different demographic relationships, suggesting a consistent trend in borrowing rates. At the same time, the effect varies strongly across specific linguistic features. This variation is only partly explained by cognitive differences in lifelong learnability and by social functions of signaling assimilation through borrowing, leaving much randomness in which specific features are borrowed. Additionally, we find that, for some features, admixture decreases sharing, likely reflecting signals of divergence (schismogenesis) under contact."

However, efficiency of snap-through energy release is challenging to improve because of the inherent trade-off between initial curvature and stiffness. Here, spatial programming of stiffness variation in the azobenzene-functionalized liquid-crystalline polymer (Azo-LCP) addresses this limitation and achieves efficient photomechanical jumping. Introduction of stiffness mismatch induced localized curvature, which preserved the initial curvature and simultaneously enhanced photomechanical strain responsivity. By programming for symmetry of stiffness variation, we achieved directional or vertical jumping via strategic placement of the rigid region, with corresponding stress accumulation behaviors corroborated by finite element simulations. Integration of patterned stiffness variation with geometric asymmetry enabled both vertical and horizontal jumping within a single structure, without compromising performance.

Based on field measurement data, we built machine learning models to predict gas–particle partitioning. We also unveiled previously unrecognized interactions that led to the deviations of partitioning from the equilibrium state under real atmospheric conditions. Our study provided valuable insights for future research in atmospheric chemistry. 
 Gas–particle partitioning governs the fate of oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) and the formation of organic aerosols. We employed a Chemical Ionization Mass Spectrometer equipped with a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsol (FIGAERO-CIMS) to measure the gas–particle distribution of OOMs in a winter campaign in the urban atmosphere. The observed gas–particle (G/P) ratios show a narrower range than the equilibrium G/P ratios predicted from saturation mass concentration C* and organic aerosol content. The difference between observed and equilibrium G/P ratios could be up to 10 orders of magnitude, depending on the C* parameterization selection. Our random forest models identified relative humidity (RH), aerosol liquid water content (LWC), temperature, and ozone as four influential factors driving the deviations of partitioning from the equilibrium state. Random forest models with satisfactory performance were developed to predict the observed G/P ratios. Intrinsic molecule features far outweigh meteorological and chemical composition features in the model's predictions. For a given OOM species, particle chemical composition features, including pH, RH, LWC, organic carbon, potassium, and sulfate, dominate over meteorological and gaseous chemical composition features in predicting the G/P ratios. We identified the positive or negative effects as well as the sensitive ranges of these influential features using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and curve fitting with a generalized additive model (GAM). Our models found that temperature does not emerge as a significant factor influencing the observed G/P ratios, suggesting that other factors, most likely associated with particle composition, inhibit the gas–particle partitioning of OOMs in response to temperature change."

A novel mass concentration (mascon) dataset, GCL-Mascon2024, was determined by leveraging the short-arc approach, advanced spatial constraints, a frequency-dependent noise processing strategy, and parameterization-integrating natural boundaries, aiming to enhance accuracy for monitoring mass transportation on Earth. 
 This paper reports on an innovative mass concentration (mascon) solution obtained with the short-arc approach, named “GCL-Mascon2024”, for estimating spatially enhanced mass variations on the Earth's surface by analyzing K- and Ka-band ranging satellite-to-satellite tracking data collected by the Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission. Compared to contemporary GRACE mascon solutions, this contribution has three notable and distinct features: first, this solution recovery process incorporates frequency-dependent data-weighting techniques to reduce the influence of low-frequency noise in observations. Second, this solution uses variably shaped mascon geometry with physical constraints such as coastline and basin boundary geometries to more accurately capture temporal gravity signals while minimizing signal leakage. Finally, we employ a solution regularization scheme that integrates climate factors and cryospheric elevation models to alleviate the ill-posed nature of the GRACE mascon inversion problem. Our research has led to the following conclusions: (a) GCL-Mascon2024 mass anomaly estimates from GRACE data show strong agreement with the (Release) RL06 versions of mascon solutions (GSFC, CSR, JPL) in both spatial and temporal domains; (b) in Greenland and global hydrologic basins, the correlation coefficients of estimated mass changes between GCL-Mascon2024 and other RL06 mascon solutions exceed 95.0 %, with comparable amplitudes, and, especially over non-humid river basins, the GCL-Mascon2024 suppresses random noise by 27.8 % compared to contemporary mascon products; and (c) in desert regions, the analysis of residuals calculated after removing the climatological components from the mass variations indicates that the GCL-Mascon2024 solution achieves noise reductions of over 29.3 % as compared to the GSFC and CSR RL06 mascon solutions.

Raymond,A spatially explicit dataset of agriculture liming across the contiguous United States,"We created the first detailed map of how much agricultural lime has been used across the United States from 1930 to 1987. Lime helps improve soil health and crop growth. Our study shows that how and where lime is used depends on climate, soil, and farming practices. By using machine learning, we found patterns that help explain these differences. This work helps us better understand the environmental role of lime and its impact on farming and climate. 
 Agricultural lime has historically been applied to croplands in the United States to counteract soil acidification and enhance soil fertility, with important consequences for crop productivity and Earth’s carbon cycle. Previous work on agricultural liming has largely focused on either region-specific case studies or national-level estimates of total application rates, leaving a major gap in understanding the spatial variability in lime application. This study addresses this gap by presenting the first spatially explicit dataset of agricultural lime application across the contiguous United States. The dataset comprises state-level data for 1930–1950 and a more detailed county-level dataset for 1954–1987, enabling comprehensive spatial-temporal analyses at multiple scales. Counties in the Midwest region exhibited the highest total amounts of lime applied in the latter half of the twentieth century, reflecting intensive agricultural activity. These counties were characterized by higher overall lime application rates (amount of lime applied per unit of limed area each year) but relatively lower liming frequency (ratio of limed area to total agricultural land area each year). In contrast, counties in the southeastern coastal region exhibited lower lime application rates per unit of limed area but more frequent lime applications. We used a machine learning framework, to elucidate key environmental and agricultural drivers of lime application. Our results show that the total amount of lime applied, as well as the application rate and frequency, are strongly associated with regional climatic conditions and soil properties. However, we also found evidence that agricultural management practices (such as crop production, fertilizer use, and soil pH recommendations) played a key role in shaping liming applications. Spatiotemporal integration of the data product results in a revised national estimate of total lime application, with a range of 15–25 million tons (Mt) per year. This study establishes a critical observational baseline for assessing the potential of agricultural lime application as a climate mitigation strategy and highlights the need for further research into its long-term environmental impacts."

The outcome is an open-access, century-scale global SPM dataset designed to advance research on long-term SPM source-sink dynamics and their climate connections. 
 Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) is a crucial indicator of marine nutrient transport, the carbon cycle, and land-sourced pollution. However, SPM research has been constrained by limited data. While marine remote sensing has helped fill this gap since late 20th century, pre-2000 data remains scarce, particularly for global datasets with high spatiotemporal resolution. To address the shortage of in-situ SPM observations, we developed two empirical models for estimating SPM concentrations: one based on remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) and the other on Secchi depth (Zsd). Model evaluation shows that retrieval uncertainties do not exceed 35 %. To mitigate errors in highly turbid waters (>100 mg l-1), we applied data quality constraints by excluding samples above this threshold. The resulting dataset merges in-situ SPM observations, providing global coverage of SPM concentrations from 1890 to 2020. Temporal and spatial analysis reveals an overall increase in global SPM concentrations, with a sharp rise between 1920 and 1942, followed by a rapid return to pre-1920 levels. The underlying causes of this fluctuation warrant further investigation. This unique dataset holds considerable potential for marine resource management, climate modeling, human activity assessment, and environmental protection."

The resulting dataset can serve as valuable scientific data for policymakers, researchers, and forest managers, guiding appropriate planting, environment enhancement, and carbon sequestration efforts. 
 China has undertaken extensive afforestation efforts in recent decades. However, the effectiveness of these plantings varies with different environmental conditions. Whether China's forest expansion is primarily due to intentional planting or natural reforestation remains uncertain. Thus, assessing the growth of planted forests (PF) is crucial for monitoring forest quality and supporting China’s commitment to carbon neutrality. In this study, using 30 m Landsat time-series, we proposed a Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC)-based PF expansion monitoring (C-PFM) method. Based on the C-PFM, 30 m annual maps for PF and natural forests (NF) across China from 1990 and 2020 were produced. The resulting PF map in 2020 achieved a F1-score of 79.2 % for PF and an overall accuracy of 90.8 % when validated against visually interpreted reference data. The PF maps for the years 1998, 2003, 2008, 2013, and 2018 were evaluated using data from the 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th National Forest Inventory (NFI) data across 34 provinces and autonomous regions of China. The results demonstrated that all Pearson’s product-moment correlations were larger than 0.86.

In eight forestry ecological engineering areas, we observed that the upper and middle reaches of Yangtze river Shelterbelt Program and Pearl River Shelterbelt Program experienced the most significant PF expansion.

 Stable carbon isotope composition of marine dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), δ13CDIC, is a valuable tracer for oceanic carbon cycling. However, its observational coverage remains much sparser than that of DIC and other physical or biogeochemical variables, limiting its full potential. Here, we reconstruct δ13CDIC in the Atlantic Ocean using a probabilistic machine learning framework, Gaussian Process Regression (GPR). We compiled data from 51 historical cruises, including a high-resolution 2023 A16N section, and applied secondary quality control via crossover analysis, retaining 37 cruises for model training, validation, and testing. The trained GPR model achieved an average bias of −0.007 ± 0.082 ‰ and an overall uncertainty of 0.11 ‰, arising from measurement (0.07 ‰), mapping (0.08 ‰), and negligible input-variable (3.77 × 10−14 ‰) errors. Using the GLODAPv2.2023 Atlantic dataset as predictors, the reconstruction expanded the number of acceptable δ13CDIC samples by a factor of 7.65, from 8,941 to 68,435 across the Atlantic basins. The resulting dataset markedly improves the spatial resolution in longitude, latitude, and depth, and provides enhanced temporal continuity over the past four decades. Compared to the sparse original measurements, the reconstruction reduces spatial discontinuities and reveals finer vertical structures consistent with other high-resolution biogeochemical observations.

We find that the biases are reduced with higher horizontal resolution but not with a shorter time step. The large-scale precipitation is sensitive to the horizontal resolution and time step; however, the convective precipitation is sensitive to the model time step. Higher horizontal resolution is more important for extreme precipitation simulation than a shorter time step. 
 Events of extreme precipitation pose a hazard to many parts of Europe but are typically not well represented in climate models. Here, we evaluate daily extreme precipitation over Europe during 1982–2019 in observations (GPCC), reanalysis (ERA5), and a set of atmosphere-only simulations at low (100 km), medium (50 km), and high (25 km) horizontal resolution and also at different time steps (i.e., 60, 30, and 15 min) using low resolution (100 km) with identical vertical resolutions using OpenIFS (version 43r3). We find that both OpenIFS simulations and reanalysis underestimate the rates of extreme precipitation compared to observations. The biases are largest for the lowest resolution (100 km) and decrease with higher-horizontal-resolution (50 and 25 km) simulations in all seasons. The sensitivity to horizontal resolution is particularly high in mountain regions (such as the Alps, Scandinavia, Iberian Peninsula), likely linked to the sensitivity of vertical velocity to the representation of topography. The sensitivity of precipitation to model resolution increases dramatically with increasing percentiles, with modest biases in the 70th–80th percentile range and large biases above the 99th percentile range. We also find that precipitation above the 99th percentile mostly consists of large-scale precipitation (∼ 80 %) in winter, while in summer it is mostly large-scale precipitation in northern Europe (∼ 70 %) and convective precipitation in southern Europe (∼ 70 %). Convective precipitation is more sensitive to model time step than to horizontal resolution. Large-scale precipitation increases significantly with both higher horizontal resolution and a shorter model time step."

The Community Atmosphere Model (CAM) versions 5 and 6 exchange information interactively while running, a process known as supermodeling.

We demonstrate that the models synchronize well without decreased variability, particularly in storm track regions, across multiple timescales, and for variables where no information has been exchanged. Synchronization is less pronounced in the tropics, and in regions of lesser synchronization we observe a decrease in high-frequency variability. Additionally, the low-frequency modes of variability (North Atlantic Oscillation and Pacific North American Pattern) are not degraded compared to the base models.

Their toxicity varies significantly due to the diversity of combustion conditions, which shape mixtures of components with differing toxic potency. We quantified component-specific contributions to intracellular reactive oxygen species generation in human bronchial epithelial cells exposed to BBOAs produced under controlled combustion conditions. Elevated combustion temperatures substantially reduced organic carbon (OC) mass emissions (by 20-fold) but resulted in a more modest reduction in OC toxicity emissions (by 5-fold). The toxicity emission reduction was primarily attributed to water-extractable OC (WOC), while methanol-extractable OC (MOC) limited this effect. The reduced emission of WOC toxicity was driven by the decreased mass emission of polar compounds such as methoxylates, as the toxicity per unit mass of WOC showed negligible changes across temperatures. In contrast, the toxicity per unit mass of MOC increased 10-fold from low to high temperatures, partially due to the formation of more potent aromatic derivatives, despite their smaller mass contribution. These findings underscore the importance of identifying key toxicity drivers to guide targeted source apportionment and refine strategies for reducing toxic emissions."

Quinn,Prospective Life Cycle Assessment of Sustainable Aviation Fuel Systems,"Sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs) are critical for reducing the greenhouse gas emissions of aviation. However, many SAF feedstocks and biorefining technologies are still in the research and development stages, which complicates accurate predictions of their long-term environmental impacts through traditional life cycle assessments (LCAs). Prospective LCA (pLCA) methods, which use dynamic life cycle inventory models, offer a solution to static LCA by evaluating impacts within a future context. This study leverages pLCA to assess the decarbonization potential of three SAF pathways using corn, miscanthus, and algae biomass across three future scenarios. The miscanthus pathway consistently demonstrates the lowest carbon intensity, starting at approximately 14 g CO2e MJ–1 and maintaining this low level across all scenarios by 2050. This stability is attributed to its simpler and more mature conversion technology. In contrast, the algal and corn pathways, which initially present higher emissions (98.1 g CO2e MJ–1 and 71.8 g CO2e MJ–1 respectively), show significant reductions by 2050. Specifically, algal and corn-based SAF drop to 33.1 g CO2e MJ–1 and 49 g CO2e MJ–1, respectively, particularly under aggressive climate policy scenarios. These findings highlight the importance of pLCA for evaluating emerging technologies, as results are shown to significantly change from 2020 to 2050."

In this study, we spiked raw wastewater samples with eight human respiratory viruses and processed them with four methods that concentrate and/or extract nucleic acids from both liquid and solid fractions (Promega, Nanotrap, and InnovaPrep) or only the solid fraction of wastewater (Solids). Our findings provide encouraging evidence that all four methods combined with dPCR could detect an emerging virus in wastewater, although they differed in sensitivity. The pattern of recovery efficiency for adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and influenza A viruses was consistent across methods, with Promega producing higher median recovery efficiencies, while distinct patterns were observed for coxsackieviruses. We also normalized the concentration data with two endogenous fecal indicators, PMMoV and Carjivirus (formerly crAssphage). We found that normalization could reduce method-associated differences if the indicator exhibited a recovery pattern similar to that of the target virus. These findings can guide the selection of concentration and extraction methods for wastewater monitoring based on the properties of target viruses, thus enhancing pandemic preparedness."

Here, we analyzed 190 PPCPs in surface waters across 60 countries on five continents, screened the priority PPCP list, and identified key ecological risk driving factors. Results showed that antihyperglycemics and antibiotics dominated concentration profiles, while hormones and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) posed the most severe ecological risks. 76 PPCPs exhibited potential risks in at least one country, with ibuprofen, 17β-estradiol, and carbamazepine identified as critical compounds, and estrone posing high risks to aquatic ecosystems globally. Across income levels, PPCP concentrations peaked in lower-middle-income countries, while ecological risks were highest in upper-middle-income regions. PPCP risks were correlated with multiple factors such as environmental infrastructure, healthcare systems, unemployment rates, and the Gini index. In addition, hydrological dilution and PPCP usage were also important driving factors that might be affected by climate change. Here, we offer the perspective that enhancing treatment capacity, improving healthcare accessibility, mitigating socioeconomic disparities, and adapting to climate change are imperative to mitigate PPCP risks while advancing across many of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals."

This study demonstrates that developmental exposure to mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP: 0, 10, and 50 mg/kg), the bioactive metabolite of di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), induced neurobehavioral deficits in adolescent offspring rats. Behavioral assessments revealed that the MEHP exposure provoked anxiety-like behaviors at postnatal days (PND) 14 and 21, concurrently manifested as spatial memory impairments at PND35. Histopathological analysis demonstrated significant neurodegenerative alterations in the hippocampus of MEHP-exposed offspring, including reduced Nissl body density in the 50 mg/kg group. Transcriptomic profiling identified a robust dose-dependent dysregulation pattern, with high-dose exposure (50 mg/kg) eliciting substantially more differentially expressed genes (542 DEGs) than low-dose exposure (393 DEGs). Analysis revealed suppression of cytochrome P450 (CYP450) pathways, characterized by the downregulation of Cyp2a1, Cyp2f4, Cyp2g1, and Cyp1a2. Strikingly, these effects occurred independently of canonical xenobiotic-sensing receptors, indicating direct CYP450 transcriptional inhibition as a potential novel mechanism. Taken together, our findings determine MEHP as a potent developmental neurotoxicant, with CYP450 dysregulation identified as a critical mediator of phthalate-induced neurotoxicity, with significant implications for environmental risk assessment."

However, changes in the stratospheric impacts of the MJO, in particular on sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events, remain to be elucidated. This study investigates the decadal variation in the MJO‐SSW relationship, which suggests that, in the epoch of 1980–1999 (E1), there is an absence of systematic MJO activity preceding SSWs for all MJO phases. Conversely, during 2000–2020 (E2), a robust phase‐locked relationship between MJO phase 7 (P7) and the subsequent SSWs is observed. Concurrently, E2 has seen an amplified vertical planetary wave pulse following P7, resulting in a maximum warming of the Arctic stratosphere exceeding 5°C. The results suggest a pronounced intensification of the MJO‐SSW relationship in the past two decades, probably due to the prolonged duration of MJO‐related enhanced convection during P7 and the shifts in the extratropical basic state."

The results show that the vertical spectra in the stratosphere are more saturated than in the troposphere. The slope and amplitude distributions of the horizontal spectra vary across different frequency ranges. The slopes of the horizontal spectra show a significant correlation with convective activity, and during convection‐frequent periods, the horizontal spectral densities in the 5–2 min period decrease in the stratosphere.

Energy conversion and entry of plasma and energy are weaker when the IMF is northward. After the IMF is southward, the inflow of the electromagnetic energy (the Poynting flux) increases, leading to a loading of magnetic energy. Subsequently, a strong energy conversion occurs from the magnetic field to the plasma, leading to an unloading of the magnetic energy. When the IMF is radial, strong disturbances are formed on the magnetopause, but the total ion flux, energy fluxes, and energy conversion are not pronounced.

Here we identified a unique four‐layer tuff sequence within the Xiamaling Formation black shales, North China Craton, that can be traced over a large area ∼400 km long by ∼100 km wide, and represents a synchronous marker horizon formed by air fall tuffs from distant volcanic eruptions. High‐precision U‐Pb geochronology shows that the tuff sequence span a short duration of 0.21 Myr at 1380.41 ± 0.99 Ma. The tuff layers match the age of widely distributed ∼1,380 Ma LIPs found on multiple cratons in supercontinent Columbia/Nuna.

 Both diffusion magnetic resonance imaging and transcriptomic technologies have provided unprecedented opportunities to dissect brain network communication, offering insights from structural connectivity and signaling molecules separately. However, incorporating these complementary modalities for characterizing the interregional communication remains challenging. By simplifying the communication processes into an optimal transport problem, which is defined as the ligand-receptor expression coupling constrained by structurally-derived communication cost, we develop a method called CLRIA (connectome-constrained ligand-receptor interaction analysis) to infer a low-rank representation of ligand-receptor interaction-mediated communication networks. To solve the proposed optimization problem, the block majorization minimization algorithm is adopted and proven to converge globally. We benchmark CLRIA on simulated and published data, validating its accuracy and computational efficiency. Subsequently, we demonstrate the CLRIA’s utility in evaluating communication strategies and asymmetric communication using its solution. Furthermore, CLRIA-derived communication patterns successfully decode brain state transitions. Overall, our results highlight CLRIA as a valuable tool for understanding complex communication in the brain.

In this study, the authors uncover the structural basis by which HIV-1 adapts to a deficiency in IP6 packaging through a G225R mutation at the C-terminus of the capsid protein. 
 Inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) promotes HIV-1 assembly by stabilizing the immature Gag lattice and becomes enriched within virions, where it is required for mature capsid assembly. Previously, we identified Gag mutants that package little IP6 yet assemble particles, though they are non-infectious due to defective capsid formation. Here, we report a compensatory mutation, G225R, in the C-terminus of capsid protein (CA) that restores capsid assembly and infectivity in these IP6-deficient mutants. G225R also enhances in vitro assembly of CA into capsid-like particles at far lower IP6 concentrations than required for wild-type CA. CryoEM structures of G225R CA hexamers and lattices at 2.7 Å resolution reveal that the otherwise disordered C-terminus becomes structured, stabilizing hexamer-hexamer interfaces. Molecular dynamics simulations support this mechanism. These findings uncover how HIV-1 can adapt to IP6 deficiency and highlight a previously unrecognized structural role of the CA C-terminus, while offering tools for capsid-related studies.

 Arenes bearing silyl and boryl, or germyl and boryl groups, represent a significant class of bifunctional molecules that have garnered considerable attention in organic synthesis due to their unique reactivity and versatility in undergoing diverse chemical transformations.

The use of Si- and Ge-containing directing groups has been demonstrated to effectively suppress undesirable metathesis reactions, a side effect typically associated with their metallic nature. Our approach employs an iridium catalyst in combination with a ligand and an acetate base, which facilitates the formation of benzo-fused four-membered metallacycles within the catalytic cycle.

Here, the authors utilise longitudinal sampling of a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma model to identify biomarkers of response. 
 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has improved outcomes for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), but predictive biomarkers remain limited. Here, we use a time-resolved, multi-omic approach in a murine HNSCC model to characterize peripheral immune responses to ICB. Single-cell transcriptomics and T/B cell receptor analyses  reveal early on-treatment expansion of effector memory T and B cell repertoires in responders, preceding tumor regression. These dynamic immune features inform a composite transcriptional signature that accurately predicts ICB response in independent human HNSCC cohorts. LiBIO outperforms existing biomarkers and generalizes to melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and breast cancer without retraining. These findings suggest that early treatment-induced changes in circulating immune repertoires reflect the host’s capacity to mount an effective antitumor response. This work provides a framework for leveraging transient peripheral immune dynamics to develop non-invasive, high-fidelity biomarkers for response to immunotherapy across cancer types.

Jang et al. report structural and mechanistic studies of CRAF/MEK1/14-3-3 complexes that explain distinct features of CRAF regulation. 
 CRAF (RAF1) is one of three RAF-family kinases that initiate MAP kinase signaling in response to activated RAS and is essential for oncogenic signaling from mutant KRAS. Like BRAF, CRAF is regulated by 14-3-3 engagement and by intramolecular autoinhibitory interactions of its N-terminal regulatory region. Unlike BRAF, it is thought to require tyrosine phosphorylation in its N-terminal acidic (NtA) motif for full catalytic activation. Here we describe cryo-EM reconstructions of full-length CRAF in complex with MEK1 and a 14-3-3 dimer. These structures reveal a fully autoinhibited conformation analogous to that observed for BRAF and two “open monomer” states in which the inhibitory interactions of the CRD and 14-3-3 dimer are released or rearranged, but the kinase domain remains inactive. Structure-function studies of the NtA motif indicate that phosphorylation or acidic mutations in this segment increase catalytic activity by destabilizing the inactive conformation of the kinase domain. Collectively, these studies provide a structural foundation for understanding the shared and unique regulatory features of CRAF and will inform efforts to selectively block CRAF signaling in cancer.

Their data suggest that MYO7A traffics as a dimer within stereocilia to assemble the mechanoelectrical transduction machinery. 
 Stereocilia are F-actin-based cylindrical protrusions on the apical surface of inner ear hair cells that function as biological mechanosensors of sound and acceleration. During stereocilia development, specific unconventional myosins transport proteins and phospholipids as cargo and mediate elongation, differentiation and acquisition of the mechanoelectrical transduction (MET). How unconventional myosins localize themselves and cargo in stereocilia using energy from ATP hydrolysis is only partially understood. Here, we developed STELLA-SPIM microscopy to visualize movement of single myosin molecules in live hair cell stereocilia. STELLA-SPIM demonstrated that MYO7A, a component of MET machinery, shows processive movement toward stereocilia tips when chemically dimerized or constitutively activated by missense mutations disabling tail-mediated autoinhibition. Conversely, MYO7A shows step-wise but not processive movement in stereocilia when its tail is tethered to the plasma membrane or F-actin in the presence of MYO7A interacting partners. We posit that MYO7A dimerizes and moves processively in stereocilia when unleashed from autoinhibition.

Here, single cell profiling of metastatic melanoma samples identifies associations of the mature dendritic enriched in immunoregulatory molecules subtype with immunotherapy response. 
 Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have revolutionized cancer therapy, yet most patients fail to achieve durable responses. To better understand the tumor microenvironment (TME), we analyze single-cell RNA-seq (~189 K cells) from 36 metastatic melanoma samples, defining 14 cell types, 55 subtypes, and 15 transcriptional hallmarks of malignant cells. Correlations between cell subtype proportions reveal six distinct clusters, with a mature dendritic cell subtype enriched in immunoregulatory molecules (mregDC) linked to naive T and B cells. Importantly, mregDC abundance predicts progression-free survival (PFS) with ICIs and other therapies, especially when combined with the TCF7 + /– CD8 T cell ratio. Analysis of an independent cohort (n = 318) validates mregDC as a predictive biomarker for anti-CTLA-4 plus anti-PD-1 therapies. Further characterization of mregDCs versus conventional dendritic cells (cDC1/cDC2) highlights their unique transcriptional, epigenetic (single-nucleus ATAC-seq data for cDCs from 14 matched samples), and interaction profiles, offering new insights for improving immunotherapy response and guiding future combination treatments.

 In recent decades, Antarctica has undergone significant climate change, with most studies focusing on the impact of oceanic multiscale variability on Antarctica, especially on West Antarctica. However, our research reveals that Indian summer monsoon (ISM) rainfall strongly influences the austral winter (June–August) Antarctic climate and sea ice concentration (SIC) through atmospheric teleconnections. Diabatic heating from ISM rainfall shifts the Hadley cell northward, triggering a Rossby wave train from the Mascarene Islands into Antarctica. This alters sea level pressure and induces warm advection to both East and West Antarctica, leading to widespread warming. Consequently, Antarctic SIC undergoes a tripole redistribution, with increases in the Ross and Weddell Seas, and decreases in the Amundsen and Bellingshausen Seas. These findings emphasize the importance of ISM rainfall in shaping Antarctic climate and SIC, suggesting ISM rainfall as a possible contributing factor to the record-low Antarctic SIC observed during the austral winter of 2023."

 The potential for Arctic sea-ice loss, particularly in the Barents-Kara Seas, to induce Eurasian winter cooling remains contentious. Despite a significant correlation between Barents-Kara-Seas sea-ice loss and Eurasian winter cooling in observations, modeling studies suggest minimal causal influence. Through constraining Barents-Kara-Seas sea-ice to different states in ocean-atmosphere-coupled simulations, here we show that ocean-atmosphere coupling enhances the Eurasian cooling induced by historical sea-ice loss, though still weaker than observed, likely due to internal variability and confounding factors. Historical sea-ice loss induces stronger and deeper Arctic warming with ocean-atmosphere coupling than without, associated with a strengthened Siberian High and East Asian Trough, which promotes Eurasian cooling. However, ocean-atmosphere coupling has little influence on the Eurasian cooling response to projected end-of-the-twenty-first-century sea-ice loss. The Eurasian temperature response to historical sea-ice loss is dominated by dynamically-induced cooling, whereas strong thermodynamical warming masks dynamically-induced cooling in response to far-future sea-ice loss."

 Long-term historical studies of montane tropical forest loss in eastern Africa have been relatively neglected compared to other world regions, despite ramifications for biodiversity, climate crises, and knock-on effects on the African continent. Moreover, there has been a relative lack of historical studies of the legacies of European colonialism on land use change, native population displacement, and resource dispossession in Africa.

We estimate that during the colonial period (1910–1975) ~ 46% of the montane forest was lost, mainly attributed to large-scale forest concessions and agricultural conversions, and a further ~20% lost during the post-colonial period (1975–2024), attributed to post-colonial resettlement of small-scale farmers in colonially-designated areas and forest excisions.

Across temperate Europe, shrub landscapes dominate the area burned, with the moisture content of fuels during these events determining the threat posed. Current controls on the moisture content of temperate fuel constituents and their response to future extreme heatwaves are not known. We took field measurements of live and dead heather (Calluna vulgaris) and organic soil moisture content across the UK over 3 years, including an intensive sampling campaign during the July 2022 heatwave. Here, we show that the fuel moisture content of live fuel is associated significantly with phenological variables, dead fuel only with weather variables, whilst organic-rich ground fuels are more associated with landscape variables. However, during the record 2022 heatwave there was a harmonisation in fuel moisture controls across different fuel constituents, with those controls being driven by weather alone. This caused synchronised extreme dryness outside of current seasonal norms across all fuel constituents at the same time and place. Future intense summer heatwaves can therefore be expected to align the most severe conditions for fire ignition, spread and impact in traditionally non-fire prone regions, producing humid temperate landscapes susceptible to extreme wildfire events. Heathland ecosystems are resistant to extreme wildfires due to the differing drivers of low fuel moisture across all fuel types, but extreme heatwaves can cause homogenously low moisture content across fuels, causing extreme fire behavior, according to field measurement analysis of Calluna vulgaris and organic soil moisture content across the UK."

 This paper studies the problem of the energy transfer from a subaerial landslide to the waves it produces, in two dimensions, with a thoroughly validated multiphase Navier-Stokes model. The completeness of the model and the large domain considered give access to the time evolution of the slide and water energy components up to the far field. Considering a configuration favoring high energy transfer efficiency, namely a triangular water slide lying at the free surface, the slide volume (per unit width) is varied. The results show that the transfer efficiency is reduced by dispersion for the smaller slides and by breaking for the larger ones, leading to the existence of a local optimum for an intermediate slide size. Starting from this point, a new optimum is obtained by varying the slide density and the slope angle. Hence, with a density of 1750 kg. m−3 and a slope of 30°, the efficiency reaches a value of 87% in the near field and 73% in the far field, which may be good approximates of the related maxima in two dimensions. Compared to the previous optimum case, considering a granular rheology or slides at higher elevations drastically decreases the efficiency. The energy transfer rate from a two-dimensional subaerial landslide to the tsunami produced may be limited to a value of about 70 % in the far field, according to Navier-Stokes simulations."

 Extreme weather events are increasing in frequency and intensity, raising urgent questions about how citizens engage with such crises, especially in authoritarian and developing countries. We analyze citizen engagement on China’s Local Leaders’ Message Board, a government-run petition platform, to examine how residents communicate demands for public safety and infrastructure. Using a mixed-methods approach combining quantitative analysis and topic modeling of petition data, we demonstrate that the 2021 Henan flood, one of the deadliest in China’s recent history, led to a sharp increase in petitions concerning drainage, neighborhood safety, and flood prevention. These demands, although not framed in climate-specific language, reflect calls for state-led adaptation that is concrete and localized. We also find that concern about the disaster and preparedness extended beyond Henan, prompting appeals in unaffected provinces. These findings suggest that climate risk can catalyze political engagement in non-democratic settings, highlighting the value of citizen input in adaptation planning.

 Ocean ecological time series grow more useful with longevity, but practical constraints hinder consistency, and evolving scientific priorities necessitate sampling adjustments. We leveraged 30 years of zooplankton observations (five species, 1993–2024) from the western Antarctic Peninsula to quantify how shifts in sampling intensity, timing, and survey frequency influenced accuracy, precision, and predictability. A 67% decline in sample size aliased a long-term trend in ice krill and increased uncertainty by 47% in log10 space across species. Moving survey dates by two weeks influenced the density of salps, pteropods, and Antarctic krill by 48–83%. The ability to predict krill species density declined 47% in a simulated shift from annual to biennial survey frequency. Reduced spatial resolution and slight changes in timing can be accounted for statistically, but temporal gaps represent a challenge.

 Sustainability requirements imposed on agricultural producers by downstream supply chain actors risk excluding smallholder farmers from upgraded markets. Here we investigated smallholder participation in sustainably certified palm oil mill markets in Indonesia. We developed and applied a conceptual model to estimate the importance of structural market access, smallholder capacity, and buyer/seller behavior in shaping mill smallholder sourcing. Smallholders who hold exclusive contracts with specific mills were overrepresented at certified mills. Independent smallholders unaffiliated with mills contributed one-third of regional oil palm production but 7% of certified mill supply. We found no evidence that independent smallholders exited markets after mill certification (“active” exclusion). Instead, only 36% of certified mills ever purchased from independent smallholders, and independent smallholder lands were less common around certified (29–38% of palm area) versus noncertified (41–42%) mills. To address such “passive” exclusion, supply chain governance programs should encourage participation of actors well-positioned to source from small-scale producers.

 Temperature impacts on microbiological processes are crucial for soil biogeochemistry and ecosystem functioning, yet existing models either fail to capture microbial temperature dependences across the full biokinetic range or risk overparameterization. Here we present the “Dual-Kinetics Ratkowsky” model (Ratkowsky DK), which simultaneously describes temperature dependences of microbial growth and respiration. Compared to established models (Arrhenius, Ratkowsky, MMRT, and MMRT-2S), Ratkowsky DK showed superior performance and parsimony when applied to soils along a climate gradient, with strong implications for estimating soil carbon stock changes. Although empirically derived, the model provides reliable estimates of microbial thermal traits and climate responsiveness, reflecting warm- and cold-shifted adaptations. It also offers a biological interpretation whereby temperature-driven cell death fuels respiration beyond a threshold, explaining the decoupling between anabolism and catabolism. Ratkowsky DK represents a promising tool for advancing our understanding of microbial and biogeochemical responses to climate and implementation of ecology into Earth system representations.

 Aquatic vegetation (AV) is crucial for maintaining lake ecosystem's stability. Transformation of certain types of AV (e.g., submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV)) into other lake features (e.g., algal bloom) may cause a shift in lake's stable state. However, such transformations in Chinese lakes remain largely unknown. Using 0.23 million Landsat images from 1988 to 2023, a comprehensive investigation was conducted to reveal the long-term conversions between SAV, floating and emergent AV (FEAV), and non-AV (e.g., water or algal bloom) across 4375 Chinese lakes (with area > 1 km2). Results show that from 1988–1993 to 2018–2023, the total lake AV area experienced a reduction of 0.7 × 103 km2. Despite a countrywide net increase in FEAV (+0.9 × 103 km2), it could not offset the sharp decline in SAV (−1.6 × 103 km2). The SAV decline was mainly observed in Eastern Plain lake region. Nationwide, 3.6 × 103 km2 of SAV have transitioned into non-AV, with 78.3% of this area transformation occurring in Eastern Plain. In contrast, many non-AV areas on the Tibetan Plateau saw an emergence of SAV, expanding at +17.9 km2 per year. However, mutual conversions between SAV and FEAV were minimal. National FEAV gains were primarily from non-AV conversions (+1.3 × 103 km2), occurring mainly in Eastern Plain, while SAV-to-FEAV transitions accounted for only 23.8% of total FEAV gains. Driving forces analysis shows that lake eutrophication dominated SAV reduction, whereas FEAV variations were primarily influenced by eutrophication, temperature, and lake water area changes. These findings could provide important insights for lake restoration management in China."

 Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is an effective probe for photosynthesis, but this remote sensing signal is affected by multiple factors, including radiation intensity, canopy structure, sun-observer geometry, and leaf physiological status. The complex interplay among these factors causes substantial discrepancies among top-of-canopy (TOC) SIF, leaf-level average SIF and actual photosynthetic activity. Downscaling TOC SIF to the leaf-level and decoupling structural and physiological information remain major challenges in the use of SIF signals for remote sensing of photosynthesis. To address these challenges, the R2F (reflectance-to-fluorescence) theory was developed, grounded in the similarity in radiative transfer processes governing SIF and reflectance. This theory establishes a physical relationship between near-infrared reflectance (Rnir) and the far-red SIF scattering coefficient (σF). On this basis, SIF signals can be scaled from the canopy to the leaf level by normalizing σF, estimated from reflectance as σF=Rnir/i0, where i0 denotes canopy interceptance. However, the original R2F formulation assumes a non-reflective soil. This simplification breaks down in sparse canopies, where soil contributions are non-negligible—an issue referred to as the “black-soil problem”. Soil enhances both Rnir and σF, distorting their intrinsic relationship. In this study, we show that soil effects manifest through two main mechanisms: (1) direct soil reflection, which significantly increases Rnir but has minimal impact on σF, and (2) soil–vegetation multiple scattering, which affects both Rnir and σF but tends to have compensatory effects. Consequently, the dominant source of bias in the original R2F relationship is direct soil reflection that contributes to Rnir—a mechanism that had not been explicitly isolated in previous studies. This finding allows us to narrow down the “black-soil problem” in the R2F framework to the specific impact of soil single scattering on Rnir. To mitigate this bias, we propose a soil-adjusted R2F (saR2F) method, which estimates the direct soil contribution of Rnir using TOC red and blue reflectance. Correcting Rnir for the direct soil reflection results in a robust relationship between σF and soil-adjusted RnirsaRnir, notably σF=saRnir/i0.We evaluated the saR2F relationship using one field and two simulated datasets. In the field study, saR2F improved the estimation of σF from TOC reflectance, with R2 increasing ranging from 0.21 to 0.31 compared to the original R2F. In the two simulations, saR2F consistently outperformed the original R2F, especially under sparse canopy conditions. We also compared saR2F with NDVI-based (NIRv) and FCVI-based R2F approaches. In the available field observations collected under specific conditions (i.e., varying viewing azimuth angles), the three approaches showed similar performance and were better than the original R2F in explaining the viewing-angle dependence of σF. However, across the broader range of simulated scenarios and for estimating the exact σF, saR2F demonstrated better stability than NIRv and FCVI-based R2F methods. The NIRv-based and FCVI-based R2F methods yielded relatively low RMSE (0.092 and 0.075, respectively) but weak explanatory power, with R2 values below 0.41 for canopies with LAI < 3. In contrast, saR2F achieved a much stronger relationship (R2 = 0.80) and a low RMSE of 0.044. Furthermore, compared to the NIRv or FCVI-based approaches for R2F corrections, saR2F offers a more physically plausible and interpretable solution that can be applied to angular correction and total SIF estimation. The effective mitigation of the black-soil problem facilitates interpretation of raw SIF observations and enhances the monitoring of photosynthetic activity using SIF."

 Accurately characterizing the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil freeze depth (SFD) is critical for understanding the response of frozen soils to climate change. Existing SFD mapping schemes mainly focus on annual maximum values, rarely address monthly variations, and fail to capture both spatiotemporal heterogeneity and physical constraints. We developed a monthly SFD mapping scheme (MSFDmap) that considers spatiotemporal heterogeneity in heat transfer capability. Based on the simplified Stefan equation, which is physically constrained by energy conservation, MSFDmap first predicts the spatial distribution of monthly heat transfer factor (HTF) using a random forest regression model driven by soil clay content, precipitation, soil bulk density, soil organic carbon content, soil water content, and leaf area index, and then maps monthly SFD. MSFDmap was implemented using 2123 site-month observations from 60 pan-Arctic sites over 20 years. Results show that MSFDmap achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.21 cm and an R2 of 0.91 for monthly SFD estimates, reducing RMSE by 24–55 % and improving R2 by 8–65 % over existing schemes. For monthly SFD averaged across sites, estimates exhibit strong temporal agreement with quasi-true SFD series (Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.99, RMSE = 9.13 cm). The MSFDmap-derived SFD distribution exhibits expected latitudinal and altitudinal gradients, with r = 0.60 relative to an ERA5-Land-based reference distribution. These results demonstrate that MSFDmap effectively characterizes the spatiotemporal dynamics of monthly SFD and outperforms existing schemes. It is attributed to the capture of heterogeneous HTF, which enables the representation of SFD heterogeneity under physical constraints."

The framework features several novel methods for refining surface water extents with topographical and hydrological contextualization. A bimodal mask is generated from quadtree decomposition and gaussian mixture modelling, in combination with a bimodality test, which enables straightforward determination of local thresholds separating water and background. Mapped flood extents are contextually refined with ancillary topographical and hydrological datasets, using region-growing and linear regression. A nuanced surface water likelihood output is created from a fuzzy logic procedure using image specific backscatter coefficient statistics, topographic position index and height above nearest drainage. Results were verified through comprehensive spatial- and temporal validation, using Sentinel-2 optical imagery, a permanent water dataset, and timeseries of gauged stream water elevation.

 Accurately describing the distribution of burned area and fire emissions is essential for fire management and sustainable development. Medium-resolution datasets, such as MCD64A1 Version 6.1 and the Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED), indicate a decrease in tropical and subtropical fire activity over the past 20 years. However, these datasets often miss small burned patches, leading to underestimations in heterogeneous landscapes. Southeast Asia (SEA) is a major hotspot for fire activity and biodiversity. This study provides a high-resolution (30 m) dataset of burned area (1990–2023) and fire-related carbon emissions (2001–2023) across SEA, derived from Landsat data. We curated training data from MODIS, VIIRS, and Landsat imagery, used a Random Forest algorithm to predict burned areas, and created monthly burned area maps with 30-meter resolution. Additionally, we simulated fire-related carbon emissions using the GFED framework and high-resolution maps. Our findings reveal an average annual burned area of 125,212 km2 and emissions of 270 Tg C, both significantly exceeding previous estimates from coarse-resolution datasets by 11,771 km2 and 83.67 Tg C, respectively. Both burned area and carbon emissions have remained stable over time, with agricultural and forest fires contributing significantly to the total burned areas and emissions. Forest burning accounts for 49 % of the total burned area, leading to substantial forest loss (12 % of total forest loss) and carbon emissions (76 % of total fire emissions), with an increase since 2001. Agricultural burning contributes 28 % of the burned area and 12 % of carbon emissions in SEA.

Specifically, we utilize a noise recording device to sample sound pressure level (SPL) data through mobile measurements at various locations during the daytime, a Transformer-based model is then constructed to learn noise-related information embedded in the scale, spectral, and spatial contextual features of Sentinel-2 imagery. The extracted high-dimensional feature vectors are used to quantitatively estimate SPL, with the proposed Noise-Trans-Sentinel model achieving MAE, RMSE, and R2 values of 3.48, 4.68, and 0.63, respectively. Finally, a SHAP method is employed to interpret the model, exploring the role of multi-scale and multi-spectral remote sensing information in urban noise levels estimation. Our proposed framework enables and validates low-cost, spatially continuous noise estimation in urban areas. It fills a critical gap by demonstrating, for the first time, that high-resolution urban noise mapping can be achieved solely from remote sensing imagery, without relying on dense sensor networks or GIS data. This research contributes to cross-modal studies in urban environmental science and informs the optimization of urban soundscapes."

 Biomass combustion represents a significant source of particulate matter, posing substantial risks to both human health and the environment. This study underscores bio-coal briquettes as a promising solid fuel for residential applications, with the potential to significantly curtail PM2.5 emissions. The PM2.5 emissions were quantified using URG cyclones and quartz-fiber filters. PAHs were analyzed via GC/MS, and PM morphology via SEM-EDS. The quantitative analysis particularly examines the influence of diverse furnace types, ignition modes, and biomass blending ratios on PM2.5 emissions during bio-coal briquettes combustion. A quadratic function model is formulated to elucidate the correlations between the PM2.5 emission factors and the volatile as well as ash content. Furthermore, the presence of ash in the samples exacerbates the production of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the flue gas during combustion. Optimal conditions (20 % straw, semi-gasifier, upper ignition) reduced PM2.5 emissions to 4.9 mg/g (vs. 24.9 mg/g in conventional furnaces). Quadratic models linked volatile matter (R2 ≥ 0.97) and ash content (R2 ≥ 0.99) to PM2.5. Under these parameters, the emission factors for 16 PAHs, including benzo[a]pyrene (BaP), as well as water-soluble cations and ions, are observed at their lowest levels, demonstrating superior emission reduction efficacy. Scanning electron microscopy revealed that the collected PM2.5 exhibited a variety of morphologies and structures. Energy dispersive spectroscopy indicated that the primary constituents of PM2.5 were C, O, Na, Zn, K, Al, Ti, Ca, Cl, Te and Hg. This strategy offers a viable pathway to mitigate household air pollution in rural regions."

But recent studies also point toward a terrestrial influence. We quantify dynamic changes to northern terrestrial carbon stocks from the Last Glacial Maximum (21,000 years) until present at millennial time steps using a combination of paleo-data and climate-biome modeling. During the deglaciation, northern land carbon storage declined by >300 petagrams of carbon with a minimum around 11,000 years, followed by progressively higher land carbon stocks during the Holocene. We find evidence that dynamic changes in terrestrial land carbon stocks were of a scale to exert large influence on atmospheric CO2concentrations and that postglacial terrestrial carbon stock dynamics were dominated by losses from permafrost-affected loess and gains into peatlands."

How bacteria achieve DC subversion remains largely unknown. Here, we describe the mechanism used by tularemia agentFrancisella tularensisexploiting host mitochondrial anaplerosis. Shortly after internalization,Francisellaassociates with DC mitochondria, which leads to the rapid repurposing of their oxidative metabolism for production of mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (mtROS). Mitochondrial metabolic rewiring is orchestrated by the intramitochondrial signaling mediated by protein acetylation and involves switching to glutamate as the primary substrate for DC tricarboxylic acid cycle. Rather than killing the bacterium, glutamate-fueled mtROS production activates p38-dependent proinflammatory gene expression. Blocking of glutamate utilization prevents DC activation and bacterial dissemination and alleviates inflammation in vivo. Our findings underscore the importance of metabolic plasticity in antibacterial DC response and open up potential avenues for therapies targeting host metabolism."

Herein, we investigate the permeation of alkali chlorides (LiCl, KCl, and CsCl) through steric hindrance–free nanoporous membranes with tunable surface charge densities. Supported by molecular dynamics simulations, we confirm that electrostatic effects promote the dehydration of Cl−, the counterions to the membrane charge, at the positively charged membrane surface. This dehydration leads to a great tendency of Cl−to absorb to the membrane surface and be retained, compromises Cl−partitioning, and impedes salt cotransport. For negatively charged membranes, Cs+with its lower hydration energy undergoes greater electrostatic-driven dehydration and partition hindrance than K+, resulting in selective KCl transport. Our findings provide both theoretical and experimental proofs of ionic dehydration and transport impediments driven by electrostatic interactions at charged membrane surfaces, presenting an in-depth perspective for designing ion-selective membranes to separate similar ions based on charge effects."

The homologous recombination (HR) pathway repairs stalled replication forks (RFs) and prevents such instability. Through an E3 ubiquitin ligase screen aimed at identifying regulators of RAD51, we identified macrophage erythroblast attacher (MAEA), a core component of C-terminal to Lish (CTLH) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, as a regulator of the HR pathway. Loss of MAEA impairs RAD51 recruitment at stalled RFs, leading to increased sensitivity to RS-inducing agents and excessive degradation of nascent DNA strands. Mechanistically, MAEA associates with and mediates the ubiquitylation of Ku80, enabling its removal from RF ends and facilitating the loading of RAD51. Notably, MAEA deficiency is associated with a developmental disorder involving microcephaly, craniofacial abnormalities, ocular defects, and heart malformations. Functional assays show that disease-linked MAEA variants (R34C, E349G, Y394D, and M396R) are defective in RS response.

In the US, each approach immediately increased election confidence and reduced fraud beliefs, with prebunking showing somewhat more durable effects.

Mechanical theories, finite element analysis, and experiments verified that, with multilayer stacks and interconnects with various geometric designs as examples, the overbend strategy can enhance the designed elastic bendability to twice for the material of the ideal elastoplastic/kinematic hardening constitutive relationship and to more than twice for the mixed hardening/isotropic hardening constitutive relationship. The mechanism is extending the elastic strain range at the critical section to twice or more times the original value by the evolution of the elastoplastic constitutive relationship.

These representations minimize neural distances across different vocalizations from the same individual while preserving distinct trajectories for different callers. This structure emerged from the coordinated activity of the broader neuronal ensemble, although a small subset of highly identity-selective neurons carried high identity information.

The functional significance of DKC1 up-regulation and the mechanistic connection between pseudouridylation and IRES-mediated translation remain poorly understood. Here, we report that DKC1 drives an ATF4-mediated transcriptional program that supports amino acid metabolism and stress adaptation. We identify hnRNP A1, an IRES trans-acting factor, as a critical downstream mediator of DKC1 in sustaining ATF4 expression and IRES-dependent translation. Mechanistically, DKC1-mediated pseudouridylation at two specific 28Sribosomal RNA sites is crucial for maintaining hnRNP A1 protein expression. In turn, hnRNP A1 binds and stabilizes ATF4 messenger RNA, preferentially promoting IRES-dependent translation of ATF4 variant 1. Furthermore, cellular stress induces hnRNP A1, which is necessary for stress-induced ATF4 protein expression. Collectively, our findings uncover an MYC-driven DKC1-hnRNP A1 axis that links IRES-dependent translation and ATF4-mediated metabolic adaptation, thereby supporting cancer cell survival under metabolic stress during tumor progression."

While the role of these genes has been extensively studied in neurons, microglial functions such as phagocytosis are also dependent on cytoskeletal dynamics. We demonstrate that disturbance of actin cytoskeletal regulation in microglia, modeled by genetically impairing the scaffold protein Disrupted-in-Schizophrenia 1 (DISC1), which integrates actin-binding proteins, causes a shift in actin regulatory balance favoring filopodial versus lamellipodial actin organization. The resulting microglia-specific dysregulation of actin dynamics leads to excessive uptake of synaptic proteins. Genetically engineered DISC1-deficient mice show diminished hippocampal excitatory transmission and associated spatial memory deficits. Reintroducing wild-type microglia-like cells via bone marrow transplantation in adult DISC1-deficient mice restores the synaptic function of neurons and rescues cognitive performance. These findings reveal a pivotal role for microglial actin cytoskeletal remodeling in preserving synaptic integrity and cognitive health. Targeting microglial cytoskeletal dynamics may effectively address cognitive impairments associated with NDDs, even in adulthood."

This induces neuronal production of both nitric oxide and superoxide, which together induce oxidative cell injury. Nitric oxide can readily cross lipid membranes, but superoxide, being an anion, cannot. Using primary neuronal cultures, we show that superoxide enters neurons through volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs). Oxidative injury produced by either exogenous superoxide or NMDA receptor stimulation is prevented by the VRAC inhibitor [4-(2-butyl-6,7-dichlor-2-cyclopentylindan-1-on-5-yl)oxybutyric acid] (DCPIB) and by disruption of the essential VRAC subunit, leucine-rich repeat–containing 8A (LRRC8A). In mouse cortex, neuronal oxidative injury induced by either NMDA or transient ischemia is likewise blocked by both DCPIB and LRRC8A disruption. Selective expression of LRRC8A/C and LRRC8A/D but not LRRC8A/D subunits conferred superoxide conductance in HeLa cells. Superoxide entry through VRACs is thus a requisite step in excitotoxic neuronal injury, and interventions affecting VRAC subunit composition, localization, or opening could influence neuronal survival."

Under temperate summer-like conditions, levels of the pigment-dispersing factor (PDF) neuropeptide diminish, triggering a cascade. Lowered PDF receptor (PDFR) signaling disinhibits glycogen synthase kinase 3/SHAGGY to advance the evening output, and in parallel, weakens the siesta-promotingvcDN1p-SIFamideaxis to expand the evening peak.

Here, we investigated the warm-season water temperature of 228 springs from clean (ice) glaciers, CRLs, and reference slopes (not sourced by any of these features) in 13 mountain ranges of Europe, South America, and North America. Only springs from glaciers (90%) and CRLs (45%) had average stream temperatures below the thermal optimum for coldwater organisms of 2 °C. Springs fed by CRLs were 3 °C–5 °C (up to 9 °C) colder than those from nearby reference slopes. In general, cold springs were rarer in Mediterranean/semi-arid climates than in temperate and sub-polar climates. Landforms comprising barren and coarse rocky surfaces or ice/rock mix, having a simple or absent soil/vegetation structure, and higher likelihood of permafrost more often supported cold springs. When water temperatures were compared to air temperature, most CRL springs were thermally buffered against warm periods, cumulative heat, and daily temperature fluctuations. With cold conditions maintained in a variety of climates and mountain landscapes, CRL springs in mountains likely have high conservation value.

Additionally, fire intensity in this region varies depending on the specific type of El Niño event, namely the Eastern Pacific (EP) El Niño and the Central Pacific (CP) El Niño. However, their distinct impacts and localized variations remain insufficiently understood. Using both reanalysis and future projection data, we investigated the distinct influences of the EP and CP El Niño, as well as the IOD, on potential fire occurrences. Our results indicate that both types of El Niño significantly enhance fire activity in southern Equatorial Asia, with a stronger impact associated with the EP El Niño, whereas the IOD primarily affects the southwestern and south-central regions. These fire patterns are closely linked to large-scale atmospheric circulation changes, particularly modifications in the Walker and Hadley circulations, which influence regional precipitation and atmospheric subsidence, thereby altering vapor pressure deficit and soil moisture availability. Furthermore, fire-prone conditions in Equatorial Asia are modulated by land-atmosphere coupling, with the EP El Niño and IOD intensifying surface drying and heat stress, while the CP El Niño exhibits a weaker influence.

These changes increase the likelihood of multiple, co-occurring hazards—posing serious challenges to sustainable development and disaster management. In response, this study developed a multi-hazard probability assessment using a Random forest algorithm, focusing on four major disasters: floods, landslides, forest fires (FFs), and droughts (DTs). By applying hazard-specific environmental variables, empirical threshold values, and bootstrap-based uncertainty analysis, the study produced spatially differentiated risk maps and identified areas with overlapping vulnerabilities. The results show that high-probability zones for floods and landslides are concentrated in the southern and central regions, while FF and DT risks are more prominent in the northern and western areas. Overlapping hazard zones, though relatively small in spatial extent, highlight critical regions where compound disaster risks may arise. These patterns suggest the need for region-specific mitigation strategies that reflect the dominant hazard characteristics in each area. Overall, the study provides baseline spatial information that can inform land-use planning and disaster management. The identification of environmental thresholds and uncertainty ranges supports more transparent and evidence-based decision-making."

While attention has been given to seasonal and decadal predictions, there is growing interest in exploring the potential for skillful predictions also at interannual timescales. In the current study, we assess the skill of the Community Earth System Model-Seasonal-to-Multiyear Large Ensemble in predicting temperature extremes, globally and in all calendar seasons, up to two years ahead. This ensemble of 24 month-long hindcasts enables a comprehensive assessment of interannual predictability, since it is initialized quarterly per year. The study evaluates the capability of the prediction system to forecast the number of days in episodes of extreme temperature anomalies, considering such anomalies in all calendar seasons and studying each forecast season independently. In general, significant predictive skill is found over many regions, depending on the calendar season. As expected, the skill is higher in the first forecast season and generally decreases over time. However, notable skill persists in some regions even up to forecast-season seven. Importantly, in certain regions, significant skill remains up to approximately forecast-season four, even after removing the externally forced signal as estimated from the corresponding uninitialized historical simulations. This suggests that in certain areas, internal variability of the coupled ocean–land–atmosphere system contributes to the predictability of temperature extremes even beyond the seasonal timescale. The role of El Niño–Southern Oscillation as a source of predictability is also assessed and is found to contribute significantly, especially for the boreal winter (DJF) and spring (MAM) up to forecast-season four. However, there is evidence that additional sources of predictability may contribute."

However, access to the high-latitude Arctic Ocean is limited, and satellite data are primarily available only during summer, making continuous in-situ data collection challenging. We collected year-round chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) concentration data in high-latitude regions using a mooring system and performed a comparative analysis with reanalysis data. Unlike previous satellite-based studies, which typically rely on surface measurements, we used the annual vertical distribution of Chl-a. These data were applied to the vertically generalized production model to accurately estimate annual primary production. The moored Chl-a concentration data showed that phytoplankton exhibited a typical subsurface chlorophyll maximum (SCM) layer as sea ice retreated in June. Contrary to the gradually deepening SCM distribution predicted by model-based reanalysis data, the SCM layer persisted for approximately 4 months. This indicates that light and nutrient conditions within the SCM layer remained stable, sustaining continuous phytoplankton growth. Annual primary production, reflecting this vertical distribution of Chl-a concentration, was 6.85 gC m−2 yr−1. This exceeded satellite-based estimates by at least two-fold, highlighting the significant underestimation of primary production by satellite approaches. Estimating primary production while accounting for the vertical distribution of phytoplankton and light is essential for improving ecological models to better understand carbon cycle and food web changes in the Arctic Ocean, with important implications for climate change predictions."

However, there is still uncertainty concerning the nature and magnitude of these changes. In this study, we used open access satellite remote sensing data from ICESat-2 and Landsat to model change in vegetation structure across 183 million hectares of the Canadian forest-tundra ecotone from 1985 to 2021. We used Random Forests models to predict canopy presence and height across six time periods at 30 m spatial resolution. Change between time periods was used to classify nine stable and transitional vegetation types. We used these data to map advance and retreat in the northernmost forest limit and linked change types to disturbance history. Over the study period, the extent of forested area increased by 0.9% and the forest limit warmed by 1.08 °C, receiving 25 mm more annual precipitation. However, large parts of the forest limit remained stable over time despite favorable climate conditions. Our mapping also revealed divergent patterns in forest and shrub expansion across the ecotone, with shrubs exhibiting more widespread and diffuse expansion above the forest limit. Increasing vegetation structure across the ecotone was strongly associated with fire history as 80% of mapped vegetation changes occurred in disturbed areas. The majority of forest growth and new forest expansion occurred in fires that burned over 40 years ago. These findings highlight the importance of disturbance-recovery dynamics in structural vegetation change over decadal time periods."

Yet, the impacts of this rapid warming on extreme runoff events—key to ice mass balance, ecosystem dynamics, and global climate feedbacks—remain poorly quantified. Here, we analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of summer extreme runoff across the permanent land ice Arctic area from 1980 to 2020 based on high-resolution regional climate model simulations (MARv3.11). Extreme runoff is defined as summer runoff exceeding the 90th, 95th, or 99th percentile of modeled runoff distributions, consistent with established climate extreme thresholds. We then identify regional hotspots and quantify changes in the fraction of extreme runoff relative to total summer runoff, as well as shifts in its magnitude and drivers. Greenland contributes to most of the land ice Arctic extreme runoff area, accounting for 63% of the total, followed by Baffin (14%) and Ellesmere (8%). Our results reveal a marked intensification of extreme runoff, most notably in the Western Arctic. The fraction of extreme runoff has significantly increased, particularly in Greenland (+46%), Ellesmere (+38%), and Devon (+31%) (1980–2020 vs 2000–2020). In Ellesmere, the spatial extent of extreme runoff has expanded nearly 400%. Overall, the contribution of extreme runoff to total runoff increased by 20%–30% (1980–2020 vs 2000–2020) across the Arctic, with the largest increases in Ellesmere and Devon. A clear West-East gradient is evident, with statistically significant trends in the Western Arctic and more moderate changes in the East. For example, Iceland and Franz Josef Land show only modest increases in the fraction of extreme runoff (+11% and +2%, respectively). These patterns are consistent across multiple thresholds for extreme runoff (90th, 95th, and 99th percentiles) and remain robust after detrending. This intensification of extreme runoff is linked to increases in anticyclonic circulation in the Western Arctic. The results have far-reaching implications, including increased freshwater discharge into the Arctic Ocean and the potential disruption of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation."

Insights from China’s manufacturing sector","Manufacturing mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A) represent a market-driven mechanism for corporate restructuring that facilitates technology transfer, resource reallocation, and the exchange of management knowledge between heterogeneous corporate owners. Unlike complex multi-departmental carbon policies, M&amp;A networks may offer a more manageable pathway for diffusing cleaner production methods across urban systems. This study examines how manufacturing M&amp;A network centrality affects urban carbon emissions using data from 284 Chinese cities (2004–2018). We uncover an inverted U-shaped relationship between M&amp;A network centrality and emissions, indicating that initial network integration increases emissions before deeper connections enable reductions through operational efficiency improvements and the adoption of clean technologies. Using Apple suppliers as an instrumental variable, we establish that M&amp;A network centrality causally reduces carbon emissions. However, unconditional quantile regression reveals striking heterogeneity: emission reductions occur primarily in cities with low to moderate baseline emissions, while high-emission cities show no significant response. The temporal analysis confirms that M&amp;A effects materialize quickly but diminish over time. These findings suggest that for cities with moderate emissions and substantial network integration, facilitating manufacturing M&amp;A offers a cost-effective complement to traditional environmental policies. However, high-emission cities require more direct interventions beyond market-driven restructuring. This evidence highlights the need for tailored policy approaches that harness spontaneous market mechanisms while taking into account both emission contexts and network positions."

Within the planetary boundary framework, which defines safe operational limits for human activity to sustain the stability of the Earth system, soil moisture plays an essential role as a core component of the water cycle. It governs key ecohydrological processes, regulates land-atmosphere energy exchange, and supports carbon and water cycling, which are vital for climate resilience and biodiversity. This study explores global, regional, and river basin scale changes in soil moisture, hot spot regions of soil moisture change, and its multifaceted influence across several planetary boundaries, particularly those related to freshwater availability, land-system change, and climate regulation. Reanalysis and remote sensing evidence reveal significant declines in soil moisture across major global river basins, driven by intensifying climate change and land use transformations. These shifts signal increasing pressure from human activities on Earth system resilience and highlight the urgent need to integrate soil moisture into global sustainability assessments. Recognizing soil moisture as a dynamic and interconnected boundary variable is essential for enhancing environmental monitoring, maintaining ecological balance, informing policy interventions, and safeguarding the planet’s life-support systems in an era of accelerating change."

In these areas, habitat fragmentation and weak spatial planning and management result in poor connectivity and low protection effectiveness of protected areas (PAs), hindering long-term biodiversity conservation and ecosystem stability. Therefore, based on the evolution of the PA network in the drylands of Central and East Asia from 2000 to 2030, this study integrates circuit theory and the MaxEnt model to systematically assess the protection capacity of PAs. A multi-dimensional optimization model—spatiotemporal change–connectivity–protection effectiveness (SCPE)—is proposed to optimize the PA network from three perspectives: spatial structure, functional performance, and climate adaptability. The results show that network connectivity improves most significantly under the SSP1-2.6 scenario, while protection effectiveness declines across all scenarios, indicating a growing spatial mismatch between PA distribution and biodiversity hotspots. Optimization based on the SCPE model effectively alleviates this mismatch, with the lowest demand for new corridors and buffer zones under SSP1-2.6 and the highest under SSP5-8.5. After optimization, IIC and PC increase by 49.90% and 49.41%, respectively, under SSP1-2.6, significantly enhancing network resilience. The findings demonstrate that the SCPE model, driven by function-oriented strategies, can effectively improve the connectivity and climate responsiveness of PA networks. This provides scientific support for adaptive conservation planning under climate change and offers practical tools for biodiversity conservation in dryland ecosystems."

Here, we assess future trajectories of UIWC using an ensemble of simulations under a sustainable development pathway (SSP1-2.6) and a high-emissions pathway (SSP5-8.5), projecting changes through each decade until 2100. The baseline estimate of global UIWC is 458 km3 yr−1. Global UIWC is projected to increase under climate change, but multi-model projections show substantial uncertainty. By 2100, estimates range from 458 to 546 km3 yr−1 under the low-emission SSP1-2.6 scenario, and from 456 to 638 km3 yr−1 under the high-emission SSP5-8.5 scenario, highlighting divergent future outcomes depending on emissions pathways and model assumptions. Under baseline conditions, the Ganges, Sabarmati, and Indus basins have the highest UIWC. Climate change scenarios show divergent regional trends, with the SSP5-8.5 scenario projecting larger increases in UIWC—especially in the Ganges, Indus, and US High Plains—compared to SSP1-2.6. These increases reflect both greater climate impacts and higher model uncertainty. Normalizing UIWC by irrigated area reveals hotspots of irrigation pressure, particularly in South Asia and the Nile Delta, where per-area UIWC exceeds 50 mm yr−1, and is projected to rise further under both scenarios.

In the US, this ecologically important species is listed as ‘threatened’ under the Endangered Species Act because of population declines from compound stressors, including climate change, introduced white pine blister rust (WPBR), widespread outbreaks of mountain pine beetle, and altered fire regimes. Species recovery depends primarily on planting WBP seedlings that are resistant to WPBR, but suitable planting locations are likely to shift under climate warming. We modeled and mapped WBP climatic suitability in the US using forest inventory data and fine-scale (∼220 m) climate datasets under reference period (1961–1990) and mid-21st century climatic conditions. We projected an 80% reduction in the area climatically suitable for WBP by the mid-21st century. Moreover, 75% of the climatically suitable area for WBP under mid-21st century climate is located in designated wilderness areas and national parks. This could challenge WBP recovery efforts, as these protected areas strive to reduce human manipulation of ecological systems. WBP climate suitability maps resulting from our models can be used to identify priority or ‘target areas’ where planting will have the highest likelihood of success and to identify areas within the WPB’s current range that are most vulnerable to rapid change should high-severity wildfires or mountain pine beetle outbreaks occur.

In this study, we present in vitro evidence of PFDA-induced immunotoxicity and gain insight into underlying molecular mechanisms. PFDA induced immune dysfunction in zebrafish primarily through immunosuppression, apoptosis, and inflammatory response which further cascaded to suppress innate and adaptive immunities, ultimately weaking the ability of larvae to defend against pathogenic infection. PFDA-induced immunotoxicity was driven by a dysregulation in the toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathway, which was validated through a cotreatment of PFDA with either a morpholino knockdown or inhibitor of myeloid differentiation factor 88. Comparative toxicity studies were carried out with a subset of other alternative PFAS (PFBA, PFOA, PFNA) and it was found that PFDA posed a greater immunotoxic response than other commonly identified PFAS in the environment.

These findings strengthen the evidence for interactions between ENSO and the QBO, highlighting the role of the seasonal cycle, and may be relevant to the interactions of the QBO and the Madden‐Julian Oscillation."

Detrital multi‐mineral provenance analysis of the Oligocene–Miocene strata in the intermontane Wuyu Basin provides new key information on the paleodrainage evolution in response to topographic changes. A Qiangtang source affinity is inferred by detrital apatite and zircon provenance, indicating a distal major eastern source at 31 Ma. The west‐flowing drainage system implies Oligocene lowlands in the Gangdese arc, probably related to regional subsidence. The shift of provenance to Linzizong volcanic rocks indicates that the Gangdese arc underwent uplift since 23 Ma, which became rapid at 15 Ma due to complete delamination of the subducted Indian continental lithosphere, as inferred by abundant syn‐sedimentary zircon and apatite. The accelerated uplift and topographic changes provide independent constraints on the Tibetan Plateau growth and associated geodynamic processes."

We analyzed 30 years of shoreline observations at Hasaki Beach, Japan, using Discrete Wavelet Transform to separate variation by timescale. Spectral analysis revealed wave‐driven annual and semi‐annual cycles, while long‐term trends contributed significantly to total variance. The ShoreFor model, when calibrated using the full 30‐year data set, severely underestimated seasonal variability. In contrast, 2‐year calibration windows successfully reproduced seasonal variations both within calibration periods and, after DWT‐based detrending, across the entire 30‐year validation period. Our findings demonstrate that short‐window calibration substantially enhances model capability for capturing wave‐driven seasonal shoreline changes, offering a practical solution for coastal risk assessment using limited observational data. This approach is particularly valuable given increasing availability of satellite‐derived shoreline data and the need for accurate seasonal predictions under changing climate conditions."

Modeling this fracture evolution depends on a threshold parameter representing the strength of ice. However, the value of ice strength is treated as fixed in space and time despite evidence that it evolves with ice material properties. We investigate the effect of evolving ice strength as a function of ice grain size, the average size of ice crystals, on fracture evolution and estimates of mass loss from Pine Island Glacier. Coupling ice strength to grain size produces temporal and spatial variation in ice strength and, consequently, different spatial patterns in fracture density than using a constant ice strength. This enhances mass loss and may explain the discrepancy between ice strength estimates in ice sheet observations and laboratory experiments. These results suggest the importance of understanding the evolution of ice material properties and its role in ice fracture."

Cluster satellite observation reveals chorus propagating quasi‐parallelly at high latitudes and ULF waves. Chorus intensity enhancements correlate with refractive index increases driven by the ULF wave‐induced electron density and magnetic field variations. The theoretical maximum wave normal angle for duct propagation agrees with observed angles. The ray‐tracing calculations, using observation‐based duct models, reproduce ducted propagation, showing the consistent relation between frequencies and wave normal angles with the observation. These findings indicate that ULF waves create ducts guiding chorus waves to high latitudes and modulate chorus intensity in the time scale of the ULF wave period. This ULF wave ducting mechanism may explain chorus wave distribution and ULF wave‐modulated electron precipitation/aurora, providing new insights into wave‐particle interactions in radiation belts."

We detect an anomalous North‐South oriented gravity signal in the Eastern Atlantic Ocean in January 2007, evolving at timescales of few years and less.

In this study, we synthesized a new hcp‐structured Fe‐C‐H alloy (FeC0.065H1.05) at high pressure using the laser‐heated diamond anvil cell. Hydrogen incorporation significantly expands the volume and decreases the bulk modulus of hcp Fe and Fe‐C alloy (FeC0.065).

Furthermore, the incorporation of carbon and hydrogen considerably decreases the density of hcp Fe. 0.3–0.7 wt.% H and 0.2–0.5 wt.% C in Fe alloys could account for the observed density deficit of the inner core with 7,000–5,000 K inner core boundary temperature.

We investigate these differences through analyzing amip‐piForcing output, focusing on low cloud feedback. Time‐variation in low cloud feedback results primarily from the SST pattern, mediated by changes in near‐global lower tropospheric stability (LTS). We investigate the meteorological factors contributing to low cloud feedback variation through the cloud controlling factor analysis method, diagnosing cloud radiative sensitivities from 16 CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, and an observational constraint from MODIS. We find the radiative sensitivity of models to LTS in the stratocumulus regions dominates the magnitude of cloud feedback time variation due to the pattern effect.

Despite its importance, how to enhance radial displacement efficiency of non‐Newtonian fluids in rough fractures remains rarely reported. Here, by conducting visualization experiments of shear‐thinning fluids radially displacing silicone oil in a rough fracture, we report a novel transition in displacement patterns from capillary fingering to compact displacement (CD) to viscous fingering with increasing injection rate, which differs from conventional expectations for Newtonian fluids. This transition induces a non‐monotonic variation in displacement efficiency, thereby enabling potential control of displacement performance. We further propose theoretical models to predict the transition and identify the optimal range of flow rate for maximizing displacement efficiency, with model predictions showing good agreement with experimental observations.

 Permafrost regions contain a substantial fraction of Earth’s soil nitrogen, which is vulnerable to climate change. The response of this crucial N stock to warming could impact the permafrost–climate feedback by altering plant productivity, microbial decomposition and nitrous oxide emissions. However, the long-term trajectory of soil N stocks in response to warming remains unclear. Here we present results from a ten-year field warming experiment in a permafrost ecosystem on the Tibetan Plateau. We made repeated measurements of soil N stocks to 50 cm depth and assessed 28 N-cycling variables to explore three primary pathways affecting soil N stocks, including N inputs, microbial N transformations and N losses. Our results reveal that, despite no changes being observed during the initial years of the experiment, warmed plots experienced a decline in surface soil N stocks (an average 7.7% reduction relative to control plots) after eight years of warming. This decrease is associated with the enhanced N sequestration in perennial plant biomass, increased ecosystem N leaching and gaseous N losses from soils. Our findings underscore the vulnerability of soil N stocks in permafrost regions to ongoing warming, and suggest that the potential permafrost–climate feedback may be stronger than previously anticipated.

Here, the authors analyse the homeostatic turnover of cDC subsets in the intestine from tissue entry to migration to the draining lymph nodes, noting a dynamic life cycle with changes in transcriptome and proliferation rates. 
 Conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) are important antigen presenting cells which link innate and adaptive immunity by transferring antigenic information from peripheral organs to T cells in lymph nodes (LNs). However, despite their central function in the induction of adaptive immune responses, the kinetics and molecular regulation of the cDC life cycle and migration remain poorly understood. Using a variety of in vivo techniques, we examine the kinetics of cDC turnover in the intestine and address the molecular changes throughout the various stages of the cDC life cycle – from tissue entry and differentiation to CCR7 upregulation and subsequent migration into draining LNs. Our data demonstrate that the life cycle of gut cDCs is highly dynamic, characterised by continuous alterations in transcriptome, protein expression and proliferation rates. These progressive changes culminate in cDC homeostatic activation and migration resulting in a resource-intensive daily turnover of up to a quarter of intestinal cDCs and an almost complete daily replacement of the migratory cDC compartment in the mesenteric LN. This high turnover rate ensures that the mesenteric LN maintains an accurate reflection of the intestinal immunological state, supporting rapid adaptation to emerging immune challenges.

 Proprotein convertases (PCs), including furin and PC1/3 among nine mammalian homologues, mediate the maturation of numerous secreted substrates by proteolytic cleavage. Disbalance of PC activity is associated with diseases like cancer, fibrosis, neurodegeneration and infections. Therefore, PCs are promising drug targets for the treatment of many diseases. However, the highly conserved active site of PCs complicates the development of specific inhibitors. Here we investigate the activation mechanism of PCs using X-ray crystallography and biochemical methods. The structure-based optimization of the multibasic secondary cleavage site loop not only prevents the prodomain’s proteolytic cleavage but also increases its inhibition of furin. Combination of cleavage-resistant PC1/3-prodomain variants and a furin-specific nanobody in fusion proteins reveal very potent inhibitors (Ki = 1.2 pM) with a more than 25,000-fold higher specificity for furin compared to the closely related PC-member PCSK5.

Here, the authors use nanoscale electron diffraction mapping and in situ transmission electron microscopy to study the self-reinforcement mechanism of isoprene rubber with silica nanoparticles during stretching. 
 Strain-induced crystallisation in elastomers markedly increases their elastic moduli and rupture resistance. However, the mechanisms underlying this self-reinforcement in filled elastomers remain unclear owing to the nanoscale nature of the involved processes. Herein, isoprene rubber with/without silica nanoparticles is stretched to strains of >5 and concomitantly imaged via in situ transmission electron microscopy. Nanoscale electron diffraction mapping and in situ transmission electron microscopy results reveal that the self-reinforcement mechanism depends on the filler presence/absence. The unfilled isoprene rubber exhibits a spatially homogeneous strain-induced crystallisation behaviour resulting in drastic elastic modulus enhancement above the crystallisation onset strain. In contrast, the silica-filled isoprene rubber displays preferential crystallite formation in highly stressed regions along the silica aggregates aligned in the stretching direction. This reinforces the stress propagation pathways within the material and results in a lower crystallisation onset strain and higher rupture strength than those of the unfilled system. The insights on the role of fillers in determining strain-induced crystallisation phenomena and mechanical properties facilitate the rational design and development of elastomers. The mechanism underlying the increase in elastic moduli and rupture resistance upon strain-induced crystallization in elastomers remains unclear.

 Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales pose a critical global health threat, exemplified by increasing resistance of uropathogenic E. coli (UPEC) that cause urinary tract infections (UTIs). Here, we investigate the publicly available EnteroBase dataset and identify a signal of increasing UTI caused by phylogroup A E. coli sequence type 167 (ST167). Phylogenetic analysis of ST167 based on whole genome sequence data reveal three major clades (A, B, C), with clade C further resolving into several subclades, notably subclade C2 that possessed high carriage rates of carbapenem and cephalosporin resistance genes. Hierarchical clustering of core genome multi-locus sequence typing reveals ~77% of subclade C2 strains contain <20 allelic differences in 2,513 core genes and harbour two distinct group 1 capsule types, KL124 and KL30, likely originating from Klebsiella. Subclade C2 was predominantly sequenced in North America, and we provide evidence for clonal expansion since 2016. Analysis of UPEC virulence factors reveals complete loss of the type 1 fimbriae genes in strains from clades B and C. Two subclade C2 isolates exhibit significantly reduced capacity to colonise the bladder compared to the reference UPEC strain CFT073 in a murine UTI model.

Here the authors evaluate the relative ecological risks posed by marine plastic globally through different exposure pathways including ingestion, entanglement, pollutant adsorption and additive leaching. 
 Plastic pollution poses serious ecological risks to marine organisms through various pathways, yet a comprehensive risk assessment is lacking. Here we assess the global risks of plastic ingestion, entanglement, pollutant adsorption (methylmercury, MeHg; perfluorooctane sulfonate, PFOS) and additive leaching (bisphenol A; phthalate esters) by integrating a marine plastic model and multisize marine organism data, as well as MeHg and PFOS datasets. Our analysis reveals that ingestion risks vary with the body size of organisms, and are influenced by both biomass distribution and plastic concentration patterns. Entanglement hotspots align with regions of flourishing coastal fisheries, highlighting a substantial threat to marine species. Ingestion risks and toxicity from leached additives are concentrated in the mid-latitude North Pacific Ocean, mid-latitude Atlantic Ocean and northern Indian Ocean. Plastics exhibit high adsorption of PFOS in the North Atlantic and East and Southeast Asian coasts (0.1–0.3 pg m−2) and of MeHg in the northern Indian and southwestern Atlantic oceans (1–18 pg m−2). Using future emission scenarios, we project plastic concentrations and estimate reduced risks under emission control strategies. These findings emphasize the urgent need for targeted mitigation efforts and policy interventions to curb escalating impacts of plastic pollution on marine ecosystems.

 Arctic amplification (AA), the disproportionate Arctic warming versus hemispheric or global averages, impacts mid-latitude climate.

This study investigates the variability of the AA ratio within a long-term transient simulation encompassing the past glacial-interglacial period. We find a strong link between the AA phenomenon and North Atlantic sea ice changes driven by ice-albedo feedback, yielding a stable AA ratio of 2.5 ± 0.8 throughout the last 21,000 years. The current observed AA ratio, slightly lower than 2.5, indicates the combined effect of sea ice melt-induced AA added to the greenhouse gas-induced global warming. We hypothesize that as Arctic sea ice rapidly diminishes, or even disappears, the sea ice-induced AA phenomenon will weaken substantially, reflected in the AA ratio approaching 1.0 within the next 1–2 centuries, even as global warming persists."

Through observational analyses and model experiments, we demonstrate that the tropical Atlantic and Pacific exerted minimal influence on TC genesis over the WNP. In contrast, the pIOD played a dominant role in suppressing TC activities over the central WNP, where the decline was most pronounced. Specifically, the pIOD induced easterly wind anomalies over the Indo-western Pacific, leading to descending anomalies over the WNP that inhibited TC genesis.

 The oxygen fugacity (hereafter referred as fO2) of terrestrial planets is key in defining the outcome of planetary-scale differentiation and the planets’ potential habitability. Reconstructing the initial fO2 records in the mantle right after core formation for terrestrial planets remain challenging due to frequent secondary modifications. Here, we show based on studies of ureilites and diogenites that measurable Ti isotope fractionation occurred during melt extraction from planetary mantle in the presence of Ti3+, and demonstrate that Ti isotopes can serve as a fO2 tracer of planetary mantle reservoirs. We also show a positive correlation between the 49Ti/47Ti and La/Yb ratios for shergottites, which, when integrated with chronological constraints, imply the occurrence of Ti isotope fractionations arising from the presence of Ti3+ during early mantle differentiation of Mars. Further constraints define reducing conditions of ~ΔIW–0.8 to ~ΔIW–1.6 for early-formed martian mantle reservoirs at ~4.5 Ga. This fO2 estimate coincides with the lowest recommended values from martian meteorites, that of core-mantle differentiation for Mars and of diogenites, but is more oxidizing than that of ureilites. Mantle outgassing under these conditions would result in a reducing primordial atmosphere that is in stark contrast with Mars’ current CO2-dominated atmosphere.

 Vegetation phenology regulates the inter-annual variations in carbon and water dynamics in terrestrial ecosystems, and serves as a key indicator of vegetation-climate interaction. Chinese FengYun-3D satellite multi-channel passive microwave measurements are responsive to seasonal changes of vegetation structure and internal water status, and have a daily global coverage under both clear and cloudy skies, offering valuable and complementary phenological information to optical-infrared measurements. However, no studies have yet explored their potential for global phenology extraction. Here we evaluated the capability of Normalized Emissivity Difference Vegetation index (NEDVI), which was derived from FengYun-3D X- and Ka- band microwaves, to extract forest and grass phenological dates in the Northern Hemisphere, including the start, end and length of the growing season (SOS, EOS and LOS). By testing three phenology models and two extraction methods at 31 flux sites from 2020 to 2022, NEDVI-derived SOS, EOS and LOS were found to be significantly correlated with those derived from in-situ gross primary production (GPP). No single model or extraction method can produce an absolutely superior accuracy in extracting phenological dates, while use of multi-model mean may greatly reduce the uncertainties. NEDVI-based relative threshold extraction method showed an overall bias of less than 2 days in the phenological dates when considering the multi-model average, outperforming the maximum rate of curvature method. Performances of the time series of NEDVI are overall better for the extraction of SOS than EOS, and are also comparable to those of MODIS and VIIRS global phenology products. Spatial patterns and latitudinal variations in NEDVI-derived phenology align with the two optical phenology products in the Northern Hemisphere. In evergreen forest types, NEDVI-derived SOS, EOS and LOS tend to present earlier, later and longer than those from MODIS and VIIRS, respectively. In addition, the product of NEDVI-derived growing season length and maximum carbon uptake capacity can better explain annual GPP variation across forest and grass sites (R2 =0.43) compared to that of MODIS (R2 =0.19) and VIIRS (R2 =0.37). These findings demonstrate that FengYun-3D microwave NEDVI is promising for global retrievals of phenological dates. We also highlight that using the multi-model mean, instead of relying on a single model, can greatly enhance the robustness of microwave-based phenology extraction with lower uncertainty."

 Space-borne interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is a useful technique to generate or update digital elevation models (DEMs) over large regions. Specifical InSAR missions for DEM generation/update currently work in bistatic mode. The bistatic InSAR satellites have a low temporal coverage, causing the difficulty to keep DEM products up to date. InSAR satellites working in a repeat-pass mode can offer numerous data sources with a short temporal coverage, offering a great potential to frequently update DEMs to keep DEM valid with time. However, the accuracy of repeat-pass InSAR DEMs using the existing algorithms is too low for practical uses currently. To circumvent this, we proposed a new method to frequently update DEMs from repeat-pass InSAR datasets, in order to improve update accuracy. Firstly, multi-track repeat-pass InSAR datasets were utilized to offer more redundant observations to mitigate InSAR noises. A new quantitative model was then developed to scientifically guide the exclusion of multi-track interferograms with very short spatial baselines, in order to further reduce the propagation of InSAR errors into DEM products. Thirdly, a robust variance component estimation (RVCE) algorithm, which can adaptively weight multi-track InSAR observations and automatically exclude outliers, was used to dynamically update the DEMs. The proposed method was tested over the Hambach open-pit mine in Germany. The results show that the mean accuracy of the updated DEMs is about 8.7 m, demonstrating a 60 % improvement over classical single-track repeat-pass InSAR techniques. The proposed method offers a new option to frequently update DEMs, especially over areas with changes of surface terrain."

Mitchard,Multimodal deep learning enables forest height mapping from patchy spaceborne LiDAR using SAR and passive optical satellite data,"•GEDI relative heights strongly correlate with field-measured dominant tree height. •A multimodal framework, MARSNet, effectively integrates multisource remote sensing data. •Forest height map generated by MARSNet shows high accuracy validated by field data. •MARSNet with Sentinel-2 exceeds traditional machine learning using multiple datasets in accuracy. 
 Accurate estimation of forest height plays a pivotal role in mapping carbon stocks from space. Spaceborne LiDARs give accurate spot estimates of forest canopy height, but sample only a tiny fraction of the landscape. The gaps must therefore be filled using other satellite remote sensing data. Although several studies have employed machine learning methods to produce wall-to-wall forest height maps, they have generally overlooked the distinct characteristics of various remote sensing data sources and have not fully exploited the potential benefits of multisource remote sensing integration. In this study, we propose a novel deep learning framework termed the multimodal attention remote sensing network (MARSNet) to extrapolate dominant heights derived from Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI), using Sentinel-1 C-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, Advanced Land Observing Satellite-2 (ALOS-2) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar-2 (PALSAR-2) data, and Sentinel-2 passive optical data. MARSNet comprises separate encoders for each remote sensing data modality to extract multi-scale features, and a shared decoder to fuse the features and estimate height. Using individual encoders for each remote sensing data source avoids interference across modalities and extracts distinct representations. To focus on the useful information from each dataset, we reduce the prevalent spatial and layer redundancies in each remote sensing data by incorporating the extended spatial and layer reconstruction convolution (ESLConv) modules in the encoders. MARSNet achieves good performance in estimating dominant height, with a R2 of 0.62 and RMSE of 2.82 m on test data, outperforming the widely used random forest (RF) approach which attained an R2 of 0.55 and RMSE of 3.05 m using the same layers. We demonstrate the efficacy of the MARSNet modules and the expansion of data sources for improving dominant height estimation through network ablation studies and data ablation studies. Finally, we apply the trained MARSNet model to generate wall-to-wall maps at 10 m resolution for Jilin province, China. Through independent validation using field measurements, MARSNet demonstrates an R2 of 0.54 and RMSE of 3.76 m, compared to 0.39 and 4.37 m for the RF baseline model. Additionally, MARSNet effectively mitigates the common tendency of RF models to overestimate in low height areas and underestimate in high canopy areas (low sensitivity). Our research demonstrates the effectiveness of a multimodal deep learning approach fusing GEDI with SAR and passive optical imagery for enhancing the accuracy of high-resolution dominant height estimation. This method shows promise for enabling accurate large-scale forest height mapping in areas where high-quality ground data are available, potentially revolutionizing our understanding of global forest structure and carbon stocks."

 Scene classification plays a critical role in remote sensing image analysis, with numerous methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs) developed to improve performance on high-resolution remote sensing (HRRS) imagery. However, the existing models struggle with several key challenges, including effectively capturing fine-grained local features and modeling long-range spatial dependencies in complex scenes. These limitations reduce the discriminative power of extracted features, which is critical for HRRS image classification. To overcome these issues, our study aims to design a unified model that jointly leverages local information extraction, global context modeling, and long-range dependency learning. We propose a novel architecture, ViCxLSTM, designed to enhance feature discriminability for HRRS scene classification. ViCxLSTM is a hybrid model that integrates a Local Pattern Unit (comprising convolutional layers and Fourier Transforms), an extended Long Short-Term Memory module (xLSTM), and a Vision Transformer. This integrated architecture enables the model to capture a wide range of spatial patterns, from local textures to long-range dependencies and global contextual relationships. Experimental evaluations show that ViCxLSTM achieves superior classification performance across diverse land use datasets, outperforming several state-of-the-art models, including ResNet-50, ResNet-101, ResNet-152, ViT, LeViT, CrossViT, DeepViT, and CaiT.

 As a novel and challenging task, referring segmentation combines computer vision and natural language processing to localise and segment objects based on textual descriptions. While Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) has been extensively studied in natural images, little attention has been given to aerial imagery, particularly from Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The unique challenges of UAV imagery, including complex spatial scales, occlusions, and varying object orientations, render existing RIS approaches ineffective. A key limitation has been the lack of UAV-specific datasets, as manually annotating pixel-level masks and generating textual descriptions is labour-intensive and time-consuming. To address this gap, we design an automatic labelling pipeline that leverages pre-existing UAV segmentation datasets and the Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLM) for generating textual descriptions. Furthermore, we propose Aerial Referring Transformer (AeroReformer), a novel framework for UAV Referring Image Segmentation (UAV-RIS), featuring a Vision-Language Cross-Attention Module (VLCAM) for effective cross-modal understanding and a Rotation-Aware Multi-Scale Fusion (RAMSF) decoder to enhance segmentation accuracy in aerial scenes.

 Vertical wind plays a crucial role in convection and cloud processes, transporting mass and momentum to the upper troposphere and stratosphere. Very high frequency wind profiling radars uniquely measure vertical wind velocity profiles under all weather conditions. This study examines ten years of observed vertical wind using wind profiler over a tropical station, Gadanki, to characterize draft cores and vertical wind patterns pertinent to convection episodes. Downdraft cores (764) outnumber updraft cores (484), with core properties following a lognormal distribution favoring stronger updraft intensities. Over 70 % of updrafts and 90 % of downdrafts have maximum value below 5 m s−1, and only 12 % persist beyond 15 min. Updrafts show significant vertical variation above 5 km, unlike downdrafts. Among convective types—shallow, congestus, and deep—congestus are most frequent, while deep cores are less common. The velocity difference between shallow and deep updraft cores is 7 m s−1 as compared to 1.64 m s−1 for downdrafts, indicating predominantly stronger updrafts overall. During the southwest and northeast monsoon seasons, weaker updrafts and downdrafts occur at lower altitudes, gradually increasing with height. Pre-monsoon updraft profiles exhibit prominent double peaks near 5.0 km and 13.5 km altitude, whereas, during the monsoon and post-monsoon periods, single peaks prevail around 10 km and 11 km, respectively. Seasonally, congestus cores (∼20 %) exhibit the highest occurrence in the post-monsoon and the lowest in the pre-monsoon. The observational vertical structure of convective dynamics over a tropical station unravels the realistic updraft and downdraft core magnitudes pertinent to tropical convection."

 Investigating radar reflectivity profiles below the freezing level helps improve surface rainfall estimation. In South China, stratiform rain is common, but the microphysical processes and key factors behind its vertical structure variations are still unclear. Based on ground-based dual-frequency radar observations from Longmen in South China, this study categorizes stratiform precipitation into three types: growth, stable, and evaporative, and examines their formation mechanisms. The results indicate that growth-type precipitation is primarily driven by weak updrafts (0 ∼ 0.5 m/s), which prolong the residence time of raindrops in the warm cloud layer (temperature above 0 °C), enhancing coalescence growth and leading to increased reflectivity to ground. Stable-type precipitation occurs in a high-humidity environment (>90%), which suppresses raindrop evaporation, resulting in minimal vertical variation in the reflectivity profile. In contrast, evaporative-type precipitation is closely associated with lower relative humidity (70%∼90%), with a pronounced decrease in reflectivity. Although both stable and evaporative precipitation are accompanied by downdraft (0 ∼ 0.5 m/s), the difference in relative humidity (maximum difference exceeds 20%) is the key factor driving the distinct reflectivity profile between the two types, while the influence of air motion is relatively secondary."

Here we show the sea surface temperature variability peaking in boreal winter over the equatorial Atlantic, dubbed as winter Atlantic Niño/Niña, regulates ENSO decay pace via modulating trans-basin Walker circulation. Both observational analyses and pacemaker experiments demonstrates that El Niños concurrent with preceding winter Atlantic Niño would decay rapidly, while those with a winter Atlantic Niña tend to decay slowly. Analogously, La Niñas would undergo a prolonged attenuation following a winter Atlantic Niño but evanish rapidly following a winter Atlantic Niña. Our results highlight the winter Atlantic Niño/Niña as a crucial factor modulating ENSO decay pace, offering valuable insights for improving seasonal forecasts of ENSO evolution in decaying phase."

We find that longer duration extreme events with a 1-in-10 year return period in Historical simulations, will begin to occur at least every other year across the majority of the country by the mid 21st-century under a SSP2-4.5 warming scenario, with shorter duration events emerging more slowly. Once model-specific warming rates are accounted for, we find a consistent pattern of accelerated warming for the hottest days of the year, with each degree of annual-mean warming over the wider New Zealand region resulting in approximately 1.6 ∘C of change in the hottest days of the year. Importantly, we find evidence of heat extremes intensifying much faster than mean warming across many regions of inland New Zealand, contradicting past claims of muted changes based on coarse resolution global climate models. Finally, we examine a model-based example of a physically plausible record-shattering heatwave capable of occurring in the present climate, with five-day temperature anomalies exceeding +10 ∘C over large parts of the North Island."

Our model simulations predict around a 10 % increase in the particle and cloud droplet number concentrations when doubling the emissions in the Manaus region in the Amazonian wet season. However, the corresponding changes in cloud water and rain mass are around 4 %. Such a weak response implies that this convective environment is not sensitive to the localized anthropogenic emission changes here. 
 Anthropogenic emissions have been shown to affect new particle formation, aerosol concentrations, and clouds. Such effects vary with region, environmental conditions, and cloud types. In the wet season of Amazonia, anthropogenic emissions emitted from Manaus, Brazil, can significantly increase the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations compared to the background of mainly natural aerosols. However, the regional response of cloud and rain to anthropogenic emissions in Amazonia remains very uncertain. Here, we aim to quantify how aerosol concentration, cloud, and rain respond to changes in anthropogenic emissions through parameterized new particle formation and primary aerosol emission in the Manaus region and to understand the underlying mechanisms. We ran the atmosphere-only configuration of the HadGEM3 climate model with a nested regional domain that covers most of the rainforest region (720 km by 1200 km with 3 km resolution) under scaled regional emissions. The 7 d simulations show that, in the areas that are affected by anthropogenic emissions, when aerosol and precursor gas emissions are doubled from the baseline emission inventories, aerosol number concentrations increase by 13 %. The nucleation rate that involves sulfuric acid and biogenic compounds generally increases with pollution levels. However, nucleation is suppressed very close to the pollution source, resulting in lower nucleation and soluble Aitken mode aerosol number concentrations. We also found that doubling the anthropogenic emission can increase the cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd) by 9 %, but cloud water and rain mass mixing ratios do not change significantly. Even very strong reductions in aerosol number concentrations by a factor of 4, which is an unrealistic condition, cause only a 4 % increase in rain over the domain. If we assume our simulation has a fine enough grid resolution and an accurate representation of the relevant atmospheric processes, the simulated weak and non-linear response of cloud and rain properties to linearly scaled anthropogenic emissions suggests that the interactions among aerosol, cloud, and precipitation in the Amazonian convective environment are buffered by microphysical processes. It also implies that the convective environment is resilient to the changes in Nd that occur in response to localized anthropogenic aerosol perturbations."

We therefore measured soil physical and hydraulic properties (n = 1300) at seven field sites (Thames catchment, UK). The sites cover a range of geologies, land use, and management. Dataset applications include hydrological and land surface modelling and validation of remote sensing observations. The dataset also provides a baseline against which future soil changes may be compared. 
 Observational data on soil physical and hydraulic properties are important for improving our understanding of hydrological processes. This is particularly relevant given current interest in the potential of land-based “natural flood management” measures (and related concepts: “nature-based solutions” and “working with natural processes”) to reduce flood risk. Therefore, a detailed survey of seven field sites under different land uses and management practices in the Thames catchment, UK, was undertaken as part of the LANDWISE project. Measurements (n = 1300) included soil surface infiltration rate, saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, estimated porosity, soil moisture, and soil moisture retention. Field sites comprised three arable fields on shallow soils over limestone, two arable fields on free-draining loamy soils over chalk, and permanent grassland and broadleaf woodland on slowly permeable soil over mudstone. Soil sampling points covered infield areas, trafficked areas (e.g. tramlines), and untrafficked margins. Samples were generally taken at five depths ranging from the soil surface to 100 cm below ground level. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements were made at 25 and 45 cm depths. Soil samples and measurements were taken between April and October 2021, with repeats taken pre- and post-harvest (arable sites).

 Extreme sea levels, generated by storm surges and high tides, can cause coastal flooding and erosion. Global datasets have been instrumental in mapping extreme sea levels and associated societal risks.

This is an extension of a previously published dataset that covered a shorter period (1979–2018). Using this dataset, we estimate extreme sea levels globally. Validation shows good agreement between observed and modelled extreme sea levels, with the level of agreement for the extended dataset being very similar to that of the previously published dataset. The extended 75-year dataset allows for a more robust estimation of return periods, often resulting in smaller uncertainties than its 40-year precursor.

The statistical atmospheric model is based on singular value decomposition (SVD), capturing interannual relationships of atmospheric perturbations such as wind stress and freshwater flux anomalies with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. The model is constructed in a flexible way so that various components representing atmospheric forcing and oceanic biogeochemistry can be easily included as a module in the HCMROMS. Results demonstrate that the HCMROMS can simulate a stable quasi-3-year ENSO cycle when the interannual wind stress coupling coefficient, ατ, is set to 1.5. The HCMROMS reproduces the three-dimensional (3D) evolution of ENSO-related anomalies, revealing that the most pronounced temperature anomalies occur beneath the surface at 150 m. The interannual temperature anomaly budget highlights the dominance of the advection process in simulated ENSO. Vertical mixing contributes negatively to ENSO anomalies, damping temperature anomalies from the surface due to the turbulent heat flux feedback. This newly developed HCMROMS is poised to serve as an efficient modeling tool for ENSO research in the future."

Existing approaches are often too slow, especially when analyzing complex data like radiation maps. Our method combines techniques to simplify these maps and predict them quickly using statistical tools. This approach could help authorities respond faster and more accurately in emergencies, reducing risks to the population and the environment. 
 Uncertainty estimation is a key issue in nuclear crisis situations. Probabilistic methods for taking uncertainties into account in assessments are often costly in terms of the number of simulations and computation time. This is why emulation methods, which enable rapid estimation of numerical model outputs, represent a promising solution. However, in the context of radioactive dispersion modeling, existing emulators are mostly limited to scalar outputs. In a crisis context, decisions are often based on dose maps, which are mathematically represented by high-dimensional data. In this study, we use the auto-associative model method to reduce the dimension of dose results and then predict these reduced representations using kriging. We also compare this prediction method with others used by the French Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection Authority (ASNR) to predict the consequences of a nuclear accident."

While MPs’ fate and transport have been studied extensively, the adsorption of eDNA onto polymer surfaces and its persistence remain less understood. Here, we systematically studied eDNA adsorption onto poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polyethylene (PE), and silica (Si) surfaces, where the latter material was used as a proxy for comparison to natural particles. Using quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), the impact of varying ionic conditions that mimic freshwater and seawater environments was analyzed for adsorption rate and extent. The role of cations, particularly divalent ions such as Ca2+, in promoting eDNA adsorption through cation bridging was particularly important. PET exhibited the highest adsorption rates, followed by those of PE and Si. Adsorption of eDNA in seawater led to thicker and more rigid adlayers compared with freshwater conditions. However, eDNA adlayers were susceptible to enzymatic degradation and replacement by DNase in both freshwater and seawater, suggesting limited protection from decay. Consequently, the longevity and potential for transfer of material over time and distance are brought into question. This study provides insights into the adsorption mechanisms and stability of eDNA on MPs, advancing our understanding of how MPs influence the transport and persistence of genetic material, including antibiotic-resistant genes, in aquatic environments."

However, the long-term impact of chronic dietary exposure to environmentally relevant IMI doses on kidney health has not been fully elucidated, particularly regarding its nephrotoxic mechanisms. To address this gap, chronic exposure to IMI was administered to mice through supplementation of their feed with environmentally relevant doses (approximately 100 and 1000 μg/kg/day) for 24 weeks to investigate its nephrotoxicity and underlying mechanisms. Toxicological analysis revealed that chronic IMI exposure led to renal dysfunction, histopathological alterations, and excessive apoptosis in mice. Mechanistic investigations suggested that IMI might inhibit AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity through both direct and indirect pathways. Direct inhibition occurred through the binding of IMI and its metabolites to AMPK, reducing its phosphorylation activity. Indirect inhibition involved excessive production of reactive oxygen species, which suppressed AMPK phosphorylation, leading to sustained purine metabolism dysregulation in the renal system. Consequently, the kidneys showed an aggravated redox imbalance, heightened inflammatory states, and increased cellular apoptosis.

Compared to the dark oxidation of Cr(OH)3 by O2, photoirradiation enhanced Cr(VI) production in both aqueous and frozen solutions. In the presence of natural organic matter (NOM), the photoproduction of Cr(VI) was significantly promoted in aqueous solution but hindered in frozen solution. Photosensitized NOM induced the production of H2O2 that played the dual roles of enhancing Cr(OH)3 oxidation in aqueous solution and accelerating Cr(VI) reduction in frozen solution. The in situ generated Cr(VI) in the Cr(OH)3/NOM/UV system was gradually accumulated during the repeated cycles of aqueous–frozen phase transitions and light–dark variations, which confirms that the stable Cr(OH)3 can be a source of natural Cr(VI) under realistic environmental conditions. The photooxidative dissolution of Cr(OH)3 is proposed to involve the complex formation between dissolved Cr(OH)4– and O2, which subsequently undergoes the photoinduced charge transfer, resulting in the oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) with the concurrent reduction of O2 to H2O2 via •O2–. A similar mechanistic behavior was also observed with FexCr1–x(OH)3 (x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) for the photooxidative production of Cr(VI).

Molecular docking revealed direct 8:2 diPAP-JAK2 binding, and Western blot analysis showed decreased hepatic Jak2 expression in exposed mice.

While previous studies assessed transition strategies in isolation, focused mainly on climate impacts, and neglected regional differences, our integrated model assesses transition strategies, globally and regionally, addressing the potential co-benefits and trade-offs across several key drivers of the triple planetary crisis. We note that other important impacts, such as microplastic leakage, remain to be quantified. Achieving a net-zero plastic industry by 2050 (1 Gt annual production) is technically feasible through lignocellulose residue-based feedstocks, recycling, and carbon capture. Meanwhile, this would require consuming all available global lignocellulose residues (2.3 Gt), early retirement of fossil infrastructure to avoid at least 0.35 Gt CO2-eq emissions, and ensuring grid decarbonization, presenting great challenges. Without internationally coordinated relocation of plastic production facilities or trade of biomass feedstocks or the derived intermediate chemicals, global net zero becomes unattainable. The global climate benefits through the transition come with trade-offs in higher land-use-related biodiversity loss and particulate matter-related health impacts, especially in regions with vulnerable ecosystems and dense populations, necessitating tailored regional solutions.

Understanding and quantifying the impacts of such MHWs on land heatwaves can enhance seasonal prediction skills for these extremes. Here we evaluate the impact of the 2023 MHW on the record‐breaking atmospheric heatwave in East Asia during the summer. Through a set of regional atmospheric model experiments, we demonstrate that the MHW significantly exacerbated the 2023 East Asian summer atmospheric heatwave, particularly as a compound hot‐humid extreme. The extremely warm ocean amplified both surface air temperature and humidity anomalies, on top of the contributions of background atmospheric circulation anomalies. The MHW influence on air temperature manifests through radiative effects of cloud and water vapor changes. Our results also indicate that the atmospheric heatwave amplifies despite the MHW acts to dampen the western North Pacific subtropical high against large‐scale background atmospheric conditions. By examining the effects of both temperature and humidity anomalies through wet‐bulb globe temperature, we find that the MHW explains ∼20%–50% of the aggravation and prolonged duration of hot‐humid conditions in East Asia, with notable impacts in Japan. Additionally, the recent trend of sea surface warming is shown to substantially amplify the MHW's impact on the heatwave.

SM gradients shape sensible heat flux gradients via evapotranspiration, while upstream pre‐storm rain‐producing clouds suppress surface available energy.

For example, snow and water vapor become more absorptive as incident radiation shifts from visible (VIS) to near‐infrared (NIR) wavelengths. Some earth system models (ESMs) aggregate solar radiation into just two bands (VIS and NIR) partitioned at 0.7 μ ${\upmu }$m for transmission between the atmospheric and surface components. In the widely used radiative transfer model RRTMG_SW this partition is near the center of the overlap spectral band spanning 0.625–0.778 μ ${\upmu }$m, whose flux is often approximated as being evenly divided between the VIS and NIR surface bands. Using a hyperspectral radiative transfer model, we show that the fractional downwelling surface flux within the overlap band is usually distributed about 55.5%:44.5% VIS:NIR. This improved approximation shifts as much as 4.27 W m−2 from the NIR to the VIS band, leading to an instantaneous decrease in surface absorption of up to 0.91 W m−2 over snow‐covered surfaces. Century‐long fully coupled ESM simulations show surface absorption over snow decreases by over 1.6 W m−2.

Relatively limited research has examined AR characteristics further inland, particularly for Colorado (CO), where high and complex topography, as well as the distance from the coast, complicate attempts to track ARs, AR‐derived moisture, and AR‐related impacts. Previous research efforts attributing precipitation to ARs based on their spatial footprint have yielded less than 30% of cool‐season precipitation in CO as related to ARs. However, a large volume of anecdotal evidence suggests that ARs play a larger role in CO precipitation, but this requires quantitative investigation. We used trajectory‐based methods to explore the role of landfalling ARs, their moisture pathways, and their contribution to top‐decile precipitation in sub‐basins throughout CO. Moisture sourced from landfalling ARs affects this area more frequently, penetrating inland along relatively low‐elevation corridors through the Interior West, and exhibit substantial geographic and interannual variability. The backward trajectory approach for attributing precipitation to landfalling ARs yields mostly higher AR contributions to top‐decile cool‐season precipitation (21%–78%), primarily affecting western CO. Most of the AR‐related precipitation across western CO during the cool season is sourced from landfalling ARs near Southern California, the Baja peninsula, and the Pacific Northwest. These results indicate a larger role for ARs in CO weather and hydroclimate than previous research suggests."

The Northern Annular Mode (NAM) index and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index are derived from the model output to represent the strengths of the polar vortices in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH), respectively. During weak polar vortex events in the NH, there is an increase in zonal‐mean zonal winds in the MLT at the NH high latitudes and a warming of the lower thermosphere, accompanied by a cooling of the mesosphere. Conversely, the wind and temperature anomalies are reversed during strong NH polar vortex events. During weak polar vortex events in the SH, similar but generally weaker anomalies are observed in the corresponding hemisphere. This study also elucidates the response of the solar‐migrating semidiurnal tide (SW2) to variations in the strength of the polar vortices. A weak NH polar vortex is associated with an increase in SW2, while a strong NH vortex results in a decrease in SW2. The response of SW2 to changes in the SH polar vortex is similar, although considerably weaker. The NH polar vortex variability can explain around 40−50% $40-50\%$ of the variability in the SW2 during NH winter. The SH polar vortex, however, accounts for only a small fraction of the variability (up to ∼5% ${\sim} 5\%$) in SW2."

PAs established primarily for biodiversity conservation also contribute to increasing carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems. However, there is a lack of quantitative studies on the role of China's existing PAs in carbon storage. We proposed an integrated approach to estimating the carbon density of terrestrial ecosystems in China, based on a modified Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade‐offs model. Through a statistical matching method, we evaluated the conservation effectiveness of PAs in carbon storage during 2020–2050. Under the moderate emission scenario (SSP2‐RCP4.5), the average carbon density of PAs is projected to 168.3 Mg C ha−1, an increase of 14.2% compared to 2020. In contrast, under the low emission scenario (SSP1‐RCP2.6) and high emission scenario (SSP5‐RCP8.5), the average carbon density of PAs is projected to decrease by 4.8% and 4.6%, respectively. By 2050, approximately 45%–47% of PAs are expected to experience effective conservation in carbon storage, with about 80% of PAs maintaining their current effectiveness during 2020–2050. Additionally, in view of area proportion, 34.3%–36.2% of PAs will remain effective, while 1.8%–4.0% are projected to transition from ineffective to effective. PAs with conservation effectiveness in carbon storage were predominantly located in humid and mid‐to‐high‐altitude regions. Given the spatial mismatch among existing PAs, priority areas for carbon storage conservation, and effective areas for carbon storage conservation, our findings underscore the necessity of expanding China's PAs to achieve the additional benefits of PAs in carbon storage conservation."

Although previous studies have widely investigated the historical changes of CHEPs, when these changes emerge from the internal climate variability remains unclear. In this study, we aim to understand the time of emergence (ToE) of CHEPs by utilizing multiple advanced Single Model Initial‐condition Large Ensembles (SMILEs) in China. First, we investigate the spatiotemporal changes of CHEP characteristics over a 200‐year period. Second, we detect ToE of CHEPs by adopting a signal‐to‐noise ratio framework. Third, we evaluate the added value of using SMILEs in the ToE analysis. We find that most areas have experienced increases in CHEP characteristic values in the historical period, which are projected to be more remarkable in the future under multiple projection scenarios. The agreement on the spatial distribution among SMILEs implies that anthropogenic forcings have already caused CHEP frequency to emerge from the internal climate variability over more than 84% of grid cells at least by 2020. In addition, earlier emergence can be found in CHEP hotspots. The temporal uncertainty largely derives from the model uncertainty in simulating signal‐to‐noise ratios for individual events rather than differences in ensemble sizes among SMILEs. Furthermore, ToE can be better constrained based on SMILEs compared to the climate models with fewer members, confirming the added value of using SMILEs. Our findings have implications for climate attribution and provide a scientific basis for mitigating and adapting to climate changes."

However, the geographical distribution of Hg in urban forests remains poorly quantified at multiple spatial scales. Based on field investigations of urban forest parks in China, we explored the urban‐rural gradients and latitudinal trends of tree leaf and topsoil (0–10 cm) Hg concentrations. Our results indicate an urban hotspot of leaf and topsoil Hg concentrations across urban‐rural transects and show an increase in leaf and topsoil Hg concentrations from higher latitudes toward lower latitudes. The urban‐rural gradient and latitudinal trend of leaf Hg concentration are both significantly explained by road density, annual precipitation, and plant life forms. Leaf Hg concentration increases significantly with higher road density and is significantly higher in deciduous trees than in evergreen trees. Leaf Hg concentration decreases with higher annual precipitation across the urban‐rural transects but increases with it across latitudes. The urban‐rural gradient of topsoil Hg concentration is significantly associated with the spatial variation in traffic sources, while the latitudinal change in topsoil Hg concentration is largely explained by background soil Hg concentration. Our findings demonstrate distinctive patterns of urban forest Hg from local to regional scales and the occurrence of urban Hg hotspot implies a significant imprint on accelerated Hg cycling in urban areas."

Here, we examine the changes in hydrologic fluxes due to a shift toward aridity and the extent to which water storage in major reservoirs has offset these changes using a novel, high‐resolution (4 km) configuration of a state‐of‐the‐science land model, the Community Land Model. We leverage an emulation‐based parameter optimization approach to improve model hydrologic performance and reservoir parametrizations (generic and data‐driven) to simulate water storage and release. The hydrologic performance is notably improved across 121 basins in the Southwest, which translates into improved simulation of inflow, storage, and release across 133 reservoirs. The data‐driven approach outperforms the generic one, in simulating reservoir storage but not releases due to biases in inflows. Model simulations show a widespread increase in evapotranspiration (especially its soil evaporation component), driven primarily by increased absorption of solar radiation due to snowpack loss, which suppresses runoff. Increases in snowmelt mitigate runoff deficits during spring, which highlights the sensitivity of runoff response to the seasonal distribution of hydroclimatic supply and demand in the Southwest. Up to 40% of inflow deficits are met by surface water storage in large reservoirs (i.e., Mead and Powell). Simulated estimates of this supply‐demand imbalance are sensitive to biases in simulated inflows and releases. Caution is therefore warranted when using land models with reservoir parametrization for future drought risk and water scarcity assessments."

Past work has shown how hydrological non‐stationarity may alter water discharges and hence Sy, but less attention has been given to the impact of likely future changes in upland sediment‐detachment rates on downstream Sy. In certain environments, climatically driven changes in vegetation cover on upland hillslopes may more than counteract the effects of changing runoff on Sy. Changes in precipitation, temperature, and vegetation may, therefore, interact in nonlinear ways to produce unexpected changes. In this work, we simulated future changes to background Sy (i.e., changes unrelated to land‐use changes and dams) with climatological and vegetative data output from an ensemble of CMIP6 Earth System Model (ESM) simulations. Depending on the future scenario, the cumulative annual sediment flux of 780 globally distributed rivers increases by between 2.3% and 8.4%. Significant deviations from historical Sy are projected at high latitudes in response to each forcing variable, while low‐latitude responses are regionally varied. In regions where ensemble members agree on future changes in forcing variables, large Sy changes are forecast with high confidence (e.g., >200% Sy increase for several northeastern U.S. rivers at the 95% level). In contrast, ensemble variability in vegetation projections results in considerable uncertainty in the projected Sy of rivers in other regions. Further improvements to the vegetation components of ESMs will help to reduce regional uncertainties in projected changes to Sy."

The challenge of feeding a growing population without increasing cultivated land can be addressed partly by expanding irrigation to currently rain‐fed croplands. At the same time, water‐scarce regions with currently unsustainable irrigation practices may experience a reduction in irrigated area. While the evaporative cooling effect of irrigation on regional climate has been extensively studied, it is still unclear how different irrigation expansion (or contraction) scenarios would affect global and regional near‐surface climatic conditions. Here we evaluate the hydro‐climatic impacts of several irrigation expansion scenarios. To assess changes in evapotranspiration (ET) $(ET)$ and land surface temperature (LST) $(LST)$ under various irrigation scenarios, we incorporated and validated an irrigation model representing four main irrigation methods: sprinkler, drip, furrow, and flood‐paddy, into the NASA Catchment land surface model. Globally, the increase in ET $ET$ from irrigation and the associated impact on average yearly LST $LST$ are negligible, with an average global cooling of −0.03°C ${-}0.03{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the case of current irrigation (with respect to a baseline without irrigation). Compared to the current irrigation scenario, the maximum irrigation expansion scenario can lead to an additional LST $LST$ cooling of −0.01°C ${-}0.01{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, while the net irrigation contraction in a sustainable irrigation scenario is associated with a 0.02°C $0.02{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ warming. While global and regional impacts of irrigation on LST $LST$ are relatively modest, locally, the cooling effect can be substantial, with a maximum yearly average LST $LST$ cooling as strong as −5°C ${-}5{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and monthly cooling peaks of up to −10.2°C ${-}10.2{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in heavily irrigated periods."

 Steel truss bridges are constructed by connecting many different types of bars (components) to form a load-bearing structural system. Several disastrous collapses of this type of bridge have occurred as a result of initial component failure(s) propagating to the rest of the structure1–3. Despite the prevalence and importance of these structures, it is still unclear why initial component failures propagate disproportionately in some bridges but barely affect functionality in others4–7. Here we uncover and characterize the fundamental secondary resistance mechanisms that allow steel truss bridges to withstand the initial failure of any main component. These mechanisms differ substantially from the primary resistance mechanisms considered during the design of (undamaged) bridges. After testing a scaled-down specimen of a real bridge and using validated numerical models to simulate the failure of all main bridge components, we show how secondary resistance mechanisms interact to redistribute the loads supported by failed components to other parts of the structure. By studying the evolution of these mechanisms under increasing loads up to global failure, we are able to describe the conditions that enable their effective development. These findings can be used to enhance present bridge design and maintenance strategies, ultimately leading to safer transport networks.

 Nuclease–helicase DNA2 is a multifunctional genome caretaker that is essential for cell proliferation in a range of organisms, from yeast to human1–4. Bi-allelic DNA2 mutations that reduce DNA2 concentrations cause a spectrum of primordial dwarfism disorders, including Seckel and Rothmund–Thomson-related syndromes5–7. By contrast, cancer cells frequently express high concentrations of DNA2 (refs. 8–11). The mechanism that precludes cell proliferation in the absence of DNA2 and the molecular aetiology of DNA2-linked diseases remain elusive. Here we used yeast and human cells to demonstrate that DNA2 suppresses homologous recombination-restarted replication and checkpoint activation at stalled DNA replication forks. Loss of this control mechanism upon degradation of DNA2 in human cells causes recombination-dependent DNA synthesis and build-up of RPA-bound single-stranded DNA in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Consequently, DNA2 deprivation triggers the DNA damage checkpoint and invariably leads to ATR–p21-dependent cell-cycle exit before mitosis. These findings explain why DNA2 is essential for cell proliferation and reveal that replication fork processing to restrict recombination is indispensable for avoiding cellular senescence. Stochastic entry into senescence stifles the proliferative potential of cells following the expression of a Seckel syndrome patient-derived DNA2 hypomorph or partial degradation of DNA2, providing a conceptual framework to explain global growth failure in DNA2-linked primordial dwarfism disorders.

 Geologically storing carbon is a key strategy for abating emissions from fossil fuels and durably removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere1,2. However, the storage potential is not unlimited3,4. Here we establish a prudent planetary limit of around 1,460 (1,290–2,710) Gt of CO2 storage through a risk-based, spatially explicit analysis of carbon storage in sedimentary basins. We show that only stringent near-term gross emissions reductions can lower the risk of breaching this limit before the year 2200. Fully using geologic storage for carbon removal caps the possible global temperature reduction to 0.7 °C (0.35–1.2 °C, including storage estimate and climate response uncertainty). The countries most robust to our risk assessment are current large-scale extractors of fossil resources. Treating carbon storage as a limited intergenerational resource has deep implications for national mitigation strategies and policy and requires making explicit decisions on priorities for storage use.

 A key challenge in neuroscience is understanding how neurons in hundreds of interconnected brain regions integrate sensory inputs with previous expectations to initiate movements and make decisions1. It is difficult to meet this challenge if different laboratories apply different analyses to different recordings in different regions during different behaviours. Here we report a comprehensive set of recordings from 621,733 neurons recorded with 699 Neuropixels probes across 139 mice in 12 laboratories. The data were obtained from mice performing a decision-making task with sensory, motor and cognitive components. The probes covered 279 brain areas in the left forebrain and midbrain and the right hindbrain and cerebellum. We provide an initial appraisal of this brain-wide map and assess how neural activity encodes key task variables. Representations of visual stimuli transiently appeared in classical visual areas after stimulus onset and then spread to ramp-like activity in a collection of midbrain and hindbrain regions that also encoded choices. Neural responses correlated with impending motor action almost everywhere in the brain. Responses to reward delivery and consumption were also widespread. This publicly available dataset represents a resource for understanding how computations distributed across and within brain areas drive behaviour. The International Brain Laboratory presents a brain-wide electrophysiological map obtained from pooling data from 12 laboratories that performed the same standardized perceptual decision-making task in mice."

 Metazoan development proceeds through a series of morphogenetic events that sculpt body plans and organ structures1,2. In the early embryo, these processes occur concurrently such that forces generated in neighbouring tissues can impose mechanical stresses on each other3–5, potentially disrupting development and consequently decreasing fitness. How organisms evolved mechanisms to mitigate inter-tissue mechanical conflicts remains unclear. Here, we combined phylogenetic survey, quantitative live imaging and functional mechanical perturbation to investigate mechanical stress management during gastrulation across the insect order of flies (Diptera). We identify two distinct cellular mechanisms that prevent tissue collision between the expanding head and trunk. In Cyclorrhapha, a monophyletic subgroup including Drosophila melanogaster, active out-of-plane deformation of a transient epithelial fold, called the cephalic furrow, acts as a mechanical sink to pre-empt head–trunk collision. Genetic and optogenetic ablation of the cephalic furrow leads to accumulation of compressive stress, tissue buckling at the head–trunk boundary and late-stage embryonic defects in the head and nervous system. By contrast, the non-cyclorrhaphan Chironomus riparius lacks cephalic furrow formation and instead undergoes widespread out-of-plane division that reduces the duration and spatial extent of head expansion. Re-orienting head mitosis from in-plane to out-of-plane in Drosophila partially suppresses tissue buckling, showing that it can function as an alternative mechanical sink. Our data suggest that mechanisms of mechanical stress management emerge and diverge in response to inter-tissue conflicts during early embryonic development. Flies have evolved two distinct strategies for managing mechanical stresses during embryogenesis: out-of-plane cell division in midges and transient out-of-plane tissue folding in fruit flies."

 Artificial intelligence (AI) and combinatorial optimization drive applications across science and industry, but their increasing energy demands challenge the sustainability of digital computing. Most unconventional computing systems1–7 target either AI or optimization workloads and rely on frequent, energy-intensive digital conversions, limiting efficiency. These systems also face application-hardware mismatches, whether handling memory-bottlenecked neural models, mapping real-world optimization problems or contending with inherent analog noise. Here we introduce an analog optical computer (AOC) that combines analog electronics and three-dimensional optics to accelerate AI inference and combinatorial optimization in a single platform. This dual-domain capability is enabled by a rapid fixed-point search, which avoids digital conversions and enhances noise robustness. With this fixed-point abstraction, the AOC implements emerging compute-bound neural models with recursive reasoning potential and realizes an advanced gradient-descent approach for expressive optimization. We demonstrate the benefits of co-designing the hardware and abstraction, echoing the co-evolution of digital accelerators and deep learning models, through four case studies: image classification, nonlinear regression, medical image reconstruction and financial transaction settlement. Built with scalable, consumer-grade technologies, the AOC paves a promising path for faster and sustainable computing. Its native support for iterative, compute-intensive models offers a scalable analog platform for fostering future innovation in AI and optimization.

 Over time, cells in the brain and in the body accumulate damage, which contributes to the ageing process1. In the human brain, the prefrontal cortex undergoes age-related changes that can affect cognitive functioning later in life2. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) and spatial transcriptomics, we identify gene-expression and genomic changes in the human prefrontal cortex across lifespan, from infancy to centenarian. snRNA-seq identified infant-specific cell clusters enriched for the expression of neurodevelopmental genes, as well as an age-associated common downregulation of cell-essential homeostatic genes that function in ribosomes, transport and metabolism across cell types. Conversely, the expression of neuron-specific genes generally remains stable throughout life. These findings were validated with spatial transcriptomics. scWGS identified two age-associated mutational signatures that correlate with gene transcription and gene repression, respectively, and revealed gene length- and expression-level-dependent rates of somatic mutation in neurons that correlate with the transcriptomic landscape of the aged human brain. Our results provide insight into crucial aspects of human brain development and ageing, and shed light on transcriptomic and genomic dynamics.

 Internal motive states, such as sexual arousal, drive behaviour in response to social cues. However, little is known about how internal states and external cues are integrated to release appropriate behaviours at the correct moment during a social interaction, such as the transition from the appetitive to the consummatory phases of mating1,2. Here we identify a neural circuit in male mice that gates the onset of consummatory reproductive behaviours on contact with a mating partner. Stimulating MPOAEsr1∩Vgat hypothalamic neurons promotes mounting of conspecifics and three-dimensional dummy objects3. We find that such mounting depends on mechanosensory but not visual cues. Through a large-scale electrophysiological screen, we identify neurons in the subparafascicular thalamic nucleus that nonlinearly integrate medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus (MPOA) and mechanosensory input to encode contact with a potential mate. Circuit tracing and perturbations demonstrated that this conjunctive coding occurs by means of convergent disinhibition from MPOA and excitation from the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Functional manipulations and calcium recordings showed these social-contact neurons, marked by parathyroid hormone 2, were essential for and able to promote mounting. These data indicate that subparafascicular thalamic nucleus-parathyroid hormone 2 neurons integrate internal drive with social touch to trigger mounting at opportune moments during mating. More generally, our findings uncover a brain mechanism whereby an internal state can attribute a social quality to a generic touch to initiate purposeful reproductive actions.

 The spatial resolution of omics analyses is fundamental to understanding tissue biology1–3. The capacity to spatially profile DNA methylation, which is a canonical epigenetic mark extensively implicated in transcriptional regulation4,5, is lacking. Here we introduce a method for whole-genome spatial co-profiling of DNA methylation and the transcriptome of the same tissue section at near single-cell resolution. Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and the postnatal mouse brain resulted in rich DNA–RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The concordance and distinction in spatial patterns of the two modalities highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function. By integrating spatial maps of mouse embryos at two different developmental stages, we reconstructed the dynamics that underlie mammalian embryogenesis for both the epigenome and transcriptome, revealing details of sequence-, cell-type- and region-specific methylation-mediated transcriptional regulation. This method extends the scope of spatial omics to include DNA cytosine methylation, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of tissue biology across development and disease.

 Mechanical forces are crucial for driving and shaping tissue morphogenesis during embryonic development1–3. However, their relevance for the evolution of development remains poorly understood4. Here we show that an evolutionary novelty of fly embryos—the patterned embryonic invagination known as the cephalic furrow5–7—has a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we demonstrate that the head–trunk boundary of the embryo is under increased compressive stress due to the concurrent formation of mitotic domains and germ band extension and that the cephalic furrow counteracts these stresses, preventing mechanical instabilities during gastrulation. Then, by comparing the genetic patterning of species with and without the cephalic furrow, we find evidence that changes in the expression of the transcription factor buttonhead are associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. These results suggest that the cephalic furrow may have evolved through the genetic stabilization of morphogenesis in response to the mechanical challenges of dipteran gastrulation. Together, our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development. In Drosophila, the cephalic furrow counteracts mechanical stress as the developing head and the trunk tissues meet, providing evidence for how mechanical forces influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development."

 The neural representations of prior information about the state of the world are poorly understood1. Here, to investigate them, we examined brain-wide Neuropixels recordings and widefield calcium imaging collected by the International Brain Laboratory. Mice were trained to indicate the location of a visual grating stimulus, which appeared on the left or right with a prior probability alternating between 0.2 and 0.8 in blocks of variable length. We found that mice estimate this prior probability and thereby improve their decision accuracy. Furthermore, we report that this subjective prior is encoded in at least 20% to 30% of brain regions that, notably, span all levels of processing, from early sensory areas (the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex) to motor regions (secondary and primary motor cortex and gigantocellular reticular nucleus) and high-level cortical regions (the dorsal anterior cingulate area and ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex). This widespread representation of the prior is consistent with a neural model of Bayesian inference involving loops between areas, as opposed to a model in which the prior is incorporated only in decision-making areas. This study offers a brain-wide perspective on prior encoding at cellular resolution, underscoring the importance of using large-scale recordings on a single standardized task.

 The nine human herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, human cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus, present a significant burden to global public health1. Their envelopes contain at least ten different glycoproteins, which are necessary for host cell tropism, attachment and entry2. The best conserved among them, glycoprotein B (gB), is essential as it performs membrane fusion by undergoing extensive rearrangements from a prefusion to postfusion conformation. At present, there are no antiviral drugs targeting gB or neutralizing antibodies directed against its prefusion form, because of the difficulty in structurally determining and using this metastable conformation. Here we show the isolation of prefusion-specific nanobodies, one of which exhibits strong neutralizing and cross-species activity. By mutational stabilization we solved the herpes simplex virus 1 gB full-length prefusion structure, which allowed the bound epitope to be determined. Our analyses show the membrane-embedded regions of gB and previously unresolved structural features3,4, including a new fusion loop arrangement, providing insights into the initial conformational changes required for membrane fusion. Binding an epitope spanning three domains, proximal only in the prefusion state, the nanobody keeps wild-type HSV-2 gB in this conformation and enabled its native prefusion structure to be determined. This also indicates the mode of neutralization and an attractive avenue for antiviral interventions.

 Physical neural networks (PNNs) are a class of neural-like networks that make use of analogue physical systems to perform computations. Although at present confined to small-scale laboratory demonstrations, PNNs could one day transform how artificial intelligence (AI) calculations are performed. Could we train AI models many orders of magnitude larger than present ones? Could we perform model inference locally and privately on edge devices? Research over the past few years has shown that the answer to these questions is probably “yes, with enough research”. Because PNNs can make use of analogue physical computations more directly, flexibly and opportunistically than traditional computing hardware, they could change what is possible and practical for AI systems. To do this, however, will require notable progress, rethinking both how AI models work and how they are trained—primarily by considering the problems through the constraints of the underlying hardware physics. To train PNNs, backpropagation-based and backpropagation-free approaches are now being explored. These methods have various trade-offs and, so far, no method has been shown to scale to large models with the same performance as the backpropagation algorithm widely used in deep learning today. However, this challenge has been rapidly changing and a diverse ecosystem of training techniques provides clues for how PNNs may one day be used to create both more efficient and larger-scale realizations of present-scale AI models.

 Learning enables biological organisms to begin life simple yet develop immensely diverse and complex behaviours. Understanding learning principles in engineered molecular systems could enable us to endow non-living physical systems with similar capabilities. Inspired by how the brain processes information, the principles of neural computation have been developed over the past 80 years1, forming the foundation of modern machine learning. More than four decades ago, connections between neural computation and physical systems were established2. More recently, synthetic molecular systems, including nucleic acid and protein circuits, have been investigated for their abilities to implement neural computation3–7. However, in these systems, learning of molecular parameters such as concentrations and reaction rates was performed in silico to generate desired input–output functions.

We demonstrate a DNA neural network trained to classify three different sets of 100-bit patterns, integrating training data directly into memories of molecular concentrations and using these memories to process subsequent test data.

 Enteric pathogens engage in complex interactions with the host and the resident microbiota to establish gut colonization1–3. Although mechanistic interactions between enteric pathogens and bacterial commensals have been extensively studied, whether and how commensal fungi affect enteric infections remain largely unknown1. Here we show that colonization with the common human gut commensal fungus Candida albicans worsened infections with the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. The presence of C. albicans in the mouse gut increased Salmonella caecal colonization and systemic dissemination. We investigated the underlying mechanism and found that Salmonella binds to C. albicans via type 1 fimbriae and uses its type 3 secretion system to deliver effector proteins into C. albicans. A specific effector, SopB, was sufficient to manipulate C. albicans metabolism and trigger the release of millimolar amounts of arginine into the extracellular environment. The released arginine, in turn, induced expression of the type 3 secretion system in Salmonella, increasing its invasion of epithelial cells. C. albicans deficient in arginine production was unable to increase Salmonella virulence. Arginine-producing C. albicans also dampened the inflammatory response during Salmonella infection. Arginine supplementation in the absence of C. albicans increased the systemic spread of Salmonella and decreased the inflammatory response, phenocopying the presence of C. albicans.

 Despite genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) having identified many genetic risk loci1–3, the underlying disease mechanisms remain largely unclear. Determining causal disease variants and their LOAD-relevant cellular phenotypes has been a challenge. Here, using our approach for identifying functional GWAS risk variants showing allele-specific open chromatin, we systematically identified putative causal LOAD-risk variants in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived neurons, astrocytes and microglia, and linked a PICALM LOAD-risk allele to a microglial-specific role of PICALM in lipid droplet (LD) accumulation. Allele-specific open-chromatin mapping revealed functional risk variants for 26 LOAD-risk loci, mostly specific to microglia. At the microglial-specific PICALM locus, the LOAD-risk allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs10792832 reduced transcription factor (PU.1) binding and PICALM expression, impairing the uptake of amyloid beta (Aβ) and myelin debris. Notably, microglia carrying the PICALM risk allele showed transcriptional enrichment of pathways for cholesterol synthesis and LD formation. Genetic and pharmacological perturbations of microglia further established a causal link between reduced PICALM expression, LD accumulation and phagocytosis deficits. Our work elucidates the selective LOAD vulnerability in microglia at the PICALM locus through detrimental LD accumulation, providing a neurobiological basis that can be exploited for developing clinical interventions.

 Sustainable development is an imperative worldwide1–3 but metrics and data on poverty and quality of life have remained too coarse and abstract to characterize challenges adequately and guide practical progress4,5. Nowhere is this challenge greater than in Africa4–6, where we still know little about the spatial details of development3,7–9. Here we leverage a comprehensive, high-precision dataset of building footprints to identify infrastructure deficits and infer informal settlements down to the street block level10–12 everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa. We identify a general pattern of informality with cities showing, on average, greater access to infrastructure and services than rural and peri-urban areas. We show that such patterns of informality are characterized by consistent statistical distributions reflecting uneven local development2,13,14. We also show that these physical measures of informality are systematically associated with many indicators of human deprivation, which form a single principal component co-varying predictably with specific changes in street access to buildings. These results demonstrate that the localization of sustainable development is possible down to the street level at a continental scale and provide a general distributed strategy for accelerating progress in infrastructure and service expansion that taps local innovations in systematic, equitable and context-appropriate ways7,11,12,15.

 Behavioural adaptations to environmental threats are crucial for survival1,2 and necessitate rapid deployment of energy reserves3–5. The amygdala coordinates behavioural adaptations to threats6, but little is known about its involvement in underpinning metabolic adaptations. Here we show that acute stress activates medial amygdala (MeA) neurons that innervate the ventromedial hypothalamus (MeAVMH neurons), which precipitates hyperglycaemia and hypophagia. The glycaemic actions of MeAVMH neurons occur independently of adrenal or pancreatic glucoregulatory hormones. Using whole-body virus tracing, we identify a polysynaptic connection from MeA to the liver that promotes the rapid synthesis of glucose by hepatic gluconeogenesis. Repeated stress exposure disrupts MeA control of blood glucose, resulting in diabetes-like dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. Our findings reveal an amygdala–liver axis that regulates rapid glycaemic adaptations to stress and links recurrent stress to metabolic dysfunction.

 Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by interacting with DNA in a sequence-specific manner. High-throughput in vitro technologies, such as protein-binding microarrays1–6 and HT-SELEX (high-throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment)7,8, have revealed the DNA-binding specificities of hundreds of TFs. However, they have limited ability to reliably identify lower-affinity DNA binding sites, which are increasingly recognized as important for precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression9–19. Here, to address this limitation, we developed protein affinity to DNA by in vitro transcription and RNA sequencing (PADIT-seq), with which we comprehensively assayed the binding preferences of six TFs to all possible ten-base-pair DNA sequences, detecting hundreds of novel, lower-affinity binding sites. The expanded repertoire of lower-affinity binding sites revealed that nucleotides flanking high-affinity DNA binding sites create overlapping lower-affinity sites that together modulate TF genomic occupancy in vivo. We propose a model in which TF binding is not determined by individual binding sites, but rather by the sum of multiple, overlapping binding sites. The overlapping binding model explains how competition between paralogous TFs for shared high-affinity binding sites is determined by flanking nucleotides that create differential numbers of overlapping, lower-affinity binding sites. Critically, the model transforms our understanding of noncoding-variant effects, revealing how single nucleotide changes simultaneously alter multiple overlapping sites to additively influence gene expression and human traits, including diseases.

 Cardiolipin (CL) is the signature phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it stabilizes electron transport chain protein complexes1. The final step in CL biosynthesis relates to its remodelling: the exchange of nascent acyl chains with longer, unsaturated chains1. However, the enzyme responsible for cleaving nascent CL (nCL) has remained elusive. Here, we describe ABHD18 as a candidate deacylase in the CL biosynthesis pathway. Accordingly, ABHD18 converts CL into monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) in vitro, and its inactivation in cells and mice results in a shift to nCL in serum and tissues. Notably, ABHD18 deactivation rescues the mitochondrial defects in cells and the morbidity and mortality in mice associated with Barth syndrome. This rare genetic disease is characterized by the build-up of MLCL resulting from inactivating mutations in TAFAZZIN (TAZ), which encodes the final enzyme in the CL-remodelling cascade1. We also identified a selective, covalent, small-molecule inhibitor of ABHD18 that rescues TAZ mutant phenotypes in fibroblasts from human patients and in fish embryos. This study highlights a striking example of genetic suppression of a monogenic disease revealing a canonical enzyme in the CL biosynthesis pathway.

 Living organisms are assumed to produce same-species offspring1,2. Here, we report a shift from this norm in Messor ibericus, an ant that lays individuals from two distinct species. In this life cycle, females must clone males of another species because they require their sperm to produce the worker caste. As a result, males from the same mother exhibit distinct genomes and morphologies, as they belong to species that diverged over 5 million years ago. The evolutionary history of this system appears as sexual parasitism3 that evolved into a natural case of cross-species cloning4,5, resulting in the maintenance of a male-only lineage cloned through distinct species’ ova. We term females exhibiting this reproductive mode as xenoparous, meaning they give birth to other species as part of their life cycle.

 Fibroblasts and immune cells coordinate tissue regeneration and necessary scarring after injury. In the brain, fibroblasts are border-enriched cells whose dynamic molecular states and immune interactions after injury remain unclear1. Here we define the shared fibroblast–immune response to brain injury. Early profibrotic myofibroblasts develop from pre-existing brain fibroblasts and infiltrate brain lesions, orchestrated by fibroblast TGFβ signalling, profibrotic macrophages and microglia, and perilesional glia. Myofibroblasts transition into several late fibroblast states, including lymphocyte-interactive fibroblasts. Interruption of the early myofibroblast state exacerbated sub-acute brain injury, tissue loss and secondary neuroinflammation, with increased mortality in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model. Disruption of late lymphocyte–fibroblast niches via selective loss of fibroblast chemokine CXCL12 led to late brain-specific innate inflammation and lymphocyte dispersal with increased IFNγ production. These data indicate the response to brain injury is coordinated by evolving temporal and spatial fibroblast states that limit functional tissue loss and chronic neuroinflammation. Spatial transcriptomic studies and lineage tracing reveal that, after brain injury, transient profibrotic fibroblasts develop from existing brain fibroblasts, infiltrate lesions, regulate the local immune response and lead to beneficial scar tissue formation."

 The brain avidly consumes glucose to fuel neurophysiology1. Cancers of the brain, such as glioblastoma, relinquish physiological integrity and gain the ability to proliferate and invade healthy tissue2. How brain cancers rewire glucose use to drive aggressive growth remains unclear. Here we infused 13C-labelled glucose into patients and mice with brain cancer, coupled with quantitative metabolic flux analysis, to map the fates of glucose-derived carbon in tumour versus cortex. Through direct and comprehensive measurements of carbon and nitrogen labelling in both cortex and glioma tissues, we identify profound metabolic transformations. In the human cortex, glucose carbons fuel essential physiological processes, including tricarboxylic acid cycle oxidation and neurotransmitter synthesis. Conversely, gliomas downregulate these processes and scavenge alternative carbon sources such as amino acids from the environment, repurposing glucose-derived carbons to generate molecules needed for proliferation and invasion. Targeting this metabolic rewiring in mice through dietary amino acid modulation selectively alters glioblastoma metabolism, slows tumour growth and augments the efficacy of standard-of-care treatments. These findings illuminate how aggressive brain tumours exploit glucose to suppress normal physiological activity in favour of malignant expansion and offer potential therapeutic strategies to enhance treatment outcomes.

 For rocky planets, the presence of a solid inner core has notable implications on the composition and thermal evolution of the core and on the magnetic history of the planet1–3. On Mars, geophysical observations have confirmed that the core is at least partially liquid4–7, but it is unknown whether any part of the core is solid. Here we present an analysis of seismic data acquired by the InSight mission, demonstrating that Mars has a solid inner core. We identify two seismic phases, the deep core-transiting phase, PKKP, and the inner core boundary reflecting phase, PKiKP, indicative of the inner core. Our inversions constrain the radius of the Martian inner core to about 613 ± 67 km, with a compressional velocity jump of around 30% across the inner core boundary, supported by additional inner-core-related seismic phases. These properties imply a concentration of distinct light elements in the inner core, segregated from the outer core through core crystallization. This finding provides an anchor point for understanding the thermal and chemical state of Mars. Moreover, the relationship between inner core formation and the Martian magnetic field evolution could provide insights into dynamo generation across planetary bodies.

 The second half of the first millennium ce in Central and Eastern Europe was accompanied by fundamental cultural and political transformations. This period of change is commonly associated with the appearance of the Slavs, which is supported by textual evidence1,2 and coincides with the emergence of similar archaeological horizons3–6. However, so far there has been no consensus on whether this archaeological horizon spread by migration, Slavicisation or a combination of both. Genetic data remain sparse, especially owing to the widespread practice of cremation in the early phase of the Slavic settlement. Here we present genome-wide data from 555 ancient individuals, including 359 samples from Slavic contexts from as early as the seventh century ce. Our data demonstrate large-scale population movement from Eastern Europe during the sixth to eighth centuries, replacing more than 80% of the local gene pool in Eastern Germany, Poland and Croatia. Yet, we also show substantial regional heterogeneity as well as a lack of sex-biased admixture, indicating varying degrees of cultural assimilation of the autochthonous populations. Comparing archaeological and genetic evidence, we find that the change in ancestry in Eastern Germany coincided with a change in social organization, characterized by an intensification of inter- and intra-site genetic relatedness and patrilocality. On the European scale, it appears plausible that the changes in material culture and language between the sixth and eighth centuries were connected to these large-scale population movements.

This study shows rising emissions, limited decoupling, and shifting trade patterns involving more emerging and developing economies. 
 Methane has been identified as the second-largest contributor to climate change, accounting for approximately 30% of global warming. Countries have established targets and are implementing various measures to curb methane emissions. However, our understanding of the trends in methane emissions and their drivers remains limited, particularly from a consumption perspective (i.e. accounting for all emissions along the entire global supply chain). This study investigates the most recent dynamics of methane emissions across 120 sectors from both production and consumption viewpoints in 164 countries. It also discusses the status of decoupling of production- and consumption-based methane emissions from economic growth. Our results indicate that there is no foreseeable slowdown in the momentum of global methane emissions growth. Only a few developed countries have managed to reduce both production- and consumption-based emissions while maintaining economic growth (i.e., strong decoupling) during the observed period (1990-2023). Global trade accounts for approximately 30% of global methane emissions, but major trade patterns are shifting from North-North and North-South to South-South countries, reflecting the increasing participating of developing countries in global supply chains. The study further reveals the changing drivers of global methane emissions from 1998 to 2023 in five-year intervals. It identifies that the reduction in emission coefficient (i.e., emissions per unit of output), driven by advancements in improved energy efficiency and cleaner production technologies, is the main determinant for reducing emissions over the observation period, partly offsetting the increasing effects from growth of final demand. Changes in demand structure have played a considerable role in the increase of emissions since 2008. This study enhances our understanding of the changes and drivers of methane emissions and supports countries in incorporating methane emissions into their climate mitigation strategies. Understanding global methane trends remains limited, especially from a consumption view.

Immediately accounting for the equity obligations of the Paris Agreement implies important financial support now. 
 National emissions targets are collectively insufficient to align with the Paris Agreement. The fair-share literature assesses whether these targets are fair and ambitious in comparison to emissions trajectories based on equity principles. Such emissions trajectories commonly start at present-day emissions levels. Here we show that these continuous trajectories inherently reward past inaction and increasingly do so with their iterative updates. We provide an approach to allocating emissions trajectories based on equity principles applied with immediate effect. The resulting discontinuous national trajectories not starting at current emissions levels imply significant immediate international support to fund rapid mitigation globally. Modelling allocations with or without continuity has remarkable consequences for the relative implied contributions to international support among high-income countries. We find that emissions targets of G7 countries, Russia and China are responsible for most of the global 2030 ambition gap, while only some countries align with their 1.5 °C allocation. Existing ambition assessments of national climate pledges are biased, incompatible with international law and reward high emitters.

Minimizing these losses requires soft magnetic materials with high saturation magnetization, low coercivity, and low core loss at high frequency. Here, Gautam et al present an approach combining nanostructure engineering with high frequency domain structure control, reducing core losses by 55%. 
 The next generation of power electronics necessitates materials capable of rapid response at tens of kilohertz frequencies while ensuring minimal core losses. Accelerating the advancement of power electronics hinges on addressing the current shortage of ultra-low core loss soft magnets, thereby enabling sustainable energy utilization and paving the way toward achieving zero carbon footprints. Here we demonstrate an approach that integrates nanostructure engineering with high-frequency domain structure control, significantly enhancing the performance of Fe-enriched amorphous ribbons. Our strategy reduces core loss by 55%, achieving an ultra-low loss of ~ 75 ± 1.3 W/kg at 10 kHz, 1 T. We attribute this improvement to optimized perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which is induced by positive magnetostriction and compressive stress generated from partial nanocrystallization of α-Fe in a residual amorphous matrix. These configurations lead to the formation of a narrow stripe-shaped magnetic domain (~ 4.8 ± 0.6 μm wide), resulting in minimal excess loss. These findings highlight a pivotal advancement in soft magnet design, facilitating energy-efficient, miniaturized power electronics for modern applications.

Accounting for age and education greatly improves predictions, with demographic-specific effects often an order of magnitude larger than population wide averages. 
 Understanding the impact of climate change on human migration is critical for policymakers. Yet climate change can both incentivize people to migrate and reduce their ability to move, making its effect on human migration ambiguous. We propose an approach to studying migration that combines causal inference methods with cross-validation techniques to reliably estimate effects of weather on migration within and across borders. This approach highlights the key role of migrant demographics in the weather-migration relationship. We show that allowing weather effects to differ by age and education improves out-of-sample performance by a factor of five or more compared with a homogeneous effect. Demographic heterogeneity is critical in explaining this discrepancy. Projections based on our empirical estimates indicate that the effects of climate change on future cross-border migration will be an order of magnitude larger for most demographics than the average effect, but differing responses across groups largely offset one another. Migration responses to climate are demographically heterogeneous.

 Cognitive impairments in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are prevalent and disabling yet often unaddressed. Here, we optimised automated online assessment technology for people with MS and used it to characterise their cognitive deficits in greater detail and at a larger population scale than previously possible. The study involved 4526 UK MS Register members over three stages. Stage 1 evaluated 22 online cognitive tasks and established their feasibility.

Here, the authors show that the KH and R3H domains of KhpB cooperatively bind RNA via a composite interface revealed by crystal structures. 
 KhpB, also known as EloR, is a recently discovered global RNA-binding protein in various pathogenic bacteria that regulates critical cellular processes. KhpB is unique in containing both an R3H domain and a KH domain, which are universal RNA/DNA-binding domains found across various proteins involved in diverse cellular functions. However, the precise roles of these domains in KhpB’s RNA-binding mechanism remain unclear, particularly as no structural data of the R3H domain bound to RNA/DNA have been reported for any protein. In this study, we present the crystal structures of both the RNA-free and RNA-bound forms of Thermus thermophilus KhpB dimer. These structures reveal that the KH and R3H domains cooperate to form a composite RNA-binding site capable of binding a single RNA molecule. Notably, the coordinated interaction requires RNA molecules that are at least 7 nucleotides long. This interaction induces conformational changes, including the closure of the RNA-binding cleft between the two domains. The structural data further reveal that KhpB primarily interacts with the phosphate backbone of RNA, while most of the base moieties remain solvent-exposed. These findings provide structural insights into the molecular function of KhpB and shed light on the RNA-binding strategies of other R3H domain-containing proteins. R3H domain-containing proteins are widespread RNA binders, yet their binding mechanisms remain poorly understood.

Here the authors show that the ocean carbon sink declined in 2023 despite record-high sea surface temperatures (SSTs), primarily due to SST-driven outgassing of CO2 in the subtropics. 
 In 2023, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) reached record highs, partly due to a strong El Niño. Based on historical responses to elevated global mean SSTs, oceanic CO2 uptake in 2023 should have increased (−0.11 ± 0.04 PgC yr−1), driven by reduced outgassing in the tropical Pacific Ocean. However, using observation-based estimates of ocean CO2 fugacity, we show here that the global non-polar ocean absorbed about 10% less CO2 than expected (+0.17 ± 0.12 PgC yr−1). This weakening was caused by the anomalous outgassing of CO2 in the subtropical and subpolar regions, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, driven primarily by elevated SSTs reducing the solubility of CO2. In most regions, this SST-induced outgassing was mitigated by the depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface mixed layer. Such negative feedbacks caused an overall muted response of the ocean carbon sink to the record-high SSTs, but this resilience may not persist under long-term warming or more severe SST extremes. The ocean carbon sink strengthened in previous warm El Niño years due to reduced CO2 outgassing in the tropics.

 Strategies for achieving net-zero emissions in municipal solid waste (MSW) management are crucial for a sustainable society, but insights that can guide global policy-making are still scarce. Here we provide a holistic view on this topic on a global scale. We first evaluated the spatiotemporal differences in global and national MSW-related emissions in 195 countries or regions between 1980 and 2022, and determined the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and drivers of global and national MSW-related greenhouse gas emissions. Then we performed prospective scenario-based simulations and found that all countries can achieve net zero in MSW management by 2100, but tailored measures are needed. We finally explored the strategies and challenges associated with achieving net zero via 1,024 scenarios while considering the combination of several measures from a local perspective. The results suggest that most developing countries should adjust their treatment measures and/or upgrade their technologies, whereas developed regions can achieve net zero with a single measure, particularly recycling, which has substantial mitigation potential. These insights can help to develop localized MSW management strategies for different countries and eventually contribute to achieving the net-zero target globally. Developing strategies for reducing carbon emissions in municipal solid waste management is essential to achieve the net-zero target. Here the authors systematically assess strategy options of different countries for achieving net-zero municipal solid waste management."

 Central Asia hosts some of the world’s last relatively healthy mountain glaciers and is heavily dependent on snow and ice melt for downstream water supply, though the causes of this stable glacier state are not known. We combine recent in-situ observations, climate reanalysis and remote sensing data to force a land-surface model to reconstruct glacier changes over the last two decades (1999–2023) and disentangle their causes over a benchmark glacierized catchment in Tajikistan. We show that snowfall and snow depth have been substantially lower since 2018, leading to a decline in glacier health and reduced runoff generation. Remote-sensing observations confirm wider snow depletion across the Northwestern Pamirs, suggesting that a lack of snowfall might be a cause of mass losses regionally. Our results provide an explanation for the recent decline in glacier health in the region, and reinforce the need to better understand the variability of precipitation.

 Understanding how climate systems respond to carbon dioxide removal is crucial for assessing effectiveness of carbon neutrality policies. Here we show that rising carbon dioxide intensifies aridity over vast regions, particularly in vulnerable and climate-sensitive drylands based on idealized emission-driven simulations from an Earth System Model. Notably, even as carbon dioxide concentrations decline, arid regions continue to expand and experience worsening conditions, exacerbating climate injustice and resource conflicts. This pronounced hysteresis is primarily driven by long-lasting precipitation reductions in the tropics, linked to hysteresis of the intertropical convergence zone. The asymmetric response of arid zones suggests that reversing aridity intensification under global warming is exceptionally difficult. Further analysis highlights that negative carbon dioxide emissions may be essential to mitigating these deteriorating conditions, yet full recovery requires extended timescales. Our findings underscore irreversible risks of delayed action and stress the urgent need for carbon neutrality strategies that go beyond net-zero targets.

 Phosphorus is a critical factor limiting ecosystem productivity in subtropical ecosystems. Deforestation alters element stocks and cycling, leading to changes in the soil microbiome. However, the impacts of native forest conversion on the capacity of microbes to support phosphorus availability remain unknown. Here, we investigate the responses of soil microbial phosphorus cycling after native subtropical forests conversion to plantations and croplands across southern China. Increases in soil pH and phosphorus content after forest conversion alter microbial phosphorus cycling in plantations and croplands. Croplands have the declined functional potentials for phosphorus solubilization and mineralization, and the diversity of the key phosphorus-solubilizing bacterial taxa in Burkholderiaceae and Enterobacteriaceae is reduced. Our work highlights the importance of conserving soil phosphorus biogeochemical cycles to support the restoration of deforested environments and the sustainability of managed ecosystems.

 Microbial respiration is conventionally considered the primary driver of short-term carbon dioxide pulses following soil drying-rewetting cycles. However, rapid emission kinetics and delayed microbial recovery in drought-impacted soils suggest substantial abiotic contributions to carbon mineralization, particularly in arid sandy soils. Here, we quantified abiotic carbon emissions during soil drying–rewetting through microbial growth monitoring and sterilization. In sandy soils, abiotic processes dominated initial emissions, accounting for 95.5% of total carbon dioxide production within three hours after rewetting, compared to 39.5% in paddy soils. Solid-liquid interfacial reactions during rewetting drove iron and manganese redox cycling, generating reactive oxygen species that directly promoted carbon mineralization. These reactive oxygen species synergized with enzymes to degrade organic carbon, preferentially targeting dissolved organic matter with low hydrogen-to-carbon ratios and high double bond equivalents, which are typically resistant to microbial degradation. Our findings show that abiotic processes dominate short-term carbon dynamics during rewetting of arid sandy soils.

 Crop mapping is an indispensable application in agricultural and environmental remote sensing. Over the last few decades, the exponential growth of open Earth Observation (EO) data has significantly enhanced crop mapping and enabled the production of detailed crop-specific land cover data at national and regional scales. These data have served multiple purposes across a wide range of applications and research initiatives. However, there is currently no comprehensive summary of the crop mapping data products, nor is there a detailed discussion of their uses in remote sensing studies. This paper provides the first in-depth review of remote sensing for crop mapping from the perspective of crop-specific land cover data by evaluating over 60 open-access operational products, archival crop type map datasets, single-crop extent map datasets, cropping pattern datasets, and crop mapping platforms and systems. Using the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) – one of the most widely used products with over 25 years of continuous monitoring of U.S. croplands – as a case study, we also conduct a systematic literature review on the application of crop type maps in remote sensing science. Our analysis synthesizes 129 research articles through three core research questions: (1) What EO data are used with CDL; (2) What scientific problems and technologies are explored using CDL; and (3) What role does CDL play in remote sensing applications. Furthermore, we delve into the implications of our vision for new data products and propose emerging research topics, ranging from extending the spatiotemporal coverage of current data products to improving global mapping reliability and developing operational in-season crop mapping systems. This review paper not only serves as a reference for stakeholders seeking to utilize crop-specific land cover data in their work, but also outlines the directions for future geospatial data product development."

 Coastal areas worldwide experience serious ground subsidence and rising sea levels, leading to frequent flooding and continued elevation loss. Reliable estimation of coastal subsidence is critical for effective risk assessment and management. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) enables millimeter-scale deformation monitoring, but generating seamless wide-area results remains challenging due to limited swath width and inconsistencies between adjacent frames. This study proposes an adaptive gridded adjustment model for merging multi-path/frame InSAR results into a wide-area high-precision deformation map. We employ a quadtree-based adaptive grid with dynamically optimized sizes determined by the deformation gradient. The gridded corrections are combined with GNSS-constrained global corrections to eliminate inter-frame biases. Applied to the coastal area of the Bohai Rim, this method reduces the Sentinel-1 discrepancies by 38 %, and outperforms the fixed-grid method in achieving an optimal balance between precision and efficiency. This method is useful for wide-area high-precision deformation monitoring to support risk assessments of relative sea level rise in the context of global climate change."

 Parcels are the fundamental units of agricultural management; accurate crop classification of cropland parcels is crucial for the implementation of precision agriculture. Despite extensive knowledge of crop growth processes, the difficulty in acquiring this knowledge and its modal differences with remote sensing data hinder its application in crop classification research. Moreover, the highly complex and variable growth patterns of crops present significant challenges for time-series crop classification. We propose a novel crop classification framework that extracts intricate multi-period features of crop growth from remote sensing time-series signals. Additionally, we introduce an automatic construction process for crop remote sensing knowledge graphs based on a decision tree structure, capturing the association between crops and remote sensing time-series data. Through graph convolution, knowledge graph serves as a global guide to improve crop classification. By combining field survey samples with visible, near-infrared, and radar signals, we constructed a parcel-scale dataset of rice and wheat crops across four cities in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River using zonal feature aggregation methods for evaluation. The results indicate that the proposed framework achieves accuracies ranging from 89.45 % to 94.43 % across the four datasets. We conducted inferences in the four cities and compared the results with county-level statistical data, achieving R2 values of 0.89 and 0.97 for wheat and rice planting areas, respectively. Our proposed framework can automatically generate crop knowledge graphs based on samples from different regions, overcoming the modal barriers between the knowledge space and the remote sensing feature space, thus enhancing crop recognition accuracy."

 Fine-grained soils are crucial for assessing forest diversity and soil disturbances. Existing models for predicting particle size distributions (PSDs) often rely heavily on soil samples or lack necessary spatial dependencies, scalability and flexibility. This study introduces a holistic GeoAI model using graph neural networks (GNNs), LiDAR, and Sentinel-2 data to address these limitations. We collected 330 soil samples from 47 forest stands with a random-stratified method in southwestern Finland. The samples were pre-processed and analyzed for PSDs using a laser diffraction method, and classified into four groups: <2 µm, 2–6 µm, 6–20 µm, and 20–60 µm. To increase the number of annotations, we predicted soil PSDs at unmeasured locations using CoKriging within stands. The forests were segmented into small homogeneous polygons to construct the graph layer. We mapped 61 covariates using LiDAR and Sentinel-2 based on scorpan model, which were then summarized into the graph layer. Subsequently, we established the pipelines of five GNN models regarding the top covariates. The results indicate that geomorphometry and organisms covariates accounted for the majority of importance. The graph attention network (GAT) recorded high stability during training and remarkable prediction accuracy after testing with R2 values above 0.98 in predicting fine-grained soil PSDs across all four soil groups. Conversely, the relational graph convolutional networks (RGCN) also achieved R2 values above 0.97, but with lower stability and longer training times. However, the high accuracy of the predictive models is partly due to the large number of annotations derived from CoKriging, which may introduce uncertainties. Our GAT model demonstrated strong transferability when applied to an independent test stand using CoKriging-derived data (R2: 0.98–0.99) and showed robust performance when evaluated against real ground-truth samples (R2: 0.88–0.95). The observed prediction errors (RMSE: 0.68–2.82) reflect a combination of uncertainties originating from the CoKriging training data (RMSE: 0.34–2.46) and model-induced errors during training (RMSE: 0.37–1.46). Nevertheless, the consistently high R2 values indicate a strong agreement between predicted and measured soil PSDs. Future studies should focus on training the model with a larger number of ground-truth soil samples and evaluating its transferability across diverse boreal forest landscapes."

 Quantifying and minimizing atmospheric transport errors is key to improve meteorological modeling and to better estimate urban greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollution emissions from measurements. The Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) model has been used to simulate urban atmospheric transport in many cities globally and there exist various possible configurations especially concerning choice of physics schemes, which influence the quality of the atmospheric simulation. Here, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of WRF on 1 km resolution for a polycentric European metropolitan area, namely the Rhine-Main-Neckar area by varying Land Surface Model (LSM), Surface Layer Model (SLM), Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) and urban parametrization scheme configurations. We compare four month-long simulations to 2 m temperature, 10 m wind velocity and wind direction measured at 19 stations operated by the German Weather Service and to PBL height derived from radiosonde data at two locations. By showing kernel density functions in a Taylor diagram, we show the average performance of the schemes as well as the spread across different stations. We find that while the 2 m temperature and PBL height performance are most sensitive to choice of urban parametrization scheme, 10 m wind velocity and direction are most sensitive to choice of PBL scheme. Good overall performance was achieved using the Single-Layer Urban Canopy Model (SLUCM), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), Noah-Multiparametrization Land Surface Model (Noah-MP) and Monin-Obukhov (Janjic) (MO) schemes.

Tankyrase, a PAR transferase, adds PAR to itself and other proteins targeting them for proteasomal degradation via the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146. This degradation can be counteracted by RING-UIM E3 ligases RNF114 and RNF166, although the process is unclear. Here, we identify a mechanism that can regulate the balance between MAR and PAR on tankyrase to control degradation. We show that Deltex E3 ligases DTX2 and DTX3 catalyze monoubiquitylation of tankyrase in cells. This ubiquitylation occurs, not on a (canonical) lysine, but rather on MAR, creating a monoubiquitin-MAR hybrid mark. RNF114 and RNF166 recognize this mark using a unique hybrid reader domain and further diubiquitylate it. This ubiquitylation of MAR, which occurs near the ADP-ribose addition site, prevents PAR formation, antagonizing the action of the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146 and stabilizing tankyrase.

Differentiation therapy, aiming to mature CSCs and MDSCs, shows great promise. However, its efficacy is hindered by limited accessibility in hypoxic deep tumor regions. Inspired by the apoptotic body (ApoBD)–mediated deep tumor penetration, we design a pulsatile sequential drug release system with a core-shell structure. The reversible acid-responsive shell protonates and swells in lysosomes to release doxorubicin, inducing lysosomal escape and cell apoptosis. In ApoBDs, it deprotonates and contracts to prevent excessive drug release. After deep penetration via ApoBDs, the hypoxia-responsive core releases all-trans retinoic acid to reverse CSCs and MDSCs, overcoming chemoresistance and modulating the immuno-microenvironment. This strategy targets the heterogeneous distribution of CSCs and MDSCs in solid tumors, enhancing chemo-intervention and immune checkpoint blockade therapy while presenting encouraging potential for cascade deep tumor penetration and differentiation therapy."

Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses identified gene networks involved in cell cycle regulation, embryonic cell identity, and interferon response and revealed features of regulome components, such as susceptibility to pharmacologic inhibition and the fine-tuning of TBXT downstream effectors through IGFBP3. Finally, we found high interferon signaling in chordoma cell lines and patient tumors, which was promoted by TBXT and associated with sensitivity to JAK2 inhibitors. These findings demonstrate the potential of DARPins for probing nuclear proteins to understand the regulatory networks of transcription factor–driven cancers, including entry points for therapies that warrant testing in patients."

Herein, we propose a strategy that involves the rapid and sustained vasculature repair alongside microenvironment-driven drug delivery to achieve multifaceted RA management. The transformable, self-assembling nanoplatform specifically accumulates in the inflamed joint cavity guided by a vascular targeting peptide (STP). Subsequently, STP detaches and undergoes shape transformation, forming nanofibers on the vascular endothelium, which serve as a rapid-acting physical barrier in the short term and facilitate sustained vascular normalization in the long term. Concurrently, the remaining nanoparticles undergo charge reversal and RGD exposure, enabling precise delivery of anti-RA agent triptolide and the immunomodulatory agent metformin. Collectively, this study provides a potent strategy for rapid, sustained, and precise spatiotemporal remodeling of RA using a simple yet intelligent self-assembling nanoplatform."

Many non-native marine taxa are not documented until after they have become invasive, leaving questions about invasion timing (first introduction and lag period), geographic origin, vectors and pathways, and cause(s) of success. Foraminifera, unicellular, calcareous-shelled eukaryotes, offer a unique way of analyzing past ecosystem structure because their fossilized shells provide a window into the past, and small size and abundance enable us to document distribution over time in core samples. We use records of Foraminifera to document the timing and history of establishment of an invasive species (Ammonia confertitesta) in Long Island Sound, east of New York City (USA).A. confertitestawas rare from the mid-19th century but did not proliferate until the mid-1970s.

While Spanish colonists brought horses to the Caribbean decades earlier, settlement of the English colony at Jamestown, Virginia, was among the first dispersals of horses to the eastern seaboard. Archaeozoological analysis of identifiable domestic equid remains from two contexts associated with the initial occupation of Jamestown demonstrates intense processing and consumption of the first Jamestown horses during the “Starving Time” winter of 1609. Osteological and biomolecular study of these equid remains demonstrates their successful reproduction at the colony and use in transport activities and identifies an adult domestic donkey with mixed European and West African ancestry, possibly supplied through undocumented exchange during a transatlantic stopover. These results reveal the challenges of equid translocation in early settlement of eastern North America and the global connectivity of early transatlantic animal exchange."

Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of long-term/low-dose Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) supplementation in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)–infected, ART-treated rhesus macaques (RMs). THC significantly increased plasma/jejunum serotonin and indole-3-propionate, enhancing gut-brain communication through up-regulation of serotonin receptors (HTR4/HTR7) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) signaling via a cannabinoid receptor (CBR)-2–mediated mechanism. Furthermore, THC enriched cholesterol-metabolizingOscillibacterand reduced plasma cholesterol and toxic secondary bile acids (SBAs), thus improving cholesterol and SBA homeostasis. Furthermore, THC increased β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels via a CBR1-mediated mechanism, suggesting enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation for metabolic and cardiovascular health. THC restored ART/SIV-induced elevation of pro-inflammatory and cardiotoxic long-chain acylcholines to preinfection levels.

We developed a Bayesian computational model to decompose path integration errors into distinct components. SCD participants exhibited significantly higher path integration error, primarily driven by increased memory leak, while other modeling-derived error sources, such as velocity gain, sensory, and reporting noise, remained comparable across groups. Our findings suggest that path integration deficits, specifically memory leak, may serve as an early marker of neurodegeneration in SCD and highlight the potential of self-motion–based navigation tasks for detecting presymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease–related cognitive changes."

The stress-protective transcription factor heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) is associated with cancer, but its function in breast carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. Analysis of human breast tumor samples and mouse in vivo xenografts uncovered that HSF2 expression and activity undergo dynamic changes as a function of tumor progression. HSF2 expression, nuclear localization, and coexpression with the proliferation marker Ki67 are increased in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), suggesting that HSF2 designates hyperplastic cells underlying tumor expansion. In mouse xenografts, HSF2 localization switches from nuclear to cytoplasmic upon DCIS-to-invasive transition. Using cell-based models, we identify canonical transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling as the molecular mechanism regulating HSF2. TGF-β–mediated down-regulation of HSF2 allowed acquisition of an invasive cell phenotype, which was counteracted by ectopic HSF2.

Grishchuk,"Ndc80 complex, a conserved coupler for kinetochore-microtubule motility, is a sliding molecular clutch","Chromosome motion at spindle microtubule plus ends relies on dynamic molecular bonds between kinetochores and proximal microtubule walls. Under opposing forces, kinetochores move bidirectionally along these walls while remaining near the ends, yet how continuous wall sliding occurs without end detachment remains unclear. Using ultrafast force-clamp spectroscopy, we show that single Ndc80 complexes, the primary microtubule-binding kinetochore component, exhibit processive, bidirectional sliding. Plus end–directed forces induce a mobile catch bond in Ndc80, increasing frictional resistance and restricting sliding toward the tip. Conversely, forces pulling Ndc80 away from the plus end trigger mobile slip-bond behavior, facilitating sliding. This dual behavior arises from force-dependent modulation of the Nuf2 calponin-homology domain’s microtubule binding, identifying this subunit as a friction regulator. We propose that Ndc80’s ability to modulate sliding friction provides the mechanistic basis for the kinetochore’s end coupling, enabling its slip-clutch behavior."

Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been previously implicated in ABP of epithelial cells, and, here, we find that it is apically expressed in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) during neural induction. Gal-3 blockade disrupts ABP and alters the distribution of junctional proteins in hESC-derived neural rosettes and is rescued by addition of recombinant Gal-3. Transcriptomics analysis shows that blocking Gal-3 regulates expression of genes responsible for nervous system development and cell junction assembly, among others. Last, Gal-3 blockade during embryonic development in vivo reduces horizontal cell divisions, disturbs cortical layering of neural progenitors, and induces gyrification. These data uncover a regulatory mechanism for ABP in the brain and warrant caution in modulating Gal-3 during pregnancy."

Using parylene C film for waterproofing and encapsulation, the ultrathin perovskite curved image sensor with the hierarchical mesh design is demonstrated, which conforms to spherical surfaces of different radii while maintaining mechanical stability during deformation. The image sensor exhibits low detection limit (10 nanowatts per square centimeter) and long-term stable dynamic photoresponse. Combining the image sensor with a tunable lens achieves clear images at different distances via simultaneously adjusting both sensor and lens radii.

Small signaling peptides play crucial roles in the regulation of stress responses in plants. Here, we unveil that the TaCEP15 peptide interacts with the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase TaCEPRL. Knockout ofTaCEP15orTaCEPRLincreases primary root length and enhances drought tolerance in wheat. TaCEPRL interacts with and phosphorylates TaSnRK1α, leading to the degradation of TaSnRK1α. The presence of TaCEP15 intensifies the phosphorylation and degradation of TaSnRK1α. Consistently, overexpressingTaSnRK1α boosts primary root elongation and augments drought tolerance. In addition, we identify the transcription factor TabZIP9, which binds to theTaCEP15promoter and suppresses its transcription. A-to-T substitution in theTaCEP15promoter decreases the binding affinity of TabZIP9. As expected, transgenic plants withTabZIP9knockout or overexpression exhibit noteworthy changes in primary root length and drought tolerance.

Previous global analyses described increased yield volatility from warming, but it has become increasingly clear that changes in water availability are also a key determinant of yields. Here, we provide the first global quantification of climate change impacts on maize, soybean, and sorghum yield variance due to changes in temperature and soil moisture. Pairing an empirical crop model with CMIP6 simulations indicates that changes in temperature and soil moisture increase interannual weather-induced yield variance by7to19%°Cacross crops. This increase is driven roughly equally by previously quantified increased temperature stress variance, as well as by increased covariance between temperature and soil moisture stresses. Results using a simple land surface model are consistent with those using CMIP6 simulations in indicating that this increased covariance is driven by warmer air more quickly drying soils and by dry soils promoting greater warming."

Connectomic analyses revealed that the sLNvs form strong synaptic connections with previously uncharacterized neurons called superior lateral protocerebrum 316 (SLP316). Here, we show that silencing the synaptic output from the SLP316 neurons via tetanus toxin expression shortened the free-running period, whereas hyperexciting them by expressing the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel resulted in period lengthening. Under light-dark cycles, silencing SLP316 neurons caused lower daytime activity and higher daytime sleep.

We characterize this crossover both numerically, revealing a power-law decay in the cluster-size distribution, and analytically, by connecting to percolation theory. Comparison with data suggests that populations evolve toward the sparse phase by remaining near the crossover.

 Elucidating size-dependent formation mechanisms of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) remains a critical research gap in atmospheric chemistry. Here, we analyzed water-soluble compounds in size-segregated aerosol samples (0.056–18 µm) collected at a coastal site in southern China. Radiocarbon (14C) isotope analysis reveals that fossil sources dominate SOAs in both fine (95.8 %) and coarse (80.4 %) modes, while the small quantity of biogenic SOAs mostly exist in the coarse mode (74.1 %). Fine-mode oxygenated organic carbon (OOC) correlates strongly with polar carbonyl compounds (e.g., glyoxal, methylglyoxal, acetone, and MVK + MACR), while coarse-mode OOC exhibits better correlations with nonpolar aromatic hydrocarbons (e.g., toluene, C8 aromatics, C9 aromatics, styrene) and biogenic volatile organic compounds (VOCs) (e.g., monoterpenes, isoprene), indicating that the sources of fine- and coarse-mode OOC are different. Multivariate analyses incorporating inorganic ions, pH, water-soluble iron ions, aerosol liquid water content, and O3 revealed divergent size-dependent mechanisms, emphasizing the significant role of aqueous-phase reactions in fine-mode OOC formation, particularly the key contribution of water-soluble Fe ions (r2 = 0.74), while coarse-mode OOC exhibited a notable correlation with O3 (r2 = 0.63). Combining the information on VOC precursors and key components, our study elucidates the fact that aqueous-phase reactions play a key role in fine-mode OOC, especially the Fenton reaction, while gas-phase VOC autoxidation plays an important role in coarse-mode OOC generation.

These models' computational cost poses a challenge in studying low-probability extreme weather. We use machine learning to construct a new probabilistic system. We give an in-depth explanation of how we constructed this system. We present a thorough pipeline to validate our method. Our method requires fewer computational resources than existing weather and climate models. 
 Simulating low-likelihood high-impact extreme weather events in a warming world is a significant and challenging task for current ensemble forecasting systems.   While these systems presently use up to 100 members, larger ensembles could enrich the sampling of internal variability. They may capture the long tails associated with climate hazards better than traditional ensemble sizes.  Due to computational constraints, it is infeasible to generate huge ensembles (comprised of 1000–10 000 members) with traditional, physics-based numerical models. In this two-part paper, we replace traditional numerical simulations with machine learning (ML) to generate hindcasts of huge ensembles.  In Part 1, we construct an ensemble weather forecasting system based on spherical Fourier neural operators (SFNOs), and we discuss important design decisions for constructing such an ensemble.  The ensemble represents model uncertainty through perturbed-parameter techniques, and it represents initial condition uncertainty through bred vectors, which sample the fastest-growing modes of the forecast.  Using the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) as a baseline, we develop an evaluation pipeline composed of mean, spectral, and extreme diagnostics.  With large-scale, distributed SFNOs with 1.1 billion learned parameters, we achieve calibrated probabilistic forecasts.  As the trajectories of the individual members diverge, the ML ensemble mean spectra degrade with lead time, consistent with physical expectations. However, the individual ensemble members' spectra stay constant with lead time.  Therefore, these members simulate realistic weather states during the rollout, and the ML ensemble passes a crucial spectral test in the literature. The IFS and ML ensembles have similar extreme forecast indices, and we show that the ML extreme weather forecasts are reliable and discriminating.  These diagnostics ensure that the ensemble can reliably simulate the time evolution of the atmosphere, including low-likelihood high-impact extremes.  In Part 2, we generate a huge ensemble initialized each day in summer 2023, and we characterize the simulations of extremes."

This ensemble provides a large sample size, which is essential to characterize the statistics of extreme weather events and study their physical mechanisms. Also, these ensembles can be beneficial to accurately forecast the probability of low-likelihood extreme weather. 
 In Part 1, we created an ensemble based on spherical Fourier neural operators. As initial condition perturbations, we used bred vectors, and as model perturbations, we used multiple checkpoints trained independently from scratch.  Based on diagnostics that assess the ensemble's physical fidelity, our ensemble has comparable performance to operational weather forecasting systems.  However, it requires orders-of-magnitude fewer computational resources.  Here in Part 2, we generate a huge ensemble (HENS), with 7424 members initialized each day of summer 2023.  We enumerate the technical requirements for running huge ensembles at this scale. HENS precisely samples the tails of the forecast distribution and presents a detailed sampling of internal variability. HENS has two primary applications: (1) as a large dataset with which to study the statistics and drivers of extreme weather and (2) as a weather forecasting system. For extreme climate statistics, HENS samples events 4σ away from the ensemble mean. At each grid cell, HENS increases the skill of the most accurate ensemble member and enhances coverage of possible future trajectories.  As a weather forecasting model, HENS issues extreme weather forecasts with better uncertainty quantification. It also reduces the probability of outlier events, in which the verification value lies outside the ensemble forecast distribution."

Tested on Mediterranean, Adriatic, and Atlantic sea data, CRITER outperforms current methods, reducing errors by up to 44 %. 
 Satellite observations of sea surface temperature (SST) are essential for accurate weather forecasting and climate modeling. However, these data often suffer from incomplete coverage due to cloud obstruction and limited satellite swath width, which requires development of dense reconstruction algorithms. The current state of the art struggles to accurately recover high-frequency variability, particularly in SST gradients in ocean fronts, eddies, and filaments, which are crucial for downstream processing and predictive tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel two-stage method CRITER (Coarse Reconstruction with ITerative Refinement Network), which consists of two stages. First, it reconstructs low-frequency SST components utilizing a Vision Transformer-based model, leveraging global spatio-temporal correlations in the available observations. Second, a UNet type of network iteratively refines the estimate by recovering high-frequency details.

By utilizing best software practices like modular design, version control, and clear documentation, the new WaterGAP supports collaboration across teams. It can be easily understood, applied, and enhanced by both novice and experienced modellers. Additionally, we share the reprogramming process to assist in the reprogramming of other large geoscientific research software. 
 Global hydrological models (GHMs) improve our understanding of water flows and storage on the continents and have undergone significant advancements in process representation over the past four decades. However, as research questions and GHMs become increasingly complex, maintaining and enhancing existing model codes efficiently has become challenging. Issues such as non-modular design, inconsistent variable naming, insufficient documentation, lack of automated software testing suites, and containerization hinder the sustainability of GHM research software as well as the reproducibility of study results obtained with the help of GHMs. Although some GHMs have been reprogrammed to address these challenges, existing literature focuses on evaluating the quality of model output rather than the quality of the reprogrammed software. To address this research gap and guide other researchers who wish to implement their existing models as sustainable research software, we describe how the most recent version of the GHM WaterGAP was reprogrammed. The success of reprogramming is assessed based on various software sustainability criteria and the FAIR4RS principles – findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability – since the primary goal was to improve software sustainability and research reproducibility, rather than model output quality. Following an agile project management approach, WaterGAP was rewritten from scratch in Python with a modular Model-View-Controller architecture. Due to the switch from C/C++ in the legacy code to Python, execution time doubled. Our evaluation indicates that the reprogramming substantially improved the software's usability, maintainability, and extensibility, making the reprogrammed WaterGAP software much more sustainable than its predecessor. The reprogrammed WaterGAP software can be easily understood, applied, and enhanced by novice and experienced modellers and is suited for collaborative code development across diverse teams and locations, fostering the establishment of a community GHM. We outline four lessons learned from the reprogramming process concerning the sustainability-runtime trade-off, the applicability of the agile approach, software design patterns, variable naming, external documentation, and automation."

We studied 12 peatlands on a trophic gradient in northwestern Canada, including permafrost peat plateaus and thawed bogs and fens, to determine the effects of thaw on MeHg production from measures of soil and porewater MeHg and in situ methylation assays. The production of MeHg was greater in thawed peatlands, especially rich fens, as indicated by higher potential rates of microbial methylation of inorganic mercury (Hg) to MeHg and higher soil %MeHg (MeHg:total Hg). Soil %MeHg was 0.1% in permafrost peat plateaus, 0.7% in bogs, and 2.0% in fens. Microbial analysis indicated three putative methylators (two methanogens and one novel bacteria) as most influential to the community composition, although their abundances were not consistently highest in fens. Fens had a greater range of porewater MeHg concentrations than bogs, potentially due to hydrological flushing, controls on MeHg solubility, or redox disequilibria in fens. MeHg in porewater was strongly associated with dissolved organic matter that had a low aromaticity and a low oxygen-to-carbon ratio. Regionally upscaling our results suggested that the expansion of bogs and fens due to thawing may increase the landscape-scale potential for MeHg production by 65% by 2100, representing a substantial risk to downstream aquatic ecosystems."

The current paradigm suggests that the microbial methylation of inorganic Hg within the oceanic water column produces monomethylmercury (MMHg) and potentially dimethylmercury (DMHg). Reaction rates and main drivers governing MeHg levels (sum of MMHg and DMHg) are poorly constrained. We conducted ambient Hg species measurements and enriched isotopic tracer experiments in waters of two contrasting marine environments: the oligotrophic Mediterranean Sea (MED) and the mesotrophic Atlantic Ocean (ATL). Maximum subsurface MeHg levels were ∼2 times higher in the MED compared to the ATL, essentially driven by higher DMHg concentrations (0.45 ± 0.06 vs 0.16 ± 0.02 pM). Methylation was detectable only in unfiltered subsurface waters and presumably biotically driven. The highest methylation rate (MMHg to DMHg) was observed in subsurface MED waters, while reduction and demethylation rates were highest in surface waters of both environments. Experimental reaction rates and the potential microbial activity (based on 16S rDNA) were aligned with ambient Hg species distributions. Assuming high DMHg stability and applying our fast experimental DMHg formation rates, a newly developed 1D water column model (MED) successfully reproduced the MeHg species distribution, suggesting that DMHg plays a key role in the global marine Hg cycle."

While the cement industry faces increasing pressure to achieve carbon neutrality, there is a lack of existing transport and storage infrastructure, high investment costs, and public perception risks. In this study, cost-effective CCS systems are designed to abate different fractions of the U.S. cement industry using integrated spatial and cost modeling. The median total capture cost ranges from $144/tCO2 to abate 15% of the sector to $215/tCO2 for 100%. Building on the cement-centric system design, the potential for a large-scale pipeline network based around the location of “carbon hubs”─collections of nearby industries─is analyzed to understand opportunities to reduce costs. While connecting to a carbon hub is not economical for all facilities, there is an opportunity to capture 5X the emissions while only increasing the investment by 2X. If the cement industry were to be a first mover in CCS deployment, the industry could have an outsized positive impact across industrial sectors and accelerate industrial CCS deployment. However, support is needed beyond the Section 45Q Tax Credit since it is not enough for a majority of cement plants to invest in CCS infrastructure."

River basins, with high population densities and poor waste management, are particularly exposed to plastic pollution. Floods amplify the presence of plastic in rivers by mobilizing previously deposited materials and introducing new plastics. Yet, the fate of these mobilized plastics remains unclear, with observations suggesting either downstream export or floodplain deposition. This study assesses flood impact on macroplastic deposition along river floodplains, using data from 14 events─five floods and nine nonflood conditions─across two Dutch rivers. Higher flood return periods increased macroplastic deposition, with the two largest floods depositing two to three times more macroplastic than nonflood conditions. Deposition mechanisms varied by flood type. Obstruction-based deposition dominated during an extreme summer flood, when macroplastics accumulated mainly in inundated vegetation. Low-energy deposition prevailed during a long winter flood, with high plastic concentrations found in wide floodplain sections where flow velocities decreased. Flood severity and plastic entry into the environment are both projected to increase. Therefore, we expect an even more prominent role for floods in the global distribution of plastic pollution."

This study evaluated the adsorption of butylparaben (BP) by pristine (PS) and aged polystyrene nanoplastics (APS) and prepared BP-loaded aged PS to analyze their effects on Microcystis aeruginosa. The results showed that APS had stronger BP adsorption and translocation capacity, with APS increasing BP adsorption by 4.34-fold and significantly enhancing its bioconcentration in M. aeruginosa. Compared with the PS–BP treatment, the 1.13 ng/g APS–BP treatment significantly inhibited algal growth, exacerbated cell membrane damage and oxidative stress, and promoted MC-LR synthesis and release. Transcriptome analyses and molecular docking showed that BP inhibited quorum sensing (QS) by binding to luxR, whereas APS further enhanced the binding affinity of BP and blocked the binding of N-acylhomoserine lactone, a natural QS signaling molecule, to its receptor, amplifying the QS inhibitory effect. QS inhibition downregulated genes related to photosynthesis, membrane synthesis, and oxidative stress and upregulated genes related to MC-LR synthesis.

Collectively, these SWBs potentially remove approximately 169.97 kt N y–1 from paddy runoff, equivalent to 23.62% of national crop N emissions, yielding an estimated economic benefit of 1.68 billion USD. However, a spatial mismatch between SWB distribution and N emission hotspots hampers the current efficiency, as 23.04% of paddy fields have high N loads but limited SWBs. Increasing SWBs in these critical areas shows better N removal efficiency than a nationwide increase strategy under land resource constraints. Specifically, increasing SWBs from the current 1.08–1.23% of the rice region achieves the most cost-effective 20.96% increase in N removal. Increasing macrophyte coverage in these SWBs to 25–50% could further augment N removal by 5.98–10.58%.

The role of organo-mineral associations in regulating glyphosate retention and transformation pathways, however, remains unclear. In this study, we employed time-resolved in situ ATR-FTIR spectroscopy and microfluidic experiments coupled with LC-MS quantification to track glyphosate and its oxidation byproducts. A model protein (bovine serum albumin; BSA) and two Mn oxides (K-birnessite and hausmannite) were used to represent environmentally relevant interfaces. Our results show that protein adsorption onto Mn oxide surfaces favors the AMPA oxidation pathway over the glycine and sarcosine pathways, particularly under acidic pH. This pathway selectivity correlates with altered surface coordination, where adsorbed protein promotes mononuclear monodentate binding via the phosphonate group. Additionally, protein association diminishes the extent and rate of glyphosate adsorption, desorption, and oxidation by passivating Mn oxide active sites and forming glyphosate–protein complexes at pH 4.6 and 7.2. Given the ubiquity of organo-mineral associations, the shift toward AMPA formation (a toxic and persistent byproduct) has critical implications for human and ecosystem health. These insights advance the mechanistic understanding of glyphosate behavior at redox-active organo-mineral interfaces and inform sustainable soil management and pollution mitigation strategies."

During the Pleistocene, coccolithophores experienced several periodic high‐abundance and dominance intervals (acmes) that significantly altered the ocean carbon cycle by increasing the production of carbonate in the ocean. However, the reason for these episodes of enhanced calcification is still unclear. Here, we focus on one of the most significant dominance intervals, the Gephyrocapsa caribbeanica acme event, that lasted between ∼500 and 300 thousand years ago. We find that the variations of seawater alkalinity made only a minor contribution to the increased calcification rates during coccolithophore blooms. Rather, coccolithophore carbon isotopic fractionation indicates that coccolithophores employed a stronger bicarbonate pumping to increase intracellular carbon availability. Greater nutrient availability and shallower living depth likely facilitated higher bicarbonate pumping rates. The upregulation of bicarbonate pumping indicates the vital role of nutrients and light, and not only the ocean carbonate system, in the evolution of marine phytoplankton. Models of future coccolithophore calcification response to changing ocean carbon chemistry would, therefore, benefit from a more comprehensive consideration of how light and nutrient availability affect cellular energy budgets and drive carbon uptake."

Chl a bursts were concentrated within 2° of the typhoon center and peaked 1–6 days after passage. The strongest Chl a responses occurred with slow, large typhoons, while fast, small typhoons induced the weakest response.

Formation of bridgmanite occurs at a depth of about 660 km causing the strong and abrupt seismic discontinuity. Previous experimental studies have revealed that this discontinuity is caused by ringwoodite dissociation in the average mantle. However, the cause of the 660‐km seismic discontinuity beneath hotspots remains unclear. Here we determine the phase relations in the MgSiO3 system near the 660‐km seismic discontinuity conditions. At 2,200–2,350 K with decreasing pressure, MgSiO3 bridgmanite first transforms to akimotoite and then to garnet. The akimotoite‐bridgmanite boundary has almost no temperature dependence, whereas the garnet–akimotoite transition has a very steep positive boundary slope. Based on these slopes, we calculated the garnet–bridgmanite boundary slope. Depending on the temperature regime, the akimotoite‐bridgmanite or the garnet–bridgmanite transition may occur in ascending plume beneath hotspots near the 660 km depth."

 Prokaryotes create adaptive immune memories by acquiring foreign DNA snippets, known as spacers, into the CRISPR array1. In type II CRISPR-Cas systems, the RNA-guided effector Cas9 also assists the acquisition machinery by selecting spacers from protospacer adjacent motif (PAM)-flanked DNA2,3. Here, we uncover the first biological role for Cas9 that is independent of its dual RNA partners. Following depletion of crRNA and/or tracrRNA, Neisseria apoCas9 stimulates spacer acquisition efficiency. Physiologically, Cas9 senses low levels of crRNA in cells with short CRISPR arrays – such as those undergoing array neogenesis or natural array contractions – and dynamically upregulates acquisition to quickly expand the small immune memory banks. As the CRISPR array expands, rising crRNA abundance in turn reduces apoCas9 availability, thereby dampening acquisition to mitigate autoimmunity risks associate with elevated acquisition. While apoCas9’s nuclease lobe alone suffices for stimulating acquisition, only full-length Cas9 responses to crRNA levels to boost acquisition in cells with low immunity depth. Finally, we show that this activity is evolutionarily conserved across multiple type II-C Cas9 orthologs. Altogether, we establish an auto-replenishing feedback mechanism in which apoCas9 safeguards CRISPR immunity depth by acting as both a crRNA sensor and a regulator of spacer acquisition."

Here, the authors develop a soybean–bradyrhizobial symbiosis system with enhanced capacity to reduce N2O emissions using the incompatibility between two soybean R genes and their effector present in bradyrhizobia. 
 Soybeans fix atmospheric N2 through symbiosis with rhizobia. The relationship between rhizobia and soybeans, particularly those with high nitrous oxide (N2O)-reducing (N2OR) activities, can be leveraged to reduce N2O emissions from agricultural soils. However, inoculating soybeans with these rhizobia under field conditions often fails because of the competition from indigenous rhizobia that possess low or no N2OR activity. In this work, we utilize natural incompatibility systems between soybean and rhizobia to address this challenge. Specifically, Rj2 and GmNNL1 inhibit certain rhizobial infections in response to NopP, an effector protein. By combining a soybean line with a hybrid accumulation of the Rj2 and GmNNL1 genes and bradyrhizobia lacking the nopP gene, we develop a soybean-bradyrhizobial symbiosis system in which strains with high N2OR activity predominantly infect. Our optimize symbiotic system substantially reduces N2O emissions in field and laboratory tests, presenting a promising approach for sustainable agricultural practices.

 The composition of Earth’s core is a fundamental property of the Earth’s deep interior, defining its present structure and long term thermal and magnetic evolution. However, the composition of the core is not well understood, with several combinations of light elements being able to satisfy the traditional constraints from cosmochemistry, core formation and seismology. The classic view of inner core formation does not include the necessity for liquids to be supercooled to below their melting point before freezing. Attempts to calculate the magnitude of this supercooling have found that several binary core compositions are incompatible with inner core nucleation. Here we show, through molecular dynamics simulations, that nucleation from an Fe1−xCx=0.1-0.15 composition is compatible with a range of geophysical constraints. Whilst not a complete description of core chemistry, our results demonstrate that inner core nucleation places a strong constraint on the composition of Earth’s core that may allow discrimination between previously identified potential compositions.

 Brown adipose tissue (BAT) plays a key role in metabolic homeostasis through its thermogenic effects and the secretion of regulatory molecules. Here we report that RAP250 haploinsufficiency stimulates BAT in mice, thus contributing to a decrease in fat accumulation. Local in vivo AAV-mediated RAP250 silencing in BAT reduces body weight and fat mass and enhances glucose oxidation, thereby indicating that RAP250 participates in the regulation of BAT metabolic activity. Analysis of the mechanisms led to the finding that Neuritin 1 is produced and released by brown adipocytes, it plays a key metabolic role, and it participates in the enhanced BAT metabolic activity under RAP250 deficiency. Forced overexpression of Neuritin 1 in UCP1-expressing cells markedly decreases fat mass and body weight gain in mice and induces the expression of thermogenic genes in BAT. Neuritin 1-deficient brown adipocytes also shows a reduced β-adrenergic response. We demonstrate a metabolic role of BAT-derived Neuritin 1 acting through an autocrine/paracrine mechanism.

 This study focuses on developing comprehensive malaria risk model for Indonesia, integrating susceptibility, vulnerability, and capacity to better understand and manage malaria risks across the country. The primary objective was to identify high-risk areas and prioritize malaria management efforts by combining machine-deep learning techniques and socioeconomic data. Using Gradient Tree Boosting, Classification and Regression Tree, Random Forest algorithms and Deep Learning Multilayer Perceptron, the study analyzed malaria susceptibility, revealing that 38% of Indonesia’s territory was categorized as highly susceptible, with the provinces of Central Kalimantan, West Kalimantan, East Kalimantan, South Sumatra, and Papua identified as the most affected regions. Novel aspects of this study include integrating age and sex ratios to model vulnerability and calculating healthcare access to assess capacity, which showed that 65% of the territory exhibited high vulnerability and 34% had low healthcare capacity, with Kalimantan and Papua consistently ranking highest in risk factors. By combining these factors, the final malaria risk model identified 88 cities with high malaria risk, of which 60 cities with low Gross Regional Domestic Product were prioritized for intervention.

 Substantial nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from permafrost-affected regions could accelerate climate warming, given that N2O exhibits approximately 300 times greater radiative forcing potential than carbon dioxide. Pronounced differences exist in N2O emissions between freeze and thaw periods (FP and TP), but the mechanisms by which environmental factors regulate the production and emission of N2O during these two periods have not been thoroughly examined. We therefore combined static chamber gas chromatography, in-situ soil temperature (ST) and moisture (SM) monitoring, and 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate seasonal N2O variations in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) alpine meadow ecosystem, and assess the relative contributions of environmental and microbial drivers. Our findings indicate that N2O fluxes (−3.15 to 6.10 μg m−2 h−1) fluctuated between weak sources and sinks, peaking during FP, particularly at its late stage with initial surface soil thawing. Soil properties affect N2O emissions by regulating denitrification processes and altering microbial community diversity. During the FP, ST fluctuations control N2O release by modifying mineral nutrient availability. During TP, soil texture modulates denitrification-driven N2O production through its effect on SM. Spring N2O pulses likely originate from microbial reactivation in thawed soil. N2O accumulated in frozen soil may gradually release during vertical profile thawing. On the QTP, a warmer and wetter climate scenario may alter N2O emissions by modifying the duration of the FP and TP and phase-specific hydrothermal allocation. This study provides mechanistic insights for predicting climate change impacts on N2O flux in fragile alpine meadow ecosystems."

 The Yangtze River Basin (YRB), home to millions of people and vital farmlands, faces increasing flood risks due to extreme summer rainfall. This study demonstrated that the western North Pacific warm pool (WNPWP) can exert significant impacts on extreme precipitation in YRB through modulating atmospheric intraseasonal activities over the northwestern Pacific, which operates on 25–80-day timescales. Extreme precipitation occurs preferentially during warm WNPWP summers compared to cold WNPWP summers owing to that intraseasonal oscillation (ISO) over the northwestern Pacific is more likely to induce extreme rainfall over the YRB during warm WNPWP summers than cold WNPWP summers. The underlying mechanism involves enhanced southwesterly moisture transport by the anomalous anticyclone over the northwestern Pacific driven by the ISO in its specific phases. Crucially, this transport intensifies remarkably during warm WNPWP summers due to the strengthened anticyclonic background manifested as the westward extension of the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) in response to warm WNPWP conditions, which is statistically tied to preceding El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events."

RELMγ is part of a pore-forming protein family that defends the host against bacteria by perforating their membranes. In mice with acute infarcts, leukocyte-specificRetnlgdeletion reduced ventricular tachycardia.

Exceptions follow structure-function associations that arose independently multiple times, specifically, the gain of D1 claws with subterranean habits and the loss of D1 ungues with oral-only feeding behavior. We hypothesize that early acquisition of D1 nails and manually dexterous food handling was crucial for rodents to adaptively leverage cranial specializations for efficient gnawing and thereby exploit hard seeds and nuts, a niche that they dominated after the extinction of multituberculates. Our study recasts ideas about rodent evolution and uncovers a previously unrecognized contributor to their successful radiation."

To help address this controversy, we synthesized and probed 40 M4AlC3layered carbide phases containing two to nine metals and found that short-range ordering from enthalpy was present until the entropy increased enough to achieve complete disordering of the transition metals in their atomic planes. We transformed all of these layered carbide phases into two-dimensional (2D) sheets and showed the effects of the order versus disorder on their surface properties and electronic behavior.

The physiological features of these neurons were used to train a machine learning classifier, which subsequently inferred specific interneuron families in large-scale recordings. This combined approach enabled the reconstruction of synaptic connectivity motifs across interneuron family members.

Defined as the difference between actual and attainable crop yields, they can be reduced by expanding irrigation and increasing nutrient inputs—strategies whose land, water, and nutrient requirements have been quantified in previous studies; however, their energy consumption and emissions remain largely unknown. This study quantifies the energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with yield gap closure through irrigation and fertilizer management. Our findings indicate that energy consumption for irrigation pumping, and fertilizer production under baseline scenario is 462 TWh and 1884 TWh per year, respectively. Nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium fertilizers account for 97%, 2%, and 1% of total fertilizer energy consumption. These activities contribute 552 Mt CO2e annually—154 Mt from irrigation and 398 Mt from fertilizer production. Closing the full yield gap would double annual energy consumption to 4579 TWh with emissions of 1.1 Gt CO2e, equivalent to 3% of global energy consumption and 2% of total GHG emissions in 2020. Although closing 75% or 50% of the yield gap would reduce energy use and GHG emissions, countries such as India, Pakistan, Afghanistan, and several in Sub-Saharan Africa would still face disproportionate burdens, requiring over 15% of their national energy consumption and more than 5% of their total GHG emissions to achieve the full yield gap closure.

(3) Comprehensive spatial-temporal analysis shows that surpluses are concentrated in western regions, while deficits dominate central and eastern cities, with most eastern and western areas improving, in contrast to declining trends in central cities; the province-wide average index rose from 0.45 to 0.51. (4) The DID results confirm that the NKEFZs policy significantly improved the balance of ecosystem services, with the effect remaining robust after multiple tests.

Evapotranspiration (ET) is central to understand these processes, as it regulates water transport across the Amazon. However, its long-term responses to ongoing climate change and human activities remain poorly understood. This study conducted a multi-scale analysis of ET trends from basin to local scale in the most deforested region of the Brazilian Amazon. We applied a remote sensing-based model (geeSEBAL) from 1990 to 2022 to assess deforestation and climate change effects on ET. Our results indicate that overall ET in the Amazon arc of deforestation has increased by 11% during the dry season despite significant forest removal, largely due to the contribution of intact forests and global warming feedback. While these findings suggest a forest response to a changing climate, they also highlight a critical vulnerability that is exacerbated by the threat of ongoing deforestation. With projected warmer future climate and extended dry seasons, our results emphasize the complex interplay between water recycling and climate change in the world’s largest rainforest, with significant ecological and water security implications."

In the Amazon, deforestation disrupts this process, altering moisture source and sink dynamics of areas in the region and impacting its overall moisture recycling function. This study examined the spatial and temporal variability of moisture recycling by assessing the responses of moisture sources and sinks to deforestation across different time lags, focusing on the Amazon’s contribution to and dependency on its moisture recycling regime. We used the UTrack moisture tracking model and high-resolution deforestation data from MapBiomas to quantify changes in dependency and contribution of the Amazon over a 22 year period (2000–2021). Our findings revealed high heterogeneity in moisture recycling patterns across the Amazon. We also found that deforestation affects both immediate and delayed moisture recycling responses, with mid- and long-term responses (13–48 months and 49–72 months) more pronounced than immediate responses (1–12 months). Deforestation is associated with a decreasing evaporation contribution of the Amazon to its moisture recycling regime as moisture sources and an increasing dependency for precipitation as moisture sinks. These results underscore the persistent and delayed effects of deforestation on the hydrological cycle of this important biome."

Utilizing ship-based observations from a decaying cyclonic eddy off southeastern Sri Lanka, we reveal that while both the eddy interior and frontal zones exhibit elevated phytoplankton biomass due to different nutrient supply mechanisms, they drive divergent particulate organic carbon (POC) transfer efficiency: enhanced within the eddy but reduced at the front. Subsurface hydrodynamic processes and particle size distributions shaped contrasting export efficiency. During the decay phase, downwelling, weaker stratification, and larger particles inside the eddy promoted efficient POC transfer to depth. Conversely, frontal upwelling, strong stratification induced by water-mass convergence, and finer particles attenuated export. These findings demonstrate that decaying eddy-front systems exhibit spatially heterogeneous carbon sequestration efficiencies, challenging assumptions of uniform attenuation rates and underscoring the need to resolve life-stage dynamics in biological pump assessments."

We then propose a clear typology of heat indices, aligned with WMO guidance: (1) temperature indicators, (2) thermal indices, and (3) heatwave intensity indices. The typology clarifies what each type measures, where it performs best, and the trade-offs involved, helping systems move toward greater transparency, coherence, and fit-for-purpose. Each type offers distinct strengths, and many countries will benefit from layered approaches that combine them. Moving toward intensity-based approaches represents a conceptual shift, from identifying hot days to quantifying the severity of heatwaves.

The analysis covers the period from 1960 to 2018, consistent with GDIS’ temporal coverage. CDF events are defined as instances where drought and flood hazards occur concurrently or sequentially, with a flood taking place during a drought period or within four months of its end. Our findings for the global extratropics reveal that the economic losses and the number of affected people resulting from CDF events are up to eight times higher than those ascribed to isolated droughts or floods, with a confidence interval ranging from one to twelve. Similar qualitative results emerge from DesInventar and EM-DAT, albeit with some quantitative differences. Furthermore, impact ratios have increased in more recent decades compared to earlier periods, emphasizing the increasing impacts of the drought-flood compound events. These results highlight the amplified negative impacts when droughts and floods occur concomitantly or sequentially, underscoring the need for targeted policies to address their socioeconomic risks, particularly under changing climatic conditions."

Mangrove restoration strategies have typically focused on either passive (i.e. re-establishing tidal regimes suitable for natural mangrove recruitment), or active (planting) restoration approaches. To date, mangrove restoration projects typically consider chronic environmental pressures at a site (e.g. the tide). However, acute or extreme weather events (e.g. waves, floods, droughts, etc) are important drivers of global mangrove loss and are rarely considered in restoration projects. In this study, the mangrove lifecycle ecosystem analysis and forecasting model was used to monitor the temporal and spatial effectiveness of passive and active mangrove restoration projects when exposed to routine tides and wind waves, and extreme weather events like floods, droughts and storm conditions. Passive restoration was the most recommended strategy for mangrove survival and ecosystem services across all tested environmental conditions, except constant wind waves. These outcomes were overcome by the active planting of mangrove saplings with stems tall enough to resist overturning and/or wave breaking forces. Planting was most beneficial when restricted to bed elevations where propagules would naturally recruit and when waves were present. Propagule availability was found to be critical in re-populating sites post climatic events (e.g. storms) and was most effective in ensuring the long-term development of active restoration strategies. Mangrove planting provided immediate returns on ecosystem services post-restoration, before converging with the outputs of passive restoration. This study provides previously missing guidance regarding mangrove restoration for a range of chronic conditions and extreme weather events, highlighting the importance of aligning restoration conditions with the mangrove lifecycle for tailored restoration strategies."

This study investigates the large-scale atmospheric drivers behind these extremes using NOAA OISST v2.1 and ERA5 reanalysis datasets. We characterize MHWs from May to August 2023, analyze surface and mid-tropospheric anomalies in pressure, air temperature, wind and air–sea heat flux and apply regularized generalized canonical correlation analysis (RGCCA) to study multivariate links between atmospheric variability and MHW characteristics. Our findings show that the Subtropical Atlantic experienced the longest MHW, the Northwest Atlantic the most intense, and the Western Mediterranean the most frequent events. The summer North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) and Scandinavian Pattern (SCAN) emerged as key modulators of MHWs. Compound configurations of NAO−/SCAN+ in July-August and NAO+/SCAN− in May-June generated persistent atmospheric ridges and weakened the Azores High, which in turn suppressed winds, altered heat fluxes and mixed layer depths, and promoted stratification—leading to sustained surface warming. The leading RGCCA mode explains more than 40% of the SSTA variability and shows statistically robust correlations (r = 0.81–0.94) between atmospheric drivers and MHW evolution. This multivariate approach demonstrates how teleconnection patterns co-modulate regional MHW dynamics, underscoring the importance of compound atmospheric influences.

We analyzed the association between heat (defined as daily mean temperature at the 99th percentile) and non-accidental mortality across 229 regions of South Korea during 2011–2020. We conducted two-stage time-series analysis with a distributed lag nonlinear model to investigate heat-mortality associations and their spatial variations at the regional level. We then applied a multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy framework to examine the role of intersectional strata in explaining the spatial variation of heat-related risks. Heat-related mortality risks were spatially heterogeneous. The multiply disadvantaged regions (having a low annual mean temperature, a high proportion of older housing stock, and a low proportion of timely emergency room visits) exhibited the highest heat-related relative risk (RR) of 1.105 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.097, 1,112), while the multiply advantaged regions exhibited the lowest heat-related RR of 1.065 (95% CI: 1.057, 1.072).

Over the globe, this new solution is better than its predecessor, although the two solutions remain close. 
 The mean dynamic topography (MDT) is a key reference surface for altimetry. It is needed for the calculation of the ocean absolute dynamic topography, and under the geostrophic approximation, the estimation of surface currents. CNES-CLS MDT solutions are calculated by merging information from altimeter data, GRACE, and GOCE gravity field and oceanographic in situ measurements (drifting buoy velocities, High Frequency radar surface velocities, hydrological profiles). The objective of this paper is to present the newly updated CNES-CLS22 MDT. The main improvement of this new CNES-CLS22 MDT over the previous CNES-CLS18 MDT is in the Arctic, with better coverage and a more physical solution (with the disappearance of artifacts from the previous version). This is due to the use of a new first guess estimated with the CNES-CLS22 MSS and the GOCO06s geoid to which optimal filtering has been applied, as well as Lagrangian filtering at the coast to reduce the intensity of currents normal to the coast. Improvements also include updating the drifting buoy and T/S profile databases, and processing to obtain synthetic mean geostrophic velocities and synthetic mean heights. In addition, a new data type, HF radar data, was processed to extract physical content consistent with MDT in the Mid Atlantic Bight of the northeast U.S. coastal region.

 Land use-land cover, nutrient inputs from fertilizer and manure, and irrigation are primary anthropogenic drivers of ecosystem functioning and degradation. Historical datasets covering these drivers at various spatial resolutions are essential for analyzing changes in these drivers as well as for input to models that estimate ecosystem outcomes such as water quality and runoff.

Metrics are defined for warming response to cumulative emissions and for the cessation of emissions or ramp-down to net-zero and net-negative levels. Results indicate that previous concentration-driven experiments may have overstated the Zero Emissions Commitment due to emissions rates exceeding historical levels. 
 The proportionality between global mean temperature and cumulative emissions of CO2 predicted in Earth system models (ESMs) is the foundation of carbon budgeting frameworks. Deviations from this behavior could impact estimates of required net-zero timings and negative emissions requirements to meet the Paris Agreement climate targets. However, existing ESM diagnostic experiments do not allow for direct estimation of these deviations as a function of defined emissions pathways. Here, we perform a set of climate model diagnostic experiments for the assessment of transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE), the Zero Emissions Commitment (ZEC), and climate reversibility metrics in an emissions-driven framework. The emissions-driven experiments provide consistent independent variables simplifying simulation, analysis and interpretation, with emissions rates more comparable to recent levels than existing protocols using model-specific compatible emissions from the CMIP DECK 1pctCO2  experiment, where emissions rates tend to increase during the experiment, such that at the time of CO2 doubling in year 70, emissions are much greater than present-day values. A base experiment, “esm-flat10”, has constant emissions of CO2 of 10 GtC per year (near-present-day values), and initial results show that the TCRE estimated in this experiment is about 0.1 K less than that obtained using 1pctCO2. A subset of ESMs exhibit land carbon sinks that saturate during this experiment. A branch experiment, esm-flat10-zec, illustrates that both positive and negative ZEC effects are less pronounced under esm-flat10 than under 1pctCO2 – the magnitude of ZEC50 in ESMs is, on average, reduced by 30 % compared with 1pctCO2 branch experiments. A final experiment, esm-flat10-cdr, assesses climate reversibility under negative emissions, where we find that peak warming may occur before or after net zero and that the asymmetry in temperature at a given level of cumulative emissions between the positive and negative emissions phases is well described by ZEC in most models. Further, we find that existing probabilistic simple climate model (SCM) ensembles tend to overestimate temperature reversibility compared with ESMs, highlighting the need for additional constraints. We propose a set of climate diagnostic indicators to quantify various aspects of climate reversibility. These experiments were suggested as potential candidates in CMIP7 and have since been adopted as “fast track” simulations."

The model is described in detail and evaluated against grid-resolved urban canopy simulations, demonstrating its ability to model urban surfaces accurately. By bridging the gap between computational efficiency and physical detail, PALM-SLUrb broadens PALM's potential for urban climate research. 
 Urban areas are recognised as critical zones for climate research due to the high number of people living in these areas and their significant impacts on local and regional climates. However, understanding urban boundary layer processes remains a challenge, as existing mesoscale models cannot resolve their fine-scale features and dynamics, while microscale fluid dynamics simulations remain computationally expensive or unfeasible for the full extent of the urban atmosphere. To address this gap, we present PALM-SLUrb, a single-layer urban canopy model for the PALM model system, offering a computationally efficient and physics-based model to represent urban surfaces on non-building-resolving grids. Together with the model description, we present sensitivity tests and a model comparison against grid-resolved urban canopies to demonstrate the model's performance. The results demonstrate the model's ability to extend the representation of key urban–atmosphere interactions in PALM to coarser grid resolutions on the order of 10 m. By bridging the gap between computational efficiency and physical detail, PALM-SLUrb broadens PALM's capabilities in advancing urban climate research."

Bailey;Salam Abbas;Jeffrey G. Arnold;Michael J. White,SWAT+MODFLOW: a new hydrologic model for simulating surface-subsurface flow in managed watersheds,"Water managers often make use of computer models to assess a region's water supply under future conditions and management scenarios. This article introduces a new computer model that combines a land surface model (SWAT+) and a groundwater model (MODFLOW) and shows how it can be applied to managed, irrigated watersheds. This new model can be used for regions that rely on both surface water and groundwater for drinking water, agriculture, and industry. 
 Coupled surface-subsurface hydrologic models are used worldwide to study historical patterns of water storage and hydrologic behaviour, investigate the impact of management strategies on water resources, and quantify the impact of changing climate, population, and policies. This study presents a new hydrologic model to simulate surface and subsurface in a physically based spatially distributed manner by linking the popular SWAT+ and MODFLOW modelling codes. Within this new code, SWAT+ simulates processes in the landscape, soils, channels, and reservoirs, whereas MODFLOW simulation groundwater processes and interaction with land surface features (soil, channels, canals, reservoirs, tile drains). Geographic connections between SWAT+ objects and MODFLOW grid cells are established a priori using a GIS and then read into the code to be used throughout the simulation to map hydrologic fluxes (recharge, soil water transfer, groundwater-channel exchange, canal seepage, tile drainage outflow, groundwater-reservoir exchange, pumping for irrigation) on a daily time step. The use and general accuracy of the model is demonstrated for two study regions that are subject to irrigation management: the Arkansas River Basin in Colorado and the San Joaquin River Basin in California. An accompanying tutorial and example model data allow for easy use of the model to other study regions. As both SWAT+ and MODFLOW are widely used worldwide for watershed and groundwater modelling, we expect that this new tool can be an important asset in many water resources projects."

Recognizing this limitation, the lack of a robust and physically interpretable tool for assessing prediction reliability has become a critical bottleneck. In this work, the composition and photophysical inconsistencies among fluorescent compounds underlying the same fluorophore signal were identified as key sources of predictive inaccuracy. To detect these inconsistencies, fluorescence quenching was incorporated into EEM analysis with parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC). Apparent F0/F─the ratio of PARAFAC component intensity before and after extrinsic quencher addition─was proposed as an indicator for model failure and treatment anomaly detection. Validations with both model compound mixtures and real-world greywater samples showed that shifts in apparent F0/F reflect changes in the relationship between Fmax and target concentrations of total cell count (TCC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC). Two practical tools were developed based on apparent F0/F: a clustering method for post hoc chemical composition analysis, and a thresholding method for outlier detection in real-time monitoring. This work highlights the added value of fluorescence quenching for improving the reliability and interpretability of EEM-based water monitoring at the subfluorophore level."

Here, we present a data-driven workflow that reduces this bias by applying an unsupervised machine learning technique. We applied both nonmetric multidimensional scaling (NMDS) and non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) on the same nontargeted chemical data set to compare their different interpretations of environmental sources. Weekly nontargeted data was collected from the Fall Creek Monitoring Station (Ithaca, NY), where daily samples were previously analyzed using source-defined models. NMF was first used to decompose the full nontargeted chemical data set into a small set of chemical factors representing distinct composition profiles. Each factor was  then interpreted through (1) Spearman correlations with watershed characteristics (e.g., temperature, flow) and (2) suspect screening of high-weighted nontargeted features. In addition to confirming known anthropogenic inputs, our analysis revealed potential novel sources associated with snowmelt, groundwater seepage, and seasonal hydrological dynamics. We also detected an annual shift in the chemical composition, highlighting the evolving influence of these sources. This workflow enables watershed managers to move beyond predefined sources, detect both known and emerging chemical contributors, and apply adaptive, evidence-based strategies to protect water quality under changing conditions."

To date, research has mainly focused on the health impact of road dust, but little work has been conducted to characterize its role as a reactive surface in the environment. Our group has previously shown that illuminated road dust is a source of singlet oxygen, an important environmental oxidant. Here, we report the singlet oxygen steady state concentration ([1O2]ss) of illuminated aqueous suspensions and aqueous extracts of road dust samples collected from three different road types (local, arterial, and expressway) in Toronto, Canada. We find that the [1O2]ss generated by aqueous extracts of road dust samples spans less than an order of magnitude and there is no clear trend in the [1O2]ss with road type, but that road dust [1O2]ss depends on organic content and light absorbance. The median singlet oxygen apparent quantum yield of the road dust extracts is 5.4% (UV-A), which is more than double the median reported values (UV-A) for river, lake, soil and wastewater samples. Comparisons of road dust aqueous extracts with aqueous  road dust suspensions reveal that suspended road dust has a much higher [1O2]ss, emphasizing the need to examine singlet oxygen production by  the insoluble components in particulate matter.

Abiotic (i.e., water, sediment, and foam) and biotic (i.e., algae, aquatic insect larvae and adults, fish, and riparian spiders) matrices were sampled upstream and downstream of the facility’s wastewater outfall. Compared with upstream, PFAS concentrations were 600-fold higher in downstream water (mean ∑40PFAS 3.67 ng mL–1 ± 0.48 (standard error)) and reflected inputs from the outfall, with 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS) dominating the PFAS profile. Within the aquatic food web, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) was the most biomagnified, and 6:2 FTS was the most biodiluted. In contrast, insect-mediated transfer of PFAS to riparian spiders showed trophic enrichment of 6:2 FTS and dilution of PFOS. We observed significant positive associations between phospholipid membrane-water partition coefficient (log KMW) and perfluoroalkyl carboxylate (PFCA) chain length on bioaccumulation across most biological matrices, demonstrating that these chemical parameters are predictive of PFAS bioaccumulation potential in the field.

This study aims to assess the association between prenatal exposure to TRAP and the infant metabolome in two distinct, geographically independent populations: the prospective Atlanta African American Cohort and the Southern California Mother’s Milk Study (MMS). This study provides novel evidence that prenatal nitrogen oxides (NOx), a major component of TRAP, are associated with perturbations in the infant circulating and fecal metabolome during the first month of life.

Here, we employed ammonia bicarbonate (AB) as an economical additive to modify interfacial polymerization (IP) for developing high-performance NF membranes suitable for drinking water applications. Comprehensive characterization coupled with molecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that AB modulates the IP process through three mechanisms: (1) controlling the diffusion kinetics of piperazine (PIP) at the aqueous–organic interface, (2) the reaction between HCO3– and H+ produced by IP achieves nanofoaming, and (3) the thermal decomposition of AB releases additional gaseous products (NH3 and CO2), enhancing the dual nanofoaming effect.

The optimized NF-AB-8 membrane demonstrated enhanced permeance (28.5 LMH/bar) during actual surface water purification, while maintaining selective separation between minerals and dissolved organic matter (KCa2+/DOM = 34.5). In addition, the improved microstructure and separation performance enhanced the antiscaling and antifouling properties of the NF membrane.

We applied an enhanced positive matrix factorization approach integrating VOC and organic aerosol measurements. This unified analysis identifies the well-documented cooking organic aerosol (COA, ∼21% of total OA) and, importantly, extracts cooking-emitted VOCs through COA constraints. The extracted VOC profile is corroborated well by direct kitchen cooking experiments. Our results show that cooking emissions constitute ∼7% of total atmospheric VOC mixing ratio. Further analysis demonstrates that cooking-emitted VOCs contribute to both secondary pollution formation and health risks. These environmental impacts have been largely overlooked in previous ambient VOC assessments due to the failure to identify cooking-emitted VOCs. These findings challenge the conventional practice of venting cooking emissions outdoors to protect indoor air quality, suggesting the necessity of an end-of-pipe treatment for cooking exhaust. This study demonstrates an advanced data-driven source apportionment strategy that directly integrates multiple data sets within a single PMF analysis. By leveraging mutual constraints among coemitted pollutants, this unified approach enhances source separation and factor interpretation through internal cross-validation without requiring prior source profiles."

However, the toxicological effects of CTPs, particularly on pulmonary health, remain poorly understood. This study investigates the impact of long-term CTPs exposure at environmentally relevant doses on lung cells and animal models. In vitro experiments revealed that CTPs exposure impaired mitochondrial function in BEAS-2B cells in a time-dependent manner. Proteomic analysis demonstrated significant alterations in oxidative phosphorylation-related proteins, disrupting the electron transport chain (ETC). Untargeted metabolomics further revealed disruptions in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, glutathione metabolism, and purine metabolism, with notably decreased levels of key metabolites. Multiomics integration suggested potential associations between high-dose CTPs exposure and diseases including lipoyltransferase 1 deficiency, Alzheimer’s disease, and schizophrenia. In vivo studies confirmed pathological lung damage in mice, including alveolar destruction and pulmonary fibrosis. Additionally, downregulation of N-lauroylsphingosine (NLDP) was identified as a potential metabolic biomarker for CTPs-induced lung injury, offering novel insights for mitigating CTPs’ adverse effects. These findings highlight the pulmonary toxicity of CTPs and provide a foundation for future risk assessment and preventive strategies."

This study analyzes six CG flashes captured by the high‐speed camera at Beijing and Lhasa, which reveal the propagation of intracloud negative leaders before and after each return stroke. While the positive leaders are invisible, obscured by the cloud, we quantified the cumulative channel extension of negative branches. We find that the short CC is linked with vigorous negative branches after the stroke, while the long CC correlates with near absence of negative branches. Assuming a stable propagation of positive leaders before and after negative strokes, the duration of CC could be controlled by the current competition between intracloud negative leaders and the stroke channel. This study provides novel insights into CC mechanisms and suggests a new method to evaluate CC duration."

For each fjord, we conduct large model ensembles to explore the effects of subglacial discharge, iceberg melt, and fjord‐shelf exchange on water properties. We show that our model successfully captures water mass changes inside fjords: iceberg melt cools the surface, while subglacial discharge plumes and fjord‐shelf exchange tend to decrease and increase temperature stratification, respectively. By comparing our ensemble to observations, we highlight that despite high interannual and fjord‐to‐fjord variability in ocean and meltwater forcings, a reduced‐physics model can elucidate how fjords modulate ice‐sheet‐ocean exchanges at Greenland‐wide scales."

However, identifying and quantifying sediment supply signals preserved in the rock record remain challenging, leaving their stratigraphic imprint insufficiently understood. To help address this issue, we use a process‐based numerical model to simulate alluvial stratigraphy under different sediment supply scenarios, independently testing the effects of supply magnitude and variability. Our results show that sediment supply variability has a stronger impact than magnitude: increased variability leads to much thicker channel‐belt deposits and elevated yet alternating high and low down‐valley slopes. In contrast, greater total sediment supply results in only slightly thicker channel‐belt deposits and uniformly elevated down‐valley slopes. These results reconcile diverse fluvial stratigraphic responses to sediment‐supply changes across basins during climatic perturbations."

In boreal winter 2021–2022, two balloon‐borne lidars flew over the Equatorial Pacific Ocean, slowly drifting above the clouds.

This distribution is strongly asymmetric: half of the clouds live less than 1 hr, but their mean lifetime is about 6 hr. The few long‐lived clouds (>12 ${ >} 12$ hr) dominate the cloud cover.

This study investigates whether these impacts can be reversed by removing atmospheric greenhouse gases. Using carbon dioxide removal experiments from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, we identify considerable inter‐model diversity in projections of Antarctic sea ice recovery, partly driven by a positive feedback loop starting from different initial ocean stratification in the present climate. Specifically, during the CO2 increasing period, models with stronger initial stratification tend to store heat in the upper layer but not in the deeper layer in the Antarctic Ocean, accelerating sea ice melting, which in turn strengthens ocean stratification and thus impedes sea ice recovery during the CO2 decreasing period. Conversely, weaker stratification promotes sea ice recovery under carbon dioxide removal scenarios. This demonstrates that the initial ocean stratification intensity exerts a critical influence on the reversibility of Antarctic sea ice loss."

 Since Hans Driesch’s pioneering work in 1891, it has been known that animal embryos can develop into complete individuals even when divided. However, the developmental processes and molecular mechanisms enabling this self-organization remain poorly understood. In this study, we revisit Driesch’s experiments by examining the development of isolated 2-cell stage blastomeres in the sea urchin, Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus. Contrary to intact embryos, these isolated blastomeres initially form a flat, single layer of dividing cells that eventually round up to be a blastula. Live imaging and knockdown experiments reveal that actomyosin activity at the basal side of the cells and septate junctions drives this process. Intriguingly, we observed temporal disorganization of the anterior-posterior (A-P) and dorsal-ventral (D-V) axes, where the original A-P poles come into contact after sphere shape formation. The disrupted A-P axis is subsequently corrected as the embryos employ the Wnt/β-catenin signaling mechanisms assumed to be used in intact embryos to re-establish a normal axis. These findings suggest that axis re-organization through pre-existing developmental mechanisms is essential for the successful regulative development of divided embryos.

 The distribution of tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) shows remarkable inter-individual heterogeneity, including hemispheric asymmetry. However, the factors driving this asymmetry remain poorly understood. Here we explore whether tau asymmetry is linked to i) reduced inter-hemispheric brain connectivity (potentially restricting tau spread), or ii) asymmetry in amyloid-beta (Aβ) distribution (indicating greater hemisphere-specific vulnerability to AD pathology). We include 452 participants from the Swedish BioFINDER-2 cohort with evidence of both Aβ pathology (CSF Aβ42/40 or neocortical Aβ-PET) and tau pathology (temporal tau-PET), categorising them as left asymmetric (n = 102), symmetric (n = 306), or right asymmetric (n = 44) based on temporal lobe tau-PET uptake distribution. We assess edge-wise inter-hemispheric functional (RSfMRI; n = 318) and structural connectivity (dMRI; n = 352) but find no association between tau asymmetry and connectivity. In contrast, we observe a strong association between tau and Aβ laterality patterns based on PET uptake (n = 233; β = 0.632, p < 0.001), which we replicate in three independent cohorts (n = 234; β = 0.535, p < 0.001). In a longitudinal Aβ-positive sample, we show that baseline Aβ asymmetry predicts progression of tau laterality over time (n = 289; β = 0.025, p = 0.028). These findings suggest that tau asymmetry is not associated with a weaker inter-hemispheric connectivity but might reflect hemispheric differences in vulnerability to Aβ pathology, underscoring the role of regional vulnerability in determining the distribution of AD pathology. Asymmetrical distribution of tau pathology in Alzheimer’s disease is linked to asymmetrical amyloid-beta deposition, not reduced brain connectivity, suggesting regional vulnerability plays a key role in determining the distribution of tau pathology."

 Light-induced magnetisation switching is one of the most intriguing and promising areas where an ultrafast phenomenon can be utilised in technological applications. So far, experiment and theory have considered the origin of all-optical helicity-independent magnetisation switching (AO-HIS) in individual magnetic films only as a microscopically local, thermally-driven process of angular momentum transfer between different subsystems. Here, we demonstrate that this local picture is insufficient and that AO-HIS must also be regarded as a spatially inhomogeneous process along the depth within a few-nanometre thin magnetic layer. Two regions of opposite magnetisation directions are observed, separated by a highly mobile boundary, which propagates along the depth of a 9.4 nm thin Gd25Co75 alloy. The dynamics of this transient boundary determines the final magnetisation state as well as the speed of AO-HIS throughout the entire magnetic layer. The ability to understand the influence of nanoscale and transient inhomogeneities on ultrafast switching phenomena and more generally on phase transitions will open new routes for material design and excitation scenarios in future devices for transferring and storing information. The authors reveal that even within a few-nanometre thin films, ultrafast all-optical magnetisation switching is spatially inhomogeneous along the depth and driven by the picosecond propagation of a transient domain boundary."

Here, the authors show that species with both high occupancy decades ago and increasing native occupancy ever since are more likely to become naturalized elsewhere. 
 Due to anthropogenic pressure some species have declined whereas others have increased within their native ranges. Simultaneously, many species introduced by humans have established self-sustaining populations elsewhere (i.e. have become naturalized aliens). Previous studies have shown that particularly plant species that are common within their native range have become naturalized elsewhere. However, how changes in native distributions correlate with naturalization elsewhere is unknown. We compare data on grid-cell occupancy of native vascular plant species over time for 10 European regions (countries or parts thereof). For nine regions, both early occupancy and occupancy change correlate positively with global naturalization success (quantified as naturalization in any administrative region and as the number of such regions). In other words, many plant species spreading globally as naturalized aliens are also expanding within their native regions. This implies that integrating data on native occupancy dynamics in invasion risk assessments might help prevent new invasions. How changes in species’ native occupancy over time relate to global naturalization success remains unclear. Here, the authors show that species with both high occupancy decades ago and increasing native occupancy ever since are more likely to become naturalized elsewhere."

 The quantification and mapping of important soil properties, such as soil texture, are vital for effective crop management and the assessment of overall soil health in agricultural systems. In this study, we propose a multi-modal Visual Transformer (MMVT) architecture to predict and map the soil particle size distribution of agricultural topsoils in Germany at a high spatial resolution of 10 meters. Our modeling utilized multi-source bare soil satellite image composites with terrain and soil-related covariates. To optimize the model’s ability to capture spatial soil context, various image sizes were evaluated. The study findings highlighted the effectiveness of our MMVT model, demonstrating improved estimation accuracies compared to a two-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (2D CNN) and a Random Forest (RF) model. Specifically, the proposed transformer network achieved the highest averaged validated accuracy in predicting the soil texture when incorporating a contextual image surrounding of 320 × 320 m around the soil sampling positions (Sand: R2 = 0.74, RMSE = 14.78%, and RPIQ = 3.52, Silt: R2 = 0.73, RMSE = 12.36%, and RPIQ = 3.50, Clay: R2 = 0.52, RMSE = 6.30%, and RPIQ = 1.95).

 Accurate quantification of aboveground biomass (AGB) in heterogeneous forest ecosystems is critical for reliable carbon cycle modeling and the effective climate policy development. Although remote sensing-assisted methods have significantly enhanced estimation efficiency, the impact of forest type stratification on estimation accuracy remains insufficiently investigated, especially when classified forest types from remote sensing data are used. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparison between model-assisted (MA) and model-based (MB) estimators and conventional simple random sampling (SRS) estimators under three different stratified or nonstratified scenarios: (A) a nonstratified estimation framework; (B) stratified estimation employing error-free forest type maps; and (C) stratified estimation predicated on classification results from remote sensing. Additionally, we assessed the effect of model specification—whether using a general model or strata-specific models—on estimation accuracy within stratified frameworks. The results showed that both the MA and MB estimators outperformed the SRS estimator. Stratification with ground truth reference maps significantly enhanced estimation accuracy, especially for the variance of the MB estimator employing strata-specific models is reduced from 13.65 t/ha to 10.42 t/ha, with the highest relative efficiency (RE = 2.95) achieved by the error-free stratified MA estimator using a general model. However, classification errors in remote sensing-derived maps substantially reduced these benefits, often leading to estimation variances exceeding those of the unstratified approach. Specifically, the variances of estimators MA and MB have increased from 8.89 t/ha to 24.17 t/ha, and from 10.42 t/ha to 23.65 t/ha, respectively. The predominant source of error was model misassignment due to misclassified forest types. This study provides a practical framework for estimating regional forest AGB using remote sensing data and offers decision support for the scientific formulation of forest management and sustainable utilization plans."

The correlation between actual and predicted income in New York and Sydney reached 0.76 and 0.78, respectively. The accuracy of income prediction in Amsterdam reached 51.13%.

 During August 2020, record-breaking precipitation occurred over the Sichuan Basin (SCB), the highest since 1979, exceeding both the historical August average and the rainfall of July 2020. This observed inter-month precipitation evolution contrasts with the typical climatological pattern, in which precipitation rises from July to August. During this period, two extreme rainfall episodes occurred—11 to 13 August (E1) and 15 to 18 August (E2)—and E2 exhibited a more northerly-located precipitation center and higher precipitation compared to E1. These two extreme precipitation episodes accounted for 60.1 % of the total rainfall in August 2020. This study investigates the causes of inter-monthly precipitation anomalies in the SCB during July–August 2020 from the perspective of the inter-monthly difference (August minus July) and further reveals the causes of two extreme precipitation episodes. Compared to July, the enhanced and eastward-shifted South Asian High (SAH) and the northeastward-shifted Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) collectively contributed to the record-breaking precipitation over the SCB in August. The enhanced western Pacific convection and suppressed Indian Ocean convection influence precipitation through its effects on WPSH and SAH indirectly. During both extreme episodes (E1 and E2), abundant water vapor was transported from the tropical western Pacific to the SCB by the intensified WPSH. Concurrently, more moisture from the Indian Ocean resulted in more precipitation in E2. Moreover, non-adiabatic heating anomalies on the Tibetan Plateau facilitated the development of a southwest vortex, which enhanced upward motion over the SCB. All key processes can be validated by the Linear Baroclinic Model."

Short-term perturbations in one type of neurotransmission are homeostatically counteracted by the opposing type, but prolonged excitation-inhibition imbalance causes dysfunction at both single neuron and circuit levels. However, whether dysfunction in one or both types of neurotransmission leads to pathogenicity in neurodegenerative diseases characterized by select synaptic deficits is not known. Here, we used functional, morphological, and viral-mediated approaches to uncover the pathogenic contribution of unbalanced excitation-inhibition in a mouse model of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). We show that vulnerable SMA motor circuits fail to respond homeostatically to reduced excitation and instead increase inhibition. This imposes an excessive burden on motor neurons and further restricts their recruitment. Reducing inhibition genetically or pharmacologically improves neuronal function and motor behavior in SMA mice. Thus, the disruption of excitation-inhibition homeostasis is a major maladaptive mechanism that diminishes the capacity of premotor commands to recruit motor neurons and elicit muscle contractions in SMA."

Cardiomyocytes sense the mechanical properties of their environment, leading to phenotypic remodeling. A critical component of the ECM mechanosensing machinery, including the protein talin, is organized at the cardiomyocyte costamere. Our previous work indicated a different talin tension, depending on the ECM stiffness, but the effects on downstream signaling remained elusive. Here, we identify that the talin interacting proteins DLC1 (deleted in liver cancer 1), RIAM (Rap1-interacting adaptor molecule), and paxillin each preferentially bind to talin at a specific ECM stiffness, this interaction is preserved in the absence of tension, and the interaction is regulated through focal adhesion kinase signaling. Moreover, DLC1 regulates cardiomyocyte RhoA activity in a stiffness-dependent way, whereby the loss of DLC1 results in myofibrillar disarray. Together, this study demonstrates a mechanism of imprinting mechanical information into the talin interactome to fine-tune RhoA activity, with impacts on cardiac health and disease."

The mechanism involves North America acting as an additional heating center, resulting in the strengthening and extension of oceanic advection toward the monsoon region. This is achieved via the Rodwell-Hoskins mechanism that strengthens the North Pacific subtropical high and through a widespread Northern Hemisphere heating that shifts the Hadly circulation subsidence center poleward. This teleconnection is independent of the presence of the Tibetan Plateau, and its impact on East Asian summer precipitation is found to be smaller but comparable to that of Tibet.

MI consumption by hummingbirds varies with seasonal changes in body mass, consistent with a regulatory role. Furthermore, MI enhances fatty acid oxidation in avian cells, via effects on pyruvate-dehydrogenase complexes, indicating a role in mitochondrial fuel selection.

However, adverse events (e.g., chorioretinal atrophy) have been reported in many patients receiving subretinal injection of Luxturna (voretigene neparvovec-rzyl) and experimental gene therapies. Subretinal injection confines transduction to the treated area. To address this, we manufactured high-concentration fibrin hydrogels encapsulating AAV2–green fluorescent protein (AAV2-GFP). Gels had homogeneous AAV distribution, desired mechanical properties, and retained infectivity. Epiretinal placement of fibrin–AAV2-GFP(n= 11) was compared to subretinal (n= 5) and intravitreal AAV2-GFPinjection (n= 3). The subretinal group exhibited inconsistent retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) transduction restricted to the injection region with severe atrophy in two cases. The intravitreal group had weak transduction and inflammation. In contrast, epiretinal hydrogels degraded within days and led to broad transduction of RPE without atrophy or inflammation.

PTPN22 regulates T cell receptor (TCR) signaling through dephosphorylation of the kinases lymphocyte-specific protein tyrosine kinase (LCK) and zeta-chain–associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP70). The regulation of PTPN22 remains poorly understood. Here, we identify PTPN22 Ser449as a protein kinase A phosphorylation site, which is triggered by TCR engagement and is hyperphosphorylated in lupus peripheral blood cells. PTPN22 Ser449phosphorylation selectively lowered the affinity of PTPN22 for ZAP70 versus LCK but also indirectly suppressed inhibitory LCK Tyr192phosphorylation through a ZAP70-CD45 signaling axis. The resulting dephosphorylation of LCK Tyr192not only enhanced TCR signaling but also modulated pathway activation downstream the TCR. In vivo loss of PTPN22 Ser449phosphorylation reduced T cell responses and suppressed experimental lupus nephritis. These results suggest that PTPN22 Ser449phosphorylation promotes a CD45-mediated retrograde ZAP70-LCK feedback loop that enhances T cell responses and promotes autoimmunity."

Using a flow cytometry–based screening, we profiled 332 surface receptors on HIV-1–infected primary CD4+T cells and identified 23 down-regulated receptors, including known targets such as CD4, MHCI, CCR7, and CD62L. CD96, an inhibitory natural killer (NK) cell receptor poorly studied in human CD4+T cells, was markedly down-regulated. This modulation, mediated by the viral proteins Nef and Vpu, surpassed that of other NK-associated receptors such as CD155 and NTB-A and is conserved across lentiviruses. CD96HiCD4+T cells exhibited a proinflammatory TH1/TH17 phenotype characterized by IFN-γ and IL-17 secretion and displayed impaired migration in vivo. Furthermore, CD96 ligation enhanced IFN-γ release upon viral peptide stimulation and promoted the secretion of TH1/TH17-associated cytokines. Our findings suggest that CD96 regulates antiviral immune responses and maintains proinflammatory properties in CD4+T cells. Thus, its down-regulation represents a previously unknown HIV-1 immune evasion strategy, with implications for exploiting CD96 as immunotherapeutic target."

However, a practical strategy that merges bench-stable glycosyl donors with styrenes—a ubiquitous class of synthetic building blocks—remains elusive. Herein, we report a simple and general approach for synthesizing ketonylC-glycosides. The transformation uses designed glycosyl sulfides as air- and moisture-stable precursors to glycosyl radicals, styrenes as aglycone sources, and dimethyl sulfoxide as both an oxidant and solvent, proceeding under photoredox catalysis. Glycosyl radicals are generated from glycosyl sulfides via efficient unimolecular homolytic substitution. This approach obviates harsh conditions for donor activation and the use of activated aglycone precursors, accommodating extensive functional groups and heterocycles. The reaction also exhibits high stereoselectivity across various glycosyl units. Demonstrating synthetic versatility, this method enables efficient access to diverse drug-sugar conjugates and complexC-glycopeptidomimetics.

The magnetothermoelectric responses in the quantum Hall regime agree with theoretical predictions if one considers the role of chiral edge states, which flow in opposite directions on either side of the Hall bar and establish an internal temperature gradient that is perpendicular to the externally applied thermal gradient. We show that the results are self-consistent within this picture under different measurement conditions.

PSMA adoption has increased travel distances to the nearest ports in States not Party to PSMA and channeled more fishing effort to domestic and PSMA Party ports. However, domestic fishing fleets need greater attention because they constituted 66% of port visits in 2021. Among reflagged vessels, we also found a 30% increase in visits to PSMA ports by vessels shifting to domestic flags after PSMA entered into force, allowing them to avoid PSMA requirements for foreign vessels.

Current apheresis systems require large blood volumes and are primarily designed for adults, making them unsuitable for children and small animals. These systems often indiscriminately remove both harmful and protective antibodies, increasing the risk of complications such as life-threatening infections. To address this critical need, we developed acoustofluidic-based system for targeted antibody removal in transplantation (A-START). A-START is engineered to handle small blood volumes and has demonstrated efficacy in preclinical small animal trials. In a sensitized rodent skin transplantation model, A-START only demands 240 microliters of blood, selectively removing donor-specific alloantibodies (DSAs) while preserving protective antibodies, such as tetanus antibodies. A-START retains ~95% of beneficial antibodies and achieves a 60% improvement in DSA removal compared to conventional methods.

Adult diaphyseal aging was accompanied by the disproportionate rate between a faster increase in the medullary area and an absent or marginal increase in the total area.

We use computational protein design to generate high affinity binders of BAK and BAX with greater than 100-fold specificity for their target. Both binders activate their targets when at low concentration, driving pore formation, but inhibit membrane permeabilization when in excess. Crystallography shows that the BAK binder induces BAK unfolding, exposing the α6 helix and BH3 domain. Together, these data suggest that upon binding, BAK or BAX unfold; at high binder concentrations, self-association of the partially folded BAK or BAX proteins is blocked and the membrane remains intact, whereas at low concentrations, dimers form, and the membrane ruptures. Our designed binders modulate apoptosis via direct, specific interactions with BAK and BAX and reveal that for therapeutic strategies targeting BAK and BAX, inhibition requires saturating binder concentrations at the site of action."

Meadows,A typology of global relief classes derived from digital elevation models at 1 arcsec resolution,"Surveys of global relief classes are important for understanding the morphology and land processes of Earth's surface. This study proposes a novel framework integrating the accumulated slope and a new surface relief index for global relief classification (GRC) with 1 arcsec resolution. This dataset can provide abundant and detailed land surface information for the field of Earth sciences. 
 Understanding land surface morphology and its relief components, which record the dynamics of the planet's evolution and interaction of multiple environmental factors, constitutes a critical aspect of Earth system science. Advances in Earth observation technologies have enabled access to higher-resolution data, e.g. remote sensing imagery and digital elevation models (DEMs). However, classified relief and landform data with a resolution of approximately 1 arcsec (approximately 30 m) are lacking at the global scale, which limits the progress of related studies at finer scales. Here, we propose a novel framework for global relief classification and release a unique dataset called global relief classification (GRC), which incorporates a comprehensive set of objects that constitute the range of terrains and landforms on Earth. Constructed from multiple 1 arcsec DEMs, GRC covers the global land and ranks among the highest-resolution global geomorphic datasets to date. Its development integrates land surface ontologies, with cores, transitions and boundaries, and key derivatives to strike a balance between mitigating local noise and preserving valuable landform details. GRC categorizes Earth's land relief into two levels, yielding raster files and discrete vector units that record relief type and distribution. Comparative analyses with previous datasets reveal that GRC better captures details of surface morphology, enabling a more precise depiction of geomorphological boundaries. This refinement facilitates the identification of finer and more precise spatial disparities in landform patterns than before, exemplified by marked contrasts between Asia and other continents, and highlights the distinct prominence of Peru and China in terms of relief diversity. Given that the data resolution of GRC accords well with accessible remote sensing imagery and other Earth science datasets, it is readily incorporated into analytical workflows, exploring the relationship between land morphology, surface runoff, climate, and land cover. The full dataset is available on the Deep-time Digital Earth Geomorphology platform and from Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15641257, Yang et al., 2024)."

A univariate interpolation algorithm is applied to predict missing data points without relying on ancillary variables. The dataset includes gap-free uncertainty estimates for all predictions and was validated with independent in situ reference measurements. Our data record is recommended for applications which require global long-term gap-free satellite soil moisture data. 
 The ESA CCI Soil Moisture multi-satellite climate data record is a widely used dataset for large-scale hydrological and climatological applications and studies. However, data gaps in the record can affect derived statistics such as long-term trends and – if not taken into account – can potentially lead to inaccurate conclusions. Here, we present a novel gap-free dataset, covering the period from January 1991 to December 2023. Our dataset distinguishes itself from other gap-filled products, as it is purely based on the available soil moisture (SM) measurements (independent of ancillary variables to make predictions), and further due to the inclusion of uncertainty estimates for all interpolated data points.Our gap-filling framework is based on a well-established univariate discrete cosine transform with the penalized least-squares (DCT-PLS) algorithm. This ensures that the dataset remains fully independent of other soil moisture and biogeophysical datasets and eliminates the risk of introducing non-soil-moisture features from other variables. We apply DCT-PLS on a spatial moving window basis to predict missing data points based on temporal and regional neighbourhood information. The challenge of providing gap-free estimates during extended periods of frozen soils is addressed by applying a linear interpolation for these periods, which approximates the retention of frozen water in the soil. To quantify the inherent uncertainties in our predictions, we developed an uncertainty estimation model that considers the input observations quality and the performance of the gap-filling algorithm under different surface conditions. We evaluate our algorithm through performance metrics with independent in situ reference measurements and by its ability to restore GLDAS Noah reanalysis data in artificially introduced satellite-like gaps. We find that the gap-filled data perform comparably to the original observations in terms of correlation and unbiased root mean squared difference (ubRMSD) with in situ data (global median R=0.72, ubRMSD = 0.05 m3 m−3). However, in some complex environments with sparse observation coverage, performance is lower.The new ESA CCI SM v09.1 GAPFILLED dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.48436/hcm6n-t4m35 (Preimesberger et al., 2024) and will see yearly updates due to its inclusion in the operational ESA CCI SM production."

While most studies have focused on the effects of individual MP types, MPs in natural environments typically coexist as multiple types, and their combined effects remain poorly understood. In this study, we conducted a microcosm experiment with four levels of MP diversity (0, 1, 3, and 5 types) to investigate the effects of MP diversity on soil ecosystem functions using metagenomic sequencing. Our results revealed that increasing MP diversity significantly raised soil pH and organic carbon content while reducing available nitrogen. Notably, bacterial alpha diversity (Shannon and Invsimpson indices) increased significantly with higher MP diversity. Moreover, increasing MP diversity markedly shifted bacterial life-history strategies to adapt to the altered environment. Importantly, the abundance of nitrogen-related functional genes also increased with MP diversity. In particular, the abundance of denitrifying genes, predominantly driven by Rhodocyclaceae, was notably enhanced, resulting in a reduction of soil available nitrogen. Collectively, these findings offer valuable insights into the impact of MP diversity on soil function─especially within the nitrogen cycle─and have important implications for soil management strategies under MP stress."

Herein, we propose a highly effective ARB disinfection approach via activating an ultralow concentration (10 μM) of chlorite (ClO2–) by naturally abundant sunlight to generate various reactive species (i.e., HO•, Cl•, ClO•, and ClO2) with negligible generation of halogenated DBPs. Combining in situ characterization with theoretical calculations, we reveal that, in addition to the photolysis of ClO2– in the bulk solution, ClO2– ions electrostatically adsorbed on the positive local sites of lipids can boost light absorption and facilitate the in situ generation of reactive species upon sunlight irradiation, enabling more efficient attacks toward cell membranes and the intracellular antioxidant enzyme system. The intracellular antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are then released and further degraded, inhibiting horizontal ARG transfer. This approach can also achieve excellent ARB disinfection performance in real water matrices (e.g., lake and river water) in 1 L tanks and 500 mL plastic bottles with natural sunlight irradiation. Overall, this work presents an efficient, safe, and sustainable method to inactivate ARB with deep insights into disinfection mechanisms at the subcellular level."

Therefore, this study investigated the visual–neuro influence of 3cH2B (a frequently detected LCM) under environmentally relevant concentrations in zebrafish. The findings revealed that 40 μg/L 3cH2B induced visual behaviors after 40 days of exposure, which was accompanied by decreased retinoic acid (RA) levels and retinal structural deformation in the eyes. Simultaneously, a decline in the number of synaptic vesicles and loss of neurons were observed in the central nervous system (CNS). In addition, downregulation of RA metabolism pathways was identified in inhibitory neurons of the CNS.  Spatial transcriptomic analysis showed that 3cH2B exposure reduced both the proportion of inhibitory neurons and the expression of RA-related genes in the optic tectum of the midbrain.  Furthermore, RA supplementation significantly alleviated the behavioral alterations and retinal damage induced by 3cH2B, highlighting the critical role of RA in regulating these effects."

Fetch analysis and machine learning technique, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), is used to establish a relationship between TC wind speed and significant wave height (SWH). It was found that TC wind and SWH radii become asymmetric as sea states intensify. Notably, wind radii correlations (CORs) increase on the left‐right and left‐back quadrants for wind speeds larger than 20 m/s, while SWH radii exhibit the opposite trend. XGBoost is employed to obtain the improved relationship between wind fetch and SWH (COR < 0.17). Validation against buoys and Haiyang‐2 (HY‐2) observations of 20 TCs indicates that the root mean squared error in SWH predictions is reduced by up to 1.1 m using XGBoost instead of empirical model.

Simultaneously, these processes bring nutrient‐rich deep waters into the upper layer. Following the TC passage, the significant increases in both Chl‐a and nutrients lead to a high Chl‐a anomaly in the subsurface layer that persists for over 30 days. Westward geostrophic advection, driven by the meridional density gradient, tends to shift the subsurface nutrients and Chl‐a anomalies toward the left side of the generally northwestward TC track.

Our results show a significant global increase in all types of heatwaves. Compound heatwaves exhibited higher annual frequency and intensity than individual daytime or nighttime events. The three types of heatwaves displayed distinct associations with El Niño and La Niña episodes, with the tropics experiencing the most frequent and intense heatwaves during El Niño years. Meanwhile, terrestrial LWE exchange significantly influenced heatwave development, with stronger effects in dryland and temperate zones than in continental and polar regions.

By applying common Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis to three global reanalysis data sets, combined with Common Basis Function (CBF) approach for the GCMs, a unified framework for evaluating performance is established. Two distinct leading modes of monthly summer heatwave variability over NA–dipole and tripole patterns–are identified using the common EOF. The GCMs reproduce these modes, showing agreement in the centers of positive and negative anomalies with the reanalysis data sets, particularly when evaluated using the CBF approach. The GCMs capture large‐scale North Pacific to North American wave train patterns associated with the two modes of heatwave variability over NA, showing a phase shift between them. They reproduce atmospheric moisture conditions, such as total column water vapor and precipitation; however, performance in capturing these anomalies is lower due to the complexities of moisture transport and convection. The GCMs also effectively reproduce regional‐scale surface radiation and turbulent heat flux anomalies related to heatwave variability.

The results show that the northern European snow anomalies significantly correlate with the second dominant pattern of summer N‐Asia drought conditions during 1955–2017. In addition, the snow anomalies occur in preceding winter and strengthen in spring, providing a possible predictor for N‐Asia summer drought conditions. The physical processes linking spring snow anomalies over northern Europe to summer N‐Asia drought conditions are as follows. Increased spring snow anomalies enhance the surface albedo and increase overall amount of snowmelt in early summer, which cool the local 2‐m temperature and increase the soil moisture in early summer. The increased soil moisture persists from early summer to late summer through positive soil‐precipitation feedback, consequently weakening summer surface sensible heat flux and decreasing air temperature over northern Europe. Then the decreased temperature strengthens the meridional air temperature gradients around 60°N, and further induces a cyclone anomaly over northern Europe by modulating the diabatic cooling and synoptic transient eddy activities, further triggering an eastward‐propagating Rossby wave train throughout Eurasia. This wave train results in a western Siberian anticyclone anomaly and an eastern Siberian cyclone anomaly. By adjusting the conditions of water vapor, dynamics, heat and radiation fluxes, the precipitation, and potential evapotranspiration conditions over N‐Asia are changed. Therefore, the pronounced atmospheric circulation pattern leads to less/more precipitation and more/less PET over western/eastern Siberia, favoring development of a zonal dipole pattern of N‐Asia drought conditions."

However, the impacts of assimilating its observations on tropical cyclones (TCs) remain unclear. This study investigates these effects of assimilating XPAR radial wind velocity observations, both alone and in combination with S‐band Doppler radar radial winds, for TC Saola (2023). Compared with experiments assimilating only S‐band Doppler radar data, assimilating data from a single XPAR significantly reduces TC intensity errors by up to 6.4 m/s and improves structural representation in the inner‐core region, as well as demonstrates optimal enhancement in forecast skill for 9‐hr accumulated rainfall exceeding 100 mm threshold. Furthermore, higher‐frequency XPAR data assimilation yields additional improvements in intensity and inner‐core structure forecasting skills, albeit with increased computational demands. Joint assimilation of S‐band Doppler radar and XPAR data demonstrates superior performance over solely assimilating XPAR observations, achieving maximum intensity error reduction of 8.0 m/s, more realistic structural representation of both inner‐core features and outer rainbands, and optimal improvement for 50–100 mm rainfall forecasts. These improvements stem from XPAR's enhanced observational capacity of the TC's lower‐layer inner‐core, which strengthens lower‐layer inflow, and further demonstrates its potential to improve forecast accuracy of TCs."

Since 1994, scientists have recorded weather observations from stations installed on the glaciers. These records help understand how the local climate is changing and implications for glacier melt. The weather station network covers many parts of the glaciers, especially on Vatnajökull, Iceland's largest ice cap. It captures conditions in the accumulation areas where ice builds up, to the ablation areas where ice melts. For other glaciers, the data give a broader look at regional climate patterns. The results show that winters were coldest from December to February, and summers were warmest in July and August. Winter temperatures ranged from around 0°C near the coast to −10°C at higher elevations. Summer temperatures were above freezing at nearly all sites, which allows melting to occur. One sign of increased melting was a rise in “Positive Degree Days,” days warm enough to melt ice. These were more common at lower elevations and near the coast. Another sign was that glacier surfaces were getting darker in spring, especially in places with thinner winter snow. Darker surfaces absorb more sunlight, leading to faster melting. Volcanic ash and airborne dust have also darkened glacier surfaces in some years. By keeping track of these changes, this study helps to understand how Iceland's glaciers are responding to a warming climate—and why continued long‐term observations are essential."

This study investigates the sources of Ts biases in CoLMv2024 and Noah‐MP land surface model (LSM) using identical forcing data over China by decomposing the surface energy balance equation using ERA5‐Land reanalysis (ERA5L), MODIS, and ground‐based reference data sets. Both LSMs show significant seasonal and regional Ts biases, characterized by summer warm biases and pronounced winter cold biases. Uncertainty in energy fluxes across reference data sets limits single‐dataset evaluations. Energy fluxes in both LSMs are generally within uncertainty ranges of reference data, except that Noah‐MP consistently underestimates winter net radiation and sensible heat flux. Compared with ERA5L, the largest Ts bias across regions is caused by radiation forcing, that is, downward solar radiation or longwave radiation (DLW), except that the largest winter cold bias is caused by upward solar radiation (USW) in Noah‐MP in Northern China. Compared with MODIS, DLW probably contributes most to Ts biases for Noah‐MP in autumn and for CoLMv2024 in autumn and winter, except that USW contributes most to the winter cold bias in Noah‐MP. In March and April, the largest contributing term is ground heat flux in both LSMs. Despite large discrepancies in simulated snow properties, Ts simulations in two LSMs over the snow‐covered regions are similar and underestimated during the cold season.

While previous studies focused on dynamics of the potential northern limit of maize (PNLine), the movement of the actual northern limit of maize (ANLine) and its agricultural impacts remain underexplored. To bridge the gap, this study first developed a method to detect the ANLine using satellite‐derived crop data and kernel density estimation. To assess the driving factors behind the expansion of maize acreage, an empirical analysis was conducted in the maize‐soybean key competitive region (KCR). Finally, we calculated the climate‐warming driven maize acreage expansion over the past two decades and projected its changes for the next decade. Results showed that the PNLine and ANLine moved northwards by an average of 101.67 and 75.4 km from 2000 to 2020. The two lines showed a strong correlation (r = 0.78, p < 0.05). The increasing accumulated temperature was the key driver behind these movements. A 10°C·d increase in AAT10 is associated with a 3.12% increase in maize acreage in the KCR. From 2001 to 2020, ∼49.5% (2.83 × 106 ha) of the maize acreage expansion could be attributable to climate warming.

This study reports the activities of 32P and 33P in individual precipitation events for the first time on the coast of the East China Sea, Shanghai, China (31°1′35.5″N, 121°26′49.3″E) from March 2021 to April 2023.

The 33P/32P activity ratios ranged from 0.70 to 1.22 (average, 0.96 ± 0.13), showing significant seasonal variations with high in spring/winter and low in summer/autumn. The higher 33P/32P activity ratios (>1.0) in typhoons and thunderstorms precipitation, suggested the intrusion of stratospheric air masses associated with those extreme weather events.

The relationship between individual rainfall event wet deposition fluxes and rainfall throughout 2021 to 2023 appears to follow a power law, though it showed high correlation in spring/winter.

 Winter precipitation events, involving complex transitions between rain and snow, pose a significant forecasting challenge and often lead to severe weather hazards. The difficulty in predicting precipitation type stems from an incomplete understanding of the microphysical processes that govern these transitions under diverse atmospheric conditions. This study investigates two rain-to-snow transition events in western Liaoning, China. Both cases shared a common evolution from rain to snow, with the melting of ice-phase particles aloft serving as the initial source for raindrops. However, they occurred under contrasting near-surface thermodynamic and moisture conditions—one with a sub-freezing, dry sub-cloud layer (Case 1) and the other with a near-0 °C, moist layer (Case 2), leading to distinct transition processes. Ground-based disdrometer observations revealed distinct surface precipitation characteristics driving rain-to-snow transitions. In Case 1, a bimodal velocity-diameter (V–D) distribution indicated the coexistence of rain and snow. In contrast, Case 2 was characterized by a unimodal V–D distribution of dense, rimed particles. High-resolution WRF simulations using the Thompson microphysics scheme successfully reproduced these transitions. The simulations accurately captured the particle size distributions (PSDs) of rain and graupel. A comparative analysis identified distinct microphysical processes as the primary difference between the two cases, governed by the vertical profiles of temperature and humidity. In Case 1, melting initiated at higher altitudes, followed by in-cloud riming. In the subsequent descent through the sub-cloud dry layer, strong evaporation and sublimation cooled the environment and removed liquid water, causing a rapid transition to snow. In Case 2, a deeper warm layer resulted in lower-altitude melting, while high near-surface moisture fueled dominant riming processes within the near-surface layer, prolonging the mixed-phase period with dense hydrometeors. Conceptual models illustrate how near-surface temperature and relative humidity jointly regulate the key microphysical processes such as melting, riming, evaporation, and sublimation."

Hydrogen was retained in fractures sealed by mud and carbonate. However, hydrogen alone cannot produce the explosive capacity responsible for the formation of pipes.

However, the mechanisms of AG entry remain incompletely understood. Here, we identify a previously undescribed uptake pathway via carbohydrate transporters inE. coli. By deleting or overexpressing 26 carbohydrate transporters, we found that 18 facilitated AG uptake, a mechanism conserved across several Gram-negative ESKAPEE pathogens. Using fluorescent-labeled AGs and flow cytometry, we quantified differential uptake. To enhance AG efficacy, we screened 198 carbon sources for their ability to induce transporter expression using acmtA-gfpfusion. Uridine emerged as a strong inducer ofcmtAand 12 additional AG-importing transporters. Coadministration of uridine considerably improved AG efficacy against clinical and resistantE. colistrains by enhancing drug uptake. This combination also improved outcomes in human blood ex vivo and in a murine urinary tract infection model. Given uridine’s clinical safety, it holds promise as an adjuvant to potentiate AG treatment against multidrug-resistant infections."

To address this issue, we use novel tracers in a cloud-resolving model to track the life cycle of cirrus clouds. This approach provides insights into cloud formation, ice crystal evolution, and radiative effects of cirrus clouds. Additionally, we improve the model's cloud microphysics using a simple, computationally efficient approach that can be applied to other models. 
 Tropical cirrus clouds form through in situ ice nucleation below the homogeneous freezing temperature of water or through detrainment from deep convection. Despite their importance, limited understanding of their evolution and formation pathways contributes to large uncertainty in climate projections. To address these challenges, we implement novel passive tracers in the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) cloud-resolving model to track the three-dimensional development of cirrus clouds. One tracer tracks air parcels exiting convective updrafts, revealing a rapid decline in ice crystal size and number as anvils age. Another tracer focuses on in situ cirrus, capturing their formation in the cold upper atmosphere and the subsequent reduction in their ice crystal number over time. We find that in situ cirrus dominate at colder temperatures and lower ice water contents, while anvil cirrus prevail at temperatures > −60 °C. Despite the frequent occurrence of in situ cirrus within the tropical tropopause layer, they account for only 6 %–7 % of the total tropical cirrus cloud top-of-the-atmosphere radiative effect. These findings improve our ability to assess the distinct roles of convective and in situ cirrus in shaping tropical cirrus properties and their impacts on climate.We also improve the model's representation of tropical cirrus through simple, computationally inexpensive microphysics modifications, improving agreement with tropical aircraft observations. We show that updrafts critical for tropical cirrus formation are only resolved in our simulations at a horizontal grid spacing of 250 m – much finer than those used in global storm-resolving models."

We found variability in all aspects of our database, from which storms were included in the top 50 storms for each input to the storms' spatial variability. We urge users of our database to consider the storms as identified from two or more input sources within our database where possible. 
 The CLIMK–WINDS (CLimes IMK – WINDstorm) database is a new, publicly available, database of extreme European windstorm footprints for the extended winter season during 1995–2015. In contrast with previously compiled European windstorm databases, it includes storm footprints derived from four different data sets, rather than a single source: the ERA5 reanalysis, the COSMO-REA6 reanalysis for Europe, the COSMO-Climate Limited-area Mode regional climate model driven by ERA5 on the EURO-CORDEX domain and simulation output from the same model but on an enlarged Germany domain with higher horizontal resolution. The database includes the footprints themselves, expressed as the relative daily maximum wind gusts associated with a storm event, the daily maximum wind gusts in absolute magnitude associated with the footprints and a measure of storm severity.  We applied a consistent methodology, the storm loss index, across input data sets for identifying storm footprints and assessing their severity. We identified and included the storm footprints associated with the 50 most severe storms, or top 50 storms, within each of the four input data sets. This enables a direct comparison between the footprints derived from the different input data sets, eases future efforts to extend the time record of the database or to include additional input data sets and enables assessment of uncertainty in the footprints. Moreover, since we derived the top 50 storms from each input data set at its native horizontal resolution, the database also allows us to characterise the impact that horizontal resolution can have on footprint identification and severity assessment. We find that the choice of input data set – including the data's horizontal resolution – can have major effects on extreme storm identification and characterisation. Different storms were identified as belonging to the top 50 storms in the different data sets, and storm footprints for common storms displayed substantial variability across the data sets. A comparison of our database with two existing windstorm databases also highlights the important role of the footprint detection methodology. The CLIMK–WINDS database thus supports both the research community and the insurance industry in exploring the data set, methodology and resolution dependence of assessments of extreme storm hazards.

Using Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-1) data and a twofold strategy to address temporal gaps, the method produced 30 m gridded forest height mosaics for the northeastern United States and China, demonstrating promising accuracies and offering potential for fusing data from future missions. 
 This paper presents a global-to-local fusion approach combining spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) interferometry (InSAR) and lidar to create large-scale mosaics of forest stand height. The forest height estimates are derived based on a semi-empirical InSAR scattering model, which links the forest height to repeat-pass InSAR coherence magnitudes. The sparsely yet extensively distributed lidar samples provided by the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) mission enable the parameterization of the signal model at a finer spatial scale. The proposed global-to-local fitting strategy allows for the efficient use of lidar samples to determine the adaptive model at a regional scale, leading to improved forest height estimates by integrating InSAR–lidar under nearly concurrent acquisition conditions. This is supported by fusing the second generation of the Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS-2) and GEDI data at several representative forest sites. This approach is further applied to the open-access ALOS InSAR data to evaluate its large-scale mapping capabilities. To address temporal mismatch between the GEDI and ALOS acquisitions, disturbances such as deforestation are identified by integrating ALOS-2 backscatter products and GEDI data. A modified signal model is further developed to account for natural forest growth over temperate forest regions where the intact forest landscape, along with forest height, remains quite stable and only changes slightly as trees grow. In the absence of detailed statistical data on forest growth, the modified signal model can be well approximated using the original model at the regional scale via local fitting. To validate this, two forest height mosaic maps based on the open-access ALOS-1 data were generated for the entire northeastern regions of the US and China with total area of 18 and 152 million ha, respectively. The validation of the forest height estimates demonstrates improved accuracy achieved by the proposed approach compared to the previous efforts, i.e., reducing from a 4.4 m RMSE at a few-hectare pixel size to 3.8 m RMSE at a sub-hectare pixel size. This updated fusion approach not only fills in the sparse spatial sampling of individual GEDI footprints, but also improves the accuracy of forest height estimates by 20 % compared to the interpolated GEDI maps. Extensive evaluation of forest height inversion against Land, Vegetation, and Ice Sensor (LVIS) lidar data indicates an accuracy of 3–4 m over flat areas and 4–5 m over hilly areas in the New England region, whereas the forest height estimates over northeastern China are best compared with small-footprint lidar validation data even at an accuracy of below 3.5 m and with a coefficient of determination (R2) mostly above 0.6. Given the achieved accuracy for forest height estimates, this fusion prototype offers a cost-effective solution for public users to obtain wall-to-wall forest height maps at a large scale using freely accessible spaceborne repeat-pass L-band InSAR (e.g., forthcoming NISAR) and spaceborne lidar (e.g., GEDI) data.

This map helps reveal where forests have been disturbed and how they recover over time, offering a valuable tool to support forest protection and climate policy. 
 Forests are vital for the carbon sequestration, biodiversity conservation, and climate regulation, making the precise and continuous monitoring of forest structure attributes such as canopy height essential. Here we present a two decades long (2004–2024), 30 m resolution annual canopy height dataset for Italy, developed using a time-series deep learning framework that integrates Landsat optical imagery with LiDAR observations. Two UNET models were independently trained using canopy height reference data from airborne laser scanning (ALS) and NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) spaceborne LiDAR mission. Annual canopy height predictions from each model were fused using Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA) to enhance spatial consistency and temporal continuity. Validation against ground-based measurements from the Italian National Forest Inventory (NFI) demonstrated high predictive accuracy (mean absolute error = 3.98 m). To further evaluate the utility of our dataset, we derived a canopy height change-based disturbance product and validated it against observed events (mean precision = 0.64 for 2005–2016). In addition, we assessed post-disturbance recovery by monitoring canopy height regrowth in areas affected during 2004–2005, tracking changes annually through 2024 across various Italian biomes. Our results highlight the importance of integrating multi-source remote sensing data with deep learning and Bayesian data fusion for monitoring forest structural dynamics. The final dataset is publicly available via Zenodo and provides a reproducible and scalable resource to support forest research, ecological monitoring, and climate-related policy-making."

 Binary forecasts of hydroclimatic extremes play a critical part in disaster prevention and risk management. While the recent WeatherBench 2 provides a versatile framework for verifying deterministic and ensemble forecasts of continuous variables, this paper presents an extension to binary forecasts of the occurrence versus non-occurrence of hydroclimatic extremes. Specifically, 17 verification metrics of the accuracy and discrimination of binary forecasts are employed and scorecards are generated to showcase the predictive performance. A case study is devised for binary forecasts of wet and warm extremes obtained from both deterministic and ensemble forecasts generated by three data-driven models, i.e., Pangu-Weather, GraphCast and FuXi, and two numerical weather prediction products, i.e., the high-resolution forecasting (HRES) and ensemble forecasting (ENS) of the Integrated Forecast System (IFS) of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF). The results show that the receiver operating characteristic skill score (ROCSS) serves as a suitable metric due to its relative insensitivity to the rarity of hydroclimatic extremes. For wet extremes, the GraphCast tends to outperform the IFS HRES when using the total precipitation of ERA5 reanalysis data as the ground truth. For warm extremes, Pangu-Weather, GraphCast and FuXi tend to be more skillful than the IFS HRES within 3 d lead time but become less skillful as lead time increases. In the meantime, the IFS ENS tends to provide skillful forecasts of both wet and warm extremes at different lead times and at the global scale. Through diagnostic plots of forecast time series at selected grid cells, it is observed that at longer lead times, forecasts generated by data-driven models tend to be smoother and less skillful compared to those generated by physical models. Overall, the extension of WeatherBench 2 facilitates more comprehensive comparisons of hydroclimatic forecasts and provides useful information for forecast applications."

An emergent approach to derive crop productivity estimates similar to those from GGCMs are emulators that mimic the original model, but typically with considerable bias. Here we present a modelling package that trains emulators with very high accuracy and high computational gain, providing a basis for more comprehensive scenario assessments. 
 Global gridded crop models (GGCMs) are simulation tools designed for global, spatially explicit estimation of crop productivity and associated externalities. Key areas for their application are climate impact and adaptation studies. As GGCMs are typically computationally costly and require comprehensive data pre- and post-processing, GGCM emulators are gaining increasing popularity. Earlier emulators have typically been published pre-trained on synthetic weather and management combinations. Here, we present a novel computational pipeline CROp Model Emulator Suite (CROMES) v1.0 that serves for flexibly training GGCM emulators on data commonly available from GGCM simulations. Essentially, CROMES consists of modules to (1) process climate data from daily resolution netCDF files to (sub-)growing season aggregates as climate features, (2) combine various feature types (climate, soil, crop management), (3) train emulators using machine-learning algorithms, and (4) produce predictions. Exemplary, we apply CROMES to train emulators on simulations for rainfed maize from the GGCM EPIC-IIASA and climate projections from a single GCM to subsequently test their skill in predicting crop yields for unseen climate projections from other GCMs. Depending on the training and target data, the regression statistics between GGCM simulations and predictions across all points in time and space are in the ranges R2 = 0.97 to 0.98, slope = 0.99 to 1.01, and intercept = −0.06 to +0.06. The RMSE ranges between 0.49 and 0.65 t ha−1. Spatially, patterns are evident with lowest performance in (semi-)arid regions where aggregation of weather data may result in higher information loss while permanent crop growth limitations may hamper evaluation statistics as well. The gain in computational speed for predictions is at more than an order of magnitude with time required to produce target features and subsequent predictions at about 30min on common hardware. We expect CROMES to be of utility in covering more comprehensively uncertainty in climate impact projections, evaluations of adaptation options, and spatio-temporal assessments of crop productivity."

This study will help us better understand coastal wave climates and assess sea states, enabling us to better develop, protect, and use the sea. 
 Numerical simulations of ocean surface waves along the Australian coast are performed with the spectral wave model WAVEWATCH III (WW3) and the state-of-the-art physics and numerics. A large-scale, high-resolution (1–15 km) unstructured mesh is designed for better resolving the extensive Australian coastline. Based on verification against altimeter and buoy observations, it is found that the WW3 simulations, with an observation-based source term package (i.e., ST6) and other relevant physical processes, perform reasonably well in predicting wave heights and periods in most regions. Nonetheless, the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) represents a challenging region for the wave model, in which wave heights are severely overestimated because most of the individual coral reefs and their strong dissipative effects could not be resolved by the local mesh. A two-step modeling strategy is proposed here to address this problem. First, individual coral reefs are regarded as unresolved obstacles and thus complete barriers to wave energy. Second, we adopt the unresolved obstacles source term proposed recently to parameterize the dissipative impact of these subgrid coral reefs. It is then demonstrated that this subgrid-scale reef parameterization enhances the model performance in the GBR dramatically, reducing the wave height bias from above 100 % to below 20 %. The source term balance and the sensitivity of model results to the grid resolution around the GBR are also discussed, illustrating the applicability of this two-step strategy to km-scale wave simulations."

This study quantifies the relative importance of the two processes on KW maintenance by comparing the growth rates of eddy available potential energy (EAPE) and eddy kinetic energy (EKE) within KWs using satellite and reanalysis data. Results show that the growth rate of KW EAPE is greater than that of KW EKE in most regions and seasons, while their relative magnitude varies across different regions and seasons.

B. Jayasankar,Impact of Dynamic Downscaling on the Simulation of Tropical Easterly Waves in the Intra‐Americas Seas,"We analyze two 16‐year dynamically downscaled simulations for their Tropical Easterly Waves (TEWs) from global reanalysis of the atmosphere and ocean over the Intra‐Americas Seas (IAS) region, centered over Central America. We implemented two versions of a coupled ocean‐atmosphere Regional Climate Model (RCM), each run at 15 km grid resolution and differing solely in their cumulus parameterization schemes. Our analysis reveals that the RCMs were able to generate TEWs in the domain even though the global atmospheric reanalysis forcing the regional models generated a few TEWs. This seems to suggest an in situ generation of these TEWs in the domain, which is consistent with earlier studies that examined TEW over the IAS region. There were also crucial differences between the two versions of the RCMs, suggesting that the cumulus parameterization scheme has an important bearing on the generation of TEWs in the simulation over this region. In one instance of the RCM simulation, the response of the TEW was much stronger, where the convective activity was enhanced with both convective and stratiform precipitation associated with TEW higher than the other cumulus scheme used in the other RCM simulation. However, the limitations and advantages of the impacts of the two cumulus parameterization schemes on the overall simulation of TEWs refrain us from claiming one scheme is superior to the other. Nonetheless, the study highlights the importance of the cumulus scheme and the benefit of dynamic downscaling on the simulation of TEWs."

However, the relationship between precipitation and QBO index at different stratospheric levels is inconsistent. This study identifies two distinct vertical structures of stratospheric zonal wind that influence precipitation in the tropics: (a) westerlies at 50 and 70 hPa combined with easterlies above 50 hPa generate warm anomalies near the tropopause; (b) easterlies at 20–70 hPa paired with westerlies at 10 hPa induce strong cold anomalies near the tropopause. Temperature anomalies affect atmospheric static stability, with negative anomalies increasing high cloud cover and strengthening convection. Additionally, the large‐scale circulation links stratospheric zonal winds to deep convection. The vertical structure of the stratospheric zonal wind influences the intensity and positioning of the Hadley and Walker circulations, thereby shaping the spatial distribution of tropical precipitation. A linear combination of time series from these two wind structures explains a significant part of interannual tropical precipitation variability after removing the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation signal. Evaluation of 15 Phase 6 of the International Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models shows that eight reproduce the observed relationship between stratospheric wind structures and tropical precipitation with reasonable accuracy.

Using global PV data, we quantify the energy–water–land nexus of WSPV systems through capacity estimation and a water evaporation model. In this nexus, energy refers to the electricity generated by WSPV systems on water surfaces; the water surface acts both as the installation platform and a water‐saving feature by reducing evaporation. WSPV systems also replace traditional ground‐based stations, conserving land by avoiding cultivated and ecologically sensitive areas. Results show significant growth in WSPV installations from 2019 to 2022, with total installed capacity increasing by 87.37%, from 19,685.34 MW in 2019 to 36,888.62 MW in 2022.

Unstable crop yields have been identified as detrimental to international food trade and markets. However, the association between climate extremes and crop yield stability has not been well documented. Here, we present the sensitivity of corn and soybean yield stability to heat, drought and excessive wetness by using statistical modeling for rainfed corn and soybean based on survey yield records in the US Midwest. The results using survey data indicate that increased heat, drought and excessive wetness are collectively associated with reduced yield stability for corn and soybean. We find that the changes in corn and soybean yield stability in the US Midwest are predominantly related to heat stress. Additionally, irrigation can mitigate the yield stability reduction associated with heat and drought. In contrast, well‐irrigated yield is more sensitive to excess wet.

Here, the authors quantify such losses reported in the literature and point out the need to reduce non-radiative recombination for a breakthrough in power conversion efficiency. 
 The photovoltaic performance of Cu2ZnSn(S,Se)4 is limited by open-circuit voltage losses (ΔVOC) in the radiative (ΔVOCRad) and non-radiative (ΔVOCNrad) limits, due to sub-bandgap absorption and deep defects, respectively. Recently, several devices with power conversion efficiencies approaching 15% have been reported, prompting renewed interest in the possibility that the key performance-limiting factors have been addressed. In this work, we analyze the sources of ΔVOC in these devices and offer directions for future research. We find that ΔVOCRad, arising from bandgap fluctuations and Urbach tails, has been significantly suppressed, with values comparable to those of commercial Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2 solar cells. However, the recombination parameter J0, which is more directly related to ΔVOCNrad, shows only modest improvement and must be reduced by four to six orders of magnitude to compete with Cu(In,Ga)(S,Se)2. To approach the theoretical efficiency limit, future work should focus on more directly addressing deep defects and ΔVOCNrad.

The complex, which consists of an Fe adatom coupled to an iron phthalocyanine (FePc) molecule, can be reversibly switched between two stable states using bias voltage pulses locally via the tip of a scanning tunnelling microscope. Inelastic electron tunnelling spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations reveal a distinct change between a paramagnetic and a non-magnetic spin configuration. Lastly, we demonstrate the functionality of this molecular spin switch by using it to modify the electron spin resonance frequency of a nearby target FePc spin within a spin-spin coupled structure. Thus, we showcase how individual molecular machines can be utilized to create scalable and tunable quantum devices. Huang et al. demonstrate an electrically controlled Fe–FePc molecular spin switch that reversibly changes its magnetic state and shifts a nearby spin’s resonance, showing potential of scalable, electrically tunable molecular quantum devices."

 The synthesis of thin crystalline two-dimensional polymers (2DPs) typically relies on reversible dynamic covalent reactions. While substantial progress has been made in solution-based and interfacial syntheses, achieving 2DPs through irreversible carbon-carbon coupling reactions remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we present an on-liquid surface (a mixture of N,N-dimethylacetamide and water, DMAc-H2O) synthesis method for constructing diyne-linked 2DP (DY2DP) crystals via Glaser coupling, assisted by a perfluoro-surfactant (PFS) monolayer. In-situ spectroscopic and diffraction techniques reveal that the well-ordered PFS monolayer facilitates the accumulation of Cu+ ions and subsequent vertical coupling of acetylenic monomers on the DMAc-H2O surface. Building on these findings, we successfully synthesized micro-scale rod-shaped DY2DP-Por or graphdiyne (GDY) crystals through the polymerization of porphyrin- or benzene-based monomers, respectively. Our study represents a significant advancement in the field of on-liquid surface chemistry and opens up enormous opportunities for constructing C—C bond linked 2DP crystals with unique functionalities.

Here, the authors reveal that DNA replication machinery transmits dual signals to control proper timing of centrosome duplication for genome stability 
 Copy number control of DNA and centrosomes is essential for accurate genetic inheritance. DNA replication and centrosome duplication have been recognized as parallel key events for cell division. Here, we discover that the DNA replication machinery directly regulates the licensing and execution processes of centrosome duplication to prevent centrosome amplification. We find that the microcephaly protein DONSON couples DNA replication initiation with Cdc6 translocation to centrosomes. The Cdc6 signal prevents the precocious occurrence of centriole disengagement, the licensing step for centrosome duplication. During DNA replication, DONSON inhibits replisome disassembly by interacting with the CMG helicase, maintaining the intrinsic S/G2 checkpoint signal that blocks centriole-to-centrosome conversion, the execution step for centrosome duplication. Disruption of these dual signals causes precocious centrosome duplication and chromosome mis-segregation, observed in DONSON patient cells. Our results reveal that the DNA replication machinery not only duplicates genetic material but also controls the system for its accurate segregation.

Here, the authors show that E. coli filament buckling modulates Min protein dynamics and determines division site placement after stress relief. 
 Bacteria often encounter physico-chemical stresses that disrupt division, leading to filamentation, where cells elongate without dividing. Although this adaptive response improves survival, it also exposes filaments to significant mechanical strain, raising questions about the mechanochemical feedback in bacterial systems. In this study, we investigate how mechanical strain modifies the geometry of bacterial filaments and influences the Min oscillatory system, a reaction-diffusion network central to division in Escherichia coli. Through a multidisciplinary approach combining quantitative fluorescence microscopy, biophysical modeling, microfluidics, and patterned growth substrates, we demonstrate that Escherichia coli filaments undergo a growth-induced buckling instability. This phenomenon modulates the spatiotemporal patterning of the Min system. Moreover, we show that synergistic mechanochemical effects determine the location of the division site after stress relief, effectively creating a mechanical “memory” for cytokinesis. Our findings underscore the critical role of mechanical forces and geometric effects in bacterial filamentation and provide new insights into the functional implications of mechanobiology in microbial systems.

 Extreme heat may affect added sugar consumption through the increased intake of drinks and frozen desserts, but such an impact is rarely quantified. Here, using individual transaction-level data for US households in 2004–2019, we find that added sugar consumption is positively related to temperature, notably within 12–30 °C at a rate of 0.70 g °C−1. This is primarily driven by the higher consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and frozen desserts. The magnitude of such impact is larger among households with lower income or educational levels.

 As ocean industrialization accelerates, corporate transparency is increasingly seen as critical to improve governance, yet little is known about how firms disclose their impacts on marine ecosystems. This study addresses that gap through a content analysis of sustainability and annual reports from 75 of the largest companies across 8 sectors of the ocean economy. We examine which impacts are reported, how they are measured and whether firms set related targets. Most companies focus narrowly on energy use and greenhouse gas emissions, with limited attention to more ocean-specific impacts, for which fewer than 25% of firms have metrics and targets. Where measurements are reported, the use of 443 distinct indicators limits comparability and suggests a lack of consensus on what should be disclosed. Amid growing demands for corporate accountability, our findings provide a timely benchmark to support the integration of ocean-specific considerations into reporting frameworks and to guide materiality assessments that better reflect the environmental realities of the ocean economy. Increasing transparency about firms’ reporting of environmental impacts is especially important in the context of a growing ocean economy.

 This paper investigates a crossover adjustment method for spaceborne GNSS Reflectometry (GNSS-R) phase altimetry and demonstrates its capability for precise surface elevation mapping through a case study of Lake Ladoga, which is the largest lake in Europe and exhibits unmodeled gravitational effects on its water surface. GNSS-R phase altimetry measures relative surface height with a constant but unknown offset and may also include errors in the retrieved surface gradients due to factors such as the residual atmospheric propagation error after model correction. The crossover adjustment method estimates the offsets between multiple GNSS-R tracks and each track’s surface gradient errors by formulating and solving a constrained least-squares problem to minimize differences at intersections. Additionally, this method evaluates the accuracy of GNSS-R altimetry retrievals by comparing the consistency of each track with others, enabling the identification of measurement outliers with respect to stable geophysical features. In the case study, we utilize 871 sets of Spire grazing-angle GNSS-R data collected from 2020 to 2023, containing signals coherently reflected off Lake Ladoga, to map the unmodeled gravitational effects on the lake’s water surface.

 Rivers are vital to Earth’s water cycle and human societies, yet their water quality is increasingly threatened by climate change and human activities. While satellite remote sensing has emerged as a powerful tool for large-scale water quality monitoring across diverse aquatic ecosystems, a systematic analysis of water optical properties in rivers remains limited, restricting its use in supporting Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) monitoring. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of water transparency (Secchi disk depth, ZSD) and color (Forel-Ule Index) in the five large rivers (Yangtze, Danube, Mississippi, Nile, and Amazon) using Sentinel-2 MSI data (2019–2021). Results reveal significant spatial-seasonal variations: Danube had the highest transparency (ZSD) and bluest color (FUI), followed by Nile, Yangtze, Mississippi, and Amazon. These differences were primarily driven by basin-specific soil erodibility and precipitation. Spatially, the Yangtze, Mississippi, and Amazon exhibited decreasing ZSD and increasing FUI from their upper to lower reaches, contrasting with different trends in Danube and Nile, highlighting the influence of large dams. Seasonally, two different patterns were observed in the five rivers, underscoring the hydrological influences on water optical properties. Furthermore, as two key optical water quality parameters, ZSD and FUI were analyzed for their complementary roles in characterizing river turbidity across varying water conditions. By quantifying spatiotemporal patterns, this study establishes a global baseline for river optical properties and supports SDG 6.3.2 monitoring.

 A total of 26 alternative and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) were investigated in atmospheric particles collected above the offshore Eastern China Sea (OECS) during a research cruise from April 20 to May 18, 2018. The total concentrations of these 26 PFAS ranged from 35.59 to 1646.53 pg/m3, with an average of 316.79 pg/m3. The concentrations of short-chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) were significantly higher than those of long-chain PFCAs, with perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) being the dominant PFCA congener. PFBA was detected in all particle samples, accounting for 77.9 % of the total PFCAs, with an average concentration of 222.05 pg/m3. Moreover, perfluorosulfonic acid (PFSA) analogues showed lower concentrations and detection frequencies than PFCAs, possibly due to the ban on PFOS-related substances. Other PFAS congeners, such as fluorotelomer sulfonic acids (FTSAs) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), were detected at lower concentrations, possibly because they predominately exist in the gaseous phase. The levels of PFAS in atmospheric particles over the OECS were comparable or higher than those in other areas of China and abroad. The coast of Fujian Province and the Yangtze River estuary were two hot-spots for PFAS, mainly influenced by emission sources (various industrial and port transportation activities). In contrast, regions with low PFAS concentrations likely benefited from their geographical locations and meteorological factors, as inferred from backward trajectory analysis. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) modeling identified four primary sources of PFAS; electronic product manufacturing, PFOS-based products, aqueous film-forming foam extinguishing (AFFF) agent usage, and paper packing production. Among these, electronic product manufacturing and PFOS-based products contributed more of the PFAS in the PM2.5 particle samples. The estimated dry deposition of ΣPFAS ranged from 0.77 to 35.56 ng/m2/d, with an average value of 6.55 ng/m2/d. PFBA, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluoropentanoic acid (PFPeA) were the dominant contributors. The total PFAS input into the East China Sea and the Yellow Sea via dry deposition in Spring was estimated to be about 518 kg and 328 kg, several times lower than the riverine input reported in previous studies. These findings clearly demonstrate that dry deposition is a significant pathway by which PFAS enter seawater and needs more attention."

 N-(1,3-Dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) is an essential additive in tire rubber compounds to enhance their lifespan. 6PPD quinone (6PPD-Q), a known toxic chemical, is formed through the oxidation of 6PPD. The formation of 6PPD-Q is expected to proceed via radical process, as the oxidation reaction necessarily involves an oxygen atom. However, due to the challenges in detecting radical species, many studies have inferred the formation of 6PPD-Q based on the neural oxidation products. In this study, the 6PPD oxidation products including radical intermediates were analyzed using direct atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-mass spectrometry (APCI-MS). The formation of 6PPD-Q was elucidated by detecting its radical intermediates. The first ketone group in 6PPD-Q is formed through the rearrangement of (6PPD + O − H)• radical precursor. The second one is generated by the loss of a hydrogen atom from (6PPD + 2O − H)• radical precursor. The abundance of 6PPD-Q was significantly lower than those of other competing oxidation products. The primary competing reactions include the rearrangements of the two radical precursors into alternative species and the dissociations of 6PPD and oxidation products into nitrobenzene, formylaniline, 4-hydroxydiphenylamine, and 4-nitrodiphenylamine.

 Epidemiological evidence linked PM2.5 exposure to increased virus transmission, yet the impact of chemical composition of PM2.5 on viral susceptibility remains unclear. We characterized the constituents of water-soluble matters (WSM) in PM2.5 from urban Guangzhou and their association with pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 infectivity, inflammatory and antiviral responses in A549 cells. Chemical analysis revealed considerable variability in chemical composition across all samples, although all samples were dominated by inorganic ions (e.g., NO3−, SO42−, NH4+) and WSOM (e.g., lipids, oxy-aromatics), with metals constituted ∼1.2 %, primarily Cu, Fe, and Al. WSM exposure elevated viral infectivity (1.3–5.6-fold), IL-8 and TNF-α generation (1.2–5.2-fold), and suppressed IFN-β by 24 %–74 %, with minimal effects on IFN-α and surfactant proteins. An explainable machine learning analysis indicated that transition metals (e.g., Ni, V, Mn, Fe), inorganic ions (e.g., SO42−, Na+, K+), highly unsaturated oxy-aromatics (Xc ≥ 2.5, DBE ≥6) and protein1 with 0.2 < O/C ≤ 0.6 and 0.9 < H/C < 2.5 were positively linked to IL-8 and TNF-α induction, whereas trace metals (e.g., Cr, Al) and protein2 with 0.6 < O/C ≤ 1 and 1.2 < H/C < 2.5 were both associated with enhanced infectivity and IFN-β inhibition. Notably, viral infectivity remained uncorrelated with inflammatory cytokines but showed an inverse correlation with IFN-β expression consistently observed during WSM-only and WSM + virus co-exposure, suggesting that PM2.5 may impair interferon-mediated defenses to exacerbate viral susceptibility. Our study uncovers an overlooked health risk of PM2.5 thereby filling a critical gap in understanding the multifaceted health effect of PM2.5 exposure."

 Secondary organic carbon (SOC) is a ubiquitous component of atmospheric fine particles but its spatial diversity at the city level has rarely been characterized. This study is the first of its kind that examine the spatial diversity of SOC at the city level, utilizing hourly carbon analyzer data of 2022 from four representative observation sites in the megacity of Guangzhou, China (GYQ, DXC, NSPZ and CHLK) encompassing urban, suburban, and rural areas. The minimum R-squared (MRS) method was adopted for SOC estimation. This study pioneers the use of explainable machine learning for SOC reconstruction with the CatBoost algorithm and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to quantify the contribution of input factors. The 12 input factors were grouped into four categories: photochemical reactions, aqueous-phase reactions, primary emissions, and meteorological conditions. Photochemical reactions dominate variations in SOC concentrations at urban and suburban sites. The annual average contribution of photochemical reactions gradually decreases from urban (∼50 %) to rural sites (∼30 %). The aqueous phase and meteorological conditions both contribute ∼20 % of SOC variations. Primary emissions contribution to SOC variations is less than 10 % for suburban and urban sites but the contribution increased to 33 % for the rural site. Further analysis suggests that the high contribution of primary emissions at the rural site reflects the influence of aged urban plumes. SOC at the suburban site is heavily influenced by shipping emissions due to its coastal location. SOC at the two urban sites exhibits different dependence on Non-methane hydrocarbon (NMHC) and O3 levels, which is related to the uneven influence of transported SOC at the two urban sites. SOC from local, regional, and background contributions was quantified at the urban site DXC using multiple-site observations. It was found that approximately 50 % of the SOC originated from outside Guangzhou city. This indicates that future efforts to control SOC may require a shift from relying solely on local mitigation measures to a more comprehensive approach that considers the spatial diversity of SOC for effective air quality management."

Many neglected and underutilized plant species (NUS) are known for their nutritional value and climate resilience, presenting a potential solution to conserve agrodiversity and contribute to local livelihoods and food security. However, NUS is commonly used as an umbrella term, obscuring potential differentiation between NUS systems in terms of their characteristics and socioeconomic performance. Here we characterize NUS production systems in three regions of Burkina Faso, a country experiencing food insecurity, poverty and arid and semi-arid climatic conditions, where many local communities rely on NUS for their food and livelihoods. We conducted 432 in-person surveys with households cultivating NUS on farms and/or collecting from the wild. Using principal component analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis we identify three distinct NUS production systems: NUS cultivation on farms predominantly for market sales (Cluster 1), NUS collection from the wild predominantly for market sales (Cluster 2), and NUS collection from the wild predominantly for self-consumption (Cluster 3). Through propensity score matching we identify that households in Cluster 1 had better socioeconomic performance compared to the other two clusters across all five income and food security variables considered here. However, there are no significant differences in the socioeconomic performance of Clusters 2 and 3. Our results indicate that: (a) NUS systems are not homogenous but can have a high degree of differentiation; (b) NUS are not solely emergency resources during severe food insecurity periods, (c) many NUS producers exhibit strong market orientation. Such findings can provide nuance in the current debates on whether and how can NUS provide promising alternatives to the other more widely produced crops in SSA."

Post-event analyses often assess the rarity of events from historical observations, and a growing number of studies attempt to attribute the event’s severity to anthropogenic warming. Recent studies also advocate for the creation of ‘what if’ event storylines to explore the consequences if an observed event turned out to be worse. However, few studies have harmonized these different approaches when conducting retrospective analyses of hydrological extremes. Climate change attribution including river flows also remains rare. Here, a framework for post-event analyses of hydrological extremes is demonstrated using the winter half-year 2023/24 UK river flooding as a case study. Persistent high river flows were observed across the UK and western Europe, following on from notable winter floods in 2013/14, 2015/16 and 2019/20. The ‘ClimaMeter’ analogue-based attribution suggests that a 6 month period with similar atmospheric circulation patterns to the observed winter half-year 2023/24 has become warmer and wetter (by an average 8.8%) in 1945–2021 compared with 1850–1925. Monthly river flow reconstructions extended back to 1850 show that river flows during the analogue periods in the recent past have also become 13.5% higher. Applying the UNSEEN approach by pooling seasonal hindcasts show the potential for river flows to be 46% higher than the baseline in a worst-case storyline. Finally, hydrological simulations driven by a single-model initial-condition large ensemble suggest that when accounting for internal variability, a robust climate signal in winter half-year river flows has emerged for some areas but may remain concealed until the mid-21st century and beyond. Our results contribute to the use of storyline approaches in post-event analysis and highlight the changing risk of winter flooding in the UK. This framework can be applied to future hydrological extremes both in the UK and elsewhere to inform long-term planning for climate adaptation."

Topographic controls on hydrological and ecological conditions impact methane (CH4) fluxes, contributing to uncertainty in local and regional CH4 budgets and underlying drivers. The objective of this study was to explore CH4 fluxes and their drivers in a transitioning boreal forest-fen ecosystem (Goldstream Valley, Alaska, USA). This landscape is characterized by thawing discontinuous permafrost and heterogeneous mosaics of fens, collapse-scar channels, and small mounds of permafrost soils. From a survey in July 2021, observed chamber CH4 fluxes included fen areas with intermediate to very high emissions (29.8–635.3 mg CH4 m−2 d−1), clustered locations with CH4 uptake (−2.11 to −0.7 mg CH4 m−2 d−1), and three anomalous emission hotspots (342.4–772.4 mg CH4 m−2 d−1) that were located near samples with lower emissions. Some surface and near-surface variables partially explained the spatial variation in CH4 flux. Log-transformed CH4 flux had a positive linear relationship with soil moisture at 20 cm depth (R2 = 0.31, p-value < 1e-5) and negative linear relationships with microtopography (R2 = 0.13, p-value < 0.006) and slope (R2 = 0.28, p-value < 2e-5). Methane emissions generally occurred in flat, wet, graminoid-dominated fens, whereas CH4 uptake occurred on permafrost mounds dominated by feather mosses and woody vegetation. However, the CH4 hotspots occurred on drier, slightly sloped locations with low or undetectable near-surface methanogen abundance, suggesting that CH4 was produced in deeper soils. When the hotspot samples were omitted, log-transformed CH4 flux had a positive linear relationship with near-surface methanogen abundance (R2 = 0.29, p-value = 0.0023), and stronger linear relationships with soil moisture, slope, and soil macronutrient concentrations. Our findings suggest that some CH4 emission hotspots could arise from CH4 in deep taliks. The inference that methanogenesis occurs in deep taliks was strengthened by the identification of intrapermafrost taliks across the study area using low-frequency geophysical induction. This study assesses surface spatial heterogeneity in the context of subsurface permafrost conditions and highlights the complexity of CH4 flux patterns in transitioning forest-wetland ecosystems. To better inform regional CH4 budgets, further research is needed to understand the spatial distribution of terrestrial CH4 hotspots and to resolve their surface, near-surface, and subsurface drivers."

We apply the Global Change Analysis Model to explore the continent’s energy–land–water systems under four scenarios: a business-as-usual (BAU) and three net-zero scenarios targeting 2050 (NZ50), 2070 (NZ70), and 2100 (NZ100). Our analysis quantifies how the pace of decarbonization influences Africa’s interconnected energy, land, and water systems. Without new climate policy (BAU), Africa’s net CO2 emissions could increase by nearly six-fold; from 1.8 GtCO2 yr−1 in 2020 to 10.4 GtCO2 yr−1 by 2100. All net-zero scenarios constrain this growth, with NZ50, NZ70, and NZ100 achieving net-zero emissions by their respective target years through deployment of multiple carbon dioxide removal approaches (e.g. BECCS). Across all scenarios, primary energy supply expands, but its composition shifts under net-zero conditions. Over 2020–2100, renewables account for an average of 49%–53% of primary energy in the net-zero cases, displacing fossil fuels. Net-zero pathways also drive land-use shifts, reducing cropland area by 29%–31% and lowering water demand for food crops by 14%–15%, while increasing water use for BECCS (∼0.9 km3 yr−1 in NZ50). These land constraints raise staple food prices, averaging $1.16 kg−1 in NZ50—about 96% above BAU—with the steepest increase in Western Africa. In terms of mitigation cost, NZ50 is the most expensive pathway ($78 tCO2−1), compared to $68 tCO2−1 in NZ100. While earlier action enables deeper emissions cuts and faster clean energy transitions, it also imposes higher economic and resource trade-offs. Delayed net-zero deadlines reduce near-term disruption but result in higher cumulative emissions. Given Africa’s development context, we argue that net-zero timelines must balance technical feasibility with economic realities and social justice."

DRP, the most bioavailable form of phosphorus, stimulates algal proliferation directly, serving as a major driver of eutrophication, thereby threatening water quality degradation and freshwater sustainability. However, quantifying DRP loads and tracing their sources remains challenging due to landscape heterogeneity and the dynamic nature of precipitation events. In this study, a daily time-step DRP transport model was constructed for the entire Yamato River catchment (1077 km2), utilizing the Soil and Water Assessment Tool. A total of 106 weekly water quality samples, collected from January 2023 to December 2024, were analyzed for DRP concentrations and used for model calibration and validation. Results reveal that DRP fluxes are predominantly event-driven, with peak discharges closely associated with intense rainfall events. Non-point source (NPS) DRP loading, particularly from agricultural fields, was observed during rainfall, regardless of soil type or phosphorus adsorption capacity. These NPS contributions affect ecosystem vulnerability and closely correlate with environmental stability. Scenario analysis demonstrates that implementing deep fertilization practices can reduce annual NPS DRP loading by approximately 32% and lower peak loads during rainfall events by 28%. This study enhances the understanding of NPS DRP dynamics by identifying specific landscape characteristics linked to eutrophication risk, providing essential scientific guidance for targeted mitigation strategies. These findings are particularly important for enhancing the accuracy and effectiveness of environmental management strategies in the context of future climate change."

Despite reports of increasing heat-related death rates, robust epidemiological evidence on the health impacts of high temperatures, as well as the effects of low temperatures, remains scarce, particularly outside of urban settlements in Caribbean SIDS. In this study, we conducted a case time-series study on municipality-level mortality and temperature in Puerto Rico from 2015–2023. We modeled the relationship between daily mortality count and mean temperature using a conditional quasi-Poisson regression, combined with a distributed lag non-linear model (dlnm) with a 21 d lag, adjusting for relative humidity, seasonality, and day of the week. We estimated the minimum mortality temperature (MMT)—the optimal temperature associated with the lowest mortality risk—and calculated the relative risk associated with extreme low and high temperature, defined as the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of daily temperature. Additionally, we estimated the municipality- and island-level excess mortality fractions attributable to both low and high temperatures, relative to MMT. Our findings indicate that exposure to non-optimum temperatures (both low and high temperatures) is significantly associated with increased mortality risk. Specifically, extreme low temperature was associated with a 1.23 (95% CI: 1.07–1.40) times risk of all-cause mortality, while extreme high temperature was associated with a 1.16 (95% CI: 1.05–1.27) times risk. We estimated that temperature-related mortality accounted for 3.88% of the total 280 568 deaths (95% eCI: 3.39%–4.29%), with low temperatures contributing 2.02% (95% eCI: 1.69%–2.32%) and high temperatures contributing 1.86% (95% eCI: 1.35%–2.35%). Furthermore, we found substantial spatial variability in temperature-related mortality burdens across municipalities. Our study identifies the vulnerable municipalities to temperature-related deaths in Puerto Rico, providing evidence to inform municipality-specific climate adaptation and mitigation strategies."

A positive SSTIDw anomaly-marked by relatively warmer Northern Hemisphere sea surface temperatures-persists through spring to summer and leads to persistent negative surface pressure anomalies and anomalous cyclonic circulation. This intensifies the Saharan heat low and reinforces anomalous westerly and southwesterly flows across the Atlantic and the Guinea Coast, enhancing moisture flux convergence and rainfall in the Sahel. Based on this relationship, we develop an SSTIDw-based linear regression model that skillfully captures SSR characteristics. These findings highlight the multi-month lead time predictability of SSR, which is critical for climate-informed decision making in the Sahel."

Helms,Synthesis of surface snowfall rates and  radar-observed storm structures in  10+ years of northeastern US winter storms,"This study investigates how radar-detected snow bands relate to snowfall rates during winter storms in the northeastern United States. Using over a decade of data, we found that snow bands are not consistently linked to heavy snowfall at the surface, as snow particles are often dispersed by wind before reaching the ground. These findings highlight limitations of using radar reflectivity for predicting snow rates and suggest focusing on radar echo duration to better understand snowfall patterns. 
 Winter storms can cause disruptions in the densely populated regions of the northeastern United States. Mesoscale snow bands embedded within winter storms are often the main focus of snowfall forecasts and analyses. While primary bands are associated with frontogenesis, multi-bands are found in environments with both frontogenesis and frontolysis. This study investigates the relationship between observed surface snowfall rates and local enhancements in radar reflectivity (i.e., mesoscale snow bands) using data from 264 storm days over 11 winter seasons (2012–2023). We compare hourly surface snowfall rates obtained by National Weather Service (NWS) Automated Surface Observing Systems (ASOS) weather stations with the area × time fractions of locally enhanced reflectivity features and of all echoes passing over the 25 km radius of the surface observation. Our analysis focuses on non-orographic snowstorms with surface winds < 5 m s−1.Our findings show that most of the time snow rates are low (75 % of hours had liquid-equivalent snow rates less than 1 mm h−1). Heavy snow rates (>2.5 mm h−1 liquid equivalent) are rare (<4 % of observations). When enhanced reflectivity features pass over a location, only 1 out of 4 h have heavy surface snow rates. High-spatial-resolution vertical cross-sections from airborne radar obtained during the NASA Microphysics and Precipitation for Atlantic Coast-Threatening Snowstorms (IMPACTS) field campaign and rapid-update range-height indicators (RHIs) from ground-based radar demonstrate that enhanced reflectivity features in snow aloft are tilted and smeared on their way to the surface as their constituent snow particles are dispersed laterally by the horizontal winds within the storm. The duration of all snow echo over a location is useful in determining where higher snowfall accumulations may occur."

The ion-induced fraction was much higher in the clean boreal forest. However, earlier activation of charged particles and high ion-induced fraction during quiet NPF in the megacity site imply a non-negligible role for ion-induced NPF in polluted urban areas. 
 Air ions play a crucial role in new particle formation (NPF), which in turn has the potential to influence global climate and air quality. We conducted a comparative analysis of air ions in three size ranges (0.8–2 nm cluster ions, 2–7 nm intermediate ions, and 7–20 nm large ions) at two flagship sites: the Station for Measuring Ecosystem-Atmosphere Relations II (SMEAR II) site in a boreal forest of Finland and the Station for Observing Regional Processes of the Earth System (SORPES) site in a megacity of eastern China. Air ion number size distributions (0.8–42 nm) were measured using a Neutral cluster and Air Ion Spectrometer (NAIS) at these two sites from June 2019–August 2020. At both sites, rising temperatures reduced the difference between positive and negative cluster ion concentrations, likely due to the enhanced convection and turbulent mixing that diminish the Earth's electrode effect. The median cluster ion concentration at SMEAR II (1270 cm−3) was approximately six times higher than at SORPES (220 cm−3), which was caused by the high coagulation sink in the urban area. The median large-ion concentration at SORPES was nearly three times higher (197 cm−3) than that at SMEAR II (67 cm−3), which is due to the high number density of neutral aerosol particles facilitating ion attachment in the polluted megacity environment. The cluster ion concentration was negatively associated with the condensation sink (CS) at both sites, with a significantly stronger negative correlation at SORPES, suggesting that the CS was a decisive factor for reducing the cluster ion concentrations in this urban area. The median formation rates of 2 nm ions at SMEAR II (J2-: 0.033 cm-3s-1, J2+: 0.041 cm-3s-1) were similar to those at SORPES (J2-: 0.028 cm-3s-1, J2+: 0.025 cm-3s-1). The median ion-induced fractions were 19.9 % and 1.3 % at SMEAR II and SORPES, respectively, indicating a minor contribution of ions to NPF in polluted environments. Nevertheless, the charged particles were activated earlier than neutral particles at SORPES, indicating that the ion-induced nucleation could precede neutral nucleation in this polluted environment. In addition, the contribution of ion-induced nucleation at SORPES was higher at low NPF intensity, implying the non-negligible roles of air ions in urban aerosol production. This study underscores the need for long-term observations of air ions in both pristine boreal forests and polluted urban environments."

Using idealized baroclinic life cycle experiments with the ICON model, this study demonstrates that moisture and cloud processes amplify GW activity, driving strong shear and turbulence in the LMS. These findings highlight the critical role of GWs in shaping the dynamics in the LMS, particularly for clear air turbulence. 
 Mixing significantly influences the redistribution of trace species in the lower stratosphere, potentially being the dominant factor in forming the extratropical transition layer (ExTL). However, the role of small-scale processes contributing to mixing is poorly characterized. In the extratropics, mixing processes are often linked to stratosphere–troposphere exchange (STE), which occurs frequently during baroclinic life cycles, e.g., near tropopause folds, cut-off lows, or stratospheric streamers. Gravity waves (GWs), a dynamical feature of these life cycles, can potentially contribute to STE and mixing in the lower stratosphere. We present a series of baroclinic life cycle experiments with the ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) model to study the impact of GWs on the occurrence of vertical wind shear and consequent potential turbulence, an indicator for mixing in the lowermost stratosphere (LMS). Dry adiabatic simulations with varying spatial resolution reveal that the spatiotemporal occurrence of GWs depends on the model grid spacing and is closely linked to shear and turbulence generation. Further process understanding is gained from experiments incorporating physical processes like latent heating, (vertical) turbulence, and cloud microphysics. Introducing moist processes amplifies GW activity and turbulence potential, mainly driven by latent heat release and stronger baroclinic wave evolution with vigorous vertical motions. Turbulence parameterization has a lesser effect on the overall evolution without moisture, whereas it dampens the effect of latent heat release in moist simulations. Altogether, GWs substantially enhance vertical shear and potential turbulence occurrence in the LMS and thus can play a significant role in tracer mixing and, consequently, in the ExTL formation."

Based on scatterplots, correlation coefficients, and mean (in situ–dropsonde) error (ME), intercomparisons reveal good agreement for wind speed (r = 0.95, ME = 0.21 ± 1.68 m s−1), u/v wind components (r ∼ 0.96–0.97, ME ∼ 0.03–0.16 (± 1.62–1.67) m s−1), wind direction (r = 0.94, ME = 0.00 ± 0.22 based on cosine of direction angles), temperature (r = 0.99, ME = 0.00 ± 0.71 °C), and relative humidity (r = 0.91, ME = −3.86 ± 10.74 %). Sensitivity analysis shows that binning data into categories of horizontal separation distance, clear versus cloud, winter versus summer, altitude range, and terciles of the values for examined variables did not yield major changes except for relative humidity where there was more deviation, especially above 70 %. The effect of statistics was examined by relaxing the vertical separation distance criteria to expand the number of pairs to over 360 000, without much difference in intercomparison metrics. The effect of averaging more points for each instrument in the final 555 pairs was also shown to lead to minimal change in agreement. Overall, these results provide confidence in both the performance of the measurement techniques compared and combining dropsonde data with in situ data from a separate coordinated aircraft for ACTIVATE, which has relevance to other campaigns with multiple coordinated aircraft conducting similar types of measurements."

Active radar is costly, so we focus on a more accessible approach. Using data from the Fengyun-3G satellite, we successfully tracked severe weather like Typhoon Khanun and heavy rainfall in Beijing in 2023. This method enhances global precipitation data and helps better understand extreme weather. 
 The Fengyun-3G satellite (FY-3G), China's first precipitation measurement satellite, was launched on 17 April 2023. FY-3G carries the advanced Multi-Channel Microwave Radiance Imager-Rainfall Measurement (MWRI-RM) system, which, compared to the previous GPM/GMI, includes more sounding channels. Additionally, a Ka/Ku-band dual-frequency Precipitation Measurement Radar (PMR) on board FY-3G provides 3D observations of severe precipitation systems. Due to the high cost and hardware limitations of precipitation radars, most precipitation-affected satellite observations rely on passive data. Deep learning methods have become effective tools to bridge these two types of observations. In this study, we propose a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) to reconstruct PMR-Ku reflectivity profiles based on MWRI-RM multi-channel radiances across different precipitation scenarios and analyze the effects of dual oxygen absorption sounding channels and polarization differences (PDs) on reconstruction outcomes. Experimental results demonstrate that incorporating dual oxygen absorption channels substantially improves reflectivity reconstruction accuracy, particularly over land (root mean square error reduction: 5.43 % ± 1.56 %) and coastal regions (5.47 % ± 1.17 %). In contrast, polarization differences provided only marginal improvements (0 %–1.6 % RMSE reduction), with statistical significance constrained within the uncertainty bounds of model training variability.  Validation against extreme precipitation events – including Typhoon Khanun (2023) and the “07.2023” (for July 2023)  Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) extreme rainfall event – confirms the operational value of dual oxygen channels in resolving three-dimensional precipitation structures. These enhancements not only improved accuracy but also enabled a more comprehensive three-dimensional representation of precipitation systems."

Gianoutsos,Evaluating mass flow meter measurements from chambers for greenhouse gas emissions from orphan wells and other point sources,"This work demonstrates a simple approach for using mass flow meters connected to rigid chambers for measuring gas emissions rates in situations the meter cannot be attached directly, such as orphan oil and gas wells. This paper shows the results of performance testing, demonstrates common sources of uncertainty, and provides suggestions for how to use the approach to generate the best quality data. The findings can be used by researchers, the petroleum industry, regulators, and carbon markets. 
 This study evaluates the performance of a rigid gas flux chamber equipped with a mass flow meter (MFM) for measuring gas emissions from leaking orphan wells and similar pressure-driven gas point sources. We conducted a series of laboratory and field experiments to evaluate the sensitivity, stability, and dynamic range of an MFM chamber system and found an optimal method for sealing the chamber to the ground to isolate the emission source. From these results, we estimate the effects of different soil gas permeabilities on measurements and identify the uncertainty of environmental processes that can impact measurements. Simulations of an MFM chamber are compared to those of a dynamic flux chamber to contrast the data derived with both methodologies and illustrate the potential for measuring high variability leaks with the MFM chamber. Using a low flow resistance MFM and a chamber well-sealed to the ground, it is possible to measure leaks down to 1.08×10-3 cubic meters per hour (m3 h−1) (refenced to 25°/1 atm), corresponding to 0.77 grams per hour (g h−1) methane or 2.11 g h−1 carbon dioxide, with a mean uncertainty of 0.89 % relative standard deviation. Environmental processes such as heated gas inside the chamber from solar gain, wind blowing across the chamber vent, and changing humidity in the chamber, can cause variation in MFM measurements. Over 11 d of continuous monitoring under varying weather conditions, the standard deviation of the environmentally sourced signals was found to be 7.40×10-3 m3 h−1 (equivalent to or 5.27 g h−1 methane or 14.45 g h−1 carbon dioxide). Strategies to obtain the highest quality data from MFM chambers include burying the edges of the chamber below the surface sufficiently deep to seal the chamber edges against gas flow and soaking the dirt with water to lower the chances of escaping gases, while monitoring the gas flow and adjusting the chamber seal to achieve a maximum flow rate."

GRAIN is the first openly accessible, worldwide map of irrigation canals, and was built using community driven mapping efforts and machine learning. GRAIN contains data on nearly 4 million kilometers of canals, and this resource can support better water planning and agricultural management efforts by governments, researchers, and communities worldwide. 
 Despite supporting roughly 40 % of the world’s agricultural output, irrigation canal networks remain a critical data gap in global geospatial archives. Currently, there is no consistent geospatial database that documents the extent of surface-water irrigation canals. The GRAIN (Global Registry of Agricultural Irrigation Networks) dataset fills this gap by leveraging the potential of volunteered geographic information (VGI) from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and applying a machine learning based classification pipeline to distinguish canals from rivers and streams. A Random Forest classifier was trained on 20,000 samples of quality-controlled canal and river data using 5 engineered geometric and topographical features. The model achieved over 98 % training accuracy, translating to a ~93.6 % median recall on independent validation datasets for primary canals, with a mean positional offset of ~98 m. The GRAIN dataset includes land cover maps and OSM tags to assign canal use cases, identifying over 3.8 million km of agricultural irrigation canals in 95 countries. There is marked regional concentration of agricultural canals with hotspots identified in Europe, South and Southeast Asia, and North America. Agricultural canal distribution also varied widely by climatic zones with over 65 % in temperate and cold zones and approximately 22 % in arid regions. A canal density analysis normalized by cropland area highlighted smaller countries such as Finland, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and Egypt having the densest irrigation canals. While the global correlation between canal density and national cereal yields was found to be modest (r = 0.31), the GRAIN dataset suggests that the presence of well-developed surface-water infrastructure may positively influence agricultural productivity as seen in the Netherlands and New Zealand. GRAIN is now publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16786488 (Suresh and Hossain, 2025) under a CC-BY-4.0 licence. Designed as a community-driven resource, GRAIN data bridges a long-standing gap, and opens new possibilities for evaluating irrigation efficiency, supporting climate adaptation, guiding infrastructure investments, and extending the value of new satellite remote sensing missions on surface water such as the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT)."

 Argo profiles of temperature/salinity (T/S) at specific times and locations from January 2003 through December 2023 are mapped into monthly maps of steric sea level (SSL), thermosteric sea level (TSL), and Ocean Heat Content (OHC) anomalies at long wavelengths. The mapping uses a monthly satellite reference computed from the difference between satellite altimetry and gravimetry, so that in periods where there is not sufficient global Argo coverage (generally before 2007), the satellite estimate is used instead of a mean climatology. Longwave mapping is done to reduce large errors introduced by poor sampling of mesoscale eddies by the Argo floats. We demonstrate that on global- and basin-scales, the longwave mapping does not substantially affect calculations of mean SSL, TSL, or OHC changes. Monthly standard error maps from the mapping are also provided. These maps are intended for users interested in understanding global- and basin-scale sea level budgets, as well as understanding changes in ocean heat uptake."

The RW was analyzed (i) before and after the tertiary treatment (sand filtration and chlorination), (ii) during the storage period in secondary ponds before its use in irrigation, and (iii) directly in the droppers installed in four plastic-based greenhouses over 9 months. The results obtained in RW showed a bacterial concentration below the minimum required to reach class A (<10 CFU/100 mL, Regulation EU 2020/741), a reduction of the initial AB concentration (up to 13 ABs, total 4847 ± 1413 ng/L) of 58%, and no significant reduction of ARGs (Log units/100 mL: 16S rRNA (9.99 ± 0.80) > intI1 (8.80 ± 0.95) > blaCTX-M32 (7.53 ± 0.63) > sul1 (7.08 ± 1.05) > blaTEM (6.81 ± 1.05) > qnrS (5.72 ± 0.82)). The storage of RW was a hotspot only for bacteria; an increase in all concentrations was observed in both main and secondary reservoirs, demonstrating that direct RW reuse is the most beneficial option to avoid significant bacterial regrowth. In all greenhouse droppers’ systems, a significantly higher concentration of all bacteria was generally detected than in secondary reservoirs, demonstrating that this is another hotspot independent of whether the RW is used directly or not.

However, its regulatory mechanisms in rhizospheric methane oxidation and biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) remain elusive. This study reveals a previously unrecognized function of IP: mediating methanotrophic nitrogen fixation through coupled aerobic methane oxidation and IP reduction (Fe-MOX). Using a hydroponic coculture system integrating methane-oxidizing bacteria and rice seedlings, we demonstrated that IP enhanced microbial methane oxidation by 46.8% and significantly stimulated BNF rate by 33.6%, with methane-derived carbon accounting for 89.1% of the BNF energy source. Notably, dissolved iron removal did not diminish the BNF enhancement, excluding mediation by soluble iron species. Intriguingly, ferrihydrite supplementation at equivalent iron concentrations failed to replicate the BNF stimulation observed with IP, suggesting the indispensability of root-associated iron redox cycling. Mechanistic analyses identified that Methylosinus/Methylocystis species mediated Fe(III) reduction, synergistically collaborating with specific rhizobial strains to execute Fe-MOX-dependent BNF. These findings uncover a previously overlooked yet pronounced contribution of IP to BNF, providing novel insights for developing dual-strategy approaches to mitigate methane emissions and reduce nitrogen fertilizer dependency in paddy ecosystems."

While microbial arsenic detoxification has been extensively studied in bacteria, archaeal mechanisms remain understudied. Here, we investigated arsenic resistance genes in Bathyarchaeia, one of the most abundant archaeal lineages on Earth. Comprehensive genomic analysis of 318 Bathyarchaeia representatives revealed a widespread distribution of arsenic resistance genes, with 60% of genomes harboring genes for arsenate reduction (arsR1 and arsC2), arsenite methylation (arsM), and arsenic transport (acr3, arsP, and arsB). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that these genes are widely distributed across 14 archaeal phyla, including Asgardarchaeota, Thermoproteota, and Thermoplasmatota, with close evolutionary relationships among these archaeal lineages. In situ investigation of sediment columns and laboratory microcosm experiments demonstrated a strong positive correlation between Bathyarchaeia abundance and arsenic concentrations, suggesting their adaptation to arsenic-rich environments. Molecular dating analysis placed the emergence of Bathyarchaeia at approximately 3.01 billion years ago, with the evolution of their arsenic resistance mechanisms closely tracking major geological events, including the Great Oxidation Event (2.4–2.1 Gya), Huronian Glaciation (2.29–2.25 Gya), and Cryogenian Glaciation (∼700 Mya).

Here, we investigate how amine-modified polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NH2) regulate silicon transport and biosilica deposition in Synechococcus sp. CC9311, a key contributor to oceanic primary production. At an environmentally relevant concentration (0.1 μg/mL), PS-NH2 primarily modified the cell surface microenvironment, which significantly increased the level of extracellular biosilica deposition. In contrast, higher PS-NH2 concentrations (0.5–2.0 μg/mL) induced oxidative stress and membrane damage, leading to a shift toward enhanced intracellular silicon accumulation. Notably, at 2.0 μg/mL, the oxidative damage was the most severe, resulting in the most significant intracellular silicon accumulation compared to 0.5  and 1.0 μg/mL. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that PS-NH2 exposure downregulated genes involved in energy metabolism and photosynthesis while upregulating stress response pathways, suggesting that silicon accumulation may serve as a protective mechanism against PS-NH2-induced cellular stress.

However, studies of the atmospheric photochemical oxidation of BTHs remain very limited, hindering the assessment of their atmospheric impacts. Herein, we systematically investigated the reaction kinetics and yields of secondary organic aerosol (SOA) from benzothiazole (BTH, the parent compound of BTHs) photo-oxidation under various experimental conditions using an oxidation flow reactor. The rate constant for BTH reacting with OH radicals, (3.14 ± 0.20) × 10–12 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, was similar to that of single-ring aromatics like toluene, yet its SOA yield was comparable to that of bicyclic aromatics like naphthalene. Furthermore, we found that while NOx suppressed the BTH-derived SOA production, relative humidity enhanced its production. Further field measurements revealed significant SOA formation potential from BTH photo-oxidation in typical urban areas, comparable to that of well-known benzene or naphthalene. Gaseous BTH in an offshore atmosphere was also  detected, indicating its potential impacts on marine environments. Our results elucidate the atmospheric photochemical processes of BTH, revealing its important but previously overlooked contribution to ambient SOA formation."

L‐curve analysis for S40RTS models with recorded and synthetic waveforms show that SS‐S traveltimes and SS/S amplitude ratios have minima within the same damping parameter range. SS/S ratios for S40RTS and model GLAD‐M25 show the trade‐off between scale‐length and strength of lowermost‐mantle heterogeneities. The recorded SS/Sdiff ratios are lower than predicted by 3D mantle models which may be explained by a decrease in the mean shear velocity by ∼1% ${\sim} 1\%$ at the lowermost 200 km of the mantle.

Observations indicate that the duskside SAPS exhibits a wider magnetic local time extension (∼7 MLT) and longer duration (∼1 hr) than the dawnside SAPS. Furthermore, the duskside SAPS resides within low‐density mid‐latitude troughs, whereas the dawnside SAPS is not located within the trough.

Past studies on the impact of aspect‐driven differences in insolation quantify moisture in shallow soils but largely ignore moisture dynamics in deeper weathered bedrock. Here, we measure moisture dynamics via geophysical surveys and borehole measurements in two opposing hillslopes with similar properties in the seasonally dry central California Coast Range. Despite greater insolation, the grassy equator‐facing slope experienced less and shallower moisture withdrawal during the dry season relative to the pole‐facing slope with oak trees, which experienced greater and deeper moisture withdrawal. Consequently, following the dry season, water content on the grassy equator‐facing slope was higher, which may contribute to aspect‐dependent differences in runoff generation, landslide susceptibility, and drought resilience."

Here, we investigate this specific observation with a combination of machine learning techniques. Before the mainshock, we identify two seismicity volumes with asynchronous activity, disparate fault orientations, and distinct b‐values. Throughout the sequence, both structures maintain their distinct b‐values; only when combined, the b‐value apparently increases before the mainshock (and drops afterward). Our observation suggests that a temporal b‐value variation in a large volume, or the entire extent of this sequence, originates from individual structures with distinct b‐values being active at different times. More generally, temporal b‐value variations may also reflect changes in the spatial distribution of seismicity besides other underlying processes. Our findings highlight that b‐value interpretation must acknowledge the structural heterogeneity, such as associated fault segments and their orientations."

In this study, we present the first paleointensities in the mid of the superchron conducted on baked sediments from Hainan (SE Asia). This hitherto underexploited material, akin to baked clays used in archeomagnetism, produces unambiguous linear Arai‐Nagata diagrams over 60%–90% of the fraction of natural remanent magnetization. Using strict selection criteria, we show that baked sediments, volcanic glasses, and silicate crystals are consistent with a dipole moment ∼40% higher than the present‐day value.

The tornado's fine‐scale dynamic structures in turn can be disturbed by these buildings. This study employs an advanced modeling system of mesoscale‐to‐large eddy simulation (LES) to explicitly resolve both the tornado‐like vortex (TLV) and building‐induced flow disturbances. Our modeling reasonably reproduced a TLV passing over building clusters, while the evolutionary characteristics of TLV are comparable to that of the video‐captured tornado funnels of an actual event in South China. The structures of the TLV are significantly disturbed as it approaches high‐rise building clusters. After arriving at the downstream of the building cluster, the disturbed TLV regains a well‐defined structure. Such a reconstruction of TLV structures is characterized by the vertical alignment of the original aloft TLV structures and low‐level building‐induced lee vortex. As the TLV detaches the building cluster, it leaves open space for a wind corridor, a band area of high wind speeds along the direction of ambient flow in the open area among building clusters. This corridor delivers momentum that, when coupled with the reconstruction of TLV, favors local strong winds. Such a type of local strong winds are highly related to the heights of building clusters but are somewhat less sensitive to the detailed TLV track relative to building clusters, as indicated by numerical sensitivity experiments. These results provide insight into possible wind speed changes when tornadoes encounter buildings, which may have valuable implications for urban wind hazard mitigation."

Spray Transport and Statistics,"For decades, theoretical, observational, numerical, and experimental efforts have sought to quantify the behavior of sea spray in the high‐wind boundary layer. A persistent problem, however, is that it is notoriously difficult to examine spray effects directly: observations are scarce, and numerical simulations are often idealized or lacking in a full representation of the physical processes involved. In this study, we provide the most complete treatment of spray transport and coupling with the hurricane boundary layer to‐date by conducting high‐resolution large‐eddy simulations coupled with Lagrangian spray droplets across a range of wind speed using a GPU‐accelerated model. In this first of a two‐part work, we describe the turbulence, the impacts of spray on mean profiles, and the dispersion of spray throughout the boundary layer. Spray has minimal impacts on the velocity and turbulence statistics, while at the same time having a much more pronounced influence on profiles of temperature and water vapor. Droplet concentrations roughly follow the conventional power‐law shape above the droplet injection layer, although almost universally over predict the droplet number concentrations. The Lagrangian lifetime statistics are computed as well, and it is shown that estimates based on a droplet falling at its Stokes terminal velocity from the significant wave height is inaccurate and cannot capture the wide range of possible droplet lifetimes."

The potential impacts of this uncertainty on regional terrestrial hydroclimates are largely unknown, which is problematic for climate risk assessments. To address this, we designed novel atmospheric model experiments simulating future global warming with and without enhanced ETP warming, superimposed upon an idealized El Niño‐Southern Oscillation cycle. Our results show that enhanced ETP warming significantly influences future terrestrial hydroclimates in several regions across the tropical and subtropical Americas. In southern Mexico, Central America and the Amazon region, enhanced ETP warming exacerbates long term drought trends and extreme drought events, yet the opposite is true in south‐central South America. Along the west coast of the continental western United States, the effects of enhanced ETP warming manifest as El Niño‐related extreme precipitation anomalies. These findings illustrate how climate impact projections may be misrepresented in conventional multi‐model analysis, which does reflect true uncertainty of the future tropical Pacific warming pattern."

We obtain an overall root mean square error of 1.06°C $1.06{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, demonstrating the versatility of our model, and its applicability across various regions in the US. The high granularity of our model allows for the precise identification of hotspots that were previously undetected with daymet and gridMET products.

 The maternal microbiome during pregnancy and the peripartum period plays a critical role in maternal health outcomes and establishing the neonatal gut microbiome, with long-term implications for offspring health. However, a healthy microbiome during these key periods has not been definitively characterized. This longitudinal study examines maternal and neonatal microbiomes using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing in a Japanese cohort throughout pregnancy and the postpartum period. Forty-two mothers and their forty-five offspring participate in the study. The maternal vaginal microbiome remains relatively stable during pregnancy but significantly changes in the postpartum period. Among Lactobacillus species, the Lactobacillus crispatus group is predominant. A higher abundance of Lactobacillus early in pregnancy is associated with a favorable gestational period. The maternal gut microbiome is associated with the vaginal microbiome throughout pregnancy. The neonatal gut microbiome substantially changes in early life, with bacterial composition influenced by delivery mode. Over time, bacteria shared with the maternal gut microbiome become dominant in the neonatal gut. This study provides insights into microbiome dynamics in Japanese mothers and their offspring during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Identification of common patterns across diverse populations may help define keystone microbes essential for human health and inform the development of microbiome-based interventions. Here, in a longitudinal Japanese maternal-neonatal cohort, the authors characterize microbiome dynamics during pregnancy and the postpartum period, showing that early dominance of Lactobacillus crispatus in the vaginal microbiome is associated with favorable gestational outcomes."

 Rising atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD)—a measure of atmospheric dryness, defined as the difference between saturated vapor pressure (SVP) and actual vapor pressure (AVP)—has been linked to increasing daily mean near-surface air temperatures since the 1980s. However, it remains unclear whether the faster increases in daily maximum temperature (Tmax) relative to daily minimum temperature (Tmin) have contributed to rising VPD. Here, we show that the faster rise in Tmax compared with Tmin over land has intensified VPD from 1980 to 2023. This sub-diurnal asymmetric warming has driven a larger SVP increase than would occur under uniform temperature rise, while AVP is more strongly influenced by Tmin. Using reanalysis data, we estimate that asymmetric warming has contributed an additional ~18% to the increase in global land VPD. Sub-daily station observations corroborate this pattern, with asymmetric warming accounting for ~30% of VPD intensification across all stations. Our findings indicate that sub-diurnal asymmetric warming has substantially amplified global warming’s effect on atmospheric dryness over the past four decades, with significant implications for terrestrial water availability and carbon cycling.

 ROSAH (retinal dystrophy, optic nerve edema, splenomegaly, anhidrosis, and headache) syndrome is a rare genetic disease caused by variants in alpha-kinase 1 (ALPK1) resulting in downstream pro-inflammatory signaling mediated by the TIFA/TRAF6/NF-κB pathway. Here, we report the design of an ALPK1 inhibitor, DF-003, with pharmacokinetic properties suitable for daily oral dosing. In biochemical assays, DF-003 potently inhibits human ALPK1 (IC50 = 1.5 nM) and the ROSAH disease-causing mutant ALPK1[T237M] (IC50 = 16 nM). When tested against a panel of 394 human kinases, DF-003 exhibits ≥860-fold selectivity over the closest kinase. In cell-based assays, DF-003 suppresses inflammatory cytokine signaling mediated both by wild-type ALPK1 and the disease-causing ALPK1[T237M] mutant. Using mice heterozygous for wild-type human ALPK1 and ALPK1T237M established to model ROSAH syndrome that exhibit retinal microglial infiltration, astrocyte activation, and inflammatory cytokine upregulation in the retina, optic nerve, and cortex, we show that orally administered DF-003 is sufficient to inhibit these inflammatory phenotypes.

 Autism is a neurodevelopmental condition associated with altered resting-state brain function. An increased excitation-inhibition ratio is discussed as a pathomechanism but in-vivo evidence of disturbed neurotransmission underlying functional alterations remains scarce. We compare local resting-state brain activity and neurotransmitter co-localizations between autism (N = 405, N = 395) and neurotypical controls (N = 473, N = 474) in two independent cohorts and correlate them with excitation-inhibition changes induced by glutamatergic (ketamine) and GABAergic (midazolam) medication. Autistic individuals exhibit consistent reductions in local activity, particularly in default mode network regions. The whole-brain differences spatially overlap with glutamatergic and GABAergic, as well as dopaminergic and cholinergic neurotransmission. Functional changes induced by NMDA-antagonist ketamine resemble the spatial pattern observed in autism. Our findings suggest that consistent local activity alterations in autism reflect widespread disruptions in neurotransmission and may be resembled by pharmacological modulation of the excitation-inhibition balance.

 The unique biodiversity and vast carbon stocks of the Amazon rainforests are essential to the Earth System but are threatened by future water balance changes. Empirical evidence suggests that species and trait diversity may mediate forest drought responses, yet little evidence exists for tropical forest responses. In this simulation study, we identify key axes of trait variation and quantify the extent to which functional trait diversity increases tropical forests’ drought resistance. Using a vegetation model capable of simulating observed tropical forest drought responses and trait diversity, we identify emergent trade-offs between water-related traits (hereafter hydraulic traits) as a key axis of variation. Our simulations reveal that higher functional trait diversity reduces site-scale biomass loss during sudden catastrophic drought, i.e., a 50% precipitation reduction for four and seven years, by 17% and 32%, respectively, and continental-scale biomass loss due to severe chronic climate change-associated precipitation reductions, i.e., RCP8.5, constant CO2 at 380 ppm, and a 50% precipitation reduction over 100 years, by 34%. Additionally, we find that functional trait diversity-mediated biomass resistance is stronger under more severe drought conditions. These findings quantify the essential role of hydraulic-trait diversity in enhancing tropical forest drought resistance and highlight the critical linkages between biodiversity conservation and climate change mitigation.

 Cannabis consumption and legalization is increasing globally, raising concerns about its impact on fertility. In humans, we previously demonstrated that tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and its metabolites reach the ovarian follicle. An extensive body of literature describes THC’s impact on sperm, however no such studies have determined its effects on the oocyte. Herein, we investigate the impact of THC on human female fertility through both a clinical and in vitro analysis. In a case-control study, we show that follicular fluid THC concentration is positively correlated with oocyte maturation and THC-positive patients exhibit significantly lower embryo euploid rates than their matched controls. In vitro, we observe a similar, but non-significant, increased oocyte maturation rate following THC exposure and altered expression of key genes implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, inflammation, and chromosome segregation. Furthermore, THC induces oocyte chromosome segregation errors and increases abnormal spindle morphology. Finally, this study highlights potential risks associated with cannabis use for female fertility.

Here, the authors examine the neural basis of this effect, showing that neural response patterns to tools in visual perception regions become more similar to those typically elicited by guns, contributing to racially biased responding. 
 Racial stereotypes have been shown to bias the identification of innocuous objects, making objects like wallets or tools more likely to be identified as weapons when encountered in the presence of Black individuals. One mechanism that may contribute to these biased identifications is a transient perceptual distortion driven by racial stereotypes. Here we provide neuroimaging evidence that a bias in visual representation due to automatically activated racial stereotypes may be a mechanism underlying this phenomenon. During fMRI, tools presented after Black face primes induced neural response patterns that exhibited a biased similarity to independent gun images in object-discriminative regions of the ventral temporal cortex involved in the visual perception of objects. Moreover, these neural representational shifts predicted the magnitude of participants’ racial bias, as reflected by differences in response times during weapon identification due to Black versus White face primes. Together, these findings suggest that stereotypes can shape the visual representation of socially-relevant objects in line with preconceived notions, thereby contributing to racially biased responding. Due to racial stereotypes, innocuous objects (e.g. a tool) can be misperceived as a gun when presented immediately after a Black individual’s face.

 In coronavirus (CoV) infection, polyproteins (pp1a/pp1ab) are processed into non-structural proteins (nsps), which largely form the replication/transcription complex (RTC). The polyprotein processing and complex formation is critical and offers potential therapeutic targets. However, the interplay of polyprotein processing and RTC-assembly remains poorly understood. Here, we study two key aspects: The order of polyprotein processing by viral main protease Mpro and its influence on complex formation with the methyltransferase nsp16. Moreover, we establish an approach to determine rate constants k from cleavage sites in structured CoV polyprotein based on native mass spectrometry (MS). The high sensitivity and precision of our method allow quantification of multi-reaction kinetics of nsp7-11 processing from four human pathogenic CoV species. The experimentally determined rate constants are put into perspective with a comprehensive analysis of primary sequences and structural models, revealing distinct cleavage mechanisms for each site based on their local structural environments.

They show considerable scope for faster migration by reducing the fuelling time before departure and subsequently on stopovers 
 Climate change is causing an earlier onset of spring, requiring migratory birds to accelerate their spring migration to avoid arriving late at the breeding grounds. This acceleration hinges on the capacity to shorten the time spent building energy reserves (fuelling) for migratory flight, which is currently thought to be very limited. Combining multiyear global-positioning-system tracking and body mass data from five large-bodied Arctic-breeding waterfowl species, we demonstrate that there is considerable scope for the studied species to migrate faster by shortening the fuelling time, either before departure or at stopovers. With the exception of one species (brent goose), populations were able to largely or fully offset their spring departure date with subsequent fuelling time en route. Still, under the current rates of Arctic warming, this may allow them to mediate only a few more decades of spring advance by migrating faster.

 Mangrove forests store significant amounts of blue carbon, mainly as soil organic matter. Insights into mangrove organic matter are limited, despite its importance for understanding blue carbon accumulation and vulnerability to global change. Here, we quantified soil organic matter preserved through chemical recalcitrance and association with the mineral phase, as key factors influencing blue carbon persistence. We found that the nature of the soil organic matter varied with mangrove geomorphic settings. Delta settings were dominated by presumably the most persistent soil organic matter associated with minerals, while open coast karstic settings contained mostly particulate soil organic matter, likely preserved due to low microbial activity. Across mangrove soil depths, there was little difference in soil organic matter pools. The soil organic matter pool across mangroves’ geomorphic settings exhibited greater variation than that observed across all terrestrial biomes.

 The prediction of fire-induced tree mortality is important for evaluating potential timber volume losses, replanting costs, and for assessing how mortality will impact long-term yield and carbon dynamics. However, current methods do not provide spatially explicit predictions, limiting the use of this data for proactive forest management, such as thinning and reducing fuel load to reduce tree mortality. In this study we assess whether the incorporation of individual tree inventory data derived from airborne laser scanning and modeled and observed fire intensity data can provide accurate spatially explicit tree mortality predictions. Specifically, tree-level mortality was predicted for over 1.9 million trees within six wildfires in mixed coniferous forest in northwestern Montana, USA, and validated using high resolution imagery for each segmented tree crown. Random forest classification models utilizing observed fire intensity metrics derived from VIIRS observations were the most accurate (overall accuracy: 77.2 %), followed by random forest classification models utilizing modeled fire intensity (64.5–66.1 %) and those that utilized existing logistic regression relationships (55.7–59.0 %). The random forest tree mortality models also produced lower RMSE (6.3–10.2 %) and bias (1.7–3.7 %) compared to the logistic regression approach (RMSE: 38.4 %, bias: −29.6 %) when mortality accuracy was assessed across tree size class. The predictor variable importance quantification showed that fire intensity metrics were more important than species and structural variables in the mortality classification. Ultimately, this study contributes to the remote sensing of fire effects and fire science fields by developing a remote sensing-based methodology for predicting spatially explicit individual tree mortality across large spatial extents."

 Moisture content is a critical parameter for estimating the strength of partially saturated sand for engineering challenges such as beach trafficability. A framework for estimating the volumetric moisture content of sandy beaches using satellite-based HH-polarized X-band synthetic aperture radar imagery is presented and used to test the applicability of three theoretical scattering models: Oh, Dubois, and the Integral Equation Model (IEM). The developed framework relies on the measured backscatter coefficient, soil surface root-mean square (RMS) height, and the geometric characteristics of the image. Models for estimating the RMS height were developed based on field measurements for two distinct sites composed of predominately quartz sand and approximately uniform beach slopes: Duck, North Carolina and Cannon Beach in Yakutat, Alaska. The models were developed and tested for incidence angles of 23.3°-54.2° using data obtained from the Cosmo-SkyMED and TerraSAR-X satellites. Four sets of RMS height models were tested: Oh with moisture contents greater than 0 %, Oh with moisture contents greater than a very dry threshold, Dubois, and the IEM. Unique RMS height models, specific to a moisture content model, were developed for incidence angles ranging from a single incidence angle to a range of consecutive incidence angles. Applying the RMS height models, the root mean square error (RMSE) of moisture content was 0.7–6.9 %. Images with incidence angles of 30°- 46° and 40°-50° resulted in the best estimates of moisture content when compared to other ranges of incidence angles for the models tested. Deviations generally represented underestimates of the moisture content (0.1 %–1.3 %), with greater underestimates observed for the IEM. Spatial estimates of moisture content resulted in two distinct zones, one with low moisture contents and a second with slightly elevated moisture contents for all models except the IEM. Challenges associated with differences in scattering mechanisms, a lack of data with high moisture content, and sensitivity of models to small changes in RMS height are discussed."

The potential of next-generation imaging spectroscopy, whether airborne- or spaceborne-based, for mapping phenolics remains underexplored, particularly in structurally complex and heterogeneous ecosystems such as European mixed temperate forests. Furthermore, much is still unknown about the consistency and uncertainties of predicting forest canopy phenolics across different acquisition levels (airborne vs. spaceborne), limiting our ability to generalise and upscale local trait estimates to broader spatial extents. In this study, we sampled sunlit top-of-canopy leaves from three dominant tree species across mixed temperate forests in southeast Germany. Leveraging next-generation airborne (AVIRIS-NG) and spaceborne (PRISMA) imaging spectroscopy (400–2400 nm), we modelled two ecologically important phenolics (total phenol and tannin) expressed in three forms (foliar mass-based, foliar area-based, and canopy-based). The predictive accuracy of two data-driven approaches, partial least squares regression (PLSR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR), was compared to assess performance across different spatial scales. Our results demonstrate that phenolics in sunlit canopy leaves can be accurately estimated from both airborne and spaceborne data, with foliar area-based phenolics showing the strongest relationship with spectral reflectance (total phenol: R2 = 0.64–0.69, NRMSE = 13.28%–15.65%; tannin: R2 = 0.49–0.65, NRMSE = 15.86%–21.29%). We observed several similar patterns in model coefficients across airborne and satellite levels, with informative wavelengths aligning with known phenolic features. While the model accuracy declined slightly when scaling from canopy to landscape scale, phenolic maps derived from AVIRIS (aggregated to 30 m) and PRISMA showed good spatial agreement and linearity (GPR: r = 0.68, slope = 0.86; PLSR: r = 0.57, slope = 0.49). These maps successfully captured inter- and intra-species phenolic variability across the test site with low prediction uncertainty. Our findings provide valuable insights into mapping canopy traits across different observational scales, demonstrating how next-generation imaging spectroscopy can characterize the spatial and temporal dynamics of plant phenolics. This research paves the way for improved global monitoring of ecosystem functioning, as well as the pattern of phenolics across forested landscapes and trees' potential ‘chemical’ defences against herbivory and other environmental stressors."

 Reliable flood inundation modelling in complex river systems that are poorly instrumented is often limited by inaccuracies in open source DEMs, particularly near river channels and vegetated regions. This study proposes a methodology to correct and enhance resolution of satellite based DEMs in floodplain areas with ICESat-2 land elevation, Sentinel-2 MSI imagery, and a simple artificial neural network (ANN). FabDEM (30-m) is selected as the base DEM, and the ANN is trained to correct elevation errors at 10-m resolution using spectral bands from Sentinel-2 and ICESat-2 ATL03 elevation. The corrected ANN DEM reduces the mean squared error by 7 cm on average and up to 38 cm in the areas closer to the main river channel. MIKE 21 is used to simulate 2D flood extent maps for four different events, that consider in-situ discharge values at high, medium and low flow, comparing modelled flood extent with observed surface water extent (SWE) maps derived from Sentinel-2 at the selected dates. To ensure that improvements are attributed to DEM corrections rather than hydraulic parametrization, simulations are performed with different uniform values of the Gauckler-Strickler coefficient Ks, which are kept consistent across FabDEM and ANN DEM based scenarios. The critical success index (CSI), F1- score and bias are calculated for simulations with FabDEM and ANN DEM. Across all events, the ANN DEM improves flood simulation accuracy, increasing the Critical Success Index (CSI) and F1 score by up to 19 % and 13 %, respectively, and reducing bias by up to 25 %. This workflow demonstrates a scalable and efficient approach to improve hydraulic model inputs in data-scarce floodplain environments, offering valuable insights for flood risk assessment and water resource management in remote regions."

 To investigate the combustion characteristics of diesel/methanol in the engine cylinder, this study developed a chemical kinetics model for the diesel/methanol (DM) dual-fuel mechanism, comprising 288 reactions and 101 species. The simplified DM mechanism was optimized by adjusting the rate parameters of key reactions, combined with a sensitivity evaluation system for ignition delay time (IDT) and laminar flame speed (LFS). The model's predictions for IDT, LFS, and the concentrations of key species were verified experimentally using a zero-dimensional model. The effects of methanol substitution rate, and altitude on the formation of aldehyde pollutants were systematically analyzed. The results show that the DM mechanism can accurately predict the IDT, LFS, and the formation of key species for a single fuel within the temperature range of 318 K–2000 K, equivalence ratio range of 0.5–2.0, and pressure range of 0.1 MPa–2 MPa. Compared with existing mechanisms, the DM mechanism significantly improves prediction accuracy for these parameters, with R2 values greater than 0.96 and RMSE values below 0.05, demonstrating higher accuracy and consistency. Furthermore, increasing the methanol substitution rate significantly reduces CH2O emissions, while altitude lead to a marked increase in CH2O and CH3CHO emissions. Therefore, the proposed DM mechanism shows strong applicability and generalization capability in combustion characteristic prediction and pollutant emission control."

 This study employs the Greenhouse gas – Air pollution Interactions and Synergies (GAINS) model to analyse air pollution in Bathinda, Delhi, and Kanpur within the Indo-Gangetic Plain of South Asia, contrasting a Business-As-Usual (BAU) scenario with a Residential (RES) scenario that advocates for cleaner household energy use. It highlights the issue of ambient PM2.5 levels exceeding India's National Ambient Air Quality Standards, a common challenge in urban areas worldwide. The RES scenario's transition to cleaner fuels, including Liquefied Petroleum Gas, biogas, and renewable sources, forecasts significant emission reductions: a 26.76 % decrease in PM2.5 and a 10.67 % reduction in SO2 emissions. This adjustment leads to a 16.14 % improvement in average PM2.5 exposure, from 90.62 to 75.99 μg/m3, potentially preventing nearly one-third of premature deaths due to air pollution. By quantitatively evaluating residential emission control strategies and their health impacts using the GAINS model, this study offers a replicable framework for clean air planning in highly polluted regions. The Indo-Gangetic Plain case study provides transferable insights into sustainable energy transitions, supporting global air quality strategies.

 Very few evaluation studies have focused on the western Tibetan Plateau (TP), despite considerable scientific interests from climatologists and glaciologists globally. This region exhibits anomalous glacial stability under climate warming, but the lack of long-term and high-density observational data poses a major research challenge. Evaluating and selecting reanalysis datasets with higher accuracy over the western TP is thereby vital for advancing climate research. Using ground-based 2-m air temperature (T2m) observations from multiple neighboring countries across the western TP, we establish an integrated observational network to evaluate the performance of widely used reanalysis datasets, including NCEP1, NCEP2, ERA-Interim, JRA55, MERRA2, CRA-Land, CRA, and ERA5.The results indicate that three reanalysis datasets (CRA-Land, CRA, and ERA5) generally outperform the others in capturing T2m climatology and year-to-year variability across the western TP as a whole. However, over the Karakoram, the core glacial zone in the western TP, the above three datasets demonstrate the lowest skills in simulating T2m climatology, although they still perform well in capturing year-to-year variability. For CRA-Land and CRA, the error sources are unclear, although their terrain elevation differences respectively explain ∼67.4 % and ∼69.1 % of their climatological T2m errors. For ERA5, the terrain elevation differences (explaining ∼58.4 %) and collective radiative processes are the two primary error sources. Moreover, higher surface albedo in ERA5 is identified as the key contributor causing radiative errors. This study identifies the optimization of surface albedo in the Karakoram and its neighboring regions as a critical pathway to enhance ERA5 data quality in the future."

The results highlight large variability in the aerosol concentration, size, and water vapor affinity depending on in situ conditions and air mass transport over the ocean. Marine aerosol chemical composition is highly variable over this region and should be considered to better study the impacts of aerosols on regional weather and climate. 
 This study presents observations of marine aerosols made during six ship-based campaigns in the southwestern Indian Ocean in 2021 and 2023. A set of aerosol measurement instruments is used to study the spatial and temporal variability in the number and size distribution of marine aerosols, the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and the hygroscopic properties of aerosols (kappa–Köhler parameter, κ). It has been shown that the number of submicron aerosols measured varies much more significantly (ranging from 100 to over 3000 cm−3) than the number of CCN (60 to 500 cm−3 at 0.4 % supersaturation). As a result, the κ values obtained show considerable variability, ranging from 0.05 to 0.7. Four distinct scenarios are examined to elucidate some of these variations: (1) the predominance of pristine air masses in the eastern regions of the subtropical Indian Ocean, with highly variable κ values sensitive to the low aerosol concentration measured in this area; (2) the predominance of polluted air masses in the Mozambique Channel, with weakly hydrophilic aerosols; (3) a precipitation and storm event in the southern Indian Ocean, with highly variable κ values; and (4) a new particle formation event in the open ocean, with an increase in κ values as the newly formed particles grow to Aitken mode particles.The size distribution of the sampled marine aerosols was analyzed according to the origin of the air masses. In general, a shift of the Aitken and accumulation modes toward larger aerosol sizes was observed for continental and subtropical air masses in the Indian Ocean due to aging. Conversely, the modes shifted toward smaller sizes for air masses in the southern Indian Ocean due to higher primary marine emissions. Aerosols are more hydrophobic for continental air masses (κ ∼ 0.1), more hydrophilic and variable over the subtropical Indian Ocean (κ ranging from 0.2 to 0.6), and intermediate (κ ∼ 0.2) over the southern Indian Ocean. The κ of the subtropical Indian Ocean increases with wind intensity, while it remains stable in the southern Indian Ocean. This effect is attributed to the high proportion of primary organic matter, which is due to the important concentration of nanophytoplankton in the southern Indian Ocean. It has been shown that primary organic aerosols act as surfactants, thus counterbalancing the highly hydrophilic properties of NaCl."

We employ a multi-phase microphysics scheme that distinguishes between ice from different nucleation processes. Ice crystals in the cirrus outflow mostly stem from in situ formation. Hence, they were formed directly from the vapor phase. Sedimentational redistribution modulates cirrus properties and leads to disagreement between cirrus origin classifications based on thermodynamic history and nucleation processes. 
 Formation pathways of cirrus clouds are thought to differ in their dominant ice nucleation mechanism and thermodynamic regime: liquid-origin cirrus form at water saturation, and ice crystals form by freezing of liquid water drops, while in situ cirrus form below water saturation at low temperatures (T < 235 K), and ice crystals form without an intermediate, stable liquid phase.Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) can transport liquid droplets and vapor from the boundary layer into the upper troposphere, where cirrus is formed in the outflow. The dominant ice formation pathway remains uncertain. We employ a two-moment multi-class cloud microphysics scheme that distinguishes between five ice classes. Each ice class represents ice formed by a unique formation mechanism. Thus, the formation signature is available even a long time after the formation process occurred.Our analysis for a WCB case study shows that cirrus in the outflow consists predominantly of ice formed by processes only active below water saturation. From a nucleation perspective, this suggests in-situ-origin cirrus. However, Lagrangian trajectories show that the cirrus is derived from mixed-phase clouds. Hence, from a thermodynamic perspective, the cirrus is from a liquid origin. We found that sedimentation is a key process for the vertical redistribution of ice formed by different pathways. The main WCB ascent region was embedded in a slowly ascending air mass that resulted in in situ ice formation above the WCB. This in-situ-formed ice sedimented into mixed-phase clouds of the WCB below, which also altered the macrophysical properties of the outflow cirrus."

Bell,Ozonolysis of primary biomass burning organic aerosol particles: insights into reactivity and phase state,"Authentic aerosols emitted from residential wood stoves and open burning processes are only slightly oxidized by ozone in the atmosphere. Under dry conditions, the reaction does not proceed to completion, while under high humidity conditions, the reactivity proceeds further. These results indicate that the reactivity with ozone is likely impacted by aerosol phase state (e.g., aerosol viscosity). 
 Biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) particles are a major contributor to atmospheric particulate matter, with various effects on climate and public health. Quantifying these effects is limited by our understanding of the BBOA particles' evolving chemical composition during atmospheric aging, driven by their exposure to atmospheric oxidants. This study explores the role of ozone (O3) as an atmospheric oxidant in processing primary BBOA particles. We exposed particulate emissions from beech, spruce, and pine wood fires to O3 in an oxidative flow reactor, monitoring their chemical evolution using high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry (HR-ToF-AMS) and extractive electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (EESI-ToF-MS). We found that the oxidative state of the particles increased with O3 exposure, as shown by the consistent, albeit minor, rise in O/C ratios. Analysis of the EESI-ToF-MS data revealed specific molecular groups containing 18 and 20 carbon atoms, likely mainly abietic, linoleic, and oleic acids, as highly reactive towards O3 and driving the increase in oxidative state. At higher relative humidity, increased oxidation and loss of reactive species indicate that enhanced O3 diffusion into particles allows the ozonolysis to progress further, highlighting humidity's role in overcoming diffusion barriers that limit ozonolysis in dry conditions. This study provides qualitative insights into the oxidative processing of primary BBOA particles in different phase states, presenting O3 as a selective oxidant. Further research could focus on quantifying the progression of the ozonolysis, in particular, the change in diffusion rates depending on relative humidity conditions or particle sizes."

 We introduce the development of CLIMADAT-GRid, the first publicly available daily air temperature and precipitation gridded climate dataset for Greece at a high resolution of 1 km × 1 km, covering the period 1981–2019. The dataset is derived from quality-controlled and homogenized daily measurements from an extensive network of meteorological stations: 122 for temperature and 312 for precipitation. Several approaches are evaluated for generating daily gridded datasets, including fixed random Kriging, generalized additive models, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines. Based on the evaluation analysis against withheld observational data, fixed random Kriging is selected as the method for the CLIMADAT-GRid construction. To address the lack of a dense temperature observational network, high-resolution simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting  (WRF) model are blended with observational data to produce the gridded temperature datasets. CLIMADAT-GRid is benchmarked against the CHELSA-W5E5, a global climate product with a similar resolution, for the overlapping period 1981–2016. While both datasets show comparable results for temperature, CLIMADAT-GRid demonstrates superior spatial performance and closer agreement with observational data for both the mean and the extreme values. Regarding precipitation, CLIMADAT-GRid consistency indicates higher values than CHELSA-W5E5, especially during the rainy season, but exhibits better agreement with observations. In terms of the number of wet days, both datasets overestimate spatial means relative to observations, with CLIMADAT-GRid showing a more pronounced orographic pattern than CHELSA-W5E5. Both datasets show similar results for the number of days with precipitation amounts equal to or higher than 10 mm, with CLIMADAT-GRid indicating better overall agreement with the observations.

 Dolphins are highly vocal cetaceans with a complex acoustic repertoire. These marine mammals rely heavily on sound for critical activities: echolocation clicks for navigation and prey detection, whistles for social communication, and pulsed sounds for less well-documented purposes. Understanding their acoustic behaviour is essential for insights into their ecology, social structure, and responses to anthropogenic noise.

The dataset was collected in the northern Bay of Biscay, France, in the summers of 2020 to 2022 during surveys conducted as part of the DOLPHINFREE project. Audio recordings were made during opportunistic encounters using two devices: a single high-quality hydrophone (sampling rate 512 kHz and bit depth 32 bits) and a compact array of four hydrophones (256 to 512 kHz and 16 to 24 bits) for localization purposes. The dataset comprises over 400 min of unedited audio recordings of D. delphis accompanied by visual observations. In total, we identified about 68 000 echolocation clicks, 4600 whistle contours, and more than 350 pulsed sounds.

In this study, we release the first publicly available 30-year ocean front dataset (1993–2023) for the Northwest Pacific, generated by applying a deep learning framework (Mask R-CNN) to daily sea surface temperature (SST) fields, with manually annotated samples for model training. The dataset provides pixel-level frontal boundaries along with associated attributes, including position, intensity, and width, stored in NetCDF-4 format at 1/12° spatial and daily temporal resolution. Accuracy evaluation shows a mean average precision (mAP) exceeding 0.90, with smaller errors in front width and intensity compared with traditional gradient-based methods, while capturing more small-scale features. The dataset offers three main contributions: (1) Filling the critical gap of a standardized, long-term ocean front product; (2) Serving as a ready-to-use training resource for deep learning models, greatly reducing the need for manual labeling; and (3) Providing benchmark samples for validation and intercomparison of other ocean front detection products. This dataset supports robust investigations of seasonal-to-interannual frontal variability and provides a valuable foundation for applications in meteorology, ecosystem management and climate change research."

Users often need statistics covering periods longer than the stream duration, requiring algorithms that do not store full time series. One-pass methods address this need while avoiding full data archiving, offering memory-efficient, accurate results for high-performance computing (HPC) workflows and downstream applications like bias adjustment. 
 Global climate models (GCMs) are being increasingly run at finer resolutions to better capture small-scale dynamics and reduce uncertainties associated with parameterizations. Despite advances in high-performance computing (HPC), the resulting terabyte- to petabyte-scale data volumes now being produced from GCMs are overwhelming traditional long-term storage. To address this, some climate modelling projects are adopting a method known as data streaming, where model output is transmitted directly to downstream data consumers (any user of climate model data, e.g. an impact model) during model runtime, eliminating the need to archive complete datasets. This paper introduces the One_Pass Python package (v0.8.0), which enables users to compute statistics on streamed GCM output via one-pass algorithms – computational techniques that sequentially process data in a single pass without requiring access to the full time series. Crucially, packaging these algorithms independently, rather than relying on standardized statistics from GCMs, provides flexibility for a diverse range of downstream data consumers and allows for integration into various HPC workflows.  We present these algorithms for four different statistics: mean, standard deviation, percentiles and histograms. Each statistic is presented in the context of a use case, showing its application to a relevant variable. For statistics that can be represented by a single floating point value (i.e. mean, standard deviation, variance), the results are identical to “conventional” approaches within numerical precision limits, while the memory savings scale linearly with the period of time covered by the statistic. For statistics that require a distribution (percentiles and histograms), we make use of the t-digest, an algorithm that ingests streamed data and reduces them to a set of key clusters representing the distribution. Using this algorithm, we achieve excellent accuracy for variables with near-normal distributions (e.g. wind speed) and acceptable accuracy for skewed distributions such as precipitation. We also provide guidance on the best compression factor (the memory vs. accuracy trade-off) to use for each variable. We conclude by exploring the concept of convergence in streamed statistics, an essential factor for downstream applications such as bias-adjusting streamed data."

We identified microfibers from microplastics, quantitatively apportioned the sources of microplastics and microplastics in 102 lakes across China by field work, and developed a novel index (IMRI) to assess the risk based on human footprint and the abundance, size, shape, color, and residual monomers and chemical additives. The abundance in the sediments of these lakes ranged from 0.3 to 66.7 items g–1. Microfibers and fiber-shaped microplastics accounted for 45% and 32% of the abundance. The risk levels assessed by IMRI indicated that microplastics and microfibers in the sediments of 33.3%, 28.4%, 27.5%, and 9.8% of the lakes had moderate, extremely high, high, and low risk, respectively, which was more consistent with the real situation of Chinese lakes compared with PLI, PHI, and RI and independent of background abundance. Secondary and tertiary industry-related activities and aquaculture activities contributed 64% and 36% to the abundance, posing extremely high risk and high risk, respectively. Artificial cellulosic microfibers mainly derived from aquaculture activities contributed 61% to the risk due to the residual toxic chemical additives.

Microbial C fixation and degradation, closely implicated in nitrogen (N) transformation and plant–soil–microbe interactions, significantly regulate soil C accumulation. However, how shifts in microbial functional potential impact soil C sequestration during vegetation succession remains unclear. Here, we synchronized microbial C and N cycling genes in the rhizosphere and bulk soils across an ∼130-year chronosequence at the Hailuogou Glacier in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Carbon fixation dominated microbial C cycling throughout the chronosequence, contributing to 74% of C-cycling gene abundances and increasing 3–6 times at the intermediate stage relative to the initial stage. Microbes favored energy-efficient and carbonate utilization pathways, such as the Wood–Ljungdahl and 3-hydroxypropionate cycles, to support high C-fixation potential. Ammonification, primarily driven by the ureC gene (>50% of N-cycling gene abundances), dictated N supply for plants and microbes. This enhanced soil N availability likely stimulated microbial biomass, diversity, and specific taxa, thereby optimizing C use efficiency. However, the ammonification-driven C fixation was contingent upon specific plant species at different succession stages. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of microbial N mineralization in shaping microbial communities and driving soil C accumulation in deglaciated landscapes."

However, S-ZVI is susceptible to corrosion in aquifers with elevated dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that a trade-off between the passivation and oxidative corrosion of aged S-ZVI can be achieved in the presence of silicate to promote its dechlorination performance on trichloroethylene. The electron transfer from aged S-ZVI to target contaminants and DO can be promoted to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), simultaneously enhancing reductive and oxidative dechlorination. Silicate interactions contribute up to an 18.9% decrease in the electron resistance, a 23.3% increase in oxidative dechlorination, a 61.1% increase in the dechlorination rate constant, and an 85.7% increase in the degradation capacity of aged S-ZVI as compared to the control. Furthermore, the decrease in the reductive sulfur species over an extended aging time promotes the depolymerization of silica polymers into monomer silicate on S-ZVI, which is conducive to mitigating silicate passivation and promoting the release of dissolved silicate in aged S-ZVI systems. This process, in turn, facilitates ferrous iron dissolution and ROS production, thereby enhancing the redox reactivity of aged S-ZVI. This study provides new insights into the effect of silicate on the aging of S-ZVI, which will help develop novel strategies for remediation using S-ZVI-based techniques."

We verified a significant discrepancy between traditional UHI intensity and human-centered UHI intensity worldwide, an average absolute difference of 1.27 °C with the relative difference of 77%. This highlighted the necessity of incorporating a human-centered perspective in UHI intensity assessment. We identified three key elements that shape the response of human-centered UHI intensity to influencing factor change: dominant influencing factor, response patterns (Type-I (monotonic increasing), Type-D (monotonic decreasing), and Type-P (downward parabola)), and nonlinear thresholds signifying a shift from mitigating to amplifying UHI intensity. Notably, these elements exhibited distinct clustering patterns in eastern North America, East Asia, and Europe. Consequently, mitigation strategies should be customized according to the key element identified for each city.

Acute toxicity tests with AMB, P1, and DBA in four aquatic species at different trophic levels revealed: the highest sensitivity in Danio rerio (LC50 = 0.56–51 ng/L), intermediate sensitivity in D. rerio embryos (LC50 = 4.8–240 ng/L), and relative tolerance in Artemia salina (LC50 = 8.4–265.7 ng/L) and Chlorella (LC50 = 138.4–450.6 μg/L), illustrating clear trophic-level differences.

This study proposes a ‘waste-to-energy’ strategy using a hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL)-based system to displace conventional energy- and emission-intensive practices. The proposed system directs HTL-produced biocrude to oil refineries and recovers regionally tailored nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers. In an independent facility analysis, 576 WRRFs in the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) could deploy financially viable HTL-based wastewater solids management, simultaneously achieving cost savings of 4.81M [4.04M to 5.51M] $·day–1 and a GHG reduction of 1,300 [351 to 2,140] tonne CO2 eq·day–1 while offsetting ∼ 1 to 2% of synthetic fertilizers. Key sustainability drivers include the biochemical composition of solids and internal rate of return (IRR), though IRR becomes less impactful at larger WRRFs. In a hub analysis, shared processing of wastewater solids at HTL-based treatment centers expands financially driven decarbonization opportunities to WRRF networks with solids mass flow rates higher than 5 to 7 tonne·day–1 and average transportation distances less than 80 to 155 km.

However, the transformation and reactivity of plant-derived and microbially derived DOM by microorganisms adapted to biodegradable MPs, and the involved microbial physiological processes, remain nearly unknown. Here, we added virgin and aged polylactic acid (PLA) and polyhydroxyalkanoate (PHA) to agricultural soils and incubated for 56 days. Using stable isotope techniques, reactomics, and metagenomics, we found that the addition of both virgin and aged PLA induced hydroxylation, demethylation, and dehydrogenation of lignin-derived DOM, resulting in a 3-fold increase in their oxidation degree. PLA activated the enzymatic pathway for lignin-derived DOM decomposition and downregulated genes involved in bacterial anabolism, such as those related to protein, amino sugar, and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. In contrast, PHA increased the content of microbially derived DOM compounds such as proteins and amino sugars by 2.1-fold relative to the control with peptide chain elongation. PHA resulted in the degradation of lignin-derived DOM into pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, accelerated bacterial ATP synthesis, the de novo biosynthesis of proteins and peptidoglycan, and cell renewal and death, thereby increasing PHA- and soil organic matter-derived microbial necromass carbon.

This phenomenon has been increasingly discussed in the environmental sciences as the impacts of regulatory capture on human and ecosystem health have become increasingly apparent. Regulatory capture is just one tactic employed by vested interests in the strategy of delaying, weakening, or abolishing policies designed to protect the public interest. Here, we define capture strategies as ‘the act of influencing individuals, organizations, or governments to prioritize corporate interests over those of human and ecosystem health’. Similar to the evolution of terms like whitewashing and greenwashing into the broader concept of colorwashing, this new definition expands the scope of capture to include a wide range of targets, such as individuals, educational institutions, nongovernmental organizations, media, and local, national, and intergovernmental organizations. By broadening the definition, we anticipate that researchers, policymakers, and civil society will find it easier to identify and prevent such nefarious activities. This paper illustrates how ‘capture strategies’ have played, and (unless kept in check) will continue to play, an instrumental role in obstructing efforts to address the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and chemical pollution."

Clear annual and semiannual oscillations (AO and SAO) are revealed in the nightly‐mean thermosphere‐ionosphere Na (TINa) (∼105–150 km) number density and volume mixing ratio with the summer maximum but spring equinox (March/April) minimum. Such stark contrast to the summer minimum in the main Na layers (∼75–105 km) supports the theory of TINa formed via TINa+ ion neutralization (TINa++e−→TINa+hν $\text{TIN}{a}^{+}+{e}^{-}\to \text{TIN}a+h\nu $). The SAO/AO amplitude ratio profiles (75–150 km) exhibit significant changes (∼0.06–2), linking TINa SAO to thermospheric density SAO and the minimal wave/eddy transport around midlatitude equinoxes which hinders TINa+ ion production and upward transport via reduced diffusion of the main Na layer. Stronger TINa in autumn than in spring equinox is explained by the maximal (minimal) meteoric influx occurring in September (April)."

This study investigates gas invasion and gas exsolution by depressurizing CO2‐saturated solution in specimens with distinct wettability. Gas‐brine distribution, bubble nucleation and growth processes were visualized via micro‐CT. The results show that endogenous displacement efficiency is almost always higher than that of exogenous displacement, by up to 63% in the same specimen. Hydrophobic sands provide more nucleation sites and stimulate bubble exsolution in the saturated solution, leading to the highest endogenous displacement efficiency. Pore‐scale observations show that each individual bubble must displace the brine in the pore before invading into an adjacent pore and once one cluster breaks through and reaches the outlet, it does not replace more water. Therefore, more nucleation sites are confirmed as the key to improving displacement efficiency or energy recovery."

Notably, in the Southern Hemisphere, future changes in atmospheric waves differ fundamentally between the winter and summer seasons. By the end of this century, austral mid‐latitude waves are projected to intensify in winter but to shift poleward in summer. Here we find that an asymmetric response of the waves across scales drives their seasonally asymmetric changes. Specifically, a strengthening of large‐scale waves contributes to the future intensification in winter, while a reduced intensity of small‐scale waves leads to the poleward shift of the waves during summer. Our analysis further reveals that seasonal differences in upper‐level warming patterns are responsible for the contrasting future changes in the waves across scales and seasons. These results underscore the need for detailed scale‐sensitive analyses to unravel the intricate effects of anthropogenic forcings on the mid‐latitude climate."

These effects were likely driven by sea‐level fall due to global icesheet expansion and/or Australian monsoonal intensification.

However, the temporal dynamics of Topt under climate warming remain poorly understood. This study analyzed data from 135 long‐term FLUXNET sites, each with at least 5 years of observation. Our results show that Topt of ER increased with rising temperatures across years within a site, indicating thermal acclimation, with a global average acclimation magnitude (Topt change per unit change in maximum temperature) of 0.82. More interestingly, this acclimation magnitude showed a negative correlation with the mean annual temperature across sites which was particularly evident in deciduous broadleaf forests and in cold regions. This negative correlation suggests that ecosystems in colder sites exhibit higher acclimation magnitudes compared to warmer sites, potentially reducing the variation in Topt across globe under future warming. These findings indicate a global homogenization of Topt under warming conditions. Future scenario analysis suggested that neglecting thermal acclimation may lead to inaccurate Topt estimates under climate change. This study underscores the importance of considering variable thermal acclimation responses of Topt for accurate prediction of future ER."

This paper traces generalizable phases in groundwater‐withdrawal regimes in individual aquifer systems and their associated impacts on eco‐ and geosystem services. The concept seeks to address common misunderstandings of fundamental concepts in hydrogeology, which have practical consequences for the management of groundwater systems that sustain these services. The Peak Groundwater concept highlights the critical need to acknowledge the nested character of transient groundwater flow systems and the effects of groundwater withdrawals beyond the aquifer boundary. Importantly, estimations of sustainable groundwater withdrawals need to consider indirect human‐environmental risks of withdrawals, such as surface water depletion and land subsidence. Estimating acceptable steady‐state limits for future groundwater withdrawals presents an “optimization challenge.” Solving this optimization challenge, estimating sustainable withdrawals for balanced groundwater budgets, is rooted in societal priorities and demands high‐quality simulation models and monitoring tools and practices such as 4D monitoring systems that are complementary in type and scale. Recognition and prediction of Peak Groundwater can guide groundwater managers on how to operate within sustainable limits of abstraction. Proactive adaptive groundwater management can prevent Peak Groundwater and associated decline in withdrawal capacities."

 The Lepidosauria is the most species-rich group of land-dwelling vertebrates.

Squamates owe their success to their generally small size, but also to their highly mobile skull that enables them to manipulate large prey. These key features of lizard and snake skulls are not seen in Sphenodon, which makes it important to understand the nature of their common ancestor. Lepidosaurs originated in the Triassic 252–201 million years ago, but confusion has arisen because of incomplete fossils, many of which are generalized lepidosauromorphs, neither squamates nor rhynchocephalians2–5.

The new species shows, as predicted, a non-mobile skull but an open lower temporal bar and no large palatine teeth, and it seems to have been a specialized feeder on insects.

Recently, human pluripotent stem (hPS)-cell-based gastric organoids for modelling domain-specific development of the fundic and antral epithelium are emerging8–10. However, recapitulating self-organized fundic–antral patterning in early stomach organogenesis remains challenging, presenting a considerable barrier for advancing knowledge of stomach organogenesis. Here we report human gastroids—a self-organized multilineage gastric organoid derived from hPS cells—to model gastric fundic–antral patterning in vitro. Through multi-germ-layer co-development, we generate gastroids that feature an epithelial chamber with bipolar fundic–antral patterning, annexed with neural populations near the fundic domain while enveloped by mesenchymal cells, therefore showing molecular, cellular, structural and anatomical similarity to stomach development in vivo. Non-endodermal cells, especially neural populations, function as a critical signalling centre to instruct fundic–antral patterning in gastroids through WNT-mediated crosstalk. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling and genetic silencing further reveal NR2F2 as a key mediator of fundic–antral patterning in gastroid development.

 Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and densest stellar systems in the Universe, yet how they form remains a mystery1. Here we present a suite of cosmological simulations in which both dark-matter-free GCs and dark-matter-rich dwarf galaxies naturally emerge in the Standard Cosmology. We show that these objects inhabit distinct locations in the size–luminosity plane and that they have similar ages, age spread, metallicity and metallicity spread to globulars and dwarfs in the nearby Universe. About half of our simulated globulars form by means of regular star formation near the centres of their host dwarf, with the rest forming further out, triggered by mergers. The latter are more tidally isolated and more likely to survive to the present day. Finally, our simulations predict the existence of a new class of object that we call ‘globular-cluster-like dwarfs’ (GCDs). These form from a single, self-quenching, star-formation event in low-mass dark-matter halos at high redshift and have observational properties intermediate between globulars and dwarfs. We identify several dwarfs in our Galaxy, such as Reticulum II (refs. 2–4), that could be in this new class. If so, they promise unprecedented constraints on dark-matter models and new sites to search for metal-free stars.

 Bacteriophages are the most abundant entities on earth and exhibit vast genetic and phenotypic diversity. Exploitation of this largely unexplored molecular space requires identification and functional characterization of genes that act at the phage–host interface. So far, this has been restricted to few model phage–host systems that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Here, to overcome this limitation, we introduce a non-genetic mRNA targeting approach using exogenous delivery of programmable antisense oligomers to silence genes of DNA and RNA phages. A systematic knockdown screen of core and accessory genes of the nucleus-forming jumbo phage ΦKZ, coupled to RNA-sequencing and microscopy analyses, reveals previously unrecognized proteins that are essential for phage propagation and that, upon silencing, elicit distinct phenotypes at the level of the phage and host response. One of these factors is the RNase H-like protein ΦKZ155 (also known as Nlp2), which acts at a major decision point during infection, linking the formation of the protective phage nucleus to phage genome amplification. This non-genetic antisense oligomer-based gene silencing method promises to be a versatile tool for molecular discovery in phage biology, will help to elucidate defence and anti-defence mechanisms in non-model phage–host pairs, and offers potential for optimizing phage therapy and biotechnological procedures.

 Amino acids (AAs) have a long history of being used as stabilizers for biological media1. For example, they are important components in biomedical formulations. The effect of AAs on biological systems is also starting to be appreciated. For example, it is believed that water-stressed cells increase the levels of AAs to prevent protein aggregation2. Several hypotheses have been put forward regarding their function, ranging from water-structuring3 to hydrotropic4 to specific effects such as stabilization against misfolding, yet it is not known whether their stabilizing function is protein specific or a generic colloidal property. Here we deduce that AAs possess a new and broad colloidal property: they stabilize patchy nanoscale colloids by adsorbing onto their surfaces through weak interactions. We demonstrate this general property by careful experimental evaluation of the stabilizing effect of AAs on dispersions of various proteins, plasmid DNA and non-biological nanoparticles. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework that captures this phenomenon and experimentally corroborate several new broad theoretical implications that apply beyond AAs. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that the addition of 1 M proline to insulin doubles its bioavailability in blood. Overall, our results indicate that the role of small molecules is as important as that of ionic strength and should always be reported in biophysics experiments.

 Cancer development and response to treatment are evolutionary processes1,2, but characterizing evolutionary dynamics at a clinically meaningful scale has remained challenging3. Here we develop a new methodology called EVOFLUx, based on natural DNA methylation barcodes fluctuating over time4, that quantitatively infers evolutionary dynamics using only a bulk tumour methylation profile as input. We apply EVOFLUx to 1,976 well-characterized lymphoid cancer samples spanning a broad spectrum of diseases and show that initial tumour growth rate, malignancy age and epimutation rates vary by orders of magnitude across disease types. We measure that subclonal selection occurs only infrequently within bulk samples and detect occasional examples of multiple independent primary tumours. Clinically, we observe faster initial tumour growth in more aggressive disease subtypes, and that evolutionary histories are strong independent prognostic factors in two series of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Using EVOFLUx for phylogenetic analyses of aggressive Richter-transformed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia samples detected that the seed of the transformed clone existed decades before presentation. Orthogonal verification of EVOFLUx inferences is provided using additional genetic data, including long-read nanopore sequencing, and clinical variables. Collectively, we show how widely available, low-cost bulk DNA methylation data precisely measure cancer evolutionary dynamics, and provides new insights into cancer biology and clinical behaviour. Cancer evolutionary dynamics are quantitatively inferred using a method, EVOFLUx, applied to fluctuating DNA methylation."

 Monogenic lupus offers valuable insights into the underlying mechanisms and therapeutic approaches for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE)1–3. Here we report on five patients with SLE carrying recessive mutations in phospholipase D family member 4 (PLD4). Deleterious variants in PLD4 resulted in impaired single-stranded nucleic acid exonuclease activity in in vitro and ex vivo assays. PLD4 loss-of-function mutations led to excessive activation of Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) and TLR9. Downstream inflammatory signalling pathways, especially type I interferon signalling, were hyperactivated in patient dendritic cells. Pld4-deficient mice presented with autoimmunity and cell-intrinsic expansion of plasmacytoid dendritic cells and plasma cells. Pld4-deficient mice responded to the JAK inhibitor baricitinib, suggesting that targeting type I interferon may be a potential therapy for patients with PLD4 deficiency.

 Antigen-induced clustering of cell surface receptors, including T cell receptors and Fc receptors, represents a widespread mechanism in cell signalling activation1,2. However, most naturally occurring antigens, such as tumour-associated antigens, stimulate limited receptor clustering and on-target responses owing to insufficient density3–5. Here we repurpose proximity labelling6, a method used to biotinylate and identify spatially proximal proteins, to amplify designed probes as synthetic antigen clusters on the cell surface. We develop an in vivo proximity-labelling technology controlled by either red light or ultrasound to covalently tag fluorescein probes at high density near a target antigen. Using T cell receptors as an example, we demonstrate that the amplified fluorescein effectively clusters and directs a fluorescein-binding bispecific T cell engager to induce enhanced T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Noninvasive, tissue-selective labelling in multiple syngeneic mouse tumour models produces potent immune responses that rapidly eradicate treated tumours. Efficient cell lysis further promotes epitope spreading to induce systemic immunity against untreated distal lesions and immune memory against rechallenge. Thus, proximity-labelling chemistry holds promise as a generalized strategy to manipulate antigen-dependent receptor function and cell states. Red light- or ultrasound-controlled proximity labelling is engineered to stimulate clustering-induced receptor activation and downstream signalling amplification to promote antitumour immune responses."

 Loss-of-function variants in the lipid transporter ABCA7 substantially increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease1,2, yet how they impact cellular states to drive disease remains unclear. Here, using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of human brain samples, we identified widespread gene expression changes across multiple neural cell types associated with rare ABCA7 loss-of-function variants. Excitatory neurons, which expressed the highest levels of ABCA7, showed disrupted lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, DNA repair and synaptic signalling pathways. Similar transcriptional disruptions occurred in neurons carrying the common Alzheimer’s-associated variant ABCA7 p.Ala1527Gly3, predicted by molecular dynamics simulations to alter the ABCA7 structure. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived neurons with ABCA7 loss-of-function variants recapitulated these transcriptional changes, displaying impaired mitochondrial function, increased oxidative stress and disrupted phosphatidylcholine metabolism. Supplementation with CDP-choline increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis, reversed these abnormalities and normalized amyloid-β secretion and neuronal hyperexcitability—key Alzheimer’s features that are exacerbated by ABCA7 dysfunction. Our results implicate disrupted phosphatidylcholine metabolism in ABCA7-related Alzheimer’s risk and highlight a possible therapeutic approach.

 Neural activity is increasingly recognized as a crucial regulator of cancer growth. In the brain, neuronal activity robustly influences glioma growth through paracrine mechanisms1 and by electrochemical integration of malignant cells into neural circuitry via neuron-to-glioma synapses2,3. Outside of the central nervous system, innervation of tumours such as prostate, head and neck, breast, pancreatic, and gastrointestinal cancers by peripheral nerves similarly regulates cancer progression4–12. However, the extent to which the nervous system regulates small cell lung cancer (SCLC) progression, either in the lung or when growing within the brain, is less well understood. SCLC is a lethal high-grade neuroendocrine tumour that exhibits a strong propensity to metastasize to the brain. Here we demonstrate that in the lung, vagus nerve transection markedly inhibits primary lung tumour development and progression, highlighting a critical role for innervation in SCLC growth. In the brain, SCLC cells co-opt neuronal activity-regulated mechanisms to stimulate growth and progression. Glutamatergic and GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) cortical neuronal activity each drive proliferation of SCLC in the brain through paracrine and synaptic neuron–cancer interactions. SCLC cells form bona fide neuron-to-SCLC synapses and exhibit depolarizing currents with consequent calcium transients in response to neuronal activity; such SCLC cell membrane depolarization is sufficient to promote the growth of intracranial tumours. Together, these findings illustrate that neuronal activity has a crucial role in dictating SCLC pathogenesis.

 Carbonaceous asteroids are the source of the most primitive meteorites1 and represent leftover planetesimals that formed from ice and dust in the outer Solar System and may have delivered volatiles to the terrestrial planets2–5. Understanding the aqueous activity of asteroids is key to deciphering their thermal, chemical and orbital evolution, with implications for the origin of water on the terrestrial planets. Analyses of the objects, in particular pristine samples returned from asteroid Ryugu, have provided detailed information on fluid–rock interactions within a few million years after parent-body formation6–11. However, the long-term fate of asteroidal water remains poorly understood. Here we present evidence for fluid flow in a carbonaceous asteroid more than 1 billion years after formation, based on the 176Lu–176Hf decay systematics of Ryugu samples, which reflect late lutetium mobilization. Such late fluid flow was probably triggered by an impact that generated heat for ice melting and opened rock fractures for fluid migration. This contrasts the early aqueous activity powered by short-lived radioactive decay, with limited fluid flow and little elemental fractionation12. Our results imply that carbonaceous planetesimals accreted by the terrestrial planets could have retained not only hydrous minerals but also aqueous water, leading to an upwards revision of the inventory of their water delivery by a factor of two to three. Analysis of samples from the asteroid Ryugu provide evidence of late fluid flow in a carbonaceous asteroid, indicating that such bodies may have retained two to three times more water than previously thought."

 Cancer-associated muscle wasting is associated with poor clinical outcomes1, but its underlying biology is largely uncharted in humans2. Unbiased analysis of the RNAome (coding and non-coding RNAs) with unsupervised clustering using integrative non-negative matrix factorization3 provides a means of identifying distinct molecular subtypes and was applied here to muscle of patients with colorectal or pancreatic cancer. Rectus abdominis biopsies from 84 patients were profiled using high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Integrative non-negative matrix factorization with stringent quality metrics for clustering identified two highly coherent molecular subtypes within muscle of patients with cancer. Patients with subtype 1 (versus subtype 2) showed clinical manifestations of cachexia: high-grade weight loss, low muscle mass, atrophy of type IIA and type IIX muscle fibres, and reduced survival. On the basis of differential expression between the subtypes, we identified biological processes that may contribute to cancer-associated loss of muscle mass and function, including altered posttranscriptional regulation and perturbation of neuronal systems; cytokine storm and cellular immune response; pathways related to extracellular matrix; and metabolic abnormalities spanning xenobiotic metabolism, haemostasis, signal transduction, embryonic and/or pluripotent stem cells, and amino acid metabolism. Differential expression between subtypes indicated the involvement of multiple intertwined higher-order gene regulatory networks, suggesting that network interactions of (hub) long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs and mRNAs could represent targets for future research.

 Controlling spin currents, that is, the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices, is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy-efficient information technologies1,2. A pure spin current has never been measured directly because the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport3,4. Here we report that resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons—the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order—in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.

 Epithelial cells work collectively to provide a protective barrier, yet they turn over rapidly through cell division and death. If the numbers of dividing and dying cells do not match, the barrier can vanish, or tumours can form. Mechanical forces through the stretch-activated ion channel Piezo1 link both of the processes; stretch promotes cell division, whereas crowding triggers live cells to extrude and then die1,2. However, it was not clear what selects a given crowded cell for extrusion. Here we show that the crowded cells with the least energy and membrane potential are selected for extrusion. Crowding triggers sodium (Na+) entry through the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), which depolarizes cells. While those with sufficient energy repolarize, those with limited ATP remain depolarized, which, in turn, triggers water egress through the voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 and the chloride (Cl−) channel SWELL1. Transient water loss causes cell shrinkage, amplifying crowding to activate crowding-induced live cell extrusion. Thus, our findings suggest that ENaC acts as a tension sensor that probes for cells with the least energy to extrude and die, possibly damping inadvertent crowding activation of Piezo1 in background cells. We reveal crowding-sensing mechanisms upstream of Piezo1 that highlight water regulation and ion channels as key regulators of epithelial cell turnover.

 Extreme event attribution assesses how climate change affected climate extremes, but typically focuses on single events1–4. Furthermore, these attributions rarely quantify the extent to which anthropogenic actors have contributed to these events5,6. Here we show that climate change made 213 historical heatwaves reported over 2000–2023 more likely and more intense, to which each of the 180 carbon majors (fossil fuel and cement producers) substantially contributed. This work relies on the expansion of a well-established event-based framework1. Owing to global warming since 1850–1900, the median of the heatwaves during 2000–2009 became about 20 times more likely, and about 200 times more likely during 2010–2019. Overall, one-quarter of these events were virtually impossible without climate change. The emissions of the carbon majors contribute to half the increase in heatwave intensity since 1850–1900. Depending on the carbon major, their individual contribution is high enough to enable the occurrence of 16–53 heatwaves that would have been virtually impossible in a preindustrial climate. We, therefore, establish that the influence of climate change on heatwaves has increased, and that all carbon majors, even the smaller ones, contributed substantially to the occurrence of heatwaves. Our results contribute to filling the evidentiary gap to establish accountability of historical climate extremes7,8.

 The Perseverance rover has explored and sampled igneous and sedimentary rocks within Jezero Crater to characterize early Martian geological processes and habitability and search for potential biosignatures1–7. Upon entering Neretva Vallis, on Jezero Crater’s western edge8, Perseverance investigated distinctive mudstone and conglomerate outcrops of the Bright Angel formation. Here we report a detailed geological, petrographic and geochemical survey of these rocks and show that organic-carbon-bearing mudstones in the Bright Angel formation contain submillimetre-scale nodules and millimetre-scale reaction fronts enriched in ferrous iron phosphate and sulfide minerals, likely vivianite and greigite, respectively. This organic carbon appears to have participated in post-depositional redox reactions that produced the observed iron-phosphate and iron-sulfide minerals. Geological context and petrography indicate that these reactions occurred at low temperatures. Within this context, we review the various pathways by which redox reactions that involve organic matter can produce the observed suite of iron-, sulfur- and phosphorus-bearing minerals in laboratory and natural environments on Earth. Ultimately, we conclude that analysis of the core sample collected from this unit using high-sensitivity instrumentation on Earth will enable the measurements required to determine the origin of the minerals, organics and textures it contains.

 Monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (TME)1 and tumour-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow fuels these populations2. Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced the survival and immunosuppression of mo-macs in the TME, restoring natural killer and T cell anti-tumour immunity and enhancing checkpoint blockade efficacy. Our findings identify a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the lung TME and highlight the potential of early interventions to reprogram macrophage fate for improved immunotherapy outcomes.

Here, taking lithium fluoride (LiF)—a widely studied and considered crucial SEI component4–7—as an example, we use 19F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and identify that LiF formed in SEI (LiFSEI) has fruitful spectroscopy features that originated from the formation of limited LiF–LiH solid solutions: H-rich phase (LiH1−yFy) and F-rich phase (LiF1−xHx), which is further validated by 6Li isotope NMR, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). By characterizing SEI formed in various electrolytes, we confirm the dominance of LiH1−yFy in high-coulombic-efficiency electrolyte, which can be rationalized by the fact that LiF–LiH solid solution shows improved ionic conductivity over LiF. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that LiH1−yFy-rich coating layer presents obvious advantages compared with LiF-rich coating layer in lithium-metal batteries. This revised understanding of the heterogeneous nature of SEI components would provide new insights for electrode–electrolyte interface design. Using 19F nuclear magnetic resonance to study LiF–LiH solid solutions revealed that it is present in the solid–electrolyte interphase of lithium metal batteries and confirms the heterogeneous nature of LiF in such interphases."

 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive type of lung cancer, characterized by rapid proliferation, early metastatic spread, frequent early relapse and a high mortality rate1–3. Recent evidence has suggested that innervation has an important role in the development and progression of several types of cancer4,5. Cancer-to-neuron synapses have been reported in gliomas6,7, but whether peripheral tumours can form such structures is unknown. Here we show that SCLC cells can form functional synapses and receive synaptic transmission. Using in vivo insertional mutagenesis screening in conjunction with cross-species genomic and transcriptomic validation, we identified neuronal, synaptic and glutamatergic signalling gene sets in mouse and human SCLC. Further experiments revealed the ability of SCLC cells to form synaptic structures with neurons in vitro and in vivo. Electrophysiology and optogenetic experiments confirmed that cancer cells can receive NMDA receptor- and GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic inputs. Fitting with a potential oncogenic role of neuron–SCLC interactions, we showed that SCLC cells derive a proliferation advantage when co-cultured with vagal sensory or cortical neurons. Moreover, inhibition of glutamate signalling had therapeutic efficacy in an autochthonous mouse model of SCLC. Therefore, following malignant transformation, SCLC cells seem to hijack synaptic signalling to promote tumour growth, thereby exposing a new route for therapeutic intervention. Small cell lung cancer cells form functional synapses with glutamatergic neurons, receiving synaptic transmissions and deriving a proliferative advantage from these interactions."

 As a key mitochondrial Ca2+ transporter, NCLX regulates intracellular Ca2+ signalling and vital mitochondrial processes1–3. The importance of NCLX in cardiac and nervous-system physiology is reflected by acute heart failure and neurodegenerative disorders caused by its malfunction4–9. Despite substantial advances in the field, the transport mechanisms of NCLX remain unclear. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of NCLX, revealing its architecture, assembly, major conformational states and a previously undescribed mechanism for alternating access. Functional analyses further reveal an unexpected transport function of NCLX as a H+/Ca2+ exchanger, rather than as a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger as widely believed1. These findings provide critical insights into mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and signalling, offering clues for developing therapies to treat diseases related to abnormal mitochondrial Ca2+.

 Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter—they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems1–5, which are generically difficult to simulate classically because of their high entanglement. Here we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in ref. 6, on an array of superconducting qubits. We image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.

 Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers1. In particular, models based on strongly correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems2, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter3,4. However, owing to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices5. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays6. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev’s model on a honeycomb lattice3, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states7. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement8 and feedforward9, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering10,11 with tunable entangling gates12 interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram13 and verify the non-Abelian spin-liquid phase3 by evaluating an odd Chern number14,15. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study the dynamics of the Fermi–Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry16 and high-energy physics17.

 West Antarctic outlet glaciers are in a stage of rapid ice loss, modulated by wind-driven exposure to warm ocean water. Rapid ice loss probably began in the mid-twentieth century and is often attributed to warmer ocean conditions near the ice shelves driven by strengthening westerly winds at the continental shelf break. This westerly wind trend is a feature of some historical climate simulations but is not supported by proxy (for example, ice-core, tree-ring) observations. Here we present an ensemble of regional ocean simulations and proxy-constrained climate reconstructions and show that shelf-break westerlies are a poor indicator of ocean conditions near the ice shelves. Instead, cumulative northerly wind anomalies close coastal polynyas (open-water regions), driving anomalous warming and freshening near the ice shelves, increasing ice-shelf melting. The increased meltwater leads to strengthening of the undercurrent that supplies warm water, further increasing melting. Our results highlight the importance of local northerly winds and associated sea ice changes for ice-shelf melting in West Antarctica. Proxy reconstructions show a significant historical northerly wind trend in this region, providing the atmospheric forcing that can explain the initiation of West Antarctic glacier retreat in the mid-twentieth century. Ocean simulations and proxy-constrained climate reconstructions suggest that the rapid retreat of West Antarctic outlet glaciers was initiated by local northerly wind trends over the twentieth century."

 Soil organic carbon is crucial for climate mitigation and agroecosystem sustainability, yet its depletion is concerning and its response to long-term fertilization remains unclear. Here we leverage the Broadbalk Classical Experiment at Rothamsted (UK), the world’s longest-running continuous winter wheat fertilization trial, along with 14C labelling, metagenomics and metabolomics to determine how 180 years of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization impact soil organic carbon dynamics. Compared with no fertilization, long-term P, N and combined NP fertilization increased the soil organic carbon content by 10%, 22% and 28%, respectively. P application alone disproportionately increased microbial respiration (37%) and biomass (20%), limiting stable carbon formation and slightly increasing labile carbon. N application alone increased microbial carbon use and necromass accumulation efficiency, increasing mineral-associated carbon build-up. Combined NP fertilization enhanced plant-derived carbon inputs and the transformation of labile carbon into stable carbon, increasing soil organic carbon quantity and stability. A meta-analysis of the effects of fertilization duration on soil organic carbon revealed that N and P fertilization globally increased cropland soil organic carbon by 21% and 13%, and these promoting effects decreased before increasing after 16 and 34 years, respectively. Overall, long-term mineral fertilization can effectively enhance soil carbon sequestration.

Although EV has proven to be very effective both as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, patients unfortunately develop resistance to EV after about 1 year, which calls for the need to develop new treatment options. In this study, we developed a NECTIN4-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell, and showed that it was highly effective against bladder cancer cells expressing NECTIN4. We previously found that patient tumors ranged from negative to very high levels of NECTIN4. We showed that cells with higher. NECTIN4 levels were more easily targeted by the CAR T cell. Interestingly, stimulating the PPARγ pathway using small molecules like rosiglitazone (an old diabetes drug) was effective at increasing NECTIN4 expression, particularly in UC cells with lower NECTIN4 levels. This translated into enhanced NECTIN4-CAR T killing in vitro and in mouse tumor xenografts. Moreover, we found that NECTIN4 is largely retained on tumors after patients become resistant to EV, and we developed EV-resistant cell lines to study this. Importantly, NECTIN4-CAR T cells remained effective even against these EV-resistant cancer cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that NECTIN4-CAR T cells are effective, whose activity can be further enhanced by repurposing a diabetes drug, rosiglitazone, to induce NECTIN4.

 With the approval of the antibody-drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin (EV), NECTIN4 has emerged as a bona fide therapeutic target in urothelial carcinoma (UC). Here, we report the development of a NECTIN4-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell, which exhibits reactivity across cells expressing a range of endogenous NECTIN4, with enhanced activity in high expressors. We demonstrate that the PPARγ pathway, critical for luminal differentiation, transcriptionally controls NECTIN4, and that the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone primes and augments NECTIN4 expression, thereby increasing sensitivity to NECTIN4-CAR T cell-mediated killing. NECTIN4-CAR T cells have potent anti-tumor activity even against EV resistant cells, which largely retain NECTIN4 expression, including in a post-EV biopsy cohort. Our results elucidate a therapeutically actionable mechanism that UC cells use to control NECTIN4 expression and suggest therapeutic approaches that leverage PPARγ agonists for rational combinations with NECTIN4-targeting agents in UC, as well as future potential treatment options for EV-refractory patients.

 Radial spokes (RSs) are conserved multimolecular structures attached to the axonemal microtubule doublets and are essential for the motility control of both cilia and sperm flagella. CFAP91, an RS3 protein, is implicated in human male infertility, yet its molecular function remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Cfap91 knockout (KO) mice exhibit impaired sperm flagellum formation and male infertility. Using a transgenic rescue model expressing FLAG- and BioID2-tagged CFAP91, we reveal that CFAP91 immunoprecipitates with RS3 proteins CFAP251 and LRRC23, whose localization is disrupted in Cfap91 KO sperm flagella. In addition, proximity labeling in mature spermatozoa identifies EFCAB5 as a sperm-specific CFAP91-proximal component. We show that Efcab5 KO males exhibit reduced sperm motility and fertility. Our findings establish CFAP91 as an essential scaffolder of RS3 assembly and EFCAB5 as a sperm-specialized movement regulator, advancing understanding of axonemal specialization in mammalian spermatozoa and its relevance to male infertility.

 How terrestrial mean annual temperature (MAT) evolved throughout the past 2 million years (Myr) remains elusive, limiting our understanding of the patterns, mechanisms, and impacts of past temperature changes. Here we report a ~2-Myr terrestrial MAT record based on fossil microbial lipids preserved in the Heqing paleolake, East Asia. The increased amplitude and periodicity shift of glacial-interglacial changes in our record align with those in sea surface temperature (SST) records. However, its long-term warming trend (1.0 °C/Myr, 95% CI = 0.4–1.7 °C/Myr) during 1.8–0.6 Myr ago diverges from the contemporaneous SST cooling. We propose that the Pleistocene warming in East Asia primarily resulted from regionally enhanced heat input and greenhouse effect of rising water vapor driven by Antarctic ice sheets (AIS) growth, highlighting the important climatic effect of AIS evolution. Such long-term warming across the Mid-Pleistocene Transition might have been beneficial for archaic humans’ flourishing in Eurasia.

Here, the authors conduct multiomic profiling of human livers to demonstrate that RNA splicing is dysregulated in alcohol-associated liver disease, interfering with liver regeneration. 
 Individuals with progressive liver failure risk dying without liver transplantation. However, our understanding of why regenerative responses are disrupted in failing livers is limited. Here, we perform multiomic profiling of healthy and diseased human livers using bulk and single-nucleus RNA- and ATAC-seq. We report that in alcohol-associated liver disease, alterations in the hepatic immune milieu prevent hepatocytes from transitioning to proliferative progenitors. We also find differences in RNA binding protein expression, particularly of the ESRP, PTBP, and SR families, leading to misregulation of developmentally controlled RNA splicing. Our data pinpoint ESRP2 as a disease-sensitive splicing factor and support a causal role for its deficiency in the pathogenesis of severe alcoholic hepatitis. Notably, splicing defects in Tcf4 and Slk, two ESPR2 targets, alter their nuclear localization and activities, disrupting WNT and Hippo signaling pathways that are critical for normal liver regeneration. We further demonstrate that changes in stromal cell populations enrich failing livers with TGF-β, which suppresses the ESRP2-driven epithelial splicing program and replaces functional parenchyma with quasi-progenitor-like cells lacking liver-specific functions. Taken together, these findings indicate that misspliced RNAs are effective biomarkers for alcohol-associated liver disease, and targeting them could improve recovery in affected individuals.

Firms spend little funds on carbon credits, and emission offsetting is not a central part of their climate strategies. 
 Carbon credits feature prominently in corporate climate strategies and have sparked public debate about their potential to delay companies’ internal decarbonisation. While industry reports claim that credit purchasers decarbonise faster, rigorous evidence is missing. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of 89 multinational companies’ historical emission reductions and climate target ambitions. Based on self-reported environmental data and more than 400 sustainability reports, we find no significant difference between the climate strategies of companies that purchased credits and those that did not. Voluntary offsetting is not a central part of most companies’ climate strategies, and many pass credit costs directly onto their customers. While the companies within our sample retired one-fourth of all carbon credits in 2022, the top five offsetters’ expenditures on voluntary emission offsetting are, on average, only 1 percent relative to their capital expenditures. For most companies, carbon credits are, therefore, unlikely to crowd out internal decarbonisation measures. Yet, we document that for large-scale offsetters in the airline industry, carbon credit purchases competed with financing internal decarbonisation measures.

 Atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular diseases, is characterized by the buildup of lipids and chronic inflammation in the arteries, leading to plaque formation and potential rupture. Despite recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), the underlying immune mechanisms and transformations in structural cells driving plaque progression remain incompletely defined. Existing datasets often lack comprehensive coverage and consistent annotations, limiting the utility of downstream analyses. Here, we present an integrated single-cell atlas of human atherosclerotic plaques, covering roughly 250k high-quality annotated cells. We achieve robust cell type annotations validated by expert consensus and surface protein measurements. Using this atlas, we introduce distinct markers for plaque neutrophils, identify a proangiogenic endothelial cell cluster enriched in advanced lesions, and specialized macrophage subsets. We also establish that fibromyocytes are exclusive to vascular tissue. This comprehensive atlas enables accurate automatic cell type annotation of new datasets, improves experimental design by guiding sample size and detection power, and supports the deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data.

 The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) aims to avoid carbon leakage by pricing the production emissions of imported goods. Currently, the CBAM applies to iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilizers, electricity and hydrogen. As the European Union considers extending the CBAM to chemicals by 2030, its effectiveness in this complex industry remains uncertain.

We find that the current CBAM framework would cover 50–60% of production emissions for these products, leaving substantial upstream emissions unpriced. This limited emission coverage risks compromising the policy’s climate ambition and distorts market incentives. To improve effectiveness, the CBAM would need to expand to include fossil feedstocks and refinery products, and implement high fallback default values for embodied emissions to incentivize data reporting.

 The timing of harvesting is crucial for determining crop yield potential as it influences the final stages of the crop growth cycle and affects crop grain quality. Early harvesting can lead to yield losses from excessive moisture and insufficient dry matter, while delayed harvesting can degrade grain quality due to over-maturation and increased susceptibility to weather, pests, and diseases. Accurate monitoring of harvest timing is essential to assess yield gaps, support profitable and sustainable farming practices, and optimize agricultural supply chains. However, remote sensing-based harvesting date detection methods often suffer from biases due to the inconsistent relationship between end-of-season (EOS) metrics in vegetation index (VI) time series and actual harvesting dates. This inconsistency occurs because harvesting decisions are often influenced by human factors such as equipment availability, labor constraints, and fuel costs, rather than plant condition alone. In this study, we develop a novel Normalized Harvest Phenology Index (NHPI) that integrates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Near-Infrared (NIR) reflectance to accurately monitor whether fields of corn and soybean have been harvested. Leveraging the distinct separability of NIR reflectance for corn and soybean before harvesting (senescent plants) and after harvesting (crop residue), combined with the contrasting trends between NIR and NDVI during this transition, the NIR-to-NDVI ratio amplifies the harvesting signal in its time series, making it a robust indicator of harvesting events. As the first spectral index designed for scalable identification of crop harvesting stage, the developed NHPI is applied to map harvesting dates for corn and soybean fields across the U.S. Midwest from 2020 to 2023 using Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery via Google Earth Engine (GEE). At the field level, the NHPI-based harvesting date estimation method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4 days and an R2 of 0.85 when compared against field-recorded harvesting dates, significantly outperforming all advanced harvesting date estimation benchmarks (i.e., EOS phenometric-based method, shape model fitting method (SMF), and shape model fitting by the separate phenological stage method (SMF-S). The NHPI-based harvesting date mapping also shows strong alignment with the state-level cumulative distribution of harvesting dates of the USDA crop progress reports, achieving an average MAE of 3 days. Further analysis of NHPI values before and after harvesting events reveals its strong adaptability to diverse weather conditions at large scales, highlighting its efficiency and robustness."

 Studying and analyzing cropland is a difficult task due to its dynamic and heterogeneous growth behavior. Usually, diverse data sources can be collected for its estimation. Although deep learning models have proven to excel in the crop classification task, they face substantial challenges when dealing with multiple inputs, named multi-modal or Multi-View Learning (MVL). The methods used in the MVL scenario can be structured based on the encoder architecture, the fusion strategy, and the optimization technique. Here, the literature has primarily focused on using specific encoder architectures for local regions, lacking a deeper exploration of other components in the MVL methodology. In contrast, we investigate the simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and encoder architecture, assessing global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoders (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible configurations in the MVL method. We use the CropHarvest dataset for validation, which provides optical, radar, weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all cases. Instead, a specific combination should be meticulously sought, including an encoder and fusion strategy. To streamline this search process, we suggest identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a standardized model schema for the exploration of crop classification through an MVL methodology. jn"

 Investigations on the raindrop size distributions (RSDs) are essential for understanding the dynamical and microphysical processes contributing to precipitation. Empirical relationships derived from RSD parameters, like radar reflectivity–rainfall rate (Z–R), mass-weighted mean diameter–rainfall rate (Dm–R), shape–slope (μ–Ʌ), and normalized intercept parameter–rainfall rate (log10Nw–R) relationships, can enhance the rainfall estimation, and cloud modeling simulations. In the present study, four years (2018–2021) measurements of a Laser Precipitation Monitor (LPM; Thies) disdrometer installed at the National Institute of Technology Rourkela, India, are used to investigate the RSD characteristics of thunderstorms (TSs) and tropical cyclones (TCs) observed during pre-monsoon (March–May) season. Along with the disdrometer data, auxiliary parameters like convective available potential energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CIN), total column water vapor (WV), vertical profiles of temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) from reanalysis data sets of ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) are also used in this study. TCs have dominant small-sized raindrops, whereas moderate and large-sized raindrops predominate in TSs. Diurnal variation of RSD indicates that raindrop sizes during TCs are limited to 4.5 mm. The mean values of R, Z, Dm, μ, and liquid water content (W) are maximum during the TSs and the normalized intercept parameter (log10Nw) and slope parameter (Ʌ) are maximized during the TCs. The average RSD indicated significant variations between TSs and TCs precipitation with a significant difference in Z–R, Dm–R, μ–Ʌ, log10Nw–R relationships. The Z–R relationships during the TSs and TCs are Z = 543.22R1.46 and Z = 291.3R1.31, respectively.

 Substantial uncertainties remain in numerical models incorporating different planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes when it comes to reproducing the detailed thermodynamic structure of the convective boundary layer (CBL), particularly for the level of neutral stability (zn), at which statically unstable lower CBL begins to transit into slightly stable upper CBL. Using multi-year radiosonde data from 12 stations and large-eddy simulation (LES), we examined the detailed CBL thermodynamic structure and processes over the Tibetan Plateau, particularly focusing on the impact of surface heating and entrainment on zn. The results indicated that the values of zn spatially ranged within 0.16–0.38zi on the plateau, with zi representing the CBL depth, and zn was higher in the southwestern region and lower in the southeastern region. Surface−/entrainment-induced large-scale thermals (corresponding to nonlocal fluxes) tended to suppress/elevate zn, due to warm air penetrating into the upper/lower CBL, whereas small-scale eddies (corresponding to local fluxes) exert the opposite effect on zn. The LES results indicated that zn increased before 08:00 Local Time (about 80 min after sunrise), as surface-induced small eddies dominated during the early stage of CBL development. After this time, zn decreased as large-scale surface-induced thermals became more active. This improved understanding provides guidance for further improvement of PBL schemes.Plain language summaryConvective boundary layer (CBL) over the Tibetan Plateau plays an important role in the climate system in East Asia. Nevertheless, detailed CBL structure and the impact factors over the plateau have not been fully examined yet. Combining the multi-year radiosonde fine-resolution profiles of potential temperature (θ) with the large eddy simulation (LES), we investigate the CBL structure, particularly the position of neutral point (zn), a transition level separating the statically unstable lower CBL from the slightly statically stable upper CBL. We also examine the impacts of surface heating and entrainment process on detailed CBL structure. θ profiles exhibit a three-layer structure, with zn spatially varying over the plateau. Different eddies with different sizes initiated from the surface and from the entrainment zone at the CBL top synergistically affect the evolution of the CBL and the altitude of zn. This improved understanding of the detail CBL structure and the relevant physical processes provides a new angle to evaluate and calibrate numerical weather prediction (NWP) models with PBL schemes."

However, the secondary messengers involved in this process are largely unknown. Here, we use the olfactory signal transduction of the aggregation pheromone 4-vinylanisole (4VA) as a model to address this question. When locusts detect 4VA, the pheromone is transported by OBP10 and OBP13 to the OR35–Orco receptor complex, thereby activating downstream pathways in the antenna. A pivotal downstream molecule, the lipid-binding protein Clvs2, facilitates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate transportation across the cytolemma, providing more substrates for inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production. PLCe1, a biosynthetic enzyme, boosts IP3levels in the antennal lobe of the brain. IP3is responsible for converting chemical signals from the antenna into neural signals, confirming IP3as a secondary messenger in olfaction perception instead of GPCR in locusts. These findings elucidate the universal function of IP3in olfactory signal perception, shedding light on the key nodes of insect olfactory signal transduction."

The heteroplasmic nature of mtDNA—where mutant and wild-type mtDNA coexist—complicates efforts to define its contribution to disease progression. In this study, bulk whole-genome sequencing of 637 matched tumor-normal samples from the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project revealed an enrichment of functionally impactful mtDNA variants in specific pediatric leukemia subtypes. Collectively, the results from single-cell sequencing of five diagnostic leukemia samples demonstrated that somatic mtDNA mutations can arise early in leukemogenesis and undergo positive selection during disease progression, achieving intermediate heteroplasmy—a “sweet spot” that balances mitochondrial dysfunction with cellular fitness. Network-based systems biology analyses link specific heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations to metabolic reprogramming and therapy resistance.

The joint inversion of these geodetic data, template-matching seismicity, and repeating earthquakes, revealed the first two shallow slow slip events (SSEs) observed in Mexico. The first one migrated from the trench to the earthquake hypocenter before rupture, and the second one occurred following anMw7.3 long-term SSE induced by the earthquake. Episodic near-trench oceanic-crust deformations (i.e., tilt transients) associated with shallow and deep synchronous decoupling of the plate interface reveal the occurrence of “slab-pull surges” before three regional earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater, including the Acapulco event, suggesting that they may serve as rupture precursors observable in subduction zones."

Our analysis of atmospheric energetics further reveals key mechanisms for magnitude uncertainty: aerosol radiative forcing drives, cloud radiative feedback amplifies, and ocean circulation damps the intermodel uncertainty in cross-equatorial atmospheric energy transport change and the meridional shift of tropical rain bands. This has important implications for understanding and reducing intermodel uncertainty in anthropogenic climate change."

Combined at low dose, this “triple M2e-mAb” confers robust prophylactic and therapeutic protection in mice challenged with diverse human and zoonotic IAV strains, including highly pathogenic variants. Therapeutic efficacy depends on Fc-mediated effector activity via FcγRI, FcγRIII, and FcγRIV, rather than in vitro neutralization. Serial passaging in triple M2e-mAb–treated immunocompetent and immunodeficient hosts failed to generate viral escape mutants. Our findings redefine the influenza-specific antibody therapeutic design and support Fc-optimized, non-neutralizing M2e-mAbs as a broadly effective, mutation-resistant, off-the-shelve therapy with direct relevance to human pandemic preparedness."

Inspired by findings from optogenetic stimulation in mice, we hypothesized that STN-DBS can mimic dopaminergic reinforcement of ongoing movement kinematics during stimulation. To investigate this hypothesis, we delivered DBS bursts during particularly fast and slow movements in 24 patients with PD. Our findings reveal that DBS during fast movements enhanced future movement speed more than DBS during slow movements, raising movement speed to the level of healthy controls. To understand which brain circuits mediate this neurophysiological mechanism, we investigated the behavioral effects using magnetic resonance imaging connectomics and motor cortex electrocorticography. Last, we demonstrate that machine learning–based brain signal decoding can be used to predict continuous movement speed for fully embedded state-dependent closed-loop algorithms.

Here, we found that the rib structure of a cicada’s tymbal exhibits exceptional toughness and fatigue resistance, attributed to its unique architecture composed of alternating soft and stiff polymer layers. Inspired by this rib structure, we developed a robust artificial rib film (ARF) using a nanoconfined crystallization strategy that involves the deposition of soft polyethylene oxide and stiff phenol formaldehyde. The ARF demonstrates a toughness amplification factor twice that of the cicada’s tymbal rib and exhibits an exceptionally long fatigue life. The nanoconfined crystallization restricts molecular motion and disperses external forces within the crystalline structure, thereby enhancing its mechanical properties.

However, MJO’s contribution to ENSO evolution has been difficult to quantify. Here, using an ensemble hindcast approach specifically designed to isolate internal atmospheric variability, we evaluate the influences of March MJO on subsequent ENSO development. Our results show that the March MJO, under favorable background conditions, by itself has limited impacts on ENSO due to weak equatorial air-sea coupling in spring. In comparison, the North Pacific Oscillation–induced meridional mode exerts a more sustained influence on ENSO evolution. A cyclonic circulation anomaly over Hawaii, associated with the Pacific-North American pattern, also plays a role.

Seventy percent of providers prescribed antibiotics without indication of bacterial infection. Knowledge gaps explain little: 62% of providers who knew antibiotics were inappropriate still prescribed them. Closing this “know-do gap” would reduce prescribing by 30 percentage points, versus only 6 points if all providers had perfect knowledge.

It is therefore crucial to determine some of the key locally-derived, plural priorities and benefits of restoration. In this study, we investigated how communities conceptualize the priorities and benefits of restoration by conducting in-depth participatory mapping workshops with two Indigenous communities, two Afro-descendant (Quilombola) communities, and two agrarian-reform settlements in the Atlantic Forest of Brazil–a top global priority biome for restoration. Through transdisciplinary mapmaking exercises on conceptions of restoration, we assembled five primary themes on the plural ways that communities have reappropriated the concept of restoration and created alternatives to how restoration has been commonly represented by larger-scale actors. These include: asserting territorial sovereignty and defending claims to lands; Bem Viver (living well); contesting dominant narratives about monoculture, capitalism, and land speculation; caring for ancestors, animals, and other living things, and fulfilling spiritual and cultural responsibilities; and realizing dreams and visions for desired futures. By broadening conceptualizations of the priorities and benefits of restoration, our study diverges from past research on restoration and emphasizes the importance of expanding beyond narrow definitions of restoration. We highlight the critical role of communities in the restoration process and the importance of conducting direct work with affected communities to inform the way restoration is understood, discussed, and practiced. This research may support action towards a restoration future that is both effective and equitable."

But the variation of canopy temperature and its relationship with air temperature across a range of ecosystems and environmental conditions is understudied, challenging our ability to predict canopy temperature responses in a rapidly warming climate. Therefore, to better understand how environmental drivers and site characteristics interact with vegetation types to influence these temperature dynamics, we analyzed canopy temperature estimates derived from upwelling longwave radiation measurements across seven years and 36 NEON (National Ecological Observatory Network) sites in the USA. Canopy temperature consistently exceeded or closely tracked air temperature, with the strength and magnitude of this relationship varying by vegetation type. Multiple linear regression analysis confirmed incoming shortwave radiation as the dominant driver of ΔT (canopy temperature—air temperature). While this driver was consistently important across all sites, sites within the same vegetation type tended to respond similarly to the full set of environmental drivers. Vegetation height was associated with variation in the magnitude of ΔT. These findings support the use of vegetation type groupings to capture generalizable patterns in canopy temperature dynamics, patterns that are critical for understanding ecosystem responses under future climate scenarios."

However, reliable CDR is still costly and comes with considerable technological and ecological uncertainties. Despite the centrality of equity in the Paris Agreement, no integrated framework exists to equitably allocate responsibilities for CDR and residual emissions among countries. Here, we present a justice-based framework that separates out ethical considerations for equitably allocating gross emissions and gross CDR, addressing how these contributions shift before and after reaching global net-zero CO2 emissions. The framework distinguishes between CDR delivered as a common good to reach a collective global climate outcome, and CDR that is used to pay off carbon debts due to emissions overconsumption. We offer a new perspective for how nations with substantial historical responsibilities and emerging economies with increasing capacities can collaborate and equitably share the CDR burden, enhancing both international cooperation and national-level climate action."

This study evaluates the integration of photovoltaic (PV) technology into China’s extensive railway network and reveals that suitable areas on rails could potentially generate 204.6 TWh of electricity annually, equivalent to more than twice of the Three Gorges Power Station’s output, and accounting for approximately 9.2% of China’s total renewable electricity generation in 2020 (2,214.8 TWh).

Among 371 cities analyzed, 291 (78.4%) are expected to reach a production-side grid parity, while all cities would achieve user-side grid parity. The implementation of this PV system could significantly mitigate environmental impacts, reducing carbon emissions by 126.5 Mt and lowering air pollutants, including 64 199 tons of NOX, 44 423 tons of SO2, and 7789 tons of PMX. Substantial railways in rural regions can optimize the energy consumption structure of rural residents, reducing the share of coal and liquefied petroleum gas in per capita energy consumption from 29.44% to 7.27%, and leading their average annual expenditure on primary energy sources dropping from CNY667.9 to CNY502.7—a 24.23% reduction."

These changes are critical in the Arctic where the effects of sea level rise are exacerbated by the loss of sea ice protecting coasts, subsidence as permafrost thaws, and a projected increase in storms. Such changes will likely alter the land-atmosphere gas exchange of high-latitude coastal ecosystems, but the effects of flooding with warming remain unexplored. In this work we use a field experiment to examine the interacting effects of increased tidal flooding and warming on land-atmosphere CO2 and CH4 exchange in the coastal Yukon–Kuskokwim Delta, a large sub-Arctic wetland and tundra complex in western Alaska. We inundated dammed plots to simulate two levels of future flooding: low-intensity flooding represented by one day of flooding per summer-month (June, July and August), and high-intensity flooding represented by three-consecutive days of flooding per summer-month, crossed with a warming treatment of 1.4 °C. We found that both flooding and warming influenced greenhouse gas (GHG) exchange. Low-intensity flooding reduced net CO2 uptake by 20% (0.78 µmol m−2 s−1) regardless of temperature, and marginally increased CH4 emissions 0.83 nmol m−2 s−1 (33%) under ambient temperature, while decreasing CH4 emissions by −1.96 nmol m−2 s−1 (40%) under warming. In contrast, high-intensity flooding restored net CO2 uptake to control levels due to enhanced primary productivity under both temperature treatments. High-intensity flooding decreased CH4 emissions under ambient temperature by 0.76 nmol m−2 s−1 (30%), but greatly increased emissions under warming by 4.68 nmol m−2 s−1 (265%), presumably driven by increased plant-mediated CH4 transport. These findings reveal that GHG exchange responds rapidly and non-linearly to intensifying flooding, and highlight the importance of short-term flooding dynamics and warming in shaping future carbon cycling in this Arctic coastal wetland."

To quantify this emissions impact, prior work typically employs short-run marginal emissions or average emissions rates calculated from historical data or power systems models that do not consider changes in installed capacity. In this work, we use an electricity system capacity expansion model to consider the full consequential GHG emissions impact from large-scale EV adoption in the western United States, accounting for induced changes in generation and storage capacity. We find that the metrics described above do not accurately reflect the true emissions impact of EV adoption–average emissions rates can either under- or over-estimate emission impacts, and short-run marginal emissions rates can significantly underestimate emission reductions, especially when charging timing is flexible. Our results also show that using short-run marginal emission rates as signals to coordinate EV charging could increase emissions relative to price-based charging signals, indicating the need for alternative control strategies to minimize consequential emissions."

In this study, we present a univariate machine learning framework using long short term memory networks that forecasts daily-averaged SLA with a 3 d lead time over the north Indian Ocean using historical satellite altimetry data at a spatial resolution of ∼13 km. Assuming that SLA reanalysis from state-of-the-art systems represent the pinnacle of performance skill of forecasts from dynamical models, we show that the SLA forecasts from our model exhibits superior skills through comprehensive analyses. The errors are typically less than 0.04 m over most of the domain and the correlations are close to unity. The skills of the daily-averaged forecasted currents with a 3 d lead, estimated using geostrophic and Ekman theory, are comparable with the best available reanalysis when compared to in-situ observations both in the open ocean or shelf. Treating these forecasted surface currents as synthetic observations, we show that assimilating them can significantly improve the instantaneous subsurface currents during forecasts. The subsurface correlations turn significant with 99% confidence level across depth which were otherwise mostly insignificant and the errors reduce by 0.1 m·s−1. We demonstrate that the short-term forecast of daily-averaged SLA and surface currents can be approached as a collection of localized low-dimensional independent univariate systems thereby reducing computational costs by large margins.

South Korea faces this issue, particularly owing to a rise in the nation’s average age at an unprecedented rate and a significantly low total fertility rate (TFR) (0.72 in 2023). Research on measures to reduce GHG emissions in an aging society with a declining birthrate has highlighted the importance of the structure of household carbon footprint (HCF) across different age groups. However, no studies have analyzed the structure of HCF across different age groups or the impact of demographic changes on HCF in South Korea. This study highlights the structures of HCF by age group in South Korea by combining a multi-regional input–output model with household and demographic surveys. Furthermore, we projected the effects of demographic changes in line with business-as-usual and an ambitious government policy for recovering the TFR (BaU and fertility rate recovery (FRR) Scenarios, respectively) on HCF from 2020 to 2050. These procedures revealed that the FRR will increase in 13.5 Mt-CO2eq in 2050, compared to BaU. This brings the HCF of senior generations (60 years and older) from 49.7% (BaU) to 48.3% (FRR) of the total HCF in 2050, slightly reducing their dominance of HCF. With the fertility recovery policy, the impact of an increase in the HCF of younger generations, aged 39 years and below, was limited until 2050. However, the rebound of HCF (e.g. education, entertainment and culture, restaurants, and hotels) must be considered in case the number of younger generations continues to increase, underlying national policies for fertility recovery."

We found rapid cooling of the atmosphere and shifts in cloud cover and atmospheric circulation patterns like land–sea circulation. Our research helps to better understand cloud adjustments, which are a major source of uncertainty in climate models. This can improve future climate predictions. 
 “Radiative” or “rapid” adjustments refer to the response of the climate system to an instantaneous radiative forcing, independent of surface temperature changes. These adjustments occur over timescales from hours (e.g. aerosol–cloud interactions) to months (e.g. stratospheric temperature changes), often overlapping with feedback mechanisms – making their separation in realistic scenarios challenging. Controlled simulation experiments can thus help isolate adjustment processes and improve understanding relevant to more complex cases like volcanic eruptions or ongoing climate change.The abrupt-solm4p experiment of the Cloud Feedback Model Intercomparison Project (CFMIP), part of the 6th Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6), simulates an instantaneous 4 % reduction in the solar constant from a pre-industrial state on 1 January 1850. This study analyses changes in climate variables, cloud properties, and radiative fluxes across different timescales (hours, days, months and up to 150 years) to identify adjustment mechanisms and characteristic fingerprints for a shortwave forcing scenario.The four participating models show rapid adjustments of 3.57±0.46Wm-2, offsetting ∼ 35 % of the initial forcing. Distinct local patterns include initial rapid surface cooling – especially over Antarctica and the Southern Hemisphere. Stratospheric cooling slows the polar night jet, disrupts the polar vortex, and increases Arctic cloud cover, causing local warming. Within the first month, the troposphere cools more quickly than the ocean surface, decreasing vertical stability and enhancing cloud cover over oceans, while tropical land regions show the opposite change. On monthly timescales, high clouds shift downward due to reduced convective heating."

Allen,The biogeophysical effects of carbon fertilization of the terrestrial biosphere,"Climate models are analyzed to quantify the biogeophysical and biogeochemical effects of carbon fertilization at the time of atmospheric carbon dioxide quadrupling under both a preindustrial and a warmer background climate.  The biogeophysical effects lead to relatively weak warming largely due to reduced canopy transpiration.  Biogeochemical cooling associated with enhanced land carbon storage dominates.  Similar results are obtained under both background climates but with some nuances. 
 The climate impacts of carbon fertilization of the terrestrial biosphere include cooling associated with the biogeochemical effects of enhanced land carbon storage, whereas the non-carbon-cycle biogeophysical effects associated with changes in surface energy and turbulent heat fluxes may warm or cool the climate system. Both of these effects may be dependent on the background climate. Here, I analyze state-of-the-art CMIP6 Earth system models that conducted simulations driven by 1 % yr−1 increases in atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentration that isolate the carbon fertilization effect (i.e., CO2 radiative effects are not active) relative to a preindustrial background climate. At the time of CO2 quadrupling, the biogeophysical effects yield multimodel global mean near-surface warming of 0.16±0.09 K, with 13 of the 15 models yielding warming. Using a Surface Energy Balance decomposition, most of this warming is associated with decreases in surface latent heat flux associated with reduced canopy transpiration. Decreases in surface albedo and increases in downwelling shortwave and longwave radiation – both of which are modulated by cloud reductions – are also associated with the warming. Overall, however, the biogeophysical warming is about an order of magnitude smaller than the corresponding cooling associated with enhanced land carbon storage at −1.38 K (−1.92 to −0.84 K). Simulations that isolate the carbon fertilization effect relative to a warmer, higher CO2 background climate yield similar overall results. However, some nuances exist including stronger biogeophysical warming of the extratropics and weaker but nonsignificant biogeophysical warming of the tropics."

 Ocean biogeochemical models are essential for advancing our understanding of oceanographic processes. Here, we present the Offline Fennel model, a biogeochemical model that relies on previously computed physical fields, within the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS). We evaluated the model performance against a fully coupled physical–biogeochemical online application in the northern Gulf of Mexico, a region with intense biogeochemical activity, including rather frequent hypoxia events. By leveraging physical hydrodynamic outputs, we ran the Offline Fennel model using various time-step multiples from the coupled configuration, significantly enhancing computational efficiency and reducing simulation computational time by up to 87 %. The accuracy of the offline model was assessed using three different mixing schemes: the generic length scale (GLS), Large–McWilliams–Doney (LMD), and Mellor and Yamada 2.5 (MY25). The offline model achieved an average skill score of 93 %, with minimal impact on performance from the time-step choice. While the GLS configuration yielded the highest accuracy, all three mixing schemes performed well. Although some discrepancies appeared between offline and coupled simulation outputs, these were smaller than those observed when using different mixing schemes within the same model configuration. A significant challenge identified was the simulation of ammonium (NH4), which exhibited the largest discrepancies due to its rapid-turnover timescale compared to other tracers. The promising results achieved so far validate the Offline Fennel model's capability and efficiency, thus offering a powerful tool for researchers aiming to conduct extensive biogeochemical simulations without rerunning the hydrodynamic component, thus significantly reducing computational demands."

Our analysis revealed hundreds of genotoxic compounds, with condensed aromatic amines predominating in number, abundance, and contribution to overall genotoxicity. Notably, norharman, a heterocyclic aromatic amine, was identified as a key carcinogenic component. Genotoxicity analysis using a lung cell exposure model indicated that, based on the measured concentration ratio of norharman to benzo[a]pyrene in DOM, the genotoxicity of norharman was approximately 0.21 to 0.6 times that of benzo[a]pyrene. Compared to proinflammatory compounds, these carcinogenic compounds exhibited greater unsaturation, increased aromaticity, an augmented reduced state, and the presence of nitrogenous organic matter. Two-ring aromatic amines containing two nitrogen atoms were identified as key contributors to both inflammation and genotoxicity. Regional source apportionment revealed significant regional variability in condensed aromatic amines within PM2.5. While polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are significant, condensed aromatic amines also warrant consideration in PM2.5 management.

This study quantified the occurrence and estimated worker exposure based on settled dust concentrations of PPDs and  their quinone derivatives (PPD-Qs) in two representative rubber manufacturing sectors, i.e., tire and seal factories, and the surrounding areas. Results showed that median concentrations of ∑PPDs (114 μg/g) and ∑PPD-Qs (354 μg/g) in indoor workshops far exceeded the levels in industrial park road dust (∑PPDs: 1.84 μg/g; ∑PPD-Qs: 0.410 μg/g) and surrounding road dust (∑PPDs: 219 ng/g; ∑PPD-Qs: 217 ng/g) in tire rubber factories. In addition, PPD and PPD-Q concentrations exhibited interfactory disparities (tire factories exceeding seal factories by 397-fold and 227-fold, respectively) and intrafactory variations (peaking in high-temperature/abrasion workshops), highlighting the necessity for targeted ventilation and protection. Distribution patterns differed by facility type, with concentrations halving within 0.3 km of plant boundaries.

In the context of global warming and humidification, it remains to be clarified whether coastal exposure to TC‐induced precipitation has a detectable response. Based on multi‐source data sets in the past four decades, this study investigates the coastward trends of global TC‐induced precipitation changes. We find that the TC lifetime maximum precipitation intensities show a statistically significant landward migration, moving about 30 km per decade. Furthermore, the precipitation intensities of TCs exhibit faster growth in coastal areas, with a concurrent rapid expansion of the land coverage of TC‐induced precipitation. A consistent pattern of change is demonstrated between intensifying TC‐induced precipitation and the warming‐humidifying ambient environment, with higher significance in coastal areas.

 A multidimensional social exposome (MSE)—the combined lifespan measures of education, food insecurity, financial status, access to healthcare, childhood experiences, and more—may shape dementia risk and brain health over the lifespan, particularly in underserved regions like Latin America. However, the MSE effects on brain health and dementia are unknown. We evaluated 2211 individuals (controls, Alzheimer’s disease, and frontotemporal lobar degeneration) from a non-representative sample across six Latin American countries. Adverse exposomes associate with poorer cognition in healthy aging. In dementia, more complex exposomes correlate with lower cognitive and functional performance, higher neuropsychiatric symptoms, and brain structural and connectivity alterations in frontal-temporal-limbic and cerebellar regions. Food insecurity, financial resources, subjective socioeconomic status, and access to healthcare emerge as critical predictors. Cumulative exposome measures surpass isolated factors in predicting clinical-cognitive profiles. Multiple sensitivity analyses confirm our results. Findings highlight the need for personalized approaches integrating MSE across the lifespan, emphasizing prevention and interventions targeting social disparities.

 Precise control of covalent protein binding and cleavage in mammalian cells is crucial for manipulating cellular processes but remains challenging due to dark background, poor stability, low efficiency, or requirement of unnatural amino acids in current optogenetic tools. We introduce a photoswitchable intein (PS Intein) engineered by allosterically modulating a small autocatalytic gp41-1 intein with tandem Vivid photoreceptor. PS Intein exhibits superior functionality and low background in cells compared to existing tools. PS Intein-based systems enable light-induced covalent binding, cleavage, and release of proteins for regulating gene expression and cell fate. The high responsiveness and ability to integrate multiple inputs allow for intersectional cell targeting using cancer- and tumor microenvironment-specific promoters. PS Intein tolerates various fusions and insertions, facilitating its application in diverse cellular contexts. This versatile technology offers efficient light-controlled protein manipulation, providing a powerful tool for adding functionalities to proteins and precisely controlling protein networks in living cells.

Here the authors show that when often-neglected land–atmosphere feedbacks are considered, evapotranspiration increases less than currently projected by offline models. 
 Accurate projections of evapotranspiration (ET) are crucial for understanding hydrological responses to climate warming, which remain highly uncertain because of complex land–atmosphere interactions. Here we develop a theoretical framework to disentangle these interactions, achieving highly consistent ET projections between offline and coupled models. Our findings show that previous estimates of climate-driven ET increases have been exaggerated, primarily due to a substantial overestimation of atmospheric evaporative demand. Notably, the atmospheric conditions often assumed to drive ET are, in fact, responses to ET changes induced by soil moisture and vegetation dynamics. Neglecting these land–atmosphere feedbacks has led to a 25–39% overestimation of climate-driven global ET increases and a 77–121% exaggeration of the negative contribution from land surface changes. These biases have caused large discrepancies in hydrological projections and attributions between offline and coupled models, underscoring the importance of accurately representing land–atmosphere interactions to improve the reliability and consistency of future hydrological projections.

 The VIIRS was designed in recognition of the need for long-term observations in support of global-change science and to provide MODIS observation continuity. The NASA MODIS burned area (BA) product (MCD64A1) has been generated systematically for nearly 25 years and maps globally the approximate day of burning at 500-m resolution. We describe the follow-on NASA Collection 2 VIIRS BA product (VNP64A1) that became available in October 2024 and provides global BA mapping from 2012 into the next decade. The product is derived using an adaptation of the Collection 6.1 MCD64A1 BA mapping algorithm and using the same sinusoidal grid and 500-m reporting resolution. Annual and monthly intercomparisons of the VPN64A1 and MCD64A1 products at global and continental/regional scales indicate high product BA reporting consistency. Approximately 2.6 % of the land surface was mapped as burned annually; VNP64A1 mapped slightly more than MCD64A1 but with 0-day median burn-date reporting differences. A global (Stage-3) product validation, using 561 interpreted Landsat image pairs, was undertaken and the VNP64A1 product had estimated 36.7 % commission and 72.4 % omission errors, compared to MCD64A1 34.2 % commission and 71.5 % omission errors. Product accuracies were also characterized using metrics derived from the weighted regression (to incorporate sample inclusion probabilities) between 5-km BA proportions in the products and the Landsat data. The omission and commission errors observed at 30-m were largely compensated at 5-km, with coefficient of determination (0.70), slope (0.83), and intercept (−0.0006) terms for the VNP64A1 product nearly identical to those of MCD64A1. With respect to global temporal reporting accuracy, 38 % of VNP64A1 burned grid cells had burn dates that matched the date of a MODIS active fire, versus 46 % for MCD64A1, and 71 % of VNP64A1 burned grid cells had burn dates within two days (72 % for MCD64A1). The research presented in this paper indicates that the VNP64A1 product is suitable for providing continuity of the MODIS BA record."

 Models to simulate solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) are widely used to interpret fluorescence observations across scales. However, leaf fluorescence spectra models often mix-use the plate model and Kubelka-Munk (KM) model, which differ in their assumptions in the internal scattering within a leaf and brings in uncertainty in explaining SIF observations. Additionally, fluorescence photons are not conserved in spectral models due to their use of a sigmoid function to adjust the fluorescence emission spectrum dependent on excitation wavelength. To resolve these problems in SIF simulation, we present a new spectral model, Platespect. It is based on the plate model that can compute backward and forward leaf fluorescence spectra and also rescales the raw fluorescence emission spectrum to conserve fluorescence photons. We theoretically compared the fluorescence simulations from Platespect and Fluspect, which adopts the commonly used KM model, at the leaf and canopy scales; we also evaluated them with leaf-level backward fluorescence observations. At the leaf level, although Platespect predicted fluorescence magnitudes similar to those of Fluspect, it showed substantial differences in the backward and forward fluorescence spectra. Accounting for scattering among leaf plates in Fluspect helps reduce the difference. Platespect predicted a higher far-red fluorescence due to the rescaled fluorescence spectra emitted by longer wavelength light. When fitted against leaf-level observations, Platespect performed slightly better in the red fluorescence region, but all models showed a systematically biased fluorescence spectrum. Assessed at the canopy level, Platespect-based simulations predicted a higher SIF and higher sensitivity to leaf chlorophyll content. Our results highlight the necessity of better representing the scattering among plates, improving the raw fluorescence emission spectrum, and conserving emitted fluorescence photons to improve the simulation of SIF across scales."

 The growing availability of medium-resolution optical and radar satellite observations has prompted the development of synergistic change detection methodologies. Timely forest change detection, particularly early deforestation, is crucial for preventing illegal activities. This study proposes and evaluates an innovative model that integrates ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 L-band data with optical data from Landsat and Sentinel-2 to detect early deforestation, defined as the initial transition from stable to logged forest. Our model employs a 2-tier approach, combining harmonic curve fitting and z-scores to calculate differences between the time series. Bayesian updating statistics are then used to derive change probabilities. We comprehensively assessed the spatial and temporal detection accuracy of early deforestation maps generated by each sensor type, both individually and in combination. The integrated L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical method demonstrated the best performance, achieving a user’s accuracy of 99.19 ± 0.0081% (± 95 confidence interval) and a mean detection time lag of just 16 days. For comparison, L-band SAR data alone yielded a user’s accuracy of 93.70% (± 0.0333) with a mean time lag of 67 days, primarily due to ALOS-2’s lower repeat frequency. Optical-derived detections achieved a user’s accuracy of 98.39% (± 0.0113) and a mean time lag of 20 days. These findings confirm that combining radar and optical datasets significantly improves both detection accuracy and timeliness. Furthermore, detections were consistently captured shortly after logging activities, well before subsequent forest disturbances, underscoring true early deforestation. The high detection accuracies validate that both individual and combined L-band SAR and optical data can reliably detect early deforestation in this tropical region. We anticipate that the longer detection time lags observed with ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 will substantially improve with upcoming L-band SAR missions, such as NISAR and ALOS-4 PALSAR-3, which promise significantly enhanced global temporal sampling."

 In recent years, the frequency and intensity of compound high-temperature drought events have significantly increased on a global scale, posing severe challenges to agricultural production and ecological environments. To elucidate the spatiotemporal variation patterns of such extreme events and enhance prediction accuracy, this study systematically analyzed the distribution patterns and evolutionary trends of terrestrial high-temperature drought events based on the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) and Standardized Temperature Index (STI), utilizing global multi-source observational data from 1980 to 2022. The results indicate that regions such as Brazil, West Africa, the Arabian Desert, South Asia, and Mexico exhibit particularly prominent high-temperature trends, while precipitation significantly decreases in parts of South America, South Asia, Libya, western United States, eastern Canada, and southwestern China. Additionally, the recurrence intervals of high-temperature droughts in Venezuela, Brazil, northern Russia, Iran, and southwestern China have markedly shortened. To further improve prediction accuracy, this study employed wavelet transforms in combination with three deep learning methods—Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Long Short-Term Memory Network (LSTM)—to develop multi-scale predictive models for SPI and STI. The results demonstrate that all three models achieved coefficients of determination (R2) exceeding 0.98 for SPI and STI predictions, with mean absolute errors (MAE) below 0.036 and 0.07, root mean squared errors (RMSE) below 0.09 and 0.05, respectively, indicating high reliability in extreme event prediction. Forecasts for 2019–2026 suggest that the frequency and intensity of compound high-temperature drought events will generally continue to rise, providing critical references for subsequent climate risk assessments and agricultural disaster prevention and control."

 Accurate registration of optical and synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images is critical for effective fusion in remote sensing applications. To address the significant radiometric and geometric differences between these modalities, SMAF-Net, a novel network that integrates semantics-guided modality transfer and hierarchical feature fusion for optical-SAR image registration, is proposed. For modality transfer, a feature-constrained generative adversarial module (SGMT) is used to translate SAR to pseudo-optical images. By incorporating deep features from a multiscale feature learning module (MFLM) as semantic constraints, the translated images preserve structural details and reduce modality discrepancies. For feature matching, a channel attention-based hierarchical aggregation module (CA-HAM) is designed to effectively fuse multi-level features. Combined with a joint detection-description strategy, the network enables accurate keypoint detection and descriptor extraction. Experiments on optical-SAR datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average registration error of 2.26 pixels, outperforming state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods and enabling accurate registration between optical and SAR images."

 This study utilized the Thunderstorm Feature Dataset (TFD), combined with the sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the NINO3.4 region (ENSO index) from the NOAA/ERSSTv5 dataset and ERA5 reanalysis data, to investigate the response of thunderstorm activity in East Asia and the Western Pacific region to ENSO events, an aspect that has been seldom addressed in previous studies. Results indicate ENSO events as the primary factors influencing the interannual variation of thunderstorm activity in the study area, with thunderstorm activity anomalies negatively correlated with the ENSO index, lagging by approximately 3 months. Regionally, thunderstorm activity anomalies and the ENSO index show a strong positive correlation in areas north of 20°N, encompassing Southeastern China land and adjacent sea area, but a negative correlation in areas south of 20°N, including the South China Sea, the Philippine Islands, and parts of the Western Pacific. Thunderstorm activity anomalies in these areas all lag the ENSO index by 1–3 months. The response of thunderstorm activity to ENSO events demonstrates a strong correlation with anomalies in convective parameters such as convective available potential energy (CAPE), K index, the mid-level (700–400 hPa) averaged relative humidity, and 500 hPa vertical velocity. During El Niño, warm SST in the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, along with enhanced upward motion, leads to anomalous downward motion and anticyclonic circulation in the Western Pacific region within the study area, resulting in a decrease in thunderstorm activity. Concurrently, the anomalous anticyclonic circulation in the Western Pacific region enhances the warm, moist southwest winds, which transport more water vapor to Southeastern China, thereby increasing thunderstorm activity. Conversely, during La Niña, the anomalous cyclonic circulation and moisture convergence in the Western Pacific region result in an increase in thunderstorm activity in the Western Pacific region within the study area. Additionally, the anomalous cyclonic circulation leads to a weakening of the warm and moist southwest winds and upward motion in the Southeastern China land area, consequently reducing thunderstorm activity."

To date, the notion that interspecific genetic exchange (introgression) occurs more frequently between plant species than animals has gained a strong footing in scientific discourse. By examining the dynamics of gene flow across a continuum of divergence in both kingdoms, we observed the opposite relationship: Plants experience less introgression than animals at the same level of genetic divergence, suggesting that species barriers are established more rapidly in plants. This pattern raises questions about which differences in microevolutionary processes between plants and animals influence the dynamics of reproductive isolation establishment at the macroevolutionary scale."

We found that 79% of endemic species are in decline, starting after the arrival of humans approximately 3000 years ago and accelerating in the past 300 years, whereas recent arrivals are expanding. The primary correlate of population decline among endemic species was found to be sensitivity to habitat disturbance.

However, depending on the regulated promoter identity, TF function can vary, and the principles underlying this context dependence remain unclear. We demonstrate an inverse scaling relationship between the promoter’s basal activity and its regulation by a given TF. Specifically, activation is weaker and repression is stronger on stronger promoters. This scaling applies to both activators and repressors, which suggests a common underlying mechanism where TFs regulate expression by stabilizing RNAP binding at the promoter. The consequence of this relationship is that TFs buffer expression by affecting constant regulated expression levels across promoters of different basal activity, ensuring homeostatic control despite genetic or environmental changes."

Although the role of oxytocin signaling in parental care has been widely investigated, little is known about its function in social behavior during early life. We studied the role of oxytocin in mouse pup social behavior during acute separation from the mother as well as upon reunion. The activity of oxytocin neurons was increased by acute maternal separation. Behaviorally, maternally separated pups emitted more ultrasonic vocalizations upon reunion, which were further modulated by nipple attachment behavior. These effects were attenuated by blocking the oxytocin receptor during maternal separation.

This classic circuit has inspired current thinking on hippocampal functions related to learning, memory, and spatial navigation, but the potential functional contributions of other hippocampal areas, such as CA2, the fasciola cinereum, and the indusium griseum, and their integration of a major hypothalamic input, have been overlooked.

Including SIP improves agreement with in situ aircraft observations (ice crystal number concentration and supercooled drop number fraction), generates small ice crystals, and redistributes condensed water mass toward smaller particle sizes. As these crystals melt, the liquid precipitation flux decreases, reducing total precipitation by 8 % and heavy rainfall by 20 %. 
 A significant part of precipitation originates from ice crystals; however, the representation of mixed-phase clouds by atmospheric models remains a challenging task. One well-known problem is the discrepancy between the concentration of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) and the ice crystal number concentration. This study explores the effect of secondary ice production (SIP) on the properties of the Intensive Observation Period 7a (IOP7a), an intense-precipitation event observed during the  HYdrological Cycle in the Mediterranean EXperiment (HYMEX) campaign. The effect of SIP on cloud and rain properties is assessed by turning  SIP mechanisms in the DEtailed SCAvenging and Microphysics (DESCAM)  3D bin microphysics scheme on or off. Our results indicate that including SIP gives better agreement with in situ aircraft observations in terms of ice crystal number concentration and supercooled drop number fraction. During the mature cloud stage and for temperatures warmer than −30 °C, 59 % of ice crystals are produced by fragmentation due to ice–ice collisions, 38 % by the Hallett–Mossop process, 2 % by fragmentation of freezing drops, and only 1 % by heterogeneous ice nucleation. Furthermore, our results show that the production of small ice crystals by SIP induces a redistribution of the condensed water mass toward particles smaller than 3 mm rather than toward larger ones. As ice crystals melt, this effect is also visible in the precipitating liquid phase. The shift toward smaller particles results in a reduced precipitation flux of both ice crystals and drops. Consequently, SIP induces a decrease in accumulated precipitation at the surface by 8 % and reduces heavy rainfall exceeding 40 mm by 20 %."

 A novel disaggregation algorithm for commercial microwave links (CMLs), named CLEAR (CML Segments with Equal Amounts of Rain), is proposed. CLEAR utilizes a multiplicative random cascade generator to control the splitting of link segments, with the generator's standard deviation dependent on the rain rate and segment length. Spatial consistency during the splitting process is maintained using rain rate information from neighboring CMLs. CLEAR is evaluated on a network of 77 CMLs in Prague. The performance is assessed first using simulated rainfall fields and second through a case study with real attenuation data from the network to demonstrate its applicability in real-world scenarios. Results from the virtual rainfall fields indicate good overall performance, including the generation of realistic spatial patterns and effective estimation of maximal and minimal rain rates along CML paths. The stochastic nature of CLEAR allows it to represent uncertainty as an ensemble of rain rate distributions along CML paths. However, the generated ensembles significantly underestimate overall variability along the paths. Additionally, the case study on real data highlights challenges associated with uncertainties in CML quantitative precipitation estimates, which are common across all methods. In conclusion, CLEAR contributes to generating more representative rainfall distributions along CMLs, which is critical for spatial reconstruction of rainfall fields from path-integrated CML data. It also has the potential to reduce errors in CML quantitative precipitation estimates caused by assuming uniform rain rates along CML paths."

A SeaExplorer glider has been deployed to supplement the data obtained during a series of oceanographic surveys. The glider performed a continuous monitoring over 30 months of the water column from the sea surface to 1250 m water depth, with the objective of acquiring the hydrological properties, water currents and dissolved gas concentrations. 
 In May 2018, an unprecedented long and intense seismo-volcanic crisis broke out off the island of Mayotte (Indian Ocean) and was associated with the birth of an underwater volcano (Fani Maoré). Since then, an integrated observation network has been created (REVOSIMA), with the objective of monitoring and better understanding underwater volcanic phenomena. Recently, an autonomous ocean glider (ALSEAMAR's SeaExplorer) was deployed to supplement the data obtained during a series of oceanographic surveys (MAYOBS) carried out on an annual basis. Operated by ALSEAMAR in collaboration with IFREMER, the glider performed a continuous monitoring of the water column, from the sea surface to 1250 m water depth, over 30 months between September 2021 and April 2024 with the objective of acquiring hydrological properties, water currents and dissolved gas concentrations. This monitoring showed the feasibility and value of measuring autonomously, continuously and at a high spatio-temporal scale the physical (temperature, salinity, ocean current) and biogeochemical parameters (O2, CH4, CO2, bubbles/droplets, vertical speed anomalies related to droplets) over several months using a glider. In particular, innovating sensing capabilities (e.g. MINICO2, acoustic Doppler current profiler (ADCP)) have shown great potential in the context of the Mayotte seismo-volcanic crisis despite technical challenges (complex algorithms, sensor capabilities, etc.).

It is derived from the geostrophic linear vorticity balance, combining in situ and satellite, meridional velocities and wind stress. Comparisons with reanalysis and observation-based products show that OLIV3 captures the large-scale vertical flow, its climatology, and temporal variability, providing a better description of the ocean interior than Ekman pumping. 
 Vertical velocities at large scales are crucial for understanding ocean dynamics, influencing large-scale circulation and associated biochemical processes, yet their rationale is poorly understood, and their three-dimensional distribution is almost unknown. This paper introduces OLIV3 (Observation-based LInear Vorticity Vertical Velocities), a novel observation-based estimation product of vertical velocities over the global thermocline. This product relies on the geostrophic linear vorticity balance (LVB) applied to ARMOR3D observation-based meridional velocities with ERA5 Ekman pumping vertical velocity as surface boundary condition. It covers the entire water column, with 1/4° horizontal resolution at annual frequency during the 1993 – 2019 period, available on both depth and isopycnal levels. Since the geostrophic LVB-derived vertical velocities only capture the geostrophic component of the vertical velocity, their performance is tested using an OGCM numerical model data against the total vertical flow. In the upper ocean, the LVB accurately reproduces the annual variability and captures the climatology of the large-scale total vertical flow (for scales larger than 5° horizontal resolution) with errors below 50 % across the major ocean gyres. OLIV3 capability to estimate vertical velocities in different ocean circulation regimes is assessed against three reference datasets: two reanalysis-based and one observation-based product. A strong spatial and temporal correlation is evidenced between OLIV3 and reanalysis datasets, in contrast to the observation-based product, demonstrating even higher correlation than within themselves and proving that while the geostrophic components of the reanalyses are highly correlated, the ageostrophic part is not. OLIV3 also reconstructs a baroclinic vertical velocity field, consistent with the basin oceanographic concept of Sverdrup balance theory. Regarding one of the most common applications of vertical velocities, the transfers between the surface and thermocline, results from an OGCM simulation show that the baroclinic geostrophic vertical velocity is a better estimator of the temporal variability of the vertical flow in the ocean interior than Ekman pumping, and it is essential to consider the variability of the horizontal transport. The OLIV3 dataset developed in this study is available on 50 vertical levels (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16981061; Cortés-Morales and Lazar, 2025a) and 71 isopycnal levels (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16962780; Cortés-Morales and Lazar, 2025b)."

Data quality is significantly improved through integration. The integrated dataset is now publicly available for easy access and use by the academic community and the public. These datasets are of great significance for optimizing historical geomagnetic field models and investigating changing magnetic fields, the main geomagnetic field. 
 Decades to centuries of continuous geomagnetic observation data have extensive scientific research and practical application value, especially in revealing the long-term variation of the geomagnetic field, which is irreplaceable. During the International Geophysical Year (1957–1958), China established geomagnetic observatories in Beijing, Lhasa, Lanzhou, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Changchun, and Ürümqi, forming the initial structure of China's geomagnetic observation network together with the Shanghai Observatory. These observatories have continuously been in operation despite facing many challenges since their establishment, accumulating a large amount of valuable observational data, making significant contributions to the progress of geomagnetic scientific research and development. However, the scattered storage state of these historical data and the potential risk of damage pose a threat to the integrity and reliability of the data. This study conducted a rescue integration of the historical observational data from eight pioneering geomagnetic observatories in China, significantly improving data quality and facilitating long-term preservation and use of the data. This article introduces the basic conditions of eight observatories, including their locations, changes in location, observation environments, magnetic rooms, the magnetism of building materials, the layout of building facilities, measuring instruments, etc. These are the main prerequisites and foundations for ensuring the quality of observation data. Then, it introduces the integration and processing of historical data, including data collection, digitization, unification of formats, anomaly detection, and processing. Subsequently, the processed data were validated, including assessments of daily variations accuracy and long-term stability. The results show that the quality of the integrated historical data has been significantly improved. These datasets are of great value for improving historical geomagnetic field models, studying variable fields, main geomagnetic fields, and their long-term variations. Finally, we applied the data to the analysis and research of Sq and geomagnetic jerks, exploring the spatiotemporal variation characteristics of Sq and jerk in the China. Sq is mainly a daytime phenomenon, and its variation pattern in the middle- and low-latitude regions is mainly characterized by its dependence on latitude and local time. The geomagnetic jerk phenomenon exhibits significant regional differences and asynchronous occurrence times of jerks. Jerk events in 1969, 1979, 1991, 2003, and 2019 were observed at all observatories and had distinct jerk variation characteristics. Other jerks were only observed at some observatories or individual observatories. The maximum time difference for the occurrence of the same jerk event at different observatories was 2 years. This study aims to provide these precious datasets to the scientific community and the public so that these data can be integrated with data from other sources, thereby further exploring the spatiotemporal evolution and physical mechanisms of the geomagnetic field. The historical datasets of the eight geomagnetic observatories that have been integrated and quality-controlled are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15481895 (Zhang et al., 2025)."

Such measurements are key inputs for models that estimate how much ice is stored on the whole mountain range scale and for models that predict how this ice reserve will change in future, and what impact this will have on water supply for the large populations living downstream. 
 Mountain glaciers provide an important service in sustaining river flows for large populations downstream of High Mountain Asia (HMA) but these glaciers are retreating and the future of this water resource is highly uncertain. Glacier thickness measurements are vital for accurate mapping of the remaining ice reserve and for predicting where and how fast it will decline under climate change, but such measurements are severely lacking in this region due to the difficulties of surveying in remote, high-altitude settings. We report on a uniquely extensive new thickness dataset for eleven glaciers in the Khumbu Himal around Mount Everest that we collected in late 2019 using a novel, low-frequency helicopter-borne radar. To aid in interpreting the survey radargrams we developed a terrain clutter model, and we succeeded in mapping ice thickness with a precision of around ±7 % and horizontal spacing of around 40 m, for thicknesses of up to 445 m and spanning a total of 119 line-km, approximately doubling the length of previous thickness surveys in HMA. To demonstrate the utility of our new measurements, we compare them to existing modelled thickness products and find that the models struggle to reproduce the distribution of ice in these complex, steep, rapidly slowing, thinning and stagnating glaciers, with widespread systematic thin and thick biases equivalent to around half of the measured ice thickness or more. This new dataset (https://doi.org/10.5285/e39647f5-fb72-4d16-acbd-9784ed2167b8) permits for the first time a detailed analysis of model performance on Himalayan glaciers, a key step in improving model skill and hence the accuracy of modelled thickness distributions and future ice loss on the mountain-range scale."

 We introduce FACA – Fully Automated Co-Alignment, an open-source software program designed to fully automate the workflow for co-aligning point clouds derived from unoccupied aerial vehicle (UAV) images using photogrammetry. We developed FACA to efficiently evaluate fieldwork with UAVs on landslides and coastal dynamics. The software applies to any research requiring comparative, precise, and rapid multi-temporal point cloud generation from UAV imagery. Unoccupied aerial vehicles are an essential element in most contemporary applied geosciences research toolkits. Typical products of UAV flights are point clouds created with photogrammetry, which are used to measure objects and their change if multi-temporal data exists. Ground control points (GCPs) are considered the best method to increase the precision and accuracy of point clouds, but placing and measuring them is not always feasible during fieldwork. Co-alignment leads to the local precise alignment of multiple point clouds without GCPs. Fully Automated Co-Alignment uses Agisoft Metashape Pro and the Python standard library. The GPLv3 licensed FACA source code focuses on extendability, modifiability, and readability. Our software works interchangeably from the command line or a custom graphical user interface. We distribute the software with both usage and installation instructions. Three multi-temporal test datasets are available.

In this release we present updated physics and many more supported configurations which can serve as starting points to simulate the atmospheres of rocky terrestrial planets of interest. Two different radiation schemes are supported, the GISS radiation, valid only for atmospheres similar to that of modern Earth, and SOCRATES, which is more generalized but more computationally expensive. While ROCKE-3D can simulate a very wide range of planetary and atmospheric configurations, we describe here a small subset of them, with the goal of demonstrating the structural capabilities, rather than the scientific breadth, of the model. Three different atmospheric composition options (preindustrial Earth, the aerosol-free and ozone-free atmosphere used in ROCKE-3D 1.0, and an anoxic atmosphere with no aerosols), three ocean configurations (prescribed, Q-flux, and dynamic), and two resolutions are described: the medium resolution (4×5° in latitude and longitude, previously used in ROCKE-3D 1.0) and the fine resolution, which has double the resolution in the atmosphere and 4 times the horizontal and 3 times the vertical resolution in the ocean. Finally, for the land surface hydrology, we have introduced generalized physics for arbitrary topography in the pooling and evaporation of water and river transport of water between grid cells, as well as for the vertical stratification of temperature in dynamic lakes. We quantify how the different component choices affect model results and discuss the strengths and limitations of using each component, together with how one can select which component to use. ROCKE-3D is publicly available, and tutorial sessions are available for the community, greatly facilitating its use by any interested group."

However, this strategy often results in the aggregation of OV clusters, a phenomenon that has been largely overlooked in previous studies, despite its pronounced impact on catalytic performance. Herein, we demonstrate that the size of OV clusters governs the volcano-shaped dependence of catalytic activity for toluene oxidation under humid conditions. Experimental results and DFT calculations reveal that variations in OV cluster size significantly modulate H2O activation. In particular, dimer OV clusters promote rapid electron transfer and exhibit the lowest energy barrier for H2O dissociation, facilitating the formation of OH species. These OH species not only enhance the adsorption of toluene and intermediates but also act as reactive oxygen species that directly participate in the oxidation pathway, thereby improving toluene combustion under humid conditions. Consequently, MnO2-M with dimer OV clusters exhibits the highest activity (T90 = 222 °C) in the presence of 5 vol % H2O. This work provides new insights into the size-dependent effects of OV clusters and contributes to the rational design of high-performance catalysts based on OV engineering."

Although the energy efficiency for water evaporation is approaching 100%, the yield of clean liquid water still remains at a relatively low level, primarily due to inefficient condensation driving force and unstable light absorbance caused by uncondensed fog droplets. Here, we present a wavelength-anisotropic conductive interface solar distillation system (WADS) that fundamentally redefines energy flow management. By spectrally decoupling solar absorption (0.2–2.5 μm) from thermal radiation (8–13 μm), WADS achieves the simultaneous enhancement of photothermal conversion and passive radiative cooling. This dual-mode operation enables directional energy transport─sunlight influx through transparent channels and heat dissipation via high-emissivity nanostructures─establishing a self-sustaining thermal gradient that amplifies condensation kinetics while suppressing light scattering. Based on the above design, the clean liquid water production with 3D photothermal component reached 4.03 kg·m–2·h–1 under 1 sun, representing a 10-fold improvement over conventional SID, with nighttime production (0.75 kg·m–2·h–1) through continuous radiative cooling. Beyond desalination, WADS demonstrates a synergistic resource recovery from brines, enabling efficient mineral preconcentration. This integrated energy-loop architecture presents a new paradigm for addressing coupled water-energy-resource challenges."

The development of sorbents with both high capacity and stability, particularly under ambient conditions, remains a critical challenge. Herein, we report a novel multivariate (MTV) metal–organic framework (MOF), MUV-102(Cu–Ti), engineered through precise integration of heterometallic Cu(2-δ)+-Ti4+ clusters, which demonstrates exceptional NH3 adsorption performance and reversible stability under both low and high concentrations. Under static exposure to 100 ppm of NH3, MUV-102(Cu–Ti) achieves 3.9 mmol g–1 uptake, while at dynamic equilibrium (1 bar), it reaches 22.4 mmol g–1, surpassing monometallic and other heterobimetallic titanium-based analogs (Co, Ni, Zn, Mn), ranking among the top in current record of MOFs. The framework retains its integrity and adsorption capacity after nine adsorption–desorption cycles. Experimental and theoretical analyses reveal that the heterometallic Cu(2-δ)+-Ti4+ unit enhances thermodynamic stability by strengthening metal–ligand (M–L) bonds and dynamically modulating Lewis acidic sites to generate abundant open metal sites (OMS) for NH3 molecules. These findings provide a design strategy for multivariate MOFs (MTV-MOFs) with complementary metal reactivity, offering promise for efficient NH3 capture in environmental remediation and energy applications."

To clarify these associations, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of 74 epidemiological studies published through December 2023, examining PFAS exposure in adults, children, and pregnant women across both high and general exposure settings. Legacy PFAS, including PFOS, PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS, and PFDA, were the most frequently reported. Geographic variations had little impact on PFAS concentrations, whereas studies conducted near contamination sources showed higher serum PFAS concentrations. Meta-analyses and sign tests demonstrated positive associations between PFOA and PFOS exposure and increased total cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in adults, with no clear evidence for associations with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol or total triglyceride. Studies on pregnant women did not show significant associations between PFAS and lipids in either meta-analyses or sign tests.

Machine learning provides useful tools for predicting the occurrence of PFAS in groundwater and for tracing pollution sources. It also supports prioritizing investigations and implementing subsequent decisive prevention and control of PFAS pollution. This study combines the advantages of machine learning in predicting the occurrence and traceability of PFAS and employs Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) to thoroughly evaluate and predict the key factors thereof occurrence and source identification of PFAS in groundwater (n = 52) for the Pearl River Delta region. Findings reveal that groundwater chemical and spatial geographic information successfully predicts the PFAS occurrence, with industrial land, DOC, well depth, and soil saturation being the key factors. The contribution of mixed sources was successfully determined by using PFAS compositional profiles from industrial and agricultural sources. Industrial sources have a higher contribution; only 16.7% of  mixed sources are attributed to agricultural sources.

While geothermal brines are a rich source of lithium ions (Li+), they also have high concentrations of coexisting constituents, including Fe(II), Mn(II), and silica, which can form scaling layers on the electrode surface, thus presenting substantial challenges for Li+ extraction. This study systematically investigates the effects of Fe(II), Mn(II), and silica on Li+ extraction by lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO4, LFP) electrodes and the mechanisms underlying performance degradation. Through cycling experiments in impurity-laden solutions, we demonstrate that Fe(II) severely compromises LFP electrode performance, reducing capacity, Faradaic efficiency, and Li+/Na+ selectivity. This performance degradation is attributed to the formation of an iron (hydr)oxide scaling layer and the bonding of Fe2+ ions with oxygen atoms in the LFP lattice, leading to accelerated reconstruction of the crystal structure. In contrast, Mn(II) and silica cause minimal performance loss despite contributing to scaling. Finally, we propose a cost-effective pretreatment method to remove Fe(II) from geothermal brines, extending the LFP electrode lifespan while maintaining high Li+/Na+ selectivity. These findings provide critical insights for scaling mitigation in electrochemical lithium extraction from complex brine sources."

Despite growing concern, how oxygen depletion alters ecological dynamics across trophic levels remains poorly understood, highlighting the urgent need for integrated and multitrophic assessments. Here, we conducted a comprehensive analysis in the Pearl River Estuary, a globally representative urbanized estuary, by integrating multidimensional data sets including environmental DNA (eDNA) and traditional plankton monitoring, species functional traits, biomass and water quality. Our findings reveal pronounced community reassembly under hypoxic conditions, characterized by increases in pollution-tolerant and invasive taxa, and concurrent declines of sensitive taxa. While α-diversity increased significantly across all taxonomic groups (median increased 35%–65%), β-diversity declined, indicating community homogenization to some extent under hypoxia stress. The complexity of organismal networks declined under hypoxia, with decreases of 12%–30% in node number, average degree, and clustering coefficient, and a >70% loss of fish nodes; microbial taxa increasingly occupied central network positions. Structural equation modeling identified that hypoxia disrupted internal regulatory pathways, shifting the system from biodiversity-driven top-down control to bottom-up dominance, effectively decoupling biodiversity from ecosystem functions. Overall, this study provides one of the few multitrophic frameworks to mechanistically elucidate how seasonal hypoxia restructures biodiversity, weakens trophic regulation, and compromises ecosystem resilience in urbanized estuarine systems."

Accurate DBP analysis requires quenching of residual disinfectants and pH adjustment. Ascorbic acid (AA) and sulfuric acid (H2SO4) are commonly used for these purposes, particularly for organic DBPs, yet no standardized guidance exists on their use. This study evaluated the impact of AA and H2SO4 premixing on the quenching of DBP samples under both controlled laboratory and field sampling conditions. Results showed premixing of these reagents prior to sampling substantially increased the formation of haloacetaldehydes (HALs), particularly dichloroacetaldehyde (DCAL) and trichloroacetaldehyde (TCAL) under chlorination, due to acid-catalyzed degradation of AA and subsequent formation of reactive aldehydic intermediates. This effect is magnified in the presence of elevated bromide, leading to higher levels of brominated HALs that are among the most cytotoxic DBPs. Field data from four treatment plants confirmed the laboratory findings and demonstrated that premixing introduced substantial bias into HAL measurements. To prevent overestimation of DBP levels, premixing of AA and H2SO4 should be avoided; AA should be added at the time of sampling, followed immediately by pH adjustment with H2SO4."

While they are generally not classified as persistent organic pollutants due to their relatively rapid metabolism and urinary excretion, a fraction can accumulate in tissues, including the adipose. This bioaccumulation raises concerns about the potential for prolonged endocrine disruption and chronic toxicity. This study investigated the distribution and accumulation of nine BPs in human blood, visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT). By comparing the detection rates and concentrations of BPs in paired blood and adipose samples, we found that certain BPs (particularly BPF, BPE, and BPA-G) exhibit preferential accumulation in adipose tissues. The accumulation propensity was slightly higher in SAT than in VAT. Correlation analysis revealed that the sources of the same BP in VAT and SAT were highly consistent, whereas most BPs in adipose tissues had significantly different sources compared with those in blood. Further analysis suggested that age and obesity might be key factors influencing the differential accumulation of BPs in adipose tissues. Since accumulated BPs can be slowly or substantially released during lipolysis, our findings highlight that the adipose tissue reservoir of BPs may play an important role in their long-term toxic effects."

By analyzing marine temperature records spanning the past 10 million years with a regression‐based technique that removes temporal dimensions, we extract long‐term ocean warming patterns and quantify relative sea surface temperature changes across the global ocean. This analysis revealed a distinct pattern of amplified warming that aligns with equilibrated model simulations under high CO2 conditions, yet differs from the transient warming pattern observed over the past 160 years. This paleodata‐model comparison allows us to identify models that better capture fundamental aspects of Earth's warming response, while suggesting how ocean heat uptake and circulation changes modify the development of warming patterns over time. By combining this paleo‐ocean warming pattern with equilibrated model simulations, we characterized the likely evolution of global ocean warming as the climate system approaches equilibrium."

An increasing number of flood insurance programs have been using observable proxies—or indices—to activate payouts. However, convincing evaluation of important design features, including choice of index data, are lacking. This study investigates five potential flood data sets at national and regional scales in a simulated index‐based insurance program in Bangladesh: gridded precipitation, river‐height and modeled inundation from the national flood agency, and two satellite data sets of surface‐water‐extent (one state‐of‐practice, the other state‐of‐the‐art). We demonstrate that data choice determines the accuracy and timeliness of indexed payouts, as well as the uncertainty associated with their likelihood, which influences program costs. For example, while river‐height and satellite water‐extent indices activated payouts during the two worst floods in the 20‐year study period (2004 and 2007), the precipitation‐index activated for just one of them. Furthermore, our state‐of‐the‐art satellite index activated on average 1 week earlier and with 21% lower uncertainty than the satellite‐index used in practice. We propose that practitioners leverage the divergence‐of‐evidence among multiple data sets to identify regions where there is lower confidence in making accurate and timely payouts, which can help inform additional programming such as back‐up payout mechanisms. Beyond insights for practitioners leveraging insurance to protect Bangladeshi communities threatened by extreme monsoon floods, this work offers techniques to assess the sensitivity of indexed programs to different data and scales in other flood‐prone regions."

Here we use combined thermodynamic and geodynamic modelling to investigate the crystallization of a basal magma ocean continuously contaminated by oxide exsolved from the core, termed the basal exsolution contaminated magma ocean. We find suppression of ferropericlase crystallization. Geodynamic modelling demonstrates that the solidified contaminated magma ocean mantle can lead to the formation of deep mantle structures consistent with large low-velocity provinces and ultralow-velocity zones. In addition, diapirs of core exsolution entrained into the solid mantle may cause small-scale scattering. The basal exsolution contaminated magma ocean inherits the silicon, tungsten and helium isotope compositions from the core and exhibits trace element enrichments, suggesting its possible role as a source material for ocean island basalts that may sample the large low-velocity provinces, pointing to a unified mechanism for forming deep mantle heterogeneities. The proposed basal magma ocean within the early Earth may have been contaminated by oxides exsolved from the core that can explain seismic velocity anomalies observed in the lowermost mantle, according to thermodynamic and geodynamic modelling."

Here, the authors report that asymmetric Pt coordination enables a strong synergy between single-atom sites and nanoparticles, delivering efficient photocatalytic hydrogen production. 
 Integrating distinct functional reaction sites within a single photocatalyst offers a promising approach for enhancing the photocatalytic H2 evolution by water splitting. However, the synergy between the dual active sites is hindered by suboptimal electronic states arising from the uniform coordination environments. Here we demonstrate a strategy for enhancing the synergy between Pt single atoms and nanoparticles by modulating the coordination environment. The optimal boron doped catalyst with B-Pt-O asymmetric coordination achieves a H2 evolution rate of 627.6 mmol g-1h-1, with an apparent quantum efficiency of 98.4%. Experimental and theoretical analysis reveal that the asymmetric coordination structure redistributes the electron density of Pt cocatalysts, promoting charge carrier separation, optimizing the dissociation and adsorption-desorption of the intermediate H2O* and H* on the dual sites. The findings highlight the importance of asymmetric coordination facilitates the photogenerated carrier transfer and surface reactions for efficient photocatalytic H2 evolution.

 The current view of neurodevelopment after preterm birth presents a strong paradox: diverse neurocognitive outcomes suggest heterogeneous neurodevelopment, yet numerous brain imaging studies focusing on average dysmaturation imply largely uniform aberrations across individuals. Here we show both, spatially heterogeneous individual brain abnormality patterns but with consistent underlying biological mechanisms of injury and plasticity. Using cross-sectional structural magnetic resonance imaging data from preterm neonates and longitudinal data from preterm children and adults in a normative reference framework, we demonstrate that brain development after preterm birth is highly heterogeneous in both severity and patterns of deviations. Individual brain abnormality patterns are also consistent for their extent and location along the life course, associated with glial cell underpinnings, and plastic for influences of the early social environment. Our findings extend conventional views of preterm neurodevelopment, revealing a nuanced landscape of individual variation, with consistent commonalities between subjects. This integrated perspective implies more targeted theranostic intervention strategies, specifically integrating brain charts and imaging at birth, as well as social interventions during early development. This study reveals that brain aberrations after preterm birth are highly individual yet shaped by early injury and social environment, influencing long-term cognitive outcomes."

Here, Richards et al. develop a high-throughput bioprinted trophoblast organoid model to recapitulate the microenvironment of the early placenta, enabling investigation of placenta development and evaluation of therapeutics for placenta dysfunction disorders. 
 Trophoblast organoids can provide crucial insights into mechanisms of placentation, however their potential is limited by highly variable extracellular matrices unable to reflect in vivo tissues. Here, we present a bioprinted placental organoid model, generated using the first trimester trophoblast cell line, ACH-3P, and a synthetic polyethylene glycol (PEG) matrix. Bioprinted or Matrigel-embedded organoids differentiate spontaneously from cytotrophoblasts into two major subtypes: extravillous trophoblasts (EVTs) and syncytiotrophoblasts (STBs). Bioprinted organoids are driven towards EVT differentiation and show close similarity with early human placenta or primary trophoblast organoids. Inflammation inhibits proliferation and STBs within bioprinted organoids, which aspirin or metformin (0.5 mM) cannot rescue. We reverse the inside-out architecture of ACH-3P organoids by suspension culture with STBs forming on the outer layer of organoids, reflecting placental tissue. Our bioprinted methodology is applicable to trophoblast stem cells. We present a high-throughput, automated, and tuneable trophoblast organoid model that reproducibly mimics the placental microenvironment in health and disease.

This study uses drone imagery to show that small streams and ponds, often missed by satellites, considerably increase the energy available for melt. 
 Ponding of meltwater on the surface of the Greenland Ice Sheet has the potential to reduce ice sheet albedo and amplify mass loss. However, this process remains poorly constrained and is absent from models that project ice sheet mass balance. Here we demonstrate that meltwater ponding considerably increases the amount of energy available for melting the Greenland Ice Sheet. We first use satellite-derived products to show that meltwater ponding has a significant impact on spatial albedo patterns, particularly in the lower percolation zone. We then use drone imagery to demonstrate that, in the upper ablation zone, there are thousands of narrow streams and small pools (<100 m²) that collectively account for >50% of the total meltwater area. These small meltwater features are not resolved by surface water maps derived from medium-resolution satellite imagery, signifying that the radiative effect of meltwater ponding is three to four times stronger than predicted by satellite-based approaches. Our findings therefore place lower bounds on the radiative effect of meltwater ponding that could be used to advocate for the inclusion of this process into models that forecast Greenland Ice Sheet’s contribution to sea-level rise.

 Recent technological advances have facilitated the assembly of telomere-to-telomere (T2T) genomes. The current T2T CHM13 showcases the complete architecture of the human genome, yet its use in functional experiments is limited by discrepancies with the actual genome of the specific biological system under study. Access to reference assemblies for experimentally relevant cell lines is therefore essential in advancing sequencing-based analyses and precise manipulation, particularly in highly variable regions such as centromeres. Here, we present RPE1v1.1, the near-complete diploid genome assembly of the hTERT RPE-1 cell line, a non-cancerous human retinal epithelial model with a stable karyotype. Using high-coverage Pacific Biosciences and Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read sequencing, we generate a high-quality de novo assembly, validate it through multiple methods, and phase it by integrating high-throughput chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) data. Our assembly includes chromosome-level scaffolds that span centromeres for all chromosomes. Comparing both haplotypes with the CHM13 genome, we detect haplotype-specific genomic variations, including the translocation between chromosome 10 and chromosome X t(X;10)(Xq28;10q21.2) characteristic of RPE-1 cells, and divergence peaking at centromeres. Altogether, the RPE1v1.1 genome provides a reference-quality diploid assembly of a widely used cell line, supporting high-precision genetic and epigenetic studies in this model system.

Here, the authors combine rapid protein depletion, clinical CDK4/6 inhibitors, and genome-wide EdU sequencing to reveal that the CDK4/6-RB axis ensures timely loading of DNA replication factors in G1 phase in human cells. 
 Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) coordinate DNA replication and cell division, and play key roles in tissue homeostasis, genome stability and cancer development. The first step in replication is origin licensing, when minichromosome maintenance (MCM) helicases are loaded onto DNA by CDC6, CDT1 and the origin recognition complex (ORC). In yeast, origin licensing starts when CDK activity plummets in G1 phase, reinforcing the view that CDKs inhibit licensing. Here we show that, in human cells, CDK4/6 activity promotes origin licensing. By combining rapid protein degradation and time-resolved EdU-sequencing, we find that CDK4/6 activity acts epistatically to CDC6 and CDT1 in G1 phase and counteracts RB pocket proteins to promote origin licensing. Therapeutic CDK4/6 inhibitors block MCM and ORC6 loading, which we exploit to trigger mitosis with unreplicated DNA in p53-deficient cells. The CDK4/6-RB axis thus links replication licensing to proliferation, which has implications for human cell fate control and cancer therapy design. Cells must coordinate cell division with genome replication.

 During food consumption, tastes combine with retronasal odours to form flavour, which leads to a link so robust that retronasal odours can elicit taste sensations without concurrent taste stimulation. However, the cortical integration of these parallel sensory signals remains unclear. Here, we combine a flavour-binding paradigm and functional neuroimaging to test whether retronasal odorants evoke encoding patterns in the insula similar to those of their paired tastants. Healthy participants attend a familiarisation session with congruent sweet and savoury flavours followed by two functional MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) sessions where they separately receive the constituent tastants and odorants. Multivariate pattern analysis reveal classification of retronasal odours within the insula, exhibiting overlapping representations with their associated tastes, particularly in the ventral anterior insula. Additionally, we observe temporal drift in insular taste representations, paralleling findings in rodent gustatory cortex. These findings underscore the robust crossmodal influences of gustatory and retronasal olfactory processing that underpin the flavour percept. Food aromas stimulate smell receptors in the nose but are often mistaken for tastes. This study shows that aromas induce taste-like patterns in the insular cortex.

 The Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum ca. 55.93 Ma is considered one of the best geological analogues for worst-case, near-future climate states. During this warming interval, calcareous nannoplankton—critical marine primary producers and important components of the biological pump—experienced significant turnover in community composition, which likely had a major impact on ecosystem function. However, determining the extent of this relationship is complicated by recognized geographic variability in the pattern and magnitude of palaeoecological change, as well as a sampling bias towards lower latitude oceanic sites. In this study, we present new calcareous nannofossil assemblage data from the climatically-sensitive, high latitude south-west Pacific Ocean. Critically, our record shows that major changes in nannoplankton community composition—coincident with a 0.5 ‰ decrease in bulk sediment δ13C—preceded the onset of the Palaeocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum by 200 kyr. We suggest this precursor event led to the establishment of a new palaeoecological baseline that caused a relatively muted response of nannofossil assemblages to the main warming event, especially when compared to other high latitude sites. Therefore, our results highlight the importance of examining the influence of local and regional processes on palaeoecological background states when considering geographically heterogenous responses to major global palaeoclimatic events.

 Indigenous Territories are crucial for preserving biodiversity, particularly in tropical regions, yet their contribution to human health is poorly understood. Using 20 years of data on fire-related and zoonotic/vector-borne diseases, we evaluated how Indigenous Territories, their legal recognition status, and landscape parameters affected disease incidence in the Amazon biome. Overall, we found that Indigenous Territories extent had complex and non-linear effects, with a potential to reduce fire-related disease incidence and to increase zoonotic/vector-borne diseases, depending on the local landscape structure. For instance, Indigenous Territories within municipalities with high forest cover outside their boundaries can mitigate the impacts of particulate matter with less than 2.5 micrometer on human health and reduce the incidence of fire-related diseases. For zoonotic/vector-borne diseases, both forests inside and outside Indigenous Territories, when covering over 40% of a municipality, can contribute to reducing the negative effects from edge density on disease incidence. Our findings emphasize the complex relationships between conservation and human health, which vary based on the local context and Indigenous Territories legal recognition, and underscores the importance of Indigenous Territories and their legal acknowledgment for supporting ecosystem and human health, particularly in landscapes with high forest integrity and low fragmentation.

 The world is facing increasing land scarcity due to growing demand for agricultural products and urban expansion. At the same time, farmland abandonment is emerging as a widespread global land-use change phenomenon. Remote sensing plays a critical role in identifying abandonment across diverse farming systems. Here, we synthesized current knowledge through a systematic literature review of 131 publications to assess progress in remote-sensing-based monitoring of farmland abandonment. Our review highlights the growing use of remote sensing techniques and the increasing utility of multisource satellite data. However, research remains primarily skewed toward publicly available optical Landsat and Sentinel-2 data, with limited integration of other sources and a lack of global-scale assessments. We propose research directions to guide future studies, focusing on underrepresented land-use types, such as grasslands, terraces, and plantations, as well as regions like Africa, Central and Southeast Asia, and South America. We emphasize the importance of diversifying data sources and integrating ancillary information, including cadastral data and historical land-use records, to better understand abandonment processes and associated vegetation changes. We advocate for multi-scale, temporally explicit analyses to improve scalability and enable the development of regional and continental products. As most studies focus on biophysical changes, future work should also consider socio-economic contexts and integrate remote-sensing-based proxies of land-use change.

 The Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP), known as a crucial precipitation center within the Tibetan Plateau, has experienced frequent extreme precipitation events that have caused severe disasters. Atmospheric Rivers (ARs) have been recognized as significant contributors to extreme hydrological events, yet their characteristics and relationships with extreme precipitation in the SETP are not yet fully understood. In this study, we identified ARs using ERA5 reanalysis data from 1979 to 2023, quantified the variations in extreme precipitation associated with these ARs, and explored the underlying mechanisms driving these changes. The results demonstrated a critical role of ARs in modulating extreme precipitation over the SETP, Over the study period, a significant shift occurred in 1999 regarding ARs-related extreme precipitation. While this value increased prior to 1999, it experienced a sharp decline that year. Although a slight recovery was observed between 2000 and 2023, average levels remained below pre-1999 records. Fluctuations in ARs-related extreme precipitation are driven primarily by variations in ARs frequency, and the weakening of dynamic conditions associated with ARs may partly offset the enhancement effect of increased moisture availability, thereby limiting the intensification of extreme precipitation. Additionally, changes in atmospheric circulation further influence extreme precipitation by altering ARs pathways. This study enhances our understanding of the influence of ARs on extreme precipitation, providing critical insights into water resource management within the SETP."

Experimentally, we show that three-qubitWstate discrimination can be achieved by detecting the cyclic shift symmetry with a three-mode DFT optical circuit, yielding a measurement discrimination fidelity of 0.871 ± 0.039. Our experimental demonstration opens the door for the development of new quantum network protocols between multipartite systems."

AAGAB uses its C-terminal domain (CTD) to bind the α subunit and its GTPase-like domain (GD) to bind the σ2 subunit of the AP2 adaptor complex, a central player in membrane trafficking. AAGAB first recruits α via its CTD; σ2 then joins through interaction with α, forming a conformationally immature α:σ2 hemicomplex at the CTD.

While microglia/myeloid cells drive RP progression, their phenotype-regulating determinants remain unclear. Using rd10 mice, we reveal TREM2 as a biphasic RP regulator via STAT2–mediated microglial reprogramming. Early TREM2 loss amplifies neuroinflammation through STAT2 hyperactivation, while late deficiency triggers NF-κB/STAT2–driven microglial apoptosis, impairing phagocytosis yet preserving photoreceptors. We uncover a photoreceptor-microglia metabolic axis where apoptotic photoreceptors release arachidonic acid, salicylic acid, and creatinine to induce STAT2-dependent apoptosis in TREM2-deficient cells. Crucially, we identify intermicroglia PSAP/GPR37 signaling as a self-propagating apoptotic mechanism—the first evidence of apoptotic transmission in retinal degeneration.

Here, we used a CRISPR-Cas9 screen in an orthotopic xenograft model to explore PDAC dynamics. The RNA binding protein DEAD-box helicase 3X-linked (DDX3X) was identified as a pivotal oncogene and biomechanical checkpoint. Specifically, DDX3X up-regulation in PDAC promoted tumorigenesis and metastasis, primarily through the transcriptional repressor TLE family member 2 (TLE2). Dysregulation of DDX3X in the tumor destabilized TLE2 messenger RNA and therefore disrupted the interaction with KLF4 (KLF transcription factor 4), leading to increased expression of myosin light chain 9 (MYL9). This change remodeled F-actin, enhancing tumor cell traction forces and consequently facilitating tumor metastasis. Targeting the DDX3X-TLE2-MYL9 pathway considerably reduces PDAC progression.

We demonstrate an analog in-memory computing chip based on a standard complementary metal-oxide semiconductor process, achieving the highest precision reported to date. Enhanced by the proposed weight remapping technique, the chip realizes ultrahigh computing accuracy with a root mean square error of only 0.101% across multiple parallel vector-by-matrix multiplication operations. Moreover, our analog in-memory computing chip maintains high precision, with an error of 0.155 and 0.130% under environmental temperatures of −78.5° and 180°C, respectively. This work pushes the boundaries of analog computing precision by leveraging stable geometry feature of devices."

How its main building block, the ROD-Zwilch-ZW10 (RZZ) complex, assembles on the outer kinetochore remains poorly understood. Harnessing corona biochemical reconstitutions and cell biology, we reveal that the paralogous spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) proteins BUB1 and BUBR1 promote nonredundant branches of corona assembly. MPS1 kinase–dependent kinetochore docking of BUB1 and subsequent recruitment of BUBR1 initiates assembly. Disrupting the first branch by depleting CENP-E, a kinesin that links BUBR1 to RZZ, uncovered a second assembly pathway mediated by a direct interaction between BUB1 and ROD. Discovery of a direct interaction with the RZZ explains how the SAC protein MAD1 fits this corona assembly scheme. Our findings solve the long-standing puzzle of corona assembly and demonstrate the intimate interweaving of chromosome biorientation and checkpoint signaling."

The reaction is applicable to a wide range of substrates, and undesired hydrogenation of the styrenes and stilbenes is strongly suppressed. The generated H2gas can be used for hydrogenation of alkenes in a connected flask system.

We previously reported that mutations in the viral nucleocapsid (NC) are selected in the presence of the INSTI dolutegravir (DTG).

We find that in primary peripheral blood mononuclear cells, HIV-1 acquires mutations in the viral envelope glycoprotein, NC, and occasionally IN during selection for INSTI resistance. Notably, the selected NC and IN mutations act in concert to reduce the susceptibility of the virus to INSTIs.

In contrast, agents that decelerate relaxation were hitherto unknown. Such agents are highly desirable for metabolic imaging with hyperpolarized tracers such as15N-pyridine, 1,4-13C2-succinate, and 1-15N-nicotinamide, where valuable polarization decays rapidly, especially at low fields during transfer between polarizer and scanner.

The impact on longitudinal relaxation is particularly pronounced at low magnetic fields and near the tracer’s pKawhereT1can be tripled. This mitigates polarization loss during transfer, so hitherto unsuitable, fast-relaxing molecules can be used now. This way, we achieved the15N hyperpolarization of nearly 30% for 1-15N-nicotinamide. This chemically induced deceleration of nuclear spin relaxation (CIDER) was confirmed using magnetic field–cycling experiments and offers broad potential for hyperpolarized magnetic resonance and beyond."

Biodegradation in soil was assessed by monitoring polyester and cellulose mineralization to 13CO2 throughout multimonth incubations and quantifying the nonmineralized polyester in the soil after incubations. Mass balances on polyester- and cellulose-added 13C over the incubations were closed. The soil biodegradability of PBSeT was higher than that of PBAT for variants with a molar ratio of terephthalate (T) to total diacid of 50%. PBAT biodegradability substantially increased as its T content decreased from 50% to 47, 30, 20, and 0%. Increasing biodegradability with decreasing T content also resulted in preferential biodegradation of aliphatic-rich domains in the initial phase of the incubations. Polyesters undergoing extensive mineralization also showed substantial incorporation of polyester carbon into the soil microbial biomass. Differences in polyester soil biodegradability were rationalized based on differences in their enzymatic hydrolyzability.

Antimicrobial exposure altered the relative abundance of bacterial classes, including Verrucomicrobiae, Alphaproteobacteria, Betaproteobacteria, and Gammaproteobacteria, with effect directions depending on the antimicrobial. These structural shifts were predicted to enhance lipid and energy metabolism, particularly under dietary and combined exposure, potentially influencing host physiology.

As this study primarily relies on predictive models linking microbiome shifts to physiological changes, experimental validation is required to substantiate these findings. Likewise, several fungal classes were affected, but limited knowledge of the mycobiome hinders functional interpretation. Overall, dietary uptake emerged as a key driver of gut microbiome changes, while waterborne exposure played a minor role in the metabolic and physiological responses.

Herein, we developed atomically dispersed single-atom copper@carbon nanospheres (Cu-NC-3), which effectively decompose ozone (O3) to generate surface atomic oxygen (*O), as confirmed by the in situ Raman experiments and theoretical calculations. The *O species rapidly degrade 60% of oxalic acid (OA) within 1 min, while protonation of *O produces surface-confined hydroxyl radicals (•OHad) that achieve 94.7% removal of benzoic acid (BA) and other aromatic compounds. Compared to ozonation alone, the O3/Cu-NC-3 system enhances OA and BA removal by 34.5- and 1.5-fold, respectively. Atomic-level Cu dispersion induces carbon defects that enrich surface O3, and Cu–N4 coordination sites promote its conversion to *O and •OHad. This dual-oxidation mechanism effectively ensures and enables broad-spectrum pollutant removal and exceptional catalytic stability under long-term operation. Therefore, the O3/Cu-NC-3 system offers a robust and efficient approach for treating real wastewater containing diverse interfering species."

The formation of •OH, alkyl radicals (•CH3), alkoxy radicals (CH3C(═O)OO• and CH3C(═O)O•), and nonradical species (1O2) was systematically studied and detected by in situ electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR). In the homogeneous catalytic activation systems, the concentrations and types of generated radicals were dominated by the extranuclear electron configuration in the metal ions, while in the heterogeneous systems, carbon material showed lower efficiency in radical formation but directly produced 1O2 through double electron transfer. The activation performance of the photocatalyst was dominated by the reduction ability of photogenerated electrons and the oxidation ability of photogenerated holes. Furthermore, an EPR-based method for quantification of 1O2 was proposed by using 2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine (TEMP) or its derivatives, confirming that 1O2 was transformed from the self-decomposition of PAA or the Russell reaction of complexed CH3C(═O)OO•.

The Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR), which is located in the middle and upper Yangtze River and provides drinking water to over 7 million people, was selected as the study area. Sediment samples were collected during flood and nonflood period to investigate toxic effects and chemical distribution. Bioassays, including cytotoxicity tests and yeast two-hybrid tests, revealed that samples collected during the flood period induced significantly higher estrogenic effects than those from the nonflood period. Nontarget screening by high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) detected 47,321 unique features, with 527 compounds being identified successfully (level 2a). Chemometric analysis by correlation and weighted contribution analysis indicated that N-[(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)methyl]nonanamide (nonivamide) was significantly positively correlated with estrogenic activity (p < 0.05).

To enable climate change adaptation and resilience across various economic and social sectors in this region, updated information about future climate changes, specifically at finer spatial scales, is essential. Leveraging a new 150‐year dynamical downscaling data set at convection‐permitting resolution, this study introduces a framework to construct the projected future intensity‐duration‐frequency (IDF) curves of heavy precipitation, which are prominent tools for infrastructure design and water resources management. This framework generates IDF curves at both sub‐daily and multi‐day duration utilizing hourly in situ observations as well as quantile‐based statistical techniques in bias‐correction and return levels selection. The assumption of non‐stationarity in the distribution parameter fitting process is also implemented in this workflow. Compared to historical IDF curves for 1980–2022, future projected IDF curves for 2058–2100 under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5 and RCP 8.5 scenarios indicate an average intensity increase of approximately 15% and 25%, respectively, across 74 stations, considering both annual and seasonal timescales. Future projections suggest that extreme precipitation events may become more severe across six investigated return periods, with longer return periods showing a greater increase. The frequency of future extreme precipitation events in the Midwest region is also projected to double.

 Forest voids—three-dimensional (3D), unoccupied spaces within forest ecosystems—form a critical yet under-described component of stand structure. Shaped by vegetation, microclimate, and disturbance regimes, these voids govern light penetration, airflow, and habitat connectivity. We propose a LiDAR-based framework that identifies, visualizes, and quantifies forest voids directly from terrestrial and mobile laser-scanning (TLS/MLS) point clouds. By treating voids as the 3D regions between the digital elevation model (DEM) or digital surface model (DSM) where no returns are detected, our method bypasses canopy-centric metrics and simplified radiative assumptions, yielding a scalable, assumption-light representation of forest architecture. Across sites, void configurations reflect underlying stand architecture. Forests with high structural heterogeneity—multi-layered canopies and irregular stem distributions—exhibit diffuse, vertically extensive voids. In contrast, structurally uniform stands contain more confined voids, largely restricted to lower strata because of diminished understory development. These patterns demonstrate that forest voids integrate overstory and understory attributes, providing a structural lens on spatial openness under diverse conditions. Although challenges in scalability and independent validation remain, extending this framework to multi-platform LiDAR will enable broader applications in biodiversity monitoring, habitat suitability, and climate-adaptation research. By formalizing forest-void quantification, our study advances structural complexity assessment and offers fresh insights into ecosystem dynamics and function."

 Desertification represents a critical threat to ecosystems, agriculture, and livelihoods in arid and semi-arid regions. This study provides a comprehensive analysis of the spatio-temporal evolution of desertification across Algeria’s steppic and northern Sahara regions from 2002 to 2022.

Our approach employed a derived composite index, the Vegetation Sparsity Index (VSI), along with intensity analysis, gravity center change, and regionalization-based clustering. The results showed that desertification dynamics in the study area are not uniform, but characterized by distinct phases of degradation and revegetation. Specifically, desertified areas expanded northward in the western and central regions from 2010, with the central western region, which is vital for agriculture and pastoralism, degraded beyond what rainfall trends alone would predict.

On average, HY-1E outperformed HY-1D by 0.13 m, Sentinel-2 10 m by 0.09 m, and Sentinel-2 20 m by 0.01 m in terms of RMSE. In waters shallower than 10 m, most HY-1E-derived bathymetric models met the ZOC C standard. In terms of terrain characterization, HY-1E demonstrated significant improvements in detail resolution over HY-1D and produced DBMs with lower noise levels compared to Sentinel-2.

 Net Primary Productivity (NPP) is a critical measure of ecosystem vitality. This paper examines the spatiotemporal variation in NPP across Africa during 1981–2018 using Theil-Sen slope estimation and wavelet analysis. Sustainable change characteristics in different regions are analyzed using the Hurst exponent, and the influence of driving factors on African NPP are quantified through a structural equation model (SEM). The analysis revealed that: (1) The annual variation curve of African NPP demonstrated a fluctuating upward trajectory (p = 0.001) throughout the study period. Wavelet analysis revealed a cyclical pattern with a primary period of about 20 years, characterized by two upward and downward transitions during 1981–2018. (2) Spatial analysis indicates the distribution of NPP across Africa is centered around the equator and gradually decreases towards higher latitudes, in which the NPP of tropical rainforest and its adjacent areas increases significantly, covering 40.2 % of Africa’s area. However, Hurst exponent analysis reveals that NPP in Africa generally exhibits anti-sustainability changes, with 52.8 % of the total area potentially shifting from growth to decline in the future. (3) SEM analysis shows that NPP in Africa is mainly regulated by natural factors, particularly cumulative precipitation and temperature extremes, which exhibit the highest impact coefficient of 0.89. While topographic factors also have a substantial overall effect, their impact is primarily indirect through climate, with minimal direct influence. These findings offer a scientific foundation and policy support for sustainable development of environmental and socio-economic systems in Africa."

 The limited availability of observational and reanalysis data presents a significant challenge in training machine learning (ML) models for seasonal climate forecasting. Here, we show that training ML-based seasonal forecasting models with a larger number of individual simulations from CMIP6 models enhances their generalization ability and improves precipitation forecasts over South America. Using TelNet, a sequence-to-sequence machine learning model, we assess the performance of models trained with different numbers of CMIP6 simulations compared to those trained with ERA5 reanalysis and the CMIP6 ensemble mean. The results reveal that models trained with only a few CMIP6 simulations perform worse than those trained with ERA5, primarily due to instability during ML model tuning and reduced generalization ability. However, as the number of CMIP6 models increases, performance improves and surpasses both ERA5- and ensemble-mean-based ML models. Reliability and sharpness diagrams analysis further demonstrate that ML models trained with more CMIP6 simulations yield more confident and calibrated forecasts. Moreover, CMIP6-based TelNet constantly outperformed state-of-the-art dynamical models across different initialization months and lead times.

However, the mechanisms behind this circulation anomaly remain uncertain. Using both observations and model simulations, we show that local sea ice loss and sea surface temperature warming are key contributors, explaining approximately 47% of the anomaly. These processes amplify local tropospheric warming relative to other Arctic regions, enhancing the horizontal gradient in thermal expansion and raising geopotential heights aloft, thereby strengthening the anticyclonic anomaly. Combined with evidence that the BKS anticyclonic anomaly itself drives local sea ice loss and warming, our results suggest a positive feedback loop, where the anomaly amplifies sea ice loss and warming, which in turn strengthens the anomaly. Although atmosphere‐only models cannot fully capture these feedbacks due to the lack of interactive ocean and sea ice components, they underscore the crucial role of local forcing in amplifying the circulation anomaly. These results challenge the view that the BKS anomaly is primarily internally generated and largely independent of sea ice loss. Under continued greenhouse warming, the BKS anticyclonic anomaly is likely to further strengthen, with important implications for climate in the Arctic and beyond."

Long‐term water scarcity often results in depletion of water resources in so‐called water scarcity hotspots.

This resulted in a network representing the causal relations between these variables and Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS). Recognizing the limitations of causal discovery, we supplemented the network with expert knowledge.

 Subsidence along expressways and railways poses significant risks to transportation infrastructure safety and environmental stability. Predicting ground settlement enables enhanced understanding of deformation characteristics along transportation corridors and facilitates timely warnings for high risk areas. This study focuses on the area within 50 km of the Jishishan earthquake epicenter, employing InSAR technology to obtain preseismic and postseismic surface deformation maps. Utilizing 35 preseismic and 21 postseismic Sentinel-1A descending orbit images from 2021 to 2024, we derived surface deformation rates through PS-InSAR and SBAS-InSAR time series analysis. The preseismic annual deformation rate was incorporated with 12 influencing factors including PGA for coseismic geological hazard susceptibility evaluation. A novel Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory model with attention mechanism (C-L-A) was developed for settlement forecasting by integrating deformation rate data. The results show, integrated analysis incorporating InSAR derived deformation velocities and seismic dynamic factors such as PGA significantly enhances geological hazard susceptibility assessment precision. Compared to conventional static evaluation models, the novel methodology achieves a 21 % reduction in the spatial extent of very high susceptibility zones while elevating the hazard occurrence frequency ratio by 33 %, effectively mitigating false alarm risks. This approach particularly highlight extreme hazard vulnerability in areas exhibiting annual deformation rates exceeding 30 mm. Time series InSAR monitoring unequivocally delineates regional deformation patterns: significant preseismic subsidence (reaching 118 mm/year) prevailed across the study area, while the coseismic deformation field (maximum uplift: 7.85 cm) confirms a thrust type earthquake with strike slip components, tectonically linked to the South Margin Fault of the Lajishan Mountains. Persistent postseismic uplift within a 25-km radius of the epicenter reflects ongoing stress adjustment processes. The proposed C-L-A land subsidence forecasting model demonstrates superior performance across critical metrics, including Δx(MAX) = 2.94 mm, MAE = 1.74 mm, MSE = 3.39 mm2, and RMSE = 1.84 mm, outperforming benchmark models (RF, CNN, LSTM, CNN-LSTM).

 On July 10, 2023, at 08:53 UTC, the CA1524 flight from Shanghai to Beijing encountered severe turbulence while circumventing a convective system. A large-eddy simulation (LES) of this turbulence event was conducted using radar observation data. The LES with a 100 m horizontal grid spacing successfully reproduced the temporal and spatial characteristics of the severe turbulence, including the intensity distribution of vertical velocity within the turbulence region. The simulation results revealed that the turbulence was closely associated with a sudden intensification of vertical motion within a local cloud cluster. Analysis of the vertical motion equation demonstrated that atmospheric buoyancy was the primary driver of the localized vertical motion enhancement. The turbulence region featured an upward-extending moist tongue, where converging water vapor condensed into cloud droplets, releasing latent heat and warming the surrounding air. This thermal effect further amplified atmospheric buoyancy, promoting the intensification of local vertical motion. The enhanced vertical motion, combined with downstream mountain waves, jointly facilitated the development of turbulence within the cloud cluster.

Using reanalysis data, we test two proposed pathways – one at the surface and one in the free troposphere – but find that neither is a dominant mechanism for stratocumulus variability on seasonal and interannual timescales. These results challenge the assumed influence of subtropical highs on stratocumulus and highlight the need for further research into lower-tropospheric stability dynamics. 
 Stratocumulus (Sc) covers the eastern flanks of maritime subtropical high-pressure systems, and changes in their coverage can exert a radiative effect on the global energy budget comparable to that of a doubling of CO2. Previous studies have identified the temperature difference between 700 hPa and the surface as the primary driver of Sc variability. However, the mechanistic linkages between subtropical highs and this critical temperature difference, which defines lower-tropospheric stability, remain unresolved. While subsidence modulates temperatures at 700 hPa and wind-driven cooling affects surface temperatures, the observed decoupling between subtropical highs and Sc fraction on seasonal to interannual timescales lacks a mechanical explanation. This study uses reanalysis data to test two hypothesized pathways linking subtropical highs to the lower-tropospheric stability. Results demonstrate that neither pathway dominates, as correlations between Sc-area temperatures and subtropical high dynamics exhibit strong regional and temporal dependencies. Additionally, Sc-area conditions do not systematically align with subtropical high variability, highlighting the need for further investigation into the dynamical processes governing temperatures in the lower troposphere."

The average Cr(VI) concentration did not exceed 0.40 ng m−3 and was maximum in winter, too (max 1.354 ng m−3). The Cr(VI) share in PM in the particular seasons varied from a low in summer (9.1 % of Crtot) to a high in winter (40 % of Crtot). The carcinogenic risk for the urban residents based on the Cr(VI) concentration in PM10 was below the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) threshold for significant risk (between 1 × 10−6 and 1 × 10−4) and amounted to between 1.11 × 10−6 and 5.78 × 10−6 for children and from 3.69 × 10−6 to 1.92 × 10−5 for adults. The non-carcinogenic health risk caused by the presence of Crtot was also lower than the safe level of 1 – the hazard quotient (HQ) values for both adults and children ranged from 1.32 × 10−2 to 3.92 × 10−2. The studies presented in the paper fill the research gap of Crtot and Cr(VI) measurements in particulate matter of different sizes in the air of a medium-sized city in central Poland."

It includes predictions for ten major physical and chemical soil properties at various depths, plus a map of total soil depth. For each property, we selected the most accurate models and key environmental drivers. In Southwestern Asia and many arid or semi-arid regions, detailed soil data are often missing. This dataset fills that gap, supporting agriculture, research, planning, and local policy. 
 We present the first detailed soil property maps at multiple depths for the northwestern autonomous Kurdistan region of Iraq (Dohuk). A total of 532 soil samples from 122 sites were collected at five depth increments (0–10, 10–30, 30–50, 50–70, and 70–100 cm), and their mid-infrared (MIR) spectra were measured. A subset of 108 samples, selected via Kennard–Stone sampling, was analysed in a laboratory on ten soil properties. A Cubist model was trained and used from these measured values to predict all samples’ soil properties from their MIR spectra. Digital soil mapping was conducted using various machine learning regression techniques (ensemble learning, linear classifier, nearest neighbour classifier, decision trees), trained on the predicted soil properties and using a total of 85 covariates at 25 m pixel resolution, resulting in 50 prediction maps in total. Results were compared with the SoilGrids 2.0 product and a regional texture model. Soil depth was also mapped using a quantile random forest with 26 covariates. Our regional model outperformed global SoilGrids 2.0 predictions in resolution and accuracy, with texture RMSEs (sand: ∑RMSE = 9.35; silt: ∑RMSE = 6.8; clay: ∑RMSE = 10.28) comparable to local models. Quantile random forest achieved the best performance in 51 % of the models, and key predictors included Sentinel 2 SWIR, EVI, NDVI, and SAVI. Spatial patterns reflected the contrast between the flat areas of the Simele and Zakho plains, as opposed to the shallower and steeper Little Khabur Valley and anticline formations. Furthermore, the soil depth prediction model (R2 = 0.57; RMSE = 2.59 cm-0.5) showed strong correlation with slope and a similar pattern distribution with deeper soils in the flat areas of the Simele and Zakho plains, while shallow soils are visible in the anticline and strongly erodible areas.

 Atmospheric Potential Oxygen (APO, defined as O2 + 1.1 × CO2) is primarily a tracer of ocean biogeochemistry and fossil fuel burning. APO exhibits strong seasonal variability at mid-to-high latitudes, driven mainly by seasonal air-sea O2 exchange. We present results from the first version of the Atmospheric Potential Oxygen forward Model Intercomparison Project (APO-MIP1), which forward transports three air-sea APO flux products in eight atmospheric transport models or model variants, aiming to evaluate atmospheric transport and flux representations by comparing simulations against surface station, airborne, and shipboard observations of APO. We find significant spread and bias in APO simulations at eastern Pacific surface stations, indicating inconsistencies in representing vertical and coastal atmospheric mixing. A framework using airborne APO observations demonstrates that most atmospheric transport models (ATMs) participating in APO-MIP1 overestimate tracer diffusive mixing across moist isentropes (i.e., diabatic mixing) in mid-latitudes. This framework also enables us to isolate ATM-related biases in simulated APO distributions using independent mixing constraints derived from moist static energy budgets from reanalysis, thereby allowing us to assess large-scale features in air-sea APO flux products. Furthermore, shipboard observations show that ATMs are unable to reproduce seasonal APO gradients over Drake Passage and near Palmer Station, Antarctica, which could arise from uncertainties in APO fluxes or model transport. The transport simulations and flux products from APO-MIP1 provide valuable resources for developing new APO flux inversions and evaluating ocean biogeochemical processes."

The current REE supply relies on energy- and chemical-intensive mining, prompting interest in alternative sources like phosphogypsum (PG) waste. However, using conventional solvent extraction to recover REEs in PG is inefficient and environmentally burdensome. This study proposes a treatment train for REE recovery from PG, featuring a bioinspired adsorptive separation, and evaluates its environmental and economic performance using a probabilistic sustainability framework that integrates life cycle assessment (LCA) and techno-economic analysis (TEA). Results show the system achieves an internal rate of return (IRR) above 15% in 87% of simulations, suggesting strong profitability potential. Environmentally, it outperforms conventional REE mining and PG treatment in ecosystem quality and resource depletion but shows higher human health impacts. Scenario analysis reveals profitability at processing capacities over 100 000 kg·h–1 for PG with REE content above 0.5 wt %. However, more dilute sources (0.02–0.1 wt %) are not viable under current conditions due to acid and neutralization costs. This study offers the first in-depth sustainability assessment of REE recovery from PG waste and highlights key areas for future process development to improve access to low-grade sources and enhance environmental outcomes."

The red fluorescence was  observed in tobacco leaf cells, providing evidence that Cy3-siRNA-PS has successfully traversed the cell wall barrier and been internalized. Meanwhile, the targeted siRNA-PS effectively induces pronounced fluorescence quenching of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in tobacco leaves, decreasing by 97.6% after 24 h. Similarly, the vibrant red flowers of glory were tuned to a faded state through the manipulation of color-controlled genes, particularly the mRNA expression of chalcone isomerase (CHI) reduced by 69.4%.

The SGD process involves the flow of fresh, saline, or mixed groundwater from coastal aquifers into the oceans classified in different components. Existing studies rarely report the fluxes supplied by the different SGD components; therefore, the relevance of SGD as a source of mercury remains unclear. We aimed to quantify SGD-driven mercury/methylmercury fluxes to the coast, focusing on the largest coastal lagoon in the western Mediterranean. We measured total dissolved mercury and MeHg in surficial and porewaters during the summer and autumn. Porewaters were enriched in total dissolved Hg and MeHg compared to the lagoon. Lagoon shore waters and porewaters with a high concentration of labile dissolved organic matter were prone to MeHg formation and thus had higher MeHg concentrations. The mercury input through SGD to the Mar Menor lagoon (4300 mmol year–1) was similar to atmospheric deposition and 1 order of magnitude greater than the stream input. Among different components of the SGD,  long-scale lagoon water recirculation dominated. These findings have substantial implications for the regional Hg budget and raise awareness of the importance of considering the different SGD components for an accurate estimation of SGD-based Hg input to the coastal ocean."

This study validated the concentration-additive mixture effects of ambient PM2.5 fractions on in vitro interleukin-8 (IL-8) induction, enabling quantification of the role of endotoxin from Gram-negative bacteria in IL-8 induction by PM2.5 from contrasting environments. Endotoxin consistently contributed to PM2.5-induced IL-8 at both the coastal site (0.1–10%) and the urban site (0.1–17%), far exceeding its mass fraction in PM2.5 (<0.0001%). Among reported components, endotoxin demonstrated the highest toxicity-to-mass contribution ratio (10,000:1–100,000:1) due to its high potency. This suggests that reducing PM2.5 toxicity may not necessarily require a proportional reduction in its mass. The sources of Gram-negative bacteria shifted from predominantly natural origins at the coastal site (natural-to-anthropogenic ratio of 1.6:1) to increasing anthropogenic contributions at the urban site (natural-to-anthropogenic ratio of 0.7:1). These anthropogenic sources, including the built environment, sewage treatment, and humans, fall outside conventional pollution-intensive categories.

This manuscript presents an image processing pipeline developed to adapt ARTiMiS, a low-cost automated flow-imaging device, for real-time algal monitoring in natural freshwater systems. This pipeline addresses several challenges associated with autonomous imaging of aquatic samples, such as flow-imaging artifacts (i.e., out-of-focus and background objects), as well as strategies to efficiently identify novel objects that are not represented in the training data set; the latter is a common challenge with the application of deep learning approaches for image classification in environmental systems. The pipeline leverages a random forest model to identify out-of-focus particles with an accuracy of 89% and a custom background particle detection algorithm to identify and remove particles that erroneously appear in consecutive images with >97 ± 2.8% accuracy. Furthermore, a convolutional neural network (CNN), trained to classify taxonomical classes, achieved 95% accuracy in a closed set classification. Nonetheless, the supervised closed-set classifiers struggled with the accurate classification of objects when challenged with novel particles, which are common in complex natural environments; this limits real-time monitoring applications by requiring extensive manual oversight. To mitigate this, three methods incorporating classification with rejection were tested to improve model precision by flagging irrelevant or unknown classes. Combined, these advances present a fully integrated, end-to-end solution for real-time HAB monitoring in natural freshwater systems, which enhances the scalability of automated detection in dynamic aquatic environments."

Notably, optimal AON-informed machine learning models achieved an accuracy above 0.95 and identified amide, aromatic/polycyclic, and nitrogen-containing structures as obesity-related. In addition, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were identified as prime candidate obesogens, inducing metabolic syndrome by interfering with all three signaling pathways across the AONs.

Then we utilized a generalized additive model (GAM) to estimate the comprehensive and segmented impacts of LFI on scrub typhus incidence in China, grouping the results by year, land use type and fragmentation level. Additionally, we projected changes in such impacts under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs), including SSP1‐2.6, SSP2‐4.5, SSP3‐7.0, and SSP5‐8.5. Key results were: (a) The LFI exhibited a nonlinear positive correlation with scrub typhus incidence. Each 0.1 increase in the LFI was associated with a relative risk of 1.20 (95% CI:1.19–1.21) for scrub typhus. Notably, at higher fragmentation levels, scrub typhus incidence tended to decrease. (b) Forest fragmentation had the most significant impact on scrub typhus, followed by cropland fragmentation, whereas construction land fragmentation was negatively associated. (c) The future areas of elevated scrub typhus risk varied among the SSPs, but they were mainly concentrated at the interface between urban expansion and natural habitats.

Here, the authors demonstrate that unusually curved graphene crystallites exhibit rapid ion transport dynamics and enable the fabrication of thin electrodes for compact energy and power delivery. 
 Supercapacitors deliver high power but are limited in compact applications by low volumetric energy and power densities. Two-dimensional materials like graphene, despite their high packing density, are hindered by poor ion transport kinetics. A rapid thermal annealing step generates unusually curved turbostratic graphene crystallites, integrated and interwoven within disordered domains in micron-size particles to yield multiscale graphene. Ion insertion into the interlayers enables precise pore-ion matching and partial charge transfer, enabling a high Brunauer-Emmett-Teller surface area-normalized capacitance of 85 µF/cm2. Here, we show that multiscale graphene exhibits rapid ion transport dynamics within the curved crystallites and disordered domains. When the thin electrodes are assembled into symmetric pouch cell devices, they deliver a stack-level volumetric energy density of 99.5 Wh/L in ionic liquid electrolytes and 49.2 Wh/L in organic electrolyte with a high power density of 69.2 kW/L at 9.6 Wh/L.

 Valproate is highly effective at treating epilepsy and bipolar disorder. It faces prescribing restrictions in men due to concerns it causes testicular dysfunction and infertility. These mostly stem from animal models – the human evidence is limited and conflicting. We report the largest ever retrospective cohort study of infertility in men with epilepsy or bipolar disorder, using real-world healthcare data from TriNetX. 91,917 of the men are exposed to valproate, and 535,803 unexposed. Cohorts are propensity score matched for a comprehensive set of baseline covariates, and survival analysis is undertaken using Cox-proportional hazards models. No significant difference is seen between valproate-exposed and unexposed men across lifetime risks of infertility, testicular hypofunction, testicular atrophy, and a composite of low sperm concentration, motility, vitality, normal forms, and semen volume (p > 0.05).

 The P2X7 receptor is an ATP-gated ion channel that activates inflammatory pathways involved in diseases such as cancer, atherosclerosis, and neurodegeneration. However, despite the potential benefits of blocking overactive signaling, no P2X7 receptor antagonists have been approved for clinical use. Understanding species-specific pharmacological effects of existing antagonists has been challenging, in part due to the dearth of molecular information on receptor orthologs. Here, to identify distinct molecular features in the human receptor, we determine high-resolution cryo-EM structures of the full-length wild-type human P2X7 receptor in apo closed and ATP-bound open state conformations and draw comparisons with structures of other orthologs. We also report a cryo-EM structure of the human receptor in complex with an adamantane-based inhibitor, which we leverage, in conjunction with functional data and molecular dynamics simulations, to design a potent and selective antagonist with a unique polycyclic scaffold. Functional and structural analysis reveal how this optimized ligand, termed UB-MBX-46, interacts with the classical allosteric pocket of the human P2X7 receptor with subnanomolar potency and high selectivity, revealing its significant therapeutic potential.

 Initially anode-free sodium metal batteries offer a high energy density at lower costs than lithium-ion batteries, making them a promising alternative for portable electronics, transportation, and power grids. However, side reactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface hinder their practical applications. Our study reveals that negative electrode stability is primarily influenced by the solvents in the cation’s first solvation shell, whereas positive electrode stability is dictated by weakly bonded solvents. Based on this insight, we introduce an electrolyte design strategy to selectively direct 2-methyltetrahydrofuran to the Na metal electrode and tetrahydrofuran to the NaNi1/3Fe1/3Mn1/3O2 positive electrode interface, optimizing stability for both electrodes. With this tailored electrolyte, we achieve an average Coulombic efficiency of 99.91% in Na | |Cu cells for 400 cycles at 1 mA/cm2 with 1 mAh/cm2 and demonstrate stable Na plating/stripping for 5000 h at 2 mA/cm² with 2 mAh/cm2 in Na | |Na cells.

 Continental Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary sections are best known from North America, where they invariably exhibit a marked shift in sedimentary facies at or very near the boundary level. Uppermost Cretaceous strata typically reflect water-logged soils and unstable meandering-river deposits, whereas lowermost Paleogene strata typically reflect coal swamps and broad, stable meander-belt deposits. Causal links between facies shifts at the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary and the end-Cretaceous mass extinction have been largely dismissed. Here, we present five new Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary sections identified via iridium anomalies in the Bighorn and Williston basins and assess the sedimentological changes that occur at North American Cretaceous-Paleogene boundaries. We hypothesize that the geographically widespread Cretaceous–Paleogene facies shifts were driven by the extinction of dinosaur megafauna. Large-bodied dinosaurs likely promoted open vegetation structure, prompting fluvial avulsion and clastic sediment input to distal floodplains. After the end-Cretaceous mass extinction, dense forests could establish, stabilizing meander belts and starving the floodplain of clastic sediment, favoring the accumulation of organic-rich strata. More empirical data are needed, but facies change in continental Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary sections suggests dinosaurs were ecosystem engineers that promoted habitat openness in the Late Cretaceous, and their extinction likely led to a dramatic reorganization of ecosystem structure in the earliest Paleogene.

 As a part of Michigan's efforts to identify and address per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) contamination statewide, more knowledge of atmospheric PFAS concentrations is needed to better understand their atmospheric transport and impact on other environmental media. This research aimed to measure atmospheric concentrations of PFAS in Michigan's ambient air using low-cost and easy-to-use passive samplers and identify relationships with environmental factors. Passive samplers, consisting of polyurethane foam (PUF) discs and sorbent-filled polyethylene tubes (radiello-XAD samplers), were deployed for a month at 27 sites across Michigan and analyzed for both ionic and volatile, neutral PFAS. Short chain perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), specifically perfluoropropanoic acid (PFPrA) (d.f. 60 %) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) (d.f. 96 %), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (d.f. 63 %) were the most frequently detected compounds, with the ∑3PFAS ranging from non-detect to 15.5 pg/m3 for the PUFs and from non-detect to 248 pg/m3 in the radiello-XAD samplers. 6:2 fluorotelomer alcohol was also frequently detected (d.f. 45 %) and had a positive correlation with both population density (r = 0.52, p < .05) and industrial sites' density (r = 0.48, p < .05). Detection of specific compounds on each type of sampler provided insight into the preferential transport pathway of atmospheric PFAS. For example, PFOS was observed mostly in the gas-phase, predominantly captured by the radiello-XAD samplers, while PFBA was mostly in the particle-phase, predominantly captured by the PUFs.

 Using the WRF model, this study investigates the impact mechanisms of surface evaporation—including three types (direct soil evaporation, canopy evaporation, and vegetation transpiration), evaporation rates, and re-evaporation of prior precipitation on the “08·24” heavy rainfall event in the Three-River-Headwater Region of Tibet Plateau. Results demonstrate that eliminating direct soil evaporation significantly reduces afternoon scattered precipitation during the development stage (due to suppressed land surface moisture flux under peak solar radiation), while suppressing vegetation transpiration decreases precipitation across all stages (via disrupted moisture supply from stomatal conductance). Canopy evaporation primarily affects precipitation during the mature and dissipation stages (by releasing intercepted water within hours post-precipitation). Increasing evaporation rates enhances precipitation (maximum more than 40 % during the development stage). Crucially, re-evaporation of former precipitation sustains rainfall in mature/dissipation stages (through moisture recycling of precipitation). Sensitivity experiments quantify stage-specific conversions in the water vapor-hydrometeor-precipitation chain and establish a novel conceptual model of precipitation-evaporation feedback, providing the first mechanistic insights into heterogeneous evaporation controls on extreme rainfall in high-altitude “water towers”."

 The expansion of arid lands is one of the most critical environmental threats of the century, driven by climate change and unsustainable human activities. In Brazil, recent climatic shifts suggest an expansion of arid and semi-arid zones beyond the traditionally vulnerable Northeast region. While prior research has emphasized long-term climatological trends focused in that region, this study adopts non-stationary approaches to examine year-by-year aridity class frequencies from 1961 to 2020 across the entirety of Brazil. It also distinguishes the relative influence of precipitation (P) and potential evapotranspiration (PET) on observed aridity index (AI) changes. Our results reveal an expansion of roughly 30 % of dryland conditions across Brazil over the past 30 years, extending beyond the traditionally semi-arid Northeast into the Southeast, and an emerging hotspot in the Pantanal, potentially linked with larger scale South American aridization trends. The increasing annual frequency of arid and semi-arid classifications, particularly in emerging zones, suggests a persistent shift towards drier climates. This pattern seems to be driven primarily by declining P and secondarily by rising PET (temperature). By analyzing annual frequencies, we uncover a creeping aridity process, which directly converses with updated desertification risk assessments and climate adaptation strategies in Brazil, such as the ‘Brazilian Action Plan to Combat Desertification and Mitigate the Effects of Drought’."

 Accurate sunshine duration (SD) estimation is vital for large-scale, dynamic applications, such as agricultural planning, urban development, and solar energy optimization. Ground-based observations, with their sparse stations and limited coverage, often fall short of meeting these requirements. In contrast, satellite-based methods, particularly those utilizing high spatial resolution data, have become increasingly important in addressing these limitations. To address the need for enhanced precision and coverage, this study developed an AI-driven framework using high-resolution Himawari-8 L1 Gridded data for the first time. By integrating multiple machine learning models with a stacked generalization algorithm, the framework enables seamless and highly accurate SD estimation. The proposed method demonstrates significant potential for wide-spread application. Tests conducted in Jiangxi Province China have confirmed its reliability. The model achieved a high R2 of 0.969, with RMSE and MAE of 0.752 and 0.519 h, respectively. We further analyzed the distribution of SD across different land-use types. The results indicate that croplands and forests are predominantly located in areas with longer SD, reflecting the adaptive choices made by human activities and ecosystems in response to sunlight conditions. This finding suggests that SD can serve as a critical reference for the planning of croplands and forestlands. Moreover, it provides robust data support and scientific guidance for future regional land-use optimization, sustainable agricultural development, and renewable energy planning."

Results show that the method to constrain decadal predictions improves the forecast skill over the Niño3.4 region up to 12 months and enhances the near-surface temperature predictions over broad parts of the globe, with modest improvements in precipitation. This work highlights the practical potential of combining seasonal and decadal prediction systems and offers a first step toward operational, seamless climate services across monthly to multi-year timescales."

While localized salinity anomalies—particularly in the central and eastern TIO (CTIO and ETIO)—are well-documented, their basin-wide connection under the influence of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) remains unclear. This study advances the salt diagnostics based on leading mode and associated salt budget to robustly reveal the IOD-driven mechanisms on salinity’s basin-wide connections using observation and simulation. Results indicate that a coherent seesaw mode connects CTIO and Western Bay of Bengal (BoB) salinity anomalies during the IOD mature phase (September–November), with its principal component and associated localized salinity anomaly strongly correlated with the Dipole Mode Index. Composite analysis and wave diagnostics reveal two key mechanisms. First, anomalous cyclonic/anticyclonic circulations co-develop in CTIO and BoB during IOD events, driving salt advection aligned with mean salinity gradients and shaping the leading salinity pattern. Second, IOD-induced oceanic waves—both remote and local—jointly generate current anomalies that enhance salinity tendencies. In particular, equatorial easterlies during positive IOD events force upwelling Kelvin waves that propagate into the BoB, reinforcing anticyclonic salt advection and producing high salinity anomalies. Concurrently, local wind over the CTIO drives equatorial upwelling Kelvin and downwelling Rossby waves to constructively strengthen westward equatorial current and southern anticlockwise circulation, leading to anomalous freshening. These findings improve our understanding of IOD-induced hydrological variability and support better predictability of coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics in the TIO."

The resulting patterns fall into two broad categories: negative sea ice anomalies, occurring more frequently after 2005, and positive anomalies, more common prior to 2005. Differences among the modes within each category are primarily driven by sea ice variability in the Bering Sea, Sea of Okhotsk, Labrador Sea, and Greenland Sea during boreal winter and spring. Warmer temperatures, increased longwave radiation, and southerly winds favor reduced sea ice, while cooler conditions and northerly winds support increased ice cover. These atmospheric anomalies are often linked to tropical Pacific sea surface temperature variability, which influences Arctic conditions via poleward-propagating Rossby wave trains triggered by changes in tropical convection. Our findings enhance the basis for seasonal, interannual, and decadal predictions of Arctic sea ice."

Here we propose a new carbon accumulation protocol by integrating deep carbon from Yedoma deposits and representing the observed history of peat carbon formation in ORCHIDEE-MICT. Our results show an additional 157 Pg C in present-day Yedoma deposits and a 1–5 m shallower peat depth and 43 % less passive soil carbon in peatlands compared to the conventional protocol. 
 Field measurements, after extrapolation, suggest that deep Yedoma deposits (ice-rich, organic-rich permafrost, formed during the late Pleistocene) and peatlands (formed mostly during the Holocene) account for about 600 Pg C of soil carbon storage. Incorporating this old, deep, cold carbon into land surface models (LSMs) is crucial for accurately quantifying soil carbon responses to future warming. However, it remains underrepresented or absent in current LSMs, which typically include a passive soil carbon pool (a conceptual soil carbon pool with the longest turnover time) to represent all “old carbon” and lack the vertical accumulation processes that deposited deep carbon in the layers of peatlands and Yedoma deposits. In this study, we propose a new, more realistic protocol for simulating deep and cold carbon accumulation in the northern high latitudes (30–90° N), using the ORCHIDEE-MICT (ORganizing Carbon and Hydrology in Dynamic EcosystEms–aMeliorated Interactions between Carbon and Temperature) model. This is achieved by (1) integrating deep carbon from Yedoma deposits whose formation is calculated using Last Glacial Maximum climate conditions and (2) prescribing the inception time and location of northern peatlands during the Holocene using spatially explicit data on peat age. Our results show an additional 157 Pg C in present-day Yedoma deposits, as well as a shallower peat carbon depth (by 1–5 m) and a smaller passive soil carbon pool (by 35 Pg C, 43 %) in northern peatlands, compared to the old protocol that ignored Yedoma deposits and applied a uniform, long-duration (13 500 years) peat carbon accumulation across all peatlands. As a result, the total organic carbon stock across the Northern Hemisphere (30–90° N) simulated by the new protocol is 2028 Pg C, which is 226 Pg C higher than the previous estimate. Despite the significant challenge of simulating deep carbon with ORCHIDEE-MICT, the improvements in the representation of carbon accumulation from this study provide a model version to predict deep carbon evolution during the last glacial–deglacial transition and its response to future warming. The methodology implemented for deep carbon initialization in permafrost and cold regions in ORCHIDEE-MICT is also applicable to other LSMs."

 Advances in performance and analysis capabilities have accelerated the development of object tracking algorithms for atmospheric research. This has resulted in a growing number of studies using Lagrangian tracking techniques to analyze the evolution of atmospheric phenomena and the underlying processes. However, the increasing complexity and variety of tracking algorithms present a steep learning curve for new users and make it difficult for existing users to compare algorithm performance.We introduce CoCoMET (Community Cloud Model Evaluation Toolkit), an open-source toolkit that addresses these issues. CoCoMET simplifies the process of running multiple tracking algorithms simultaneously and analyzing objects in both model and observational datasets by specifying parameters in a single configuration file. It standardizes input data from different sources into a consistent format and unifies the tracking output across algorithms. CoCoMET enhances the functionality of existing tracking methods by calculating additional properties such as cell growth and dissipation rates, perimeter, surface area, convexity, and irregularity. In addition, CoCoMET includes a novel method for identifying mergers and splits in 2D and 3D tracks and supports the integration of Eulerian/stationary datasets external to the tracking data for process studies. Its potential utility is demonstrated through examples of model intercomparison, model evaluation against observations, and comparisons between tracking algorithms.

We introduce a model that includes economic, social, and environmental factors that influence dietary choices. This helps us understand how behaviour shifts impact future emissions and climate conditions. By considering a range of plausible behaviours, we provide a more accurate picture of potential outcomes, improving representations in climate models. 
 Integrated assessment models (IAMs) occupy a central role in understanding and assessing the intricate interlinkages within the human-climate system for informing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. However, there has been limited work on explicitly representing the internal social system dynamics that underlie human behavioural responses to climate change within IAMs. Instead, behavioural change and demand-side strategies are assessed with external, non-probabilistic narrative-based scenario analyses. In this paper, we introduce an alternative fully endogenous behavioural change modelling framework within the FRIDA v2.1 model, operationalized with the system dynamics method. Applied to the context of dietary behaviour, the framework models behavioural change as a function of perceived accessibility, descriptive norm, and personal norms, constrained by accessibility and past behaviour. By doing so, it captures the complex social-economic-cultural-environmental feedback processes within the human-climate system that dynamically determine per capita food demand and consumption. Our simulation results show that endogenizing human behaviour leads to lower future demand projections compared to the more prevalent GDP-driven modelling approach. This demonstrates the significant impact of behavioural feedbacks on emission behaviours and thus climate outcomes. Importantly, using an uncertainty approach, our results account for a range of plausible behaviours within the 95 % confidence bounds, which includes scenarios where we observe reversals of sustainable behavioural change in the future. We contribute to the limited work on human behaviour in IAMs, extending the complexity of current representations. Future work will extend this framework to other domains of high-impact behaviours, enhancing the robustness of IAMs for assessing demand-side mitigation."

From 2000 to 2020, >20% of the North and southeastern Atlantic showed significant increases (p < 0.05) in viral functional gene abundance, whereas 61% of the northwestern Atlantic decreased. These shifts covaried with MP accumulation, nutrient regimes, and climate indices. In a northwestern Atlantic hotspot, neglecting MPs may lead to a ∼15% underestimation of viral functional gene abundance. In low-chlorophyll (Chl) regions (57.6% of the ocean), genes linked to carbon, nitrogen, and sulfur cycling were >30% more abundant in high- versus low-MP regions; MPs did not strongly affect the abundance of viral functional genes. Network analyses revealed cascading interactions among viral functional gene abundance, MPs, Fe, Chl, and environmental properties. Our results suggest that ignoring MPs may lead to the underestimation of viral functional potential and related biogeochemical processes, and that low-Chl regions─proposed priority protection areas─are particularly vulnerable to MPs pollution."

The formation of ion pairs between PFAS and cationic surfactants was tested through controlled batch experiments with varying types and dose of HIP (e.g., cetyltrimethylammonium chloride (CTAC)) and surface tension measurements. Interactions between PFAS and CTAC were observed to be disturbed in high ionic strength solution, likely due to competitive electrostatic interactions from the presence of inorganic ions. Addition of CTAC (2 μM) prior to GAC treatment in batch adsorption experiments greatly improved the sorption of short-chain PFAS (<C7) by 54–111% but suppressed the sorption of long-chain PFAS (>C7) by 23–96%. The changes in sorption capacities were hypothesized to result from the altered physicochemical properties of the formed ion pair complex, thereby affecting its uptake on GAC. Both the linear free energy relationship (LFER) calculation and molecular dynamic (MD) simulation suggested that short-chain PFAS sorption was improved via enhanced hydrophobicity of formed ion pairs with a low self-assembly tendency, while long-chain PFAS sorption was inhibited due to the formation of large complexes with a high self-assembly tendency. Rapid small-scale column tests were performed for tap water spiked with an equal mass of perfluorobutanoate (PFBA), perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS), and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS).

We measured eight PFAS in maternal plasma collected 24–72 h postpartum using HPLC–MS/MS and mtDNAcn in cord blood using targeted sequencing. We used multivariable linear regression and Bayesian kernel machine regression models to estimate associations between PFAS and mtDNAcn Z-score, overall and stratified by newborn sex and maternal folate level. We observed that associations varied by PFAS species, including an inverse association with PFOS and nonlinear associations with Me-PFOSA-AcOH, PFDeA, and PFNA. Associations of PFHxS and PFOS with mtDNAcn differed by sex. Notably, we found inverse associations of Me-PFOSA-AcOH, PFOS, and the PFAS mixture only among newborns whose mothers had low folate levels.

However, whether and how PFOA and PFOS affect human placentation and placental-specific functions remains unclear. In this study, we reconstructed a human trophoblast organoid model, incorporating a near-physiological proportion of extravillous trophoblast (EVT). The organoids were exposed to PFOA or PFOS for 7 days. Exposure to PFOA at 10 nM significantly increased the proportion of villous cytotrophoblast (CTB) cells, while reducing the proportion of EVT and syncytiotrophoblast (STB) cells at 10 and 100 nM, respectively. A similar pattern was observed with PFOS, albeit at concentrations 10 times higher than those of PFOA. Mechanistically, both PFOA and PFOS inhibited trophoblast differentiation by antagonizing the transcriptional activity of cAMP response element-binding protein (CREB). This disruption in placentation impaired placental function, as evidenced by significantly decreasing hormone secretion and invasion potential. Our investigation may provide mechanistic insight into the association of PFOA and PFOS with low birth weight observed in epidemiological studies, with PFOA demonstrating a stronger effect than PFOS.

In this study, the influence of different HA concentrations on the structural evolution of nZVI,  synchronous •OH generation, and arsenite [As(III)] sequestration was investigated. While HA did not alter the types of evolutionary products, it accelerated zerovalent iron (Fe0) corrosion. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure and density functional theory calculation revealed that adsorbed-HA extended the Fe–O bonds in the nZVI surface, causing the compact passivation layer to rupture and the inner Fe0 to expose. This structural destabilization, along with reduced nZVI aggregation induced by HA, promoted the continuous corrosion of Fe0. Furthermore, quantitative analysis by high performance liquid chromatography demonstrated that HA enhanced •OH production in the nZVI system by up to 7-fold, due to the increased Fe(II)/Fe(II)–HA concentrations in solution. In addition, rapid Fe0 corrosion facilitated more •OH-mediated oxidation of As(III) to arsenate [As(V)] at pH 6.0, whereas at pH 9.0, it resulted in faster As(III) sequestration by generating new adsorption sites and enhancing As–Fe coprecipitation.

Recent studies have found that ferroptosis, an iron-dependent form of regulated cell death characterized by lipid peroxidation and glutathione depletion, may play a critical role in the dissemination of ARGs among environmental microbes. Here, we demonstrated for the first time that phthalate esters (PAEs) and their substitutes significantly enhanced plasmid conjugation by triggering ferroptosis-related pathways. Classical ferroptosis-associated responses, including the hyperpolarization of the cell membrane potential, elevated production of reactive oxygen species, and heightened membrane permeability, were observed under the stress of PAEs or their substitutes. Through integrated transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we revealed that these compounds triggered iron dysregulation via the upregulation of iron acquisition and storage pathways while suppressing DNA replication, concurrently causing oxidative damage that stimulated the plasmid conjugation. Molecular docking simulations revealed that PAEs and their substitutes competitively disrupted the functionality of ferric uptake regulator (Fur) protein, a master controller of intracellular iron homeostasis, with superior binding affinity than its natural ligand Fe2+. Integrated metagenomic sequencing and homology analyses demonstrated the conservation of Fur protein across biofilm microbiota and functional implications in iron homeostasis. Structural analysis based on the characteristic molecular fingerprints of chemicals pinpointed aliphatic chains as the crucial structure responsible for enhancing ARG propagation between bacteria.

Using bacteriophage MS2 as a model, this study explores the impact of progressive inoculant purification processing by centrifugation, filtration, and ultrafiltration, on photoinactivation rates. Faster inactivation kinetics under UVB radiation correlated with greater presence of background proteins as identified via sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Differences in the determined rate constants were large and statistically significant, nearing a 70% increase from the lowest to highest protein presence. Variations remained even after 100× dilution of viral stock preparations. Furthermore, the likely basis was determined to be an indirect inactivation mechanism via sensitization of host or media proteins in the solution background, as evidenced by the inclusion of singlet oxygen scavenger l-histidine, which resulted in a clustering of reaction rates near the ultracentrifuged sample. These experiments highlight the methodological importance of performing and confirming inoculant purification prior to performing photoinactivation experiments, particularly when isolation of the endogenous pathway is important for practical or mechanistic conclusions, while demonstrating the notable contribution of proteins to the exogenous pathway."

They also drove differences in distance moved, whereas males showed no consistent spatial preference and indifferent activity at the highest field strength. These sex-specific responses suggest SPC EMFs could disrupt female-driven reproductive behaviors like seasonal migrations and larval release. Attraction may cause disorientation, aggregation, or delays in migration, potentially altering sex ratios and reducing larval export. This study provides the first evidence of sex-specific EMF responses in crustaceans and highlights the importance of incorporating sex as a key variable in ecological risk assessments of offshore infrastructure."

These particles may grow into cloud condensation nuclei and influence the clouds and climate. However, little is known about the individual species driving growth and whether they undergo condensed-phase reactions. We conducted isoprene oxidation experiments at 223 and 243 K in the CLOUD chamber at CERN. Gas-phase concentrations were measured with chemical ionization mass spectrometers (NO3–-CIMS, Br–-MION2-CIMS, and NH4+-CIMS). Growth rates from 8 to 20 nm were measured by a Neutral Cluster and Air Ion Spectrometer. Particle-phase composition was measured by a filter sampling chemical ionization mass spectrometer. We use the diagonal volatility basis set (dVBS) analysis framework to compare gas- and particle-phase measurements and assess species and processes influencing growth. We find that kinetically limited condensation of a few species dominates particle composition and growth. Particle-phase processes, including oligomerization and organonitrate hydrolysis, do not influence the early growth. dVBS growth rate predictions can explain 90% of the measured growth, dominated by kinetic condensation of low-volatility species. Our findings indicate that initial growth of IP-OOM particles under cold, low-acid conditions may be controlled and modeled by the kinetically limited condensation of low-volatility compounds."

In recent years, the biotoxicity of micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) has been extensively investigated using animal models. However, most studies and reports have not sufficiently explored the specific mechanisms of biological hazards. Here, we summarize several mechanisms through which MNPs induce brain injury. These studies indicate that the application of interdisciplinary technologies has enhanced toxicological investigations of these tiny particles, helping to clarify their underlying mechanisms. For example, the use of brain in vivo imaging technology enables real-time monitoring of MNPs in living mice, facilitating the observation and recording of their functional processes and elucidating their toxicological effects. To advance in this field, it is essential to incorporate high-definition imaging technology, organoids, bioinformatics, big data analysis, and other innovations into micro- and nanoplastic toxicology research.

By using discrete element method, we explore how the pinning points affect the level ice motion and develop a first‐order theory to evaluate their impact on ice dynamics. Results show that maximum level ice resistance occurs at the onset of ice motion, when total resistance equals the sum of all turbines, followed by a drop as wakes from upstream turbines reach the downstream ones during linear ice motion.

This study demonstrates that the decadal transition in winter SWS across China is primarily attributed to the internal mode associated with the Warm Arctic−Cold Eurasia (WACE) pattern. Removing the WACE−related SWS change causes the internal component of the SWS trend to reduce by approximately 25.0%. Enhancing the simulation of the WACE pattern improves the decadal transition prediction of SWS. In the near future, the contribution of the WACE pattern to the SWS trend reaches about 21.4%, and the forcing scenario has a negligible influence on the results. The WACE−related uncertainty in the global climate model could be an important source of reducing the WACE's contribution.

In this study, we assess the impact of orographic drag on East Asia rainfall by comparing the impact of a new orographic drag scheme that considers 3D orographic anisotropy (3D‐oro) with a 2‐D scheme in a general circulation model. Two sets of simulations (medium‐range and seasonal forecast) are carried out for the comparison and validation against observation. It is shown that through local/remote forcing of the drag in the mountainous regions, the 3D‐oro alleviates part of the excessive rainfall in west Tibetan Plateau and parts of insufficient rainfall in Southeast China by about 25%∼50% in the January/winter forecasts; it alleviates about 25%∼50% of the rainfall bias in part of south Tibetan Plateau and of East Asia in the July/summer forecasts.

Future projections indicate a weakening of the AMOC in response to increased greenhouse gas concentrations. In this study, we investigate the impact of AMOC weakening on South America's mean climate, as well as temperature and precipitation extremes. We analyze targeted sensitivity experiments using the EC‐Earth3 climate model. Our findings reveal that AMOC weakening induces cooling and wetting in the tropics of South America, contrasted by warming and dryness in the extratropics. This pattern weakens the meridional temperature gradient, shifts the intertropical convergence zone and the high‐latitude winter and summer jets southward, and reduces midlatitude storm tracks, particularly in austral winter. We analyze extreme events in two representative regions—La Plata Basin and northeast Brazil—which exhibit contrasting responses. In La Plata Basin, summer heat waves become more frequent, intense, and prolonged, while winter cold spells occur more frequently but with decreased intensity and duration when the AMOC reduces. In contrast, northeast Brazil experiences an increase in the frequency and intensity of heat waves, while cold spells become less frequent but more intense. Extreme precipitation events weaken in the La Plata Basin but intensify in northeast Brazil in both seasons under AMOC weakening. Some of these climate impacts may exacerbate global warming effects, while others may partially offset them. These findings underscore the critical need to refine climate models' representation of AMOC dynamics to improve predictions of future climate scenarios."

However, climate change and global warming are altering the patterns in meteorological data, leading to gradual shifts in the statistical characteristics of climate variables. Existing statistical downscaling approaches primarily focus on fitting historical data while neglecting the integration of essential physical laws governing atmospheric dynamics. Although these models may perform well on past data, they risk losing accuracy when applied to future climate scenarios, particularly when faced with climate shifts or changing conditions. To address this challenge, we introduce a physics‐informed framework to downscale continuous temperature fields. Our framework is designed to decompose the temperature fields into a primary deterministic component and stochastic residual component, each modeled by distinct parts of the architecture. The deterministic component reconstructs the primary temperature field, whereas the stochastic diffusion component captures small‐scale details and uncertainties. Moreover, this framework integrates vertical dynamics by incorporating physical priors derived from the fundamental temperature variation equation, combined through zero convolution, and applied as physics priors in the downscaling process using a 3D U‐Net architecture as the encoder. The model's loss function includes Charbonnier loss for data fitting along with static stability loss, gradient loss, and coupling loss to ensure physical consistency and accurate vertical interaction representation. Comparative experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms traditional techniques, reducing the error between downscaled results and high‐resolution observations to 0.627 K compared to 1.394 K with bicubic interpolation."

Although ice sheet expansion and sea level fall often exert coupled influences on Hadley circulation changes, most existing studies have focused on ice sheet and overlooked the role of sea level fall. Here, using climate simulations based the Norwegian Earth System Model (NorESM1‐F), we show that sea level fall and associated closure/constriction of seaways play roles comparable to ice sheet expansion in modulating Hadley circulation changes during the initial stage of the LG period (∼70 ka). The sea level fall leads to an interhemispheric energy imbalance, which in turn causes the southward shift of the ascending branch of the Hadley circulation associated with the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The closure/constriction of seaways weakens (strengthens) the Hadley circulation in the Northern (Southern) Hemisphere and shifts its poleward edges equatorward in both hemispheres through influencing the meridional temperature gradient.

Here, we use measurements at Escudero Station (62.2°S, 58.97°W) on King George Island, north of the Antarctic Peninsula, to characterize clouds and their effects on the surface incoming radiation between 2017 and 2023. These measurements are unique providing 7 years of simultaneous cloud and radiation measurements, including year‐round observations. Cloud measurements using a mini micropulse lidar showed that clouds are present 96% of the time with persistent low‐level supercooled liquid‐containing clouds: 86% of the lowest cloud bases are within the first 1 km. Liquid was present about 80% of the time, and most liquid was supercooled: cloud‐base temperatures were below 0°C for 82% of atmospheric columns classified as liquid‐containing. Combining pyranometer and pyrgeometer measurements with clear‐sky radiative transfer modeling, we find that the downward cloud radiative forcing is negative during October–March and positive during April–September. For clouds with base temperatures below 260 K, downward longwave cloud forcing is found to be lower for ice‐only clouds than for liquid‐containing clouds; however, at warmer temperatures, both ice‐only and liquid‐containing clouds exhibited similar radiative forcing. During strong atmospheric river (AR) events, when long corridors of moisture bring heat and precipitation, surface temperatures are found to be positively correlated with downward shortwave (DSW) cloud forcing in summer, indicating that weaker DSW cloud forcing is linked to higher summertime surface temperatures."

However, its expansion, especially in high‐precipitation and mountainous regions of developing countries, has sparked growing concerns about its role in exacerbating downstream flood risks. This study critically examines the complex relationship between hydropower development and flood risk through the analysis of 107 major hydropower dams in such regions of the world spanning a period of 40 years. While 41.1% of the studied dams were found to exhibit flood mitigating characteristics by buffering against extreme inflows, 26.2% of dams were likely to exacerbate flood risks, primarily due to a steady increase in precipitation rates and sedimentation‐induced capacity loss. Hydropower dams in regions with shorter downstream river lengths were found to be more flood‐inducing than flood‐protecting. While regions with flood‐protecting dams naturally trigger urbanization and economic growth due to perceived safety and stable energy availability, these benefits are accompanied by the cost of increased deforestation. The study identified hotspots in South America and South Asia, where hydropower dams are more likely to be clustered as flood inducing in nature. Overall, the study calls for a paradigm shift in hydropower planning and management, emphasizing the integration of adaptive flood risk mitigation into energy production strategies keeping in mind the anticipated changes in climate and land cover along with a robust sedimentation management strategy during the dam's service lifespan."

However, the response of soil P availability to salinization remains unclear, making it difficult to assess its role in shaping plant responses to salinization. Here, we conducted a meta‐analysis of 823 observations from 87 published articles to investigate the effects of salinization on soil P availability and plant productivity across global terrestrial ecosystems. Across these studies, salinization decreased soil total P by an average of 4.6%, available P by 11.2%, and phosphatase activity by 25.4%. The effect of salinization on soil P availability was primarily modulated by salinization magnitude and exposure duration, vegetation types, ecosystem types, and climate conditions. Specifically, the negative effects of salinization on soil P availability were exacerbated with increasing salinization magnitude and duration, and were stronger in ecosystems dominated by herbaceous vegetation and in regions with lower precipitation. Across global ecosystems, the negative effects of salinization on soil P availability were associated with the declines in plant productivity. Our meta‐analysis provides a comprehensive understanding of how salinization impacts soil P availability across diverse vegetation and ecosystem types worldwide, and highlights that optimizing fertilization strategies and plant community composition are crucial for enhancing plant productivity and ecosystem functioning in salt‐affected areas."

 Delta-type ionotropic glutamate receptors (iGluRs), or GluDs, are members of the iGluR ligand-gated ion channel family, yet their function remains enigmatic1. Although GluDs are widely expressed in the brain, play key roles in synaptic organization, and harbor disease-linked mutations, whether they retain iGluR-like channel function is debated as currents have not been directly observed2,3. Here, we define GluDs as ligand-gated ion channels that are tightly regulated in cellular contexts by purifying human GluD2 (hGluD2) and directly characterizing its structure and function using cryo-electron microscopy (cryoEM) and bilayer recordings. We show that hGluD2 is activated by D-serine and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), with augmented activation at physiological temperatures. We reveal that hGluD2 contains an ion channel directly coupled to clamshell-like ligand-binding domains (LBDs), which are coordinated by the amino terminal domain (ATD) above the ion channel. Ligand binding triggers channel opening via an asymmetric mechanism, and a cerebellar ataxia point mutation in the LBD rearranges the receptor architecture and induces leak currents. Our findings demonstrate that GluDs possess the intrinsic biophysical properties of ligand-gated ion channels, reconciling prior conflicting observations to establish a framework for understanding their cellular regulation and for developing therapies targeting GluD2."

 Internal organs are encased by a supportive epithelial monolayer of mesodermal origin, termed mesothelium. The nature, evolution and function of mesothelial cells, and their genetic regulation impacting disease development are insufficiently understood. Here, we generate a comprehensive organ-wide single-cell transcriptomic compendium of mesothelium across healthy and diseased mouse and human organs, delineating the evolution of conserved activated states of mesothelial cells in response to disease. We uncover genetic drives behind each cell state and reveal a conserved metabolic gate into multipotent proteolytic, inflammatory and fibrotic cell differentiation, in mouse and human. Using lung injury models in mice, in combination with mesothelial cell-specific viral approaches, we show that direct metabolic reprogramming using Ifi27l2a and Crip1 on organ surfaces, blocks multipotent differentiation and protects mouse lungs from fibrotic disease. These findings place mesothelial cells as cellular exemplars and gateway to fibrotic disease, opening translational approaches to subvert fibrosis across a range of clinical indications.

 The multifunctional protein gephyrin clusters inhibitory receptors at the postsynaptic membrane in the CNS. Gephyrin has been proposed to form the inhibitory postsynaptic density by liquid-liquid phase separation, involving a complex interplay between receptor binding and oligomerization via its conserved G- and E-domains. Here we show by single particle cryo-EM analysis that dimerization promotes the formation of gephyrin filaments in which two E-domain dimers are linked by Z-shaped interfaces formed between two subdomains II (SDII) of adjacent dimers. Deletion of SDII, introduction of two epilepsy-causing pathogenic variants, or neutralization of an opposing charge in the interface abolish the formation of filaments, in vitro phase separation, and synaptic receptor clustering in hippocampal neurons. In conclusion, this work identifies gephyrin E-domain filaments as the structural foundation underlying gephyrin both phase separation and receptor clustering at inhibitory postsynaptic densities.

The authors advise caution regarding their further intentional introduction for conservation purposes. 
 Introduced species significantly impact native biodiversity worldwide, with extensive research on harms but relatively less focus on benefits. Here, using the IUCN Environmental Impact Classification for Alien Taxa (EICAT) and EICAT+ frameworks, we assess 2021 negative and positive impacts of introduced large mammalian herbivores globally. We show that negative impacts are more common, and of higher magnitude than positive impacts, i.e. affect populations, not only the performance of individuals. Native species on islands and at higher trophic level experience greater impacts. Reported impact magnitudes decline over time only for positive impacts. Most positive impacts are caused indirectly through changes in species interactions and ecosystem properties, often following negative impacts on native plants through herbivory and disturbance. We therefore advise caution regarding the intentional introduction of large mammalian herbivores for conservation purposes (rewilding, assisted colonization) without rigorous assessment of their impacts on native communities.

 Women have reported menstrual changes following SARS-CoV-2 infection and variation in long COVID symptoms across the menstrual cycle. We examined (i) whether COVID is linked to abnormal uterine bleeding (AUB), (ii) if long COVID symptoms vary with the menstrual cycle, and (iii) potential underlying mechanisms. Here we show long COVID was associated with AUB in a UK population. When compared to those never infected (n = 9423), long COVID participants (n = 1048) reported increased menstrual volume, duration and intermenstrual bleeding, while those who recovered from acute COVID (n = 1,716) reported minimal menstrual disruption. Long COVID symptoms examined in 54 women across the menstrual cycle revealed that severity was highest during the perimenstrual and proliferative phases. Serum and endometrial analysis revealed higher serum 5α-dihydrotestosterone and lower endometrial androgen receptors in long COVID versus no COVID. Other ovarian hormones showed no significant differences. Serum cytokine profiling indicated increased menstrual inflammation with long COVID and immune cell aggregates were observed in menstrual endometrium. In conclusion, long COVID was associated with AUB but not impaired ovarian function. Differences in peripheral and endometrial inflammation may contribute to AUB and long COVID symptom severity. We anticipate our findings will instigate exploration of new therapeutic strategies for women with long COVID.

 Childhood maltreatment effects on cerebral gray matter have been frequently discussed as a neurobiological pathway for depression. However, localizations are highly heterogeneous, and recent reports have questioned the replicability of mental health neuroimaging findings. Here, we investigate the replicability of gray matter correlates of maltreatment, measured retrospectively via the Childhood Trauma Questionnaire, across three large adult cohorts (total N = 3225). Pooling cohorts yields maltreatment-related gray matter reductions, with most extensive effects when not controlling for depression diagnosis (maximum partial R2 = .022). However, none of these effects significantly replicate across cohorts. Non-replicability is consistent across a variety of maltreatment subtypes and operationalizations, as well as subgroup analyses with and without depression, and stratified by sex. Results are furthermore consistent across a variety of gray matter operationalizations, including voxel-based morphometry and parcellation-based cortical and subcortical measures. In this work, we show that there is little evidence for the replicability of gray matter correlates of childhood maltreatment, when adequately controlling for psychopathology. This underscores the need to focus on replicability research in mental health neuroimaging. Surprisingly consistent replication failure of gray matter correlates of childhood maltreatment raises questions about publication bias in prior literature and about prevailing models linking maltreatment to brain structure in adult populations."

Mester et al. show that measures of human development and rural areas are more important than GDP per capita in explaining the varying vulnerability to such displacement. 
 Floods displace an average of 12 million people every year, and are responsible for 54% of all disaster-induced displacements. Displacement risk scales with the vulnerability of exposed populations, but this vulnerability is poorly understood at a global scale. Here we show that measures of human development and rural areas explain more of the variance of displacement vulnerability than income levels measured by gross domestic product. We combine global flood and displacement data to estimate vulnerability, as the ratio of displacement to exposure, for over 300 historical flood events. We find that this vulnerability varies by several orders of magnitude both between and within countries. A random forest regression shows that infant mortality rate and population density are among the most important predictors of displacement vulnerability at national level and within countries, respectively, highlighting the vulnerability of low-income and marginalized populations and of rural communities. Our results indicate that, rather than relying on overall economic development alone, targeted investments are needed to improve living conditions and coping capacities for the most vulnerable groups, particularly outside of large cities, and to prepare for increasing flood hazards due to climate change. Millions of people each year are forcibly displaced due to floods.

Here, the authors show the clonal dynamics of this proliferation and how clonality contributes to microglial heterogeneity in a mouse stroke model, revealing distinct interclonal interactions. 
 Microglial proliferation is a principal element of the inflammatory response to brain ischemia. However, the precise proliferation dynamics, phenotype acquisition, and functional consequences of newly emerging microglia are not yet understood. Using multicolor fate mapping and computational methods, we here demonstrate that microglia exhibit polyclonal proliferation in the ischemic lesion of female mice. The peak number of clones occurs at 14 days, while the largest clones are observed at 4 weeks post-stroke. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of microglia reveal a homogeneous acute response to ischemia with a pattern of outward and inward currents that evolves over time. In the resolution phase, 8 weeks post-stroke, microglial cells within one clone share similar membrane properties, while neighboring microglia from different clones display more heterogeneous electrophysiological profiles. Super-resolution microscopy and live-cell imaging unmask various forms of cell-cell interactions between microglial cells from different clones. Overall, this study demonstrates the polyclonal proliferation of microglia after cerebral ischemia and suggests that clonality contributes to their functional heterogeneity. Thus, targeting clones with specific functional phenotypes may have potential for future therapeutic modulation of microglia after stroke. Microglia proliferate in response to ischemic stroke. Here, the authors show the clonal dynamics of this proliferation and how clonality contributes to microglial heterogeneity in a mouse stroke model, revealing distinct interclonal interactions."

 Monitoring Sahelian rainfall variability is increasingly critical as climate extremes intensify across the region. Here, we develop the Sahelian Monsoon Ocean-Pressure Index (SMOPI), a novel global synthetic indicator constructed from five dynamically coherent sea-level pressure regions statistically linked to June-September Sahel monsoon rainfall. SMOPI captures intra-seasonal and interannual variability, and crucially, reflects the influence of both regional processes and large-scale teleconnections on monsoon dynamics. It aligns with the dominant rainfall variability mode in reanalyses and 29 CMIP6 models. Strong/positive SMOPI phases coincide with wet years and are associated with enhanced convergence, favorable jet configurations, and robust Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Ocean teleconnections. Conversely, weak/negative SMOPI phases correspond to drought conditions and divergent moisture fluxes. SMOPI exposes model failures in reproducing historical droughts and offers new physical insights into rainfall-driving mechanisms. It stands out as a scalable, potentially transferable diagnostic tool for monitoring/forecasting and evaluating Sahelian monsoon rainfall under global warming."

 The methane-cycling microbiomes play crucial roles in methane dynamics. However, little is known about their distributions on a pan-Arctic scale as well as their responses to the widespread permafrost degradation. Based on 621 datasets of 16S rRNA gene amplicons from intact permafrost soils across the pan-Arctic, we identified only 22 methanogen and 26 methanotroph phylotypes. Their relative abundances varied significantly between sites and soil horizons. Only four methanogen phylotypes were detected at all locations. Remarkably, the permafrost soil methane filter was almost exclusively dominated by some obligate methanotroph (Methylobacter-like) phylotypes. However, a case study in Alaska suggests that atmospheric methane oxidizing bacteria (Methylocapsa-like phylotypes) dominated methanotrophs in a drier condition after permafrost degradation. These findings point towards a few key microbes particularly relevant for future studies on Arctic methane dynamics in a warming climate and that under future dry conditions, increased atmospheric methane uptake in Arctic upland soils may occur.

 Hyperspectral images (HSIs) can capture detailed spectral features for object recognition, while multispectral images (MSIs) can provide a high spatial resolution for accurate object location. Deep learning methods have been widely applied in the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images, but still face challenges, including the limited capacity to enhance spatial details and preserve spectral information, as well as issues related to spatial scale dependency. In this paper, to solve the above problems and achieve more effective information integration between HSIs and MSIs, we propose a novel multispectral and hyperspectral image fusion transformer (MHFu-former). The proposed MHFu-former consists of two main components: (1) a feature extraction and fusion module, which first extracts deep multi-scale features from the hyperspectral and multispectral imagery and fuses them to form a joint feature map, which is then processed by a dual-branch structure consisting of a Swin transformer module and convolutional module to capture the global context and fine-grained spatial features, respectively; and (2) a spatial-spectral fusion attention mechanism, which adaptively enhances the important spectral information and fuses it with the spatial detail information, significantly boosting the model’s sensitivity to the key spectral features while preserving rich spatial details. We conducted comparative experiments on the indoor Cave dataset and the Shanghai and Ganzhou datasets from the ZY1-02D satellite to validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method. Compared to the state-of-the-art methods, the proposed method significantly enhances the fusion performance across multiple key metrics, demonstrating its outstanding ability to process spatial and spectral details."

 Rainfall measurement inherently contains uncertainty in the accuracy of the collected data. Theoretical terminal velocity models are used to filter drop size distributions (DSDs) collected by measurement devices to remove physically unlikely data. This filtration process decreases the number of drops and further influences the calculation of bulk rain parameters. This study compared the impact of different drop velocity models on the DSD and rain parameter calculations for both natural and artificial rain. A total of ten natural rainfall events were observed with a Parsivel2 disdrometer on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Research Triangle Park (RTP) campus in Durham, North Carolina, during June–July 2024. In addition, 732 min of artificial rainfall were generated using four nozzles at the U.S. EPA Fluid Modeling Facility (FMF) in Durham, North Carolina. The results showed that for artificial rainfall, the rain rate calculated from the instruments' ‘raw’ DSD data (terminal output %93) was on average 38.73 % higher across four nozzles compared to the Parsivel2's rain rate calculation. The rain rate calculated directly from ‘raw’ data more closely matched the volume of water collected in a bin than the Parsivel2's rain rate calculation. For natural rainfall, the research found that the investigated terminal velocity models performed similarly. The average reduction in drop count across the six drop velocity models tested was 0.14 %, with the highest reduction observed in the Atlas (1977) model at 0.36 %. For the accumulated DSD of ten rainfall events, the ranking of models by the number of filtered drops, from highest to lowest, was: Atlas (1977) > Uplinger (1981) > Atlas et al. (1973) > Beard (1976) > Van Dijk et al. (2002) > Gunn and Kinzer (1949). In contrast to artificial rain, both rain intensity and kinetic energy measured by Parsivel2 were higher than those calculated from the ‘raw’ DSD, and applying a filter reduced these values. The study also identified the microphysical characteristics of the natural precipitation, with peak values of liquid water content (W) and radar reflectivity factor (Z) observed at 0.6–0.7 g m−3 and 30 dBz, respectively. The average mass-weighted diameter Dm (normalized intercept parameter log10Nw) values for convective, mixed, and stratiform rain were 1.81 mm (5.40), 1.15 mm (4.18), and 1.35 mm (4.53), respectively. Filters had a more pronounced effect on the Dm values compared to the log10Nw values and appeared to have a larger influence on convective rain compared to stratiform rain.

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a large class of pollutants widely present in the environment and are the earliest discovered and studied carcinogens.The oxidation of PAHs can generate oxygenated PAHs (OPAHs) and nitrated PAHs (NPAHs), which are key precursors for the formation of SOA. However, the formation mechanism of OPAHs and NPAHs are unclear. Fluorene (FLN) is one of the most abundant PAHs discovered, and several studies have been conducted on the reaction of FLN. In this article, we investigated the oxidation mechanism of FLN initiated by OH radicals through high level quantum chemistry and chemical kinetics calculations. The oxidation starts by forming adducts FLN-n-OH (FLNn in short, n = 1, 2, 3, 4, 10, 11) which then react with O2 and NO2 in the atmosphere. When the overall reaction rate coefficient of FLNn with O2 are slow, FLNn mainly react with NO2 to form n-nitrofluorene in the atmosphere. Effective reaction rates of FLN1 with O2 in the atmosphere are fast at of ∼1.90 × 104 s−1, suggesting the negligible reaction between FLN1 adduct and NO2. Therefore, the main fate of FLN1 is reaction with O2 followed by subsequent unimolecular isomerization routes, forming OPAHs only. The rate coefficient for reaction of FLN2, FLN4 and FLN10 with O2 are obtained at of 7.44, 26.4 and 1.07 s−1, respectively, suggesting the likely formation of 2-nitrofluorene 4-nitrofluorene and 10-nitrofluorene. In addition, the hydrogen atom abstraction from FLN and the generation of alkoxy groups from FLNn-i-OO resulted in formation of unsaturated compounds, which subsequently reacted with O2 to form a large number of unsaturated oxygen-containing compounds and further transform to highly oxidized products."

The data highlight seasonal cycles and variability, informing studies of water mass formation, ice–ocean interactions, glaciology, and regional ecosystems. 
 In this paper we describe a decade-long timeseries of hydrographic mooring observations around the Drygalski Ice Tongue in southern Terra Nova Bay, Antarctica. Unique aspects of the data are that (i) the instruments were placed very close to the Ice Tongue due to its significant influence on the region’s ocean and sea ice, and (ii) the upper sensors were positioned relatively close (< 100 m) to the ocean surface compared to typical Antarctic moorings. Starting in December 2014, the mooring array included three locations – the Drygalski Basin, the edge of the Crary Bank and, on the southern side of the ice tongue, in Geikie Inlet. The instruments measure temperature, salinity, pressure, and current velocity. The “DITx” mooring locations were chosen in order to support questions regarding the influence of the Drygalski Ice Tongue on regional ocean processes. The observations are relevant to water mass formation, glaciology and ice melt, sea ice production and decay, ice shelf cavity processes – as well as regional marine ecosystem processes. The data from the instruments show the seasonal cycle along with interannual variability, as well as a range of singular events. All data can be downloaded from the SEANOE database."

 We present the results of downscaling CMIP6 global climate projections to local scales for the Mediterranean and Italian regions, aiming to produce high-resolution climate information for the assessment of climate change signals, with a focus on precipitation extreme events. We performed hindcast (i.e., ERA5-driven) and historical simulations (driven by the MPI-ESM1-2-HR model) to simulate the present (1980–2014) and future (2015–2100) climate under three different emission scenarios (SSP1-2.6, SSP2-4.5, SSP5-8.5).For each experiment, a double-nesting approach is adopted to dynamically downscale global data to the regional domain of interest, firstly over the Europe (EURO) COordinated Regional climate Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) domain, at a spatial resolution of 15 km, and then further refined (second nesting) over Italy and the northwestern Mediterranean at a resolution of 5 km, i.e., in the so-called gray zone (5–10 km), close to the convection-permitting (CP) limit. Besides validating the experimental protocol, this work potentially questions the need for climate simulations to always resort to deep convection parameterizations when spatial refinement is increased up to the limit of the CP scale, yet convective processes are still not explicitly resolved. Analyses of air temperature and precipitation are presented, with a focus on the spatial distribution of precipitation, its probability density function, and the statistics of extreme events for both current climate and far-end scenarios. By the end of the century for all the scenarios and seasons there is a projected general warming along with an intensification of the hydrological cycle over most of continental Europe  and mean precipitation reduction over the Mediterranean region accompanied, over the Italian Peninsula, by a strong increase in the intensity of extreme precipitation events, particularly relevant for the SSP5-8.5 scenario during autumn."

 This study presents SanDyPALM, an innovative toolkit designed to streamline the generation of both static and dynamic input data for the PALM model, thereby facilitating urban microclimate simulations. SanDyPALM is capable of processing a diverse range of custom input data from raster and vector files, and it incorporates two novel methods – OSM2PALM and LCZ4PALM – that introduce the automated extraction of static input data from open data sources. To investigate the impact of static input data on simulation outcomes, we developed static drivers from four distinct data sources. Our analysis reveals not only variations in the generated static drivers but also differences in the simulation results. Importantly, all simulations correlate well with measurements from two different weather stations, underscoring the robustness of the overall modeling approach. However, we observed variations in temperature, humidity, and wind speed that are dependent on the static input data.

However, critical gaps remain in identifying contamination thresholds and understanding how different microplastics affect CO2 emissions through interactions with soil and microbes. To address these gaps, we conducted a microcosm experiment to evaluate CO2 emissions and their key influencing factors in soil amended with four types of agricultural film-derived microplastics (PE, PP, PVC, and PBAT) at varying doses (0.01, 0.10, 1.00, and 5.00%). Findings reveal that at higher doses, PBAT and PVC significantly enhanced soil CO2 emissions and cumulative mineralization, whereas PE and PP exhibited no clear dose–response relationship. Microplastics exhibited a double-edged effect on CO2 emissions, transitioning from inhibition to promotion over time. The zero-point effect stabilized in a short time, with PVC and PBAT being more prone to disrupt soil processes compared to PE and PP, exhibiting dose threshold values of 0.07, 0.09, 2.38, and 2.16%, respectively. Microplastic characteristics, soil physicochemical properties, and microbial communities varied with the types and doses of microplastics added, contributing 34.7, 39.4, and 25.9%, respectively, to the double-edged effect. Furthermore, the type of microplastics (coefficient = 0.67) had a more substantial effect on the double-edged effect than dosage (coefficient = 0.39), highlighting the critical role of the microplastic type in modulating soil carbon dynamics. This study provides new mechanistic insights into how microplastics affect soil carbon cycling, helping predict their impact on climate change mitigation and sustainable soil management."

Herein, 24 commercial ozone catalysts (denoted as #1–#24) were screened for salt-resistant catalytic performance, among which four catalysts (#1, #15, #22, and #23) demonstrated exceptional catalytic ozonation activity for oxalate (OA) removal in the presence of 15 g L–1 NaCl. The active components of these four catalysts were identified as CuO (#1), CuO/MnO2 (#15), Mn2O3 (#22), and Fe3O4 (#23), respectively. Increasing the salinity from 15 to 200 g L–1 significantly inhibited OA removal in the CuO/O3 system, while no inhibitory effect was observed in the other three systems. Mechanistic studies revealed that Cl– inhibited OA removal in the CuO/O3 system by quenching the aqueous-phase hydroxyl radicals (HOaq•). Although HOaq• was also the dominant oxidant in both Mn2O3/O3 and Fe3O4/O3 systems, their negatively charged surfaces electrostatically repelled Cl–, preventing the depletion of HOaq• by Cl– and thus maintaining the catalytic activity. Differently, surface-adsorbed hydroxyl radicals were generated in the CuO/MnO2/O3 system, enabling the salt-resistance performance of this system. This work paves the way for both selecting and designing effective catalysts for catalytic ozonation of hypersaline wastewater."

This study aims to elucidate AMF’s impacts on PFAS removal and their role in mitigating the environmental risks posed by residual PFASs in the effluent. The results indicated that the primary removal pathways of PFASs in CWs were substrate adsorption and microbial degradation, while plant uptake contributed minimally (0.2–0.3%). AMF enhanced host plant absorption and translocation of PFASs, thereby increasing PFAS accumulation in plant tissues. Additionally, AMF promoted the enrichment of key microbes (e.g., Chloroflexi and Proteobacteria), which stabilized and enhanced the activity of the rhizosphere microbial network, facilitating PFAS biotransformation and degradation. Through the reinforcement of microbial degradation, substrate adsorption, and plant uptake pathways, AMF symbiosis significantly enhanced PFAS removal, increasing efficiency by 10.5–13.3% compared to treatments without AMF. Notably, long-chain (C > 7) PFASs pose higher ecological risks compared to short-chain (C ≤ 7) PFASs. AMF effectively reduced the ecological risks associated with residual PFASs and their metabolites in the effluent. The results highlight AMF’s potential to improve PFAS removal in CWs and offer valuable insights for developing sustainable, high-efficiency pollution control strategies."

This study shows that CN and Ncs interact through charge exchange, with electron transfer from Ncs to CN, leading to edge group bonding. Additionally, the humic acid component in Ncs forms heterostructure with CN via interfacial adhesion (C–O bonds). Toxicity to phytoplankton (Chlorella pyrenoidosa) was assessed based on CN and Ncs concentrations in natural aquatic ecosystems. The results showed that Ncs+CN severely damaged the photosynthetic system of algal, resulting in a 16.35% inhibition of algal growth (compared to the control group). Mechanistically, (1) Ncs+CN generates more 1O2 (69.75 vs 57.36 μmol L–1), resulting in more damage to the algal. (2) Compared to the control group, light-induced phototoxicity led to inhibition of chlorophyll a (chl-a) and rubisco enzymes (3.50–22.23%, 1.73–21.76%); (3) Metabolomics and transcriptomics analyses revealed disruptions in energy metabolism and carbon/nitrogen assimilation within the algal cells. Notably, genes associated with photosynthesis and carbon sequestration (such as psbR, psbB, and rbcS) showed significant downregulation, consistent with reduced photosynthetic capacity (e.g., chl-a and rubisco enzyme activity).

Under abiotic conditions leaching was weaker for DPG and other chemicals, with contrasting trends for chemicals prone to biotransformation. In crumb rubber leachates chemical concentrations increased with time, but showed no significant differences between biotic/abiotic or high-hydrostatic/atmospheric pressure conditions.

Image analysis is augmented by pore size distribution measurements (N2 adsorption, low-field NMR) to establish the dual-porosity nature of the zones and subvoxel resolution fluid flow pathways to vesicles. In Zone 1, drainage simulations demonstrate how the distribution of  scCO2–water interfaces vary under different capillary and viscous flow regimes and may limit the size of precipitants. In Zone 2, 3D morphological analysis of simulated capillary-driven scCO2–water distributions and microCT-informed carbonate growth within vesicles reveals that the location and growth extent of large carbonate nodules are likely controlled by the distribution of scCO2–water  interfaces (acidity source) in relation to altered vesicle surfaces (alkalinity source). Toward augmenting geochemical/reactive transport models in basalt lithologies and beyond, we propose stepwise mechanisms describing how morphology-determined local water saturation and pH gradients lead to supersaturated “Goldilocks region” conditions favorable for carbonate growth.

Current phytoremediation efforts face challenges due to a limited understanding of Cr-tolerance mechanisms and the unclear role of anthocyanins in metal detoxification. This study investigates Cr-tolerance responses in two Brassica rapa varieties: the tolerant chinensis (BRC) and the sensitive purpuraria (BRP), using an integrated multiomics framework. BRC showed 30% less biomass reduction than BRP under Cr stress. Genomic analysis identified gene clusters specific to BRC associated with metabolic flexibility. Transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling revealed regulatory networks driven by transcription factors that support tolerance. Mechanisms contributing to Cr-tolerance included improved root glutathione metabolism for Cr sequestration, suppressed glyoxylate pathways in the stem to reduce oxidative stress, and increased leaf cysteine and methionine metabolism to support antioxidant production. Notably, anthocyanin accumulation did not correlate with Cr-tolerance; BRP accumulated 15% more anthocyanins than BRC under stress. The findings indicate that Cr-tolerance in B. rapa relies on metabolic changes and transcriptional control of detoxification pathways, not anthocyanins.

By analyzing an AVOC data set of Microcystis aeruginosa (n = 814) and Chlorella vulgaris (n = 834), the extreme gradient boosting model demonstrated rapid and accurate prediction of algal density (R2: 0.95–0.98), outperforming most existing models (R2: 0.38–0.99) reliant on environmental parameters. Butanal and 2-octenal were identified as biomarkers, with species-specific concentration thresholds of butanal (158.41 ppbv for Microcystis aeruginosa; 165.61 ppbv for Chlorella vulgaris) and 2-octenal (9.02  and 6.99 ppbv, respectively), below which algal density rapidly increased. Transcriptomic and enzymatic analysis revealed that metabolic reprogramming during exponential growth, characterized by enhanced photosynthesis, suppressed carbohydrate catabolism, and inhibited fatty acid degradation, collectively contributed to decreased butanal and 2-octenal production.

To better understand their composition and genetic and metabolic potential, we analyzed 207 samples from the Swiss Alps and Jura Mountains. We determined how key environmental factors shaped cyanobacterial abundance, assessed whether these communities harbor genes for toxin biosynthesis, characterized their taxonomic composition at the family and genus level, and evaluated the actual occurrence of cyanotoxins and other bioactive metabolites. Cyanobacterial abundance proved to be influenced by factors such as elevation, exposure, and their interaction with siliceous rock substrata. Targeted PCR and Sanger sequencing revealed the presence of toxin-encoding genes, particularly for ndaF/mcyE fragments, which may encode microcystin and/or nodularin biosynthesis, while specific genes for microcystins, anatoxins, and cylindrospermopsins were rather rare. Metabarcoding analysis identified 11 cyanobacterial families, with Chroococcaceae, Nostocaceae, and Leptolyngbyaceae being the most abundant. Complementary high-resolution mass spectrometry confirmed the occasional presence of nodularins and microcystins, alongside more frequent detection of other bioactive peptides such as anabaenopeptins and cyanopeptolins. Overall, these findings provide the most comprehensive insight to date into Tintenstrich-associated cyanobacteria, underscoring their environmental significance given their genetic and metabolic potential."

Our analysis reveals that 77.4% of Chinese coastal waters experienced recent increases in water clarity, with 22.7% showing continuous increases and 54.7% exhibiting nonlinear transitions marked by recovery following earlier declines. TSM emerged as the dominant control on Zsd variability, accounting for ∼60% of the influence overall and up to 80% in nearshore waters, while CDOM contributed more prominently offshore.

Here, using zebrafish larvae with TPhP as a benchmark, we systematically evaluated the developmental and neurobehavioral toxicity of HPCTP at environmentally relevant concentrations (50–5000 ng/L) from 6 to 120 h postfertilization. HPCTP showed greater bioaccumulation potential than TPhP, suggesting the risk of long-term ecological persistence. Despite lower acute toxicity, HPCTP induced pronounced developmental defects, including reduced body length and cardiac malformations. Strikingly, HPCTP and TPhP produced divergent neurobehavioral outcomes. HPCTP caused dose-dependent depression-like behaviors (hypoactivity, light-zone avoidance) through suppression of serotonin 1A (5-HT1A) signaling, supported by decreased htr1aa expression and serotonin levels and partially rescued by the 5-HT1A receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT. By contrast, TPhP elicited anxiety-like phenotypes (hyperactivity, thigmotaxis) via CD83-dependent neuroinflammation, evidenced by decreased cd83 expression and microglial activation, which were reversed by cd83 overexpression. Taken together, these findings demonstrate that HPCTP, though marketed as a safer alternative, poses distinct developmental and neurobehavioral hazards, underscoring the urgent need for comprehensive risk evaluation prior to its widespread application."

Site investigations included soil analyses, unsaturated zone porewater sampling at two depths using porous cup suction lysimeters, and continuous moisture sensing. Measurements of PFAS concentrations in collected field porewater samples facilitated evaluation of potential PFAS impacts to underlying groundwater. The most elevated PFAS soil and porewater concentrations were typically observed in the shallow (60 cm depth) zone with substantially lower PFAS soil and porewater concentrations at 120 cm. PFBS had the highest elevated PFAS porewater average concentration (124 ng/L) in the shallow lysimeters. Average PFOS and PFOA porewater concentrations were below 5 ng/L in both the shallow (60 cm depth) and deep (120 cm depth) lysimeters. Batch desorption testing revealed that a substantial fraction of the PFAS mass was not readily desorbed from the soil (e.g., 71% for PFOS). A mass balance model based on measured desorption isotherms, along with an estimate of the average PFAS accumulation at the air–water interface (AWI), generally predicted PFAS porewater concentrations reasonably well. Model simulations showed that PFAS adsorption to the AWI and to a lesser extent the desorption-resistant fractions in soil was primarily responsible for PFAS retention in unsaturated soils."

Ashes enriched in basic compounds (e.g., CaO) lend particularly well to REEs extraction but are prone to precipitate formation that hinders upscaled implementation. This study characterizes the secondary phase precipitation that occurs during mild acid leaching and develops an approach to circumvent their formation while maintaining effective REEs recovery. Notably, precipitate characteristics vary with leachant acidity: very acidic solutions (pH < 0) condense silica gels but achieve ∼ 90 % REEs recovery, whereas mild pH values (∼ 3.5) precipitate aluminosilicate flocs and are limited to low REEs recoverability (∼ 30 to 55 %). Gel precipitates, however, alter the rheology of the leachate via their transformation to a semicondensed phase, and are problematic in upscaled operations. To minimize gel formation, we evaluate alternative extraction methods, including an acid baking (i.e., dry digestion) approach that circumvents secondary precipitates while yielding high REEs extractability of ∼ 74 % and low co-extraction of secondary elements. Together, the results here provide key insights critical to controlling acid leaching of ash feedstocks and provide alternative methods for REEs extraction that bypass gel and floc precipitation to enable effective REEs recovery from coal ash wastes."

The Wild emissions were photochemically aged in an oxidation flow reactor (Wild-Aged). We exposed human bronchial epithelial cells to PM extracts from each permutation. PM extracts from all experimental permutations (Rx, Wild, Wild-Aged) induced oxidative stress, evidenced by a significant increase in 8-isoprostane concentration in the cell media compared to control. However, the increase of 8-isoprostane was significantly less in Wild-Aged compared to that in Wild and Rx, indicating loss of oxidative potential due to photochemical aging. Based on the release of lactate dehydrogenase in the cell media, the level of lipid peroxidation, and the magnitude of gene fold-changes, Rx PM extracts were more toxic than Wild. Chemical composition analysis suggests that toxicity was driven by levels of aromatic species in the PM, which were highest in Rx, followed by Wild and Wild-Aged.

Using streamflow observations and paleohydrological records, we reconstructed streamflow for 45 gauge stations on major Indian rivers, spanning 1200–2012 C.E., to examine the changes and drivers of streamflow drought synchronicity. Our reconstructed streamflow record for the past ∼800 years shows that streamflow drought frequency and synchronicity have increased during the recent period (1850–2012). While past major synchronous droughts in Indian rivers were associated with El Niño and positive Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) conditions, the recent increase in streamflow drought synchronicity is linked with anthropogenic climate warming. Simulations of the Paleo Model Intercomparison Project Phase 4 (PMIP4‐CMIP6) that include both natural and anthropogenic forcings confirm the role of anthropogenic warming in enhancing drought synchronicity.

At a shorter timescale (<10 ka), however, water‐magma interactions were primarily controlled by variations in eruption rates, with rainfall variability having a secondary role, as phreatomagmatism occurred even during low precipitation periods.

Such hybrid profiles frequently occur in the equatorial Pacific, highlighting a large‐scale pattern rather than local island mass effect. In oligotrophic regions, seasonal variations of light availability and stratification dynamics below the mixed layer likely relate SCM to an increase in carbon biomass or photoacclimation.

Additionally, soil moisture‐based onsets capture small early season rainfall events that precipitation‐based methods misclassify as false onsets. However, in Southern Hemisphere woodlands, neither soil moisture nor precipitation fully explains vegetation variability, likely due to deep‐rooted trees accessing moisture beyond SMAP's detection limits. These findings highlight soil moisture as a valuable indicator for refining wet season definitions, particularly in agricultural regions."

Here, we integrate a water‐column CH4 module into a coupled biogeochemical model to investigate methane cycling at contrasting coastal and offshore sites in the Beaufort Sea. Baseline simulations underestimated observed subsurface CH4 peaks, but introducing additional source terms—including lateral transport, zooplankton fecal methanogenesis, organic carbon decomposition, and methylphosphonate breakdown—substantially improved model performance. Results reveal that distinct processes control CH4 accumulation across regions: both lateral transport and biological production (via zooplankton) contribute to shelf CH4 dynamics, with physical transport emerging as the dominant process, while zooplankton fecal pellet production and bacterial activity govern offshore CH4 accumulation. Seasonal variability is tightly linked to primary production, stratification, and vertical mixing. Our findings underscore the critical role of non‐benthic CH4 sources in shaping Arctic methane distributions, with implications for projecting CH4 fluxes under future climate change."

However, the long‐term tectonic role of such secondary faults and their behavior in response to earthquakes or tectonic loading are unclear. We describe secondary faults activated by the Mw 7.2, 2021 Haiti earthquake within the Enriquillo Plantain Garden Fault zone and show that they continued to slip for weeks after the main event, some of them slipping against the long‐term tectonic stress. We model this time‐dependent behavior as frictional slip in response to shear stress changes imparted by the earthquake. These faults, widely distributed in the hanging wall of the main rupture, are therefore very weak and capable of slipping under small stress changes. Therefore, they should also diffuse some of the tectonic loading between large earthquakes, reducing the amount of stress that accumulates at shallow crustal depths."

Yet there is a persistent warm SST bias in the SO across generations of coupled global climate models (CGCMs). Existing literature blames such bias primarily on the deficiencies of model‐simulated atmospheric processes or basin‐scale ocean circulations. In this study, we show that the warm SST bias in the SO can be mitigated by parameterizing the vertical mixing induced by wind‐driven near‐inertial internal waves (NIWs) in the thermocline. By representing NIW‐induced vertical mixing in the thermocline of an eddy‐resolving CGCM, the warm SST bias in the SO is significantly reduced due to the enhanced downward heat flux from the surface boundary layer to the ocean interior. Our findings provide a new pathway to alleviate the warm SST bias in the SO, helping in improving the fidelity of model projected future climate changes."

Sufficient and broad‐based representations of dams in large‐scale hydrological models prove essential to mapping their extensive regulation of river flow and biogeochemistry and gauging climate‐linked provisions, including freshwater supply and hydropower. We present an integrated modeling framework to investigate future streamflow and hydropower generation in the Contiguous U.S. (1990–2075), leveraging an ensemble of six downscaled and bias‐corrected General Circulation Models (GCMs) from the high‐end SSP585 scenario of the CMIP6. To achieve this, we develop a reservoir operations and parameterization scheme for 1,384 dams in a high‐resolution river network, including simulated hydropower generation for 326 dams. For the GCM ensemble mean, we simulate a widespread increase in regulated streamflow into the late‐century (11% annual and 17% in winter for the dam median) with region‐specific changes in summer streamflow that feature prominent declines in the Northwest (−7%). Mediation by reservoirs is shown to dampen intra‐annual streamflow changes, delivering additional summer releases that partially mitigate declining flows. Total hydropower generation is projected to increase modestly (+3%), with boosted generation in the winter (+9%) and spring (+5%) offsetting declined summer generation (−3.4%), suggesting strong adaptation potential for hydropower in the future energy portfolio. Further analysis reveals that the choice of GCM, particularly in western regions, has significant bearing on projected streamflow and hydropower changes."

However, how urbanization differentially modulates various precipitation categories—captured by indices based on all precipitation events and those representing extremes—has received limited attention. Key uncertainties remain regarding the direction of response (intensification or moderation) and potential thresholds for urbanization‐induced precipitation shifts. We assessed the urbanization effects on precipitation across 37 urbanized regions in China from 1980 to 2022, and found the urbanization effects have intensified in most cities since 2000. Urbanization generally reduced the number of wet days but increased the frequency of extreme precipitation. Moreover, urbanization induced an increase in total precipitation, the simple precipitation intensity index, and interannual variability nationally, with precipitation primarily being altered in the cold climate zone and in medium‐sized cities. Anthropogenic drivers (e.g., urban area trend) and climatic drivers (e.g., relative humidity) predominantly govern the spatial variability in urbanization effects on all precipitation events, while climatic drivers (e.g., convective available potential energy) primarily modulate the spatial variability of urbanization effects on extreme precipitation. Notably, the urbanization effect on precipitation has intensified in recent decades (2000–2022), with more pronounced effects in arid climate zones and megacities. Anthropogenic and climatic factors both exacerbate the urbanization effect. Our findings provide valuable scientific knowledge for policymakers in urban planning and hazard warning."

However, decreases in pollution have not been uniform, potentially exacerbating inequalities in air pollution exposure by race and ethnicity. These inequalities exist, in part, because of spatial differences in source(s), for example, power plants or roadways. Determining which sources are driving inequality across racial and ethnic groups is critical to determining which policies (e.g., targeting power plant vs. vehicle emissions) would reduce inequalities. Our study determines which pollutant sources should be decreased to address inequalities in four pollutants (NOx, SO2, VOCs, and PM2.5) in the Commonwealth of Virginia. We derived emissions from eight source categories for 134 Virginia counties from the National Emissions Inventory and the MOtor Vehicle Emissions Simulator mobile source emissions model. We used race and ethnicity data from the American Community Survey from 2011 to 2020. We applied the Atkinson Index to obtain a single summary of inequality for each source‐pollutant pair (e.g., NOx from electricity generation) across all race and ethnic groups. Most source category emissions were unequally distributed for at least once pollutant. Compared to other sources, electricity generation resulted in the largest inequalities across pollutants. Mobile sources increased in inequality from 2011 to 2020 even as emissions decreased.

Dengue risk assessment models currently leverage climate‐dengue statistical associations, yet what remain understudied are the mechanistic pathways that yield different statistical relationships in different locations. We hypothesize that elucidating the mechanisms by which spatiotemporal variability in climate influences dengue incidence will improve dengue dynamics predictions across climatically distinct locations and beyond dengue's well‐known seasonal cycles. We test this hypothesis by investigating a key pathway in the climate‐dengue process chain: climate impacts on Aedes breeding habitats. We have implemented a mechanistic modeling pipeline that simulates climatic influence on habitat water dynamics and thereby on relative population size of the vector. We use this modeling pipeline, driven by meteorological data, to simulate monthly Aedes populations for three climatically distinct cities in Sri Lanka. We find that simulated vector abundance is plausibly associated with climate conditions and that climate drivers of vector abundance vary among locations. Moreover, tercile‐tercile comparisons of dengue incidence against model variables indicate that risk assessments based on predicted vector abundance perform similarly to those based on meteorology alone—the signal of weather variability and its relationship to dengue propagates through the modeling pipeline. These results justify future testing of this modeling pipeline within a dengue risk assessment framework, where its process‐based structure may be leveraged to guide proactive dengue control efforts in high‐risk years and to simulate impacts of future climate conditions on dengue dynamics."

 With the rise of decentralized computing, such as in the Internet of Things, autonomous driving and personalized healthcare, it is increasingly important to process time-dependent signals ‘at the edge’ efficiently: right at the place where the temporal data are collected, avoiding time-consuming, insecure and costly communication with a centralized computing facility (or ‘cloud’). However, modern-day processors often cannot meet the restrained power and time budgets of edge systems because of intrinsic limitations imposed by their architecture (von Neumann bottleneck) or domain conversions (analogue to digital and time to frequency).

Second, an analogue in-memory computing chip5, consisting of memristive crossbar arrays, implements a compact neural network trained on the extracted features for classification. With submillisecond latency, reconfigurable-nonlinear-processing-unit-based feature extraction consuming roughly 300 nJ per inference, and the analogue in-memory computing-based classifier using around 78 µJ (with potential for roughly 10 µJ)6, our findings offer a promising avenue for advancing the compactness, efficiency and performance of heterogeneous smart edge processors through in materia computing hardware.

 Repetitive head impacts (RHIs) sustained from contact sports are the largest risk factor for chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE)1–4. Currently, CTE can only be diagnosed after death and the events that trigger initial hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) deposition remain unclear2. Furthermore, the symptoms endorsed by young individuals are not fully explained by the extent of p-tau deposition2, severely hampering therapeutic interventions. Here we observed a multicellular response prior to the onset of CTE p-tau pathology that correlates with number of years of RHI exposure in young people (less than 51 years of age) with RHI exposure, the majority of whom played American football. Leveraging single-nucleus RNA sequencing of tissue from 8 control individuals, 9 RHI-exposed individuals and 11 individuals with low-stage CTE, we identify SPP1-expressing inflammatory microglia, angiogenic and inflamed endothelial cells, astrocytosis and altered synaptic gene expression in those exposed to RHI. We also observe a significant loss of cortical sulcus layer 2/3 neurons independent of p-tau pathology. Finally, we identify TGFβ1 as a potential signal that mediates microglia–endothelial cell cross talk. These results provide robust evidence that multiple years of RHI is sufficient to induce lasting cellular alterations that may underlie p-tau deposition and help explain the early pathogenesis in young former contact sport athletes. Furthermore, these data identify specific cellular responses to RHI that may direct future identification of diagnostic and therapeutic strategies for CTE.

 Owing to increasing demand for low-cost energy storage with secure material supply chains, the battery community is approaching a pivotal shift beyond conventional lithium-ion (Li-ion) towards next-generation cells. Technologies that include alkali-metal anodes, solid electrolytes and earth-abundant materials such as sodium (Na) and sulfur (S) are reaching commercialization in cells. The abuse tolerance and thermal runaway hazards of such technologies diverge from conventional Li-ion cells. Consequently, designing safe batteries with next-generation materials requires a holistic approach to characterize cells and to understand their responses to abuse conditions from the beginning to the end of life. Here we provide a Perspective on how the safety and abuse tolerance of cells are likely to change for up-and-coming technologies; challenges and opportunities for reimagining safe cell and battery designs; gaps in our knowledge; capabilities for understanding the hazards of thermal runaway and how to address them; how standard abuse tests may need to adapt to new challenges; and how research needs to support affected professionals, from pack designers to first responders, to manage hazards and ensure safe roll-out of next-generation cells into applications like electric vehicles (EVs). Finally, given the large number of next-generation technologies being explored, we encourage giving priority to safety-focused research in proportion to the rate of manufacturing scale-up of each specific technology.

 Hole-selective self-assembled monolayers (SAMs)1,2 have played a key role in driving the certified power conversion efficiency (PCE) of inverted perovskite solar cells3–5 to 26.7% (ref. 6). However, their instability often compromises the operational performance of devices, strongly hindering their practical applications7,8. Here we employ a cross-linkable co-SAM to enhance the conformational stability of hole-selective SAMs against external stresses, while suppressing the formation of defects and voids in SAM during self-assembly. The azide-containing SAM can be thermally activated to form a cross-linked and densely assembled co-SAM with a thermally stable conformation and preferred orientation. This effectively minimizes substrate surface exposure caused by wiggling of loose SAMs under thermal stress, preventing perovskite decomposition. This enables a certified PCE of 26.92% to be achieved for the best-performing cell, which also possesses excellent thermal stability with negligible decay under maximum-power-point tracking at 85 °C for 1,000 h. It also retains >98% of initial PCE after 700 repetitive thermal cycles between −40 °C and 85 °C, representing the state of the art of the field. This work offers an in-depth understanding of SAM degradation mechanisms to guide the design of a more robust buried interface for SAM-based devices adopting high-roughness substrates to realize highly efficient and durable perovskite solar cells.

 Perceptual decision-making is thought to be mediated by neuronal networks with attractor dynamics1,2. However, the dynamics underlying the complex neuronal responses during decision-making remain unclear. Here we use simultaneous recordings of hundreds of neurons, combined with an unsupervised, deep-learning-based method, to discover decision-related neural dynamics in the rat frontal cortex and striatum as animals accumulate pulsatile auditory evidence. We found that trajectories evolved along two sequential regimes: an initial phase dominated by sensory inputs, followed by a phase dominated by autonomous dynamics, with the flow direction (that is, neural mode) largely orthogonal to that in the first regime. We propose that this transition marks the moment of decision commitment, that is, the time when the animal makes up its mind. To test this, we developed a simplified model of the dynamics to estimate a putative neurally inferred time of commitment (nTc) for each trial. This model captures diverse single-neuron temporal profiles, such as ramping and stepping3,4. The estimated nTc values were not time locked to stimulus or response timing but instead varied broadly across trials. If nTc marks commitment, evidence before this point should affect the decision, whereas evidence afterwards should not. Behavioural analysis aligned to nTc confirmed this prediction. Our findings show that decision commitment involves a rapid, coordinated transition in dynamical regime and neural mode and suggest that nTc offers a useful neural marker for studying rapid changes in internal brain state.

Here, inspired by earthworms, we introduce NeuroWorm—a soft, stretchable and movable fibre sensor designed for bioelectronic interface. Our approach involves rolling to transform 2D bioelectronic devices into 1D NeuroWorm, creating a multifunctional microfibre that houses longitudinally distributed electrode arrays for both bioelectrical and biomechanical monitoring. NeuroWorm effectively records high-quality spatio-temporal signals in situ while steerably advancing within the brain or on the muscle as needed. This allows for the dynamic targeting and shifting of desired monitoring sites. Implanted in muscle through a tiny incision, NeuroWorm provides stable bioelectrical monitoring in rats for more than 43 weeks. Even after 54 weeks of implantation in muscle, fibroblast encapsulation around the fibre remains negligible. Our NeuroWorm represents a platform that promotes a substantial advance in bioelectronics—from an immobile probe fixed in place to active, intelligent and living devices for long-term, minimally invasive and mobile evaluation of the nervous system. A soft, stretchable and freely movable fibre sensor called NeuroWorm, inspired by earthworms and that can be magnetically steered through soft tissue, is described as a new platform for dynamic bioelectrical and biomechanical monitoring."

 Directly visualizing vibrational anisotropy in individual phonon modes is essential for understanding a wide range of intriguing optical, thermal and elastic phenomena in materials1–5. Although conventional optical and diffraction techniques have been used to estimate vibrational anisotropies, they fall short in achieving the spatial and energy resolution necessary to provide detailed information4–7. Here, we introduce a new form of momentum-selective electron energy-loss spectroscopy, which enables the element-resolved imaging of frequency- and symmetry-dependent vibrational anisotropies with atomic resolution. Vibrational anisotropies manifest in different norms of orthogonal atomic displacements, known as thermal ellipsoids. Using the centrosymmetric strontium titanate as a model system, we observed two distinct types of oxygen vibrations with contrasting anisotropies: oblate thermal ellipsoids below 60 meV and prolate ones above 60 meV. In non-centrosymmetric barium titanate, our approach can detect subtle distortions of the oxygen octahedra by observing the unexpected modulation of q-selective signals between apical and equatorial oxygen sites near 55 meV, which originates from reduced crystal symmetry and may also be linked to ferroelectric polarization. These observations are quantitatively supported by theoretical modelling, which demonstrates the reliability of our approach. The measured frequency-dependent vibrational anisotropies shed new light on the dielectric and thermal behaviours governed by acoustic and optical phonons. The ability to visualize phonon eigenvectors at specific crystallographic sites with unprecedented spatial and energy resolution opens new avenues for exploring dielectric, optical, thermal and superconducting properties. A new form of momentum-selective electron energy-loss spectroscopy enables the element-resolved imaging of frequency- and symmetry-dependent vibrational anisotropies with atomic resolution."

 Accretion disks in strong gravity ubiquitously produce winds, seen as blueshifted absorption lines in the X-ray band of both stellar mass X-ray binaries (black holes and neutron stars)1–4 and supermassive black holes5. Some of the most powerful winds (termed Eddington winds) are expected to arise from systems in which radiation pressure is sufficient to unbind material from the inner disk (L ≳ LEdd). These winds should be extremely fast and carry a large amount of kinetic power, which, when associated with supermassive black holes, would make them a prime contender for the feedback mechanism linking the growth of those black holes with their host galaxies6. Here we show the XRISM Resolve spectrum of the galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1, which reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines. This Compton-thick wind significantly attenuates the flux, making it appear faint, although it is intrinsically more luminous than usual (L ≳ LEdd). However, the wind is extremely slow, more consistent with the predictions of thermal-radiative winds launched by X-ray irradiation of the outer disk than with the expected Eddington wind driven by radiation pressure from the inner disk. This puts new constraints on the origin of winds from bright accretion flows in binaries, but also highlights the very different origin required for the ultrafast (v ~ 0.3c) winds seen in recent Resolve observations of a supermassive black hole at a similarly high Eddington ratio7. The XRISM Resolve spectrum of the galactic neutron star X-ray binary, GX 13+1, reveals one of the densest winds ever seen in absorption lines."

 The regulation of metabolic processes by proteins is fundamental to biology and yet is incompletely understood. Here we develop a mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach that leverages genetic diversity to nominate functional relationships between 285 metabolites and 11,868 proteins in living tissues. This method recapitulates protein–metabolite functional relationships mediated by direct physical interactions and local metabolic pathway regulation while nominating 3,542 previously undescribed relationships. With this foundation, we identify a mechanism of regulation over liver cysteine utilization and cholesterol handling, regulated by the poorly characterized protein LRRC58. We show that LRRC58 is the substrate adaptor of an E3 ubiquitin ligase that mediates proteasomal degradation of CDO1, the rate-limiting enzyme of the catabolic shunt of cysteine to taurine1. Cysteine abundance regulates LRRC58-mediated CDO1 degradation, and depletion of LRRC58 is sufficient to stabilize CDO1 to drive consumption of cysteine to produce taurine. Taurine has a central role in cholesterol handling, promoting its excretion from the liver2, and we show that depletion of LRRC58 in hepatocytes increases cysteine flux to taurine and lowers hepatic cholesterol in mice. Uncovering the mechanism of LRRC58 control over cysteine catabolism exemplifies the utility of covariation MS to identify modes of protein regulation of metabolic processes. A mass spectrometry-based approach globally identifies protein regulators of metabolism and reveals the role of LRRC58 in controlling cysteine catabolism."

 Controlling arms and legs requires feedback from the proprioceptive sensory neurons that detect joint position and movement1,2. Proprioceptive feedback must be tuned for different behavioural contexts3–6, but the underlying circuit mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, using calcium imaging in behaving Drosophila, we find that the axons of position-encoding leg proprioceptors are active across a range of behaviours, whereas the axons of movement-encoding leg proprioceptors are suppressed during walking and grooming. Using connectomics7–9, we identify a specific class of interneurons that provide GABAergic presynaptic inhibition to the axons of movement-encoding proprioceptors. These interneurons receive input from parallel excitatory and inhibitory descending pathways that are positioned to drive the interneurons in a context-specific and leg-specific manner. Calcium imaging from both the interneurons and their descending inputs confirms that their activity is correlated with self-generated but not passive leg movements. Taken together, our findings reveal a neural circuit that suppresses specific proprioceptive feedback signals during self-generated movements.

 Neutrophils, the most abundant and biotoxic immune cells, extrude nuclear DNA into the extracellular space to maintain homeostasis. Termed neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), these protein-modified and decondensed extracellular DNA scaffolds control infection and are involved in coagulation, autoimmunity and cancer1,2. Here we show how myeloperoxidase (MPO), a highly expressed neutrophil protein, disassembles nucleosomes, thereby facilitating NET formation, yet also binds stably to NETs extracellularly. We describe how the oligomeric status of MPO governs both outcomes. MPO dimers interact with nucleosomal DNA using one protomer and concurrently dock into the nucleosome acidic patch with the other protomer. As a consequence, dimeric MPO displaces DNA from the core complex, culminating in nucleosome disassembly. On the other hand, MPO monomers stably interact with the nucleosome acidic patch without making concomitant DNA contacts, explaining how monomeric MPO binds to and licences NETs to confer hypohalous acid production in the extracellular space3. Our data demonstrate that the binding of MPO to chromatin is governed by specific molecular interactions that transform chromatin into a non-replicative, non-encoding state that offers new biological functions in a cell-free manner. We propose that MPO is, to our knowledge, the first member of a class of proteins that convert chromatin into an immune effector.

 There is an increasing demand for multimodal sensing and stimulation bioelectronic fibres for both research and clinical applications1,2. However, existing fibres suffer from high rigidity, low component layout precision, limited functionality and low density of active components. These limitations arise from the challenge of integrating many components into one-dimensional fibre devices, especially owing to the incompatibility of conventional microfabrication methods (for example, photolithography) with curved, thin and long fibre structures2. As a result, limited applications have been demonstrated so far. Here we use ‘spiral transformation’ to convert two-dimensional thin films containing microfabricated devices into one-dimensional soft fibres. This approach allows for the fabrication of high-density multimodal soft bioelectronic fibres, termed Spiral-NeuroString (S-NeuroString), while enabling precise control on the longitudinal, angular and radial positioning and distribution of the functional components. Taking advantage of the biocompatibility of our soft fibres with the dynamic and soft gastrointestinal system, we proceed to show the feasibility of our S-NeuroString for post-operative multimodal continuous motility mapping and tissue stimulation in awake pigs. We further demonstrate multi-channel single-unit electrical recording in mouse brain for up to 4 months, and a fabrication capability to produce 1,280 channels within a 230-μm-diameter soft fibre.

 Coral reefs form complex physical structures that can help to mitigate coastal flooding risk1,2. This function will be reduced by sea-level rise (SLR) and impaired reef growth caused by climate change and local anthropogenic stressors3. Water depths above reef surfaces are projected to increase as a result, but the magnitudes and timescales of this increase are poorly constrained, which limits modelling of coastal vulnerability4,5. Here we analyse fossil reef deposits to constrain links between reef ecology and growth potential across more than 400 tropical western Atlantic sites, and assess the magnitudes of resultant above-reef increases in water depth through to 2100 under various shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) emission scenarios. Our analysis predicts that more than 70% of tropical western Atlantic reefs will transition into net erosional states by 2040, but that if warming exceeds 2 °C (SSP2–4.5 and higher), nearly all reefs (at least 99%) will be eroding by 2100. The divergent trajectories of reef growth and SLR will thus magnify the effects of SLR; increases in water depth of around 0.3–0.5 m above the present are projected under all warming scenarios by 2060, but depth increases of 0.7–1.2 m are predicted by 2100 under scenarios in which warming surpasses 2 °C. This would increase the risk of flooding along vulnerable reef-fronted coasts and modify nearshore hydrodynamics and ecosystems. Reef restoration offers one pathway back to higher reef growth6,7, but would dampen the effects of SLR in 2100 only by around 0.3–0.4 m, and only when combined with aggressive climate mitigation. An analysis of coral reefs in the tropical western Atlantic suggests that nearly all will be eroding by 2100 if global warming exceeds 2 °C, which will worsen the effects of sea-level rise."

 General reasoning represents a long-standing and formidable challenge in artificial intelligence (AI). Recent breakthroughs, exemplified by large language models (LLMs)1,2 and chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting3, have achieved considerable success on foundational reasoning tasks. However, this success is heavily contingent on extensive human-annotated demonstrations and the capabilities of models are still insufficient for more complex problems. Here we show that the reasoning abilities of LLMs can be incentivized through pure reinforcement learning (RL), obviating the need for human-labelled reasoning trajectories. The proposed RL framework facilitates the emergent development of advanced reasoning patterns, such as self-reflection, verification and dynamic strategy adaptation. Consequently, the trained model achieves superior performance on verifiable tasks such as mathematics, coding competitions and STEM fields, surpassing its counterparts trained through conventional supervised learning on human demonstrations. Moreover, the emergent reasoning patterns exhibited by these large-scale models can be systematically used to guide and enhance the reasoning capabilities of smaller models.

 The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) integrates growth factor (GF) and nutrient signals to stimulate anabolic processes connected to cell growth and inhibit catabolic processes such as autophagy1,2. GF signalling through the tuberous sclerosis complex regulates the lysosomally localized small GTPase RAS homologue enriched in brain (RHEB)3.

Full engagement of the membrane anchors is required for optimal alignment of the catalytic residues in the mTOR kinase active site. Converging signals from GFs and nutrients drive mTORC1 recruitment to and activation on lysosomal membrane in a four-step process, consisting of (1) RAG–Ragulator-driven recruitment to within ~100 Å of the lysosomal membrane; (2) RHEB-driven recruitment to within ~40 Å; (3) RAPTOR–membrane engagement and intermediate enzyme activation; and (4) mTOR–membrane engagement and full enzyme activation. RHEB and membrane engagement combined leads to full catalytic activation and structurally explains GF and nutrient signal integration at the lysosome. Cryo-electron microscopy was used to study human mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation on lysosomal membranes, showing progressive recruitment by RAG–Ragulator, RHEB and RAPTOR, culminating in mTOR–membrane engagement and full enzyme activation."

 Although artificial intelligence enables productivity gains from delegating tasks to machines1, it may facilitate the delegation of unethical behaviour2. This risk is highly relevant amid the rapid rise of ‘agentic’ artificial intelligence systems3,4. Here we demonstrate this risk by having human principals instruct machine agents to perform tasks with incentives to cheat. Requests for cheating increased when principals could induce machine dishonesty without telling the machine precisely what to do, through supervised learning or high-level goal setting. These effects held whether delegation was voluntary or mandatory. We also examined delegation via natural language to large language models5. Although the cheating requests by principals were not always higher for machine agents than for human agents, compliance diverged sharply: machines were far more likely than human agents to carry out fully unethical instructions. This compliance could be curbed, but usually not eliminated, with the injection of prohibitive, task-specific guardrails. Our results highlight ethical risks in the context of increasingly accessible and powerful machine delegation, and suggest design and policy strategies to mitigate them. People cheat more when they delegate tasks to artificial intelligence, and large language models are more likely than humans to comply with unethical instructions—a risk that can be minimized by introducing prohibitive, task-specific guardrails."

 Decision-making in healthcare relies on understanding patients’ past and current health states to predict and, ultimately, change their future course1–3. Artificial intelligence (AI) methods promise to aid this task by learning patterns of disease progression from large corpora of health records4,5. However, their potential has not been fully investigated at scale. Here we modify the GPT6 (generative pretrained transformer) architecture to model the progression and competing nature of human diseases. We train this model, Delphi-2M, on data from 0.4 million UK Biobank participants and validate it using external data from 1.9 million Danish individuals with no change in parameters. Delphi-2M predicts the rates of more than 1,000 diseases, conditional on each individual’s past disease history, with accuracy comparable to that of existing single-disease models. Delphi-2M’s generative nature also enables sampling of synthetic future health trajectories, providing meaningful estimates of potential disease burden for up to 20 years, and enabling the training of AI models that have never seen actual data. Explainable AI methods7 provide insights into Delphi-2M’s predictions, revealing clusters of co-morbidities within and across disease chapters and their time-dependent consequences on future health, but also highlight biases learnt from training data. In summary, transformer-based models appear to be well suited for predictive and generative health-related tasks, are applicable to population-scale datasets and provide insights into temporal dependencies between disease events, potentially improving the understanding of personalized health risks and informing precision medicine approaches.

 The fin-to-limb transition in vertebrate evolution has been central to the study of how development underlies evolutionary change. In this context, the functional analysis of Hox gene regulation to infer evolutionary trajectories has been critical to explain the origin of new features. In tetrapods, the transcription of Hoxd genes in developing digits depends on a set of enhancers forming a large regulatory landscape1,2. The presence of a syntenic counterpart in zebrafish, which lacks digits, suggests deep homology3 or shared developmental foundations underlying distal fin and limbs. However, how this regulatory program evolved has remained unresolved. We genetically evaluated the function of the zebrafish Hoxd regulatory landscapes by comparatively assessing the effects of their full deletions. We show that, unlike in mice, deletion of these regions in fish does not disrupt hoxd gene transcription during distal fin development. By contrast, we found that this deficiency leads to the loss of expression within the cloaca, a structure related by ancestry to the mammalian urogenital sinus, and that distal hox13 genes are essential for correct cloacal formation. Because Hoxd gene regulation in the mouse urogenital sinus relies on enhancers located in this same chromatin domain that controls digit development, we propose that the current regulatory landscape active in distal limbs was co-opted as a whole in tetrapods from a pre-existing cloacal regulatory machinery. The regulatory landscape controlling Hoxd gene expression in tetrapod digit development was probably co-opted from a pre-existing cloacal regulatory mechanism, as evidenced by the effects of genetic deletion experiments in zebrafish fin, cloaca and mouse urogenital development."

 Brown and beige adipocytes express uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1), a mitochondrial protein that dissociates respiration from ATP synthesis and promotes heat production and energy expenditure. However, UCP1−/− mice are not obese1–5, consistent with the existence of alternative mechanisms of thermogenesis6–8. Here we describe a UCP1-independent mechanism of thermogenesis involving ATP-consuming metabolism of monomethyl branched-chain fatty acids (mmBCFA) in peroxisomes. These fatty acids are synthesized by fatty acid synthase using precursors derived from catabolism of branched-chain amino acids9 and our results indicate that β-oxidation of mmBCFAs is mediated by the peroxisomal protein acyl-CoA oxidase 2 (ACOX2). Notably, cold exposure upregulated proteins involved in both biosynthesis and β-oxidation of mmBCFA in thermogenic fat. Acute thermogenic stimuli promoted translocation of fatty acid synthase to peroxisomes. Brown-adipose-tissue-specific fatty acid synthase knockout decreased cold tolerance. Adipose-specific ACOX2 knockout also impaired cold tolerance and promoted diet-induced obesity and insulin resistance. Conversely, ACOX2 overexpression in adipose tissue enhanced thermogenesis independently of UCP1 and improved metabolic homeostasis. Using a peroxisome-localized temperature sensor named Pexo-TEMP, we found that ACOX2-mediated fatty acid β-oxidation raised intracellular temperature in brown adipocytes. These results identify a previously unrecognized role for peroxisomes in adipose tissue thermogenesis characterized by an mmBCFA synthesis and catabolism cycle.

 The dome-headed pachycephalosaurians are among the most enigmatic dinosaurs. Bearing a hypertrophied skull roof and elaborate cranial ornamentation, members of the clade are considered to have evolved complex sociosexual systems1–3. Despite their importance in understanding behavioural ecology in Dinosauria, the absence of uncontested early diverging taxa has hindered our ability to reconstruct the origin and early evolution of the clade4–7. Here we describe Zavacephale rinpoche gen. et sp. nov., from the Lower Cretaceous Khuren Dukh Formation of Mongolia, the most skeletally complete and geologically oldest pachycephalosaurian discovered globally. Z. rinpoche exhibits a well-developed frontoparietal dome and preserves the clade’s first record of manual elements and gastroliths. Phylogenetic analysis recovered Z. rinpoche as one of the earliest diverging pachycephalosaurians, pushing back fossil evidence of the frontoparietal dome by at least 14 Myr and clarifying macroevolutionary trends in its assembly. We found that the earliest stage of dome evolution occurred by means of a frontal-first developmental pattern with retention of open supratemporal fenestra, mirroring proposed ontogenetic trajectories in some Late Cretaceous taxa. Finally, intraskeletal osteohistology of the frontoparietal dome and hindlimb demonstrate decoupling of sociosexual and somatic maturity in early pachycephalosaurians, with advanced dome development preceding terminal body size.

Here, the authors develop a transcriptomic and epigenetic map of indisulam (RBM39 degrader) resistant neuroblastoma, demonstrating bidirectional cell state switching accompanied by increased NK cell activity, which they therapeutically enhance by the addition of an anti-GD2 antibody. 
 The cellular plasticity of neuroblastoma is defined by a mixture of two major cell states, adrenergic and mesenchymal, which may contribute to therapy resistance. However, how neuroblastoma cells switch cellular states during therapy remains largely unknown, and how to eradicate neuroblastoma regardless of its cell state is a clinical challenge. To better understand the cellular plasticity of neuroblastoma in chemoresistance, we define the transcriptomic and epigenetic map of adrenergic and mesenchymal types of neuroblastomas using human and murine models treated with indisulam, a selective RBM39 degrader. We show that cancer cells not only undergo a bidirectional switch between adrenergic and mesenchymal states, but also acquire additional cellular states, reminiscent of the developmental pliancy of neural crest cells. These cell state alterations are coupled with epigenetic reprogramming and dependency switching of cell state–specific transcription factors, epigenetic modifiers, and targetable kinases. Through targeting RNA splicing, indisulam induces an inflammatory tumor microenvironment and enhances the anticancer activity of natural killer cells. The combination of indisulam with anti-GD2 immunotherapy results in a durable, complete response in high-risk transgenic neuroblastoma models, providing an innovative, rational therapeutic approach to eradicate tumor cells regardless of their potential to switch cell states.

 Battery development pivots around understanding the complex processes governing battery operation and degradation.

Through quantitatively imaging ionic and electronic current distributions and probing the associated chemical reactions at the nanoscale, valuable insights into battery inhomogeneities and degradations can be gained.

 Southern Ocean biogeochemistry impacts global nutrient distributions, carbon cycling, and climate, motivating study of its underlying controls across different climate states. Today, poorly-ventilated North Pacific waters supply the majority of carbon and nutrients upwelling in the Southern Ocean, outpacing biological carbon uptake and fueling CO2 outgassing. Reducing this supply is both central to glacial CO2 theories involving reduced outgassing and well-supported by paleo-proxy reconstructions. While past studies emphasize physical processes (reduced upwelling, enhanced stratification), we propose a complementary mechanism where the carbon/nutrient load of waters feeding the Southern Ocean surface is reduced remotely, prior to being upwelled. Comparing glacial North Pacific and Southern Ocean proxy records, alongside Earth System Model simulations, we show that ventilating the glacial North Pacific reduces the carbon/nutrient content of waters supplying the Southern Ocean surface and Subantarctic CO2 outgassing. This highlights an interhemispheric influence on Southern Ocean biogeochemical conditions that could modulate glacial-interglacial CO2 variability.

Here the authors identify sperm expressed GALNTL5 as a GalNAc binding factor required for migration though the UTJ and attachment to the ZP. 
 More than 20 genes expressed in the male reproductive tract have been identified as essential factors for sperm migration to and through the utero-tubal junction (UTJ), and they are divided into ADAM3-dependent and ADAM3-independent pathways. In parallel, sperm having UTJ migration defects also show impaired binding to the zona pellucida (ZP). Herein, we demonstrate that knockout of Galntl5, encoding a sperm surface protein, causes impaired sperm binding with the UTJ and ZP, and null males have severe infertility. GALNTL5 appreciably disappears in sperm lacking Adam3 or Lypd4, required for ADAM3-dependent and ADAM3-independent pathways, and GALNTL5 binds to N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc) distributed on the UTJ and ZP. Blockage of GalNAc decreases the number of sperm binding to the UTJ and ZP. Thus, we unveil that GALNTL5 is a responsible factor for UTJ migration and sperm-ZP binding, and that sperm bind to the UTJ and ZP through interaction of GALNTL5 and GalNAc.

 Most CRISPR assays lack clinical utility due to their complex workflows and limited validation. Here we present a streamlined “one-pot” asymmetric CRISPR tuberculosis assay that attenuates amplicon degradation to achieve 5 copies/μL sensitivity within 60 min and detect positive patient samples within 15 min.

This assay achieves complete specificity and greater sensitivity (74% vs. 56%) than the most sensitive reference test with prospectively collected tongue swabs, and exhibits similar performance when adapted to a lateral flow assay format and employed to analyze self-collected tongue swabs. These results demonstrate the utility of this approach across diverse specimen types, including those suitable for use in remote and resource-limited settings, to improve access to molecular diagnostics.

 Sewage sludge, an unavoidable by-product of biological sewage treatment processes, is a growing environmental burden. If handled properly, it can also be a crucial secondary resource, as it contains many functional microbiomes and useful nutrients. Here we propose an in situ nitrate-driven oxidation approach to upcycle sewage sludge into valuable (>US$4,000 m−3) anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) seeds, which are a key ingredient to achieve a fast start-up of the anammox process—a low-carbon nitrogen removal process—in biological sewage treatment facilities. The approach can effectively upcycle sewage sludge rich in endogenous reductants, such as organics and sulfur-based compounds, but poor in oxidative substances. Specifically, this approach employs nitrate-containing wastewater as an oxidant source and utilizes nitrate to oxidize reductants in sewage sludge to provide nitrite for anammox bacterial growth. This approach can initiate anammox seeds within 45 days and form anammox seeds with biomarkers within 90 days. This work reveals the potential of sewage sludge as a source of functional microbiomes and opens a new avenue to sustainable sewage management.

 Timely and reliable building damage assessment is essential for effective disaster response and humanitarian assistance. However, the diversity of disaster types, geographic regions, and data distributions poses significant challenges to transferring building damage assessment models to new disaster scenarios (i.e., target domains). In addition, limited availability of post-disaster training imagery in target domains further hinders progress. Recent approaches, such as single-temporal change adaptation, enable adaptation using only target pre-disaster images by constructing pseudo bitemporal damage samples at an unexplainable embedding level. While effective, these methods produce representations that are difficult for human experts to interpret, inspect for errors, or adjust categorical distributions to ensure reliable model performance. In this paper, we propose Neural Disaster Simulation (NeDS), a deep disaster generative model that synthesizes realistic post-disaster image from pre-event image and customizable disaster information (i.e., disaster types and disaster intensity). Thanks to damage data generation based solely on pre-event imagery, NeDS enables adaptation at any time, effectively bypassing the limitation of post-disaster training image availability. Furthermore, by explicitly modeling disaster effects at the image level, NeDS mitigates distribution shifts between historical training data and unseen disaster events, enhancing both model transferability and visual interpretability. Extensive experiments conducted on both global-scale and local-scale study areas demonstrate that NeDS adaptation outperforms the previous state-of-the-art, achieving a 4.3% improvement in average performance on a global dataset, as well as 3.6%, 7.9%, and 18.5% gains in damage classification performance for the 2025 Eaton fire, the 2025 Palisades fire in Los Angeles, and the 2025 Nigeria flooding, respectively."

 Glyphosate is a widely used herbicide, and given its potential threats to health and the environment, it is necessary to monitor its actual use. Currently there is no publicly available remote sensing method for detecting glyphosate use on a large scale. This study developed two glyphosate detection methods based on Sentinel-2 data and compared them in a case study over the entire Netherlands. The NDVI-method detects glyphosate use based on parcel-level NDVI variation, employing multiple constraints. The Color-method detects glyphosate use by analyzing parcel-level changes in spectral values, combining a random forest classifier with multi-temporal constraints. Training and validation data consisted of citizen-science observations from waarneming.nl platform and random parcels, both manually validated. Validation showed that the NDVI-method achieved median precision 0.51 and recall 0.52, and was more sensitive to phenomena gradually reducing NDVI in actual detection (e.g., multiple shallow tillage). The Color-method demonstrated better overall performance, with median precision 0.84 and recall 0.77. The areas of glyphosate use detected by the two methods were 52,682 and 38,923 ha, respectively. Analysis based on crop type changes and soil types revealed that for Dutch agricultural land in spring, glyphosate is mainly used on sandy soils, to destroy cover crops in cropland, and to remove grass or weeds entirely in grasslands for conversion to cropland. This study demonstrates the potential of remote sensing for quantifying glyphosate use at large spatial scales, making direct detection of glyphosate use possible. However, factors including regional climate and ploughing patterns affect data availability, remaining a limitation."

 Coastal aquaculture ponds (CAPs) play a key role in ensuring global food security. However, their rapid expansion and seasonal drainage have triggered severe offshore water quality deterioration, posing substantial challenges to coastal sustainability in China. Therefore, accurately characterizing CAPs drainage dynamics and analyzing their impacts on offshore water quality are practically significant. In this study, we conducted the first national-scale assessment of CAPs drainage dynamics from 2017 to 2022 by utilizing time-series Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery combined with Sentinel-1 SAR data. We further quantitatively assessed the impacts of CAPs distribution and drainage periods on offshore water quality characterized by six parameters. CAPs drainage period exhibited temporal variations across China’s coastline. Interannual analysis of drainage patterns (2017–2022) exhibited significant delays, with an average of 12 and 29 days at the start and end of drainage periods, respectively. These temporal shifts were accompanied by a 19-day mean increase in drainage duration. Moreover, regions with degraded offshore water quality exhibited a high density of CAPs distribution. CAPs area and Chlorophyll-a concentration exhibited a significant positive correlation, which gradually increased as offshore distance decreased. Moreover, offshore water quality parameters exhibited notable peaks during the drainage periods, with the peak timing synchronized with interannual drainage dynamics, while water quality showed minimal fluctuations near the non-drained aquaculture ponds. The research findings could benefit coastal ecosystem governance and the sustainable development of marine fisheries, thereby promoting marine fishery enhancement and safeguarding marine ecological security."

 Understanding the formation and growth of secondary organic aerosols (SOA) from chemical reactions requires detailed knowledge of reaction products and their formation pathways. In this study, we investigated the reaction mechanisms and kinetics of chlorine-initiated trans-2-pentenal (T2P) reactions, including the decomposition of key intermediates and complexes, using the M06-2X/6-311+G(2df,2p) and CBS-QB3 computational methods. Thermodynamic and kinetic parameters were computed at the M06-2X level of theory, enabling the prediction of thermochemical properties for T2P, chlorine atoms, and the reaction products. For selected pathways, rate constants were determined over a temperature range of 300–3000 K at atmospheric pressure using conventional transition-state theory (CTST) and Rice–Ramsperger–Kassel–Marcus (RRKM) theory. At room temperature, the P2, P3, and P6 adducts emerged as the dominant kinetic products, with calculated rate constants aligning well with experimental data. At room temperature (300 K), the main kinetic products identified were P2 (CH3CH2CH(Cl)CHCHO), P3 (CH3CHCHCHCHO + HCl), and P6 (CH2CH2CHCHCHO + HCl). The calculated rate constants for these products were 2.91 × 10−10, 1.71 × 10−10, and 2.78 × 10−10 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 for P2, P3, and P6, respectively, which agree well with experimental observations. Dynamic modeling showed that these adducts contribute significantly to SOA formation, with particle growth up to 50 μg m−3 within 1 h at 300 K. Additionally, volatility trends of the products were analyzed to understand their atmospheric persistence and contribution to aerosol mass. Finally, leveraging insights from dynamic studies, we examined SOA formation from the relevant adducts, observing growth within 1 h at 300 K. We also discuss SOA formation in the context of volatility and its broader atmospheric implications."

 Accurately capturing drought change is particularly important in the face of climate change, especially given the need to understand the influence of temperature changes on drought under different climatic conditions. In this study, we compared two drought indices, the Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI) based only on precipitation and the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) based on precipitation and temperature, across global arid and humid regions for the period from 1991 to 2020. Through multi-scale analysis of gridded climate data spanning 1- to 24-month timescales, we systematically investigated how temperature influences drought characterization across arid and humid regions. Key findings reveal fundamental divergences in drought detection: while SPI and SPEI show strong agreement in humid regions (R2 > 0.80), their correlation declines sharply along the aridity gradient, reaching complete divergence (Δ = −100 %) in hyper-arid zones. The SPEI identifies 22–35 % more drought events than the SPI in arid/semi-arid regions, with differences magnifying at longer timescales (24-month, r = 0.58). Moreover, trend analysis demonstrates that SPEI-detected drought intensification occurs twice as rapidly as SPI trends in critical agricultural zones (−0.14 vs. −0.07), implicating rising temperatures in accelerated aridification. Notably, most semi-arid regions show significantly stronger drying trends in the SPEI, highlighting the index's enhanced sensitivity to climate change impacts. These results challenge the use of precipitation-only indices in water-limited ecosystems, demonstrating that SPI underestimates drought frequency by 18–27 % and severity by 1.2–2.3 standardized units in drylands. Our study highlights the critical need of weighting temperature effects according to regional climatic conditions, with immediate implications for early warning systems in a changing climate."

 Atmospheric Wind Profile (AWP) retrieval is essential for applications in meteorology, aerospace, and renewable energy. This study introduces MWR-WINet, a novel framework for passive AWP retrieval using ground-based Microwave Radiometer (MWR) data. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to apply passive MWR observations for wind profile estimation. The proposed approach incorporates a multi-district observation network to enhance spatial representation and introduces a composite loss function that combines Mean Squared Error (MSE) with Kullback–Leibler divergence (KL) to improve model performance. Applied to three districts in Xi'an—Weiyang, Chang'an, and Lintong—the model achieves retrieval errors of 1.63, 1.70, and 1.87 m/s, respectively. A joint three-district model further reduces the error to 1.27 m/s and enhances wind direction accuracy by 19.56 %, with a correlation gain of 0.08. These results demonstrate that a networked observational strategy significantly improves retrieval accuracy.

Here, we synthesized the response of growing season carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions to experimentally manipulated warming of ~2°C for permafrost in alpine and Arctic regions. Warming weakened the GHG sink of alpine permafrost, thereby increasing (13%) its global warming potential, but strengthened the GHG sink of Arctic permafrost and decreased (−10%) its global warming potential. When warming caused drying of alpine permafrost soils, the CO2sink weakened but the CH4sink increased. In contrast, warming of relatively wet Arctic permafrost increased the CO2sink and CH4source. Warming led to much stronger increases of the N2O source in alpine than Arctic permafrost.

However, the role of adipocyte-specific inflammatory signaling in metabolic syndrome remains unclear. The linear ubiquitin chain assembly complex, LUBAC, is an E3-ligase that generates nondegradative linear ubiquitination (Lin-Ub). LUBAC regulates NF-κB/MAPK-driven inflammation and prevents cell death triggered by immune receptors like TNF receptor-1. Here, we show that mice lacking HOIP, the Lin-E3 ligase catalytic subunit of LUBAC, in adipocytes (HoipA-KO) display lipodystrophy and heightened susceptibility to obesity-induced metabolic syndrome, particularly metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Mechanistically, loss of HOIP attenuates TNF-induced NF-κB activation and promotes cell death in human adipocytes. Inhibiting caspase-8–mediated cell death is sufficient to prevent lipodystrophy and MASLD inHoipA-KOobese mice. HOIP expression in adipose tissue positively correlates with metabolic fitness in obese individuals. Overall, our findings reveal a fundamental developmental role for Lin-Ub in adipocytes by mitigating cell death–driven adipose tissue inflammation and protecting against obesity-related metabolic syndrome."

Currently, little is known about the internal signals regulating haustorium development. Here, we identify root meristem growth factor (RGF) peptides inPhtheirospermum japonicumas endogenous inducers of prehaustorium formation. Treatment with specific RGF peptides in the absence of hosts triggered prehaustoria and induced expression ofPjYUC3, a gene required for auxin biosynthesis and prehaustorium formation. CRISPR-mediated knockouts showed that PjRGFR1 and PjRGFR3, receptors activated by the haustorium-specific RGF peptides PjRGF2 and PjRGF5, are essential for prehaustorium formation, revealing functional redundancy. Phylogenetic analyses indicate that PjRGF2 is broadly conserved among Orobanchaceae, whereas PjRGF5 appears to have recently evolved through segmental tandem multiplication. Our findings establish RGF peptides and their corresponding receptors as critical components of haustorium developmental signaling and provide insights into the evolutionary trajectories that shape plant parasitism."

As a proof-of-concept application demonstration, the nanofluidic device exhibits an ionic memory property as a nanofluidic memristor.

Conventional membranes are constrained to unidirectional transport of either cations or anions, severely limiting their versatility and performance. Inspired by the chloride voltage-gated channel 5 (ClC-5), we engineered a biomimetic Janus NP-MXene membrane featuring subnanochannels (~6.0 angstrom) and exceptional structural integrity, enabling controlled, simultaneous Na+/Cl−transport with unprecedented permselectivity. Under a 50-fold salinity gradient, the NP-MXene membrane achieved a record power density of 85.1 watts per square meter and an osmotic potential of 181.5 millivolts, the highest reported for a single device.

GM1 supplementation restores EV secretion in Huntington’s disease (HD) fibroblasts and cell models with ganglioside deficiency, including models of neurodegenerative diseases caused by a genetic block of ganglioside synthesis. Notably, GM1 enhances EV-mediated secretion of pathogenic misfolded proteins, including mutant huntingtin (mHTT), α-synuclein, and tau, reducing intracellular burden and providing mechanistic insight into the mHTT-lowering effects of GM1 in HD models.

Both the variation amplitude and the angular range over which the frictional strength varies are governed by roughness alignment. Universal statistical patterns emerge in micromechanical quantities, including the microcontact area, orientation, deformation, and their evolutions under shear, following generalized extreme value distributions.

Combining frequency tagging and machine learning, we achieved high-precision separation of neural responses to mixed melodies, classifying them by selective attention toward specific melodies. Across two magnetoencephalography datasets, individual musicality and task performance heavily influenced the attentional recruitment of cortical regions, correlating positively with top-down attention in the left parietal cortex but negatively with bottom-up attention in the right. In prefrontal areas, neural responses indicating higher sustained selective attention reflected better performance and musicality. These results suggest that musical training enhances neural mechanisms in the frontoparietal regions, boosting performance via improving top-down attention, reducing bottom-up distractions, and maintaining selective attention over time.

Currently available data assessing diatom responses focus on empirical comparisons between present-day and future conditions, rather than exploring the mechanisms driving these responses. Here, we conducted high-resolution growth experiments to map the fitness of diatoms across broad carbonate chemistry landscapes. Our results reveal species-specific carbonate chemistry niches, which can be used to predict ecological shifts between species under changing conditions driven by ocean acidification or ocean alkalinity enhancement. The results demonstrate that changes in diatom fitness are almost exclusively driven by carbon dioxide and proton concentrations, with bicarbonate exerting no discernible effect. Thus, current assumptions regarding the role of bicarbonate as a primary carbon source supporting diatom growth may be overestimated.

Fermentative yeasts are widespread in the terrestrial biosphere, and simple carbohydrates underpinning ethanol production are commonplace within fruits. We determined ethanol concentrations within fruits representing a substantial portion of the diet of our closest living relatives, the chimpanzees.

We demonstrate that cTHGM measures HbA1c fractions in single red blood cells (RBCs) in vivo and ex vivo, providing noninvasive HbA1c measurement and insights into HbA1c distribution at the cellular level. In addition, cTHGM reconstructs historical glycemic trajectories by decoding single-RBC HbA1c distributions, offering a retrospective view of glycemic variability over months. This innovative method combines label-free imaging, high spatial and spectral resolution, and noninvasive manners, making it a promising tool for diabetes management, glycemic variability monitoring, and broader applications in precision medicine."

The ultrathin electrode is fabricated using gelatin hydrogels with temperature-controlled phase change properties reinforced by nanomesh while incorporating lithium chloride, and a binary solvent achieves antifreezing and antidehydration characteristics. The design minimizes flexural rigidity, resulting in high interfacial adhesion energy with human skin, and enhances gas (air, oxygen, and carbon dioxide) permeance and water vapor transmission rate.

Using deep learning–based image analyses, including particle tracking, spatial distribution, and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) morphology analysis, we found that ER junctions facilitate stop-and-go motion switching and serve as platforms for endolysosome interactions. Within the ER network, endolysosomes exhibit three dynamic states: fast movement, local slow movement, and pausing. Pauses occur mainly at ER junctions, where transient endosome-lysosome interactions often coincide with organelle fission and are followed by departure. Disruption of ER junctions impairs lysosomal motility and maturation. We further show that actin condensation around endolysosomes mediates motion switching, involving VAP-STARD3 interaction and the actin regulator YWHAH. Other organelles, such as lipid droplets and peroxisomes, also pause near ER junctions. These findings highlight ER junctions as regulatory hubs that orchestrate organelle dynamics, contributing to the spatial coordination of organelle distribution and interactions within the cytoplasm."

Most notably, reactions initiated by sulfate photolysis have significant effects in aqueous aerosols but not in cloud/fog droplets. 
 Biotic and abiotic stresses can lead to terrestrial green plants releasing green leaf volatiles (GLVs), which can partition into atmospheric aqueous phases where they can undergo oxidation to form aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA). Anthropogenic emission changes have resulted in nitrate becoming an increasingly important component of atmospheric aqueous phases, which has significant implications for aqSOA formation since nitrate photolysis produces oxidants. Nevertheless, sulfate remains the main inorganic aqueous component in most regions, and thus it controls the pH and ionic strength of atmospheric aqueous phases. We report results from laboratory investigations of the effects of pH, ionic strength, and sulfate on the reaction kinetics and aqSOA formation of the aqueous nitrate-mediated photooxidation of four GLVs: cis-3-hexen-1-ol, trans-2-hexen-1-ol, trans-2-penten-1-ol, and 2-methyl-3-buten-2-ol. Our results showed that the aqueous reaction medium conditions, i.e., dilute cloud/fog vs. concentrated aqueous aerosol conditions, governed the effects that pH, ionic strength, and sulfate have on the GLV degradation rates and aqSOA mass yields. Most notably, reactions initiated by sulfate photolysis will have significant effects on the GLV degradation rates and aqSOA mass yields in aqueous aerosols but not in cloud/fog droplets. In addition to providing new insights into aqSOA formation from the aqueous reactions of GLVs in regions with substantial concentrations of nitrate in cloud, fog, and aqueous aerosols, this study highlights how nitrate and sulfate photochemistries can couple together to influence the reactions of water-soluble organic compounds and their aqSOA formation in aqueous aerosols, which have implications for our evaluations of aqueous organic aerosol lifetimes and composition."

We conducted laboratory experiments and atmospheric transport simulations to study the settling of commercially sold microplastics. We found that films settle up to 74 % slower and travel up to ~ 4x further than volume-equivalent spheres. Our work emphasizes the role of the atmosphere as a transport medium for commercial microplastics such as glitter. 
 The atmosphere plays a major role in the dispersion of microplastics in the environment. The atmospheric transport of large microplastics is strongly influenced by their settling behavior, which depends on their physical properties, including size and shape. However, experimental data on the settling behavior of commercially available microplastics with complex, nonspherical shapes in air are rare. Here we present experiments on the gravitational settling velocity of commercially available glitters (nominal diameters between 0.1 and 3 mm) and fibers (lengths between 1.2 and 5 mm). We observed that glitters and fibers settle up to 74 %  and 78 % slower compared to volume-equivalent spheres, respectively. The atmospheric transport of fibers has been studied previously; however, there are no studies on the atmospheric transport potential of glitters. Therefore, we used an atmospheric transport model constrained by our experimental results to assess the transport potential of glitters. Our results reveal that glitters exhibit transport distances 12 %–261 % greater than volume-equivalent spheres, highlighting their elevated atmospheric transport potential. As a result, the environmental impact of glitter particles, especially following their use in entertainment events, warrants attention and mitigation."

Most reanalyses are Eulerian, providing data at specific, fixed points in space and time. When studying how air moves, it is more convenient to follow air masses through space and time, requiring a Lagrangian Reanalysis (LARA). We explain how the LARA dataset is organised and provide four examples of applications. These include studying the evolution of wind patterns, understanding weather systems, and measuring air mass travel time over land. 
 Meteorological reanalyses are crucial datasets in atmospheric research, providing the foundation for many scientific applications. However, most reanalyses follow a Eulerian framework, providing data at specific, fixed points in space and time. This fixed-location approach is suitable for many scientific analyses, but studies focused on transport in the atmosphere would benefit from a Lagrangian framework, which provides data along dynamic, continuous trajectories following the movement of air.To achieve this, the Lagrangian particle dispersion model FLEXPART was driven offline with data from ECMWF’s (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) latest reanalysis, ERA5, to convert the Eulerian ERA5 data into a Lagrangian format. FLEXPART utilises the grid-scale winds from ERA5 and stochastic parameterisations of turbulence and convection to advect particles in a domain-filling mode, where the global atmosphere is represented by 6 million particles that move freely in the atmosphere, with their number density following closely the density of air. The resulting new Lagrangian Reanalysis (LARA: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14639472, Bakels, 2025) dataset has been stored in an easily searchable database and made accessible to researchers all over the world. It will enable a wide range of studies, including global and regional analyses of extreme events, water and energy transport in the atmosphere, and atmospheric energy budgets.Here, we describe the data format and how the data can be accessed and analysed. Using four examples, we give a non-exhaustive list of possible applications for which LARA could be used for. We show methods for how the evolution of air masses and their properties can be studied and how climatologies can be established. Our examples include a study of the evolution of the Hadley cell circulation, a climatology of warm conveyor belt events, a measure of continentality based on the time it takes for air to reach land from the ocean, and an evaluation of the dynamical consistency between subsequent ERA5 meteorological fields."

Using simulations, we developed a more accurate method that works efficiently, making it suitable for application in weather and climate prediction models. The new approach is numerically verified and provides precise predictions of ice formation events and reliable estimates of key parameters. 
 The present work aims to extend the parameterisation of homogeneous ice nucleation introduced in Dolaptchiev et al. (2023) by incorporating variable ice mean mass and generalising the approach under different conditions. The proposed method involves introducing an empirically derived correction to the parameterisation based on a large data set of parcel model simulations to account for the mean ice particle mass variations. The method is validated against ensemble simulations using time-resolved double-moment ice microphysics, showing a mean relative error of less than 16 %, with robust performance across a range of conditions. The uncertainty of the proposed parameterisation is evaluated for increasing integration time steps. The method remains computationally efficient and produces sufficiently accurate results, even with larger time steps, making it suitable for integration into numerical weather prediction and climate models. It is shown that the generalised approach not only provides a good representation of individual nucleation events but also effectively captures the statistics across the ensemble data. The prediction of the ice mixing ratio is also assessed against the reference double-moment system results. It is demonstrated that, following the nucleation event and re-initialisation of the ice mixing ratio, the system equilibrates toward the reference solution within a few time steps. This refined parameterisation offers a more accurate prediction of ice number concentration and ice mixing ratio, is not limited to perturbations induced by gravity waves (GWs), and can be supplemented by other relevant dynamical effects, such as large-scale motions or even turbulence."

These storms are responsible for substantial heat transport across the mid‐latitudes and deliver large amounts of precipitation to impacted locations. ARs occasionally penetrate the Northern Hemisphere high latitudes, resulting in elevated temperatures and anomalous precipitation, which can have a major influence on the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), yet the impact ARs may have had on the GrIS in past climates remains unexplored. The Last Interglacial (LIG; 130,000–115,000 years before present) featured a warmer Arctic than present and a smaller GrIS configuration, providing an ideal time period for characterizing how AR impacts on the GrIS respond to orbital forcing and GrIS topography. Here, we use existing simulations spanning the LIG with a dynamic GrIS to study AR behavior around the GrIS. Results show that there are two mechanisms for AR migration through the LIG. There is a dynamical control across the mid‐latitudes through orbitally induced migrations of the prevailing winds and a thermodynamic control at high latitudes due to changes in atmospheric moisture. This results in more warm season ARs at high latitudes early in the LIG which drive substantial melt around the margins of the GrIS and accumulation on the ice sheet interior. Future AR impacts on the GrIS are shown to be similar to the early LIG where an increase in high latitude moisture increases summertime ARs and thus ice sheet ablation around the GrIS margins."

10.1029/2025JD044024,False,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,该研究主要关注中层大气中的纬向对称振荡（S0）与北极平流层突然增温（SSW）事件之间的关系。它分析了2004/2005至2023/2024年间的数据，识别了S0事件和SSW事件，并探讨了它们之间的时间关联性。研究还对S0事件进行了分类，并分析了不同类型SSW事件前后S0的振幅变化。此外，研究还探讨了S0事件的触发机制，包括行星波的非线性相互作用以及其他因素，如波-平均流相互作用。虽然该研究涉及大气现象，但它更侧重于大气动力学和波动过程，而不是直接与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析）相关。,"['Sudden Stratospheric Warming', 'Zonal Wind', 'Planetary Waves', 'Wave-Mean Flow Interactions']",Shuyue Zhao;Sheng‐Yang Gu;Yusong Qin;Hao Chen;Liang Tang;Yuxuan Liu;Yafei Wei,Characteristics of Zonally Symmetric Oscillations in the Middle Atmosphere and Their Relationship With Arctic Sudden Stratospheric Warmings,"Using the zonal wind data from the Modern‐Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications Version 2, this study investigates the relationship between zonally symmetric oscillations (S0, wavenumber zero) in the middle atmosphere and Arctic sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events from 2004/2005 to 2023/2024. A total of 49 SSW and 31 S0 events were identified, with all S0 events occurring within ±20 days of SSW onset. Of these, 95% of S0 events occurred within 8.9 days of the nearest SSW onset, indicating a temporal association between S0 and SSW events. We classified the S0 into four scenarios: before and during major and minor SSW events. The average peak amplitude of S0 was higher before the onset of major SSW and after the onset of minor SSW, with the average peak amplitudes reaching 25.6 and 26.1 m/s, respectively. This variation is related to the Arctic background wind field: weak westerlies before major SSWs facilitate the propagation of S0, while reversed winds during SSWs suppress its propagation. In contrast, during minor SSW events, the weakening westerlies are favorable for the propagation of S0. Among the 31 identified S0 events, 13 (42%) are likely triggered by nonlinear interactions between traveling planetary waves and the stationary planetary wave with zonal wave number 1 (SPW1), as demonstrated by Eliassen‐Palm (EP) flux diagnostics and nonlinear interaction analysis. For the remaining 58% of events, other mechanisms, such as wave‐mean flow interactions and momentum deposition from gravity waves and tides, may be responsible."

 Neuroendocrine and tuft cells are rare chemosensory epithelial lineages defined by the expression of ASCL1 and POU2F3 transcription factors, respectively. Neuroendocrine cancers, including small cell lung cancer (SCLC), frequently display tuft-like subsets, a feature linked to poor patient outcomes1–9. The mechanisms driving neuroendocrine–tuft tumour heterogeneity and the origins of tuft-like cancers are unknown. Using multiple genetically engineered animal models of SCLC, we demonstrate that a basal cell of origin (but not the accepted neuroendocrine origin) generates neuroendocrine–tuft-like tumours that highly recapitulate human SCLC. Single-cell clonal analyses of basal-derived SCLC further uncovered unexpected transcriptional states, including an Atoh1+ state, and lineage trajectories underlying neuroendocrine–tuft plasticity. Uniquely in basal cells, the introduction of genetic alterations enriched in human tuft-like SCLC, including high MYC, PTEN loss and ASCL1 suppression, cooperates to promote tuft-like tumours. Transcriptomics of 944 human SCLCs revealed a basal-like subset and a tuft–ionocyte-like state that altogether demonstrate notable conservation between cancer states and normal basal cell injury response mechanisms10–13. Together, these data indicate that the basal cell is a probable origin for SCLC and other neuroendocrine–tuft cancers that can explain neuroendocrine–tuft heterogeneity, offering new insights for targeting lineage plasticity.

 Autonomic dysreflexia is a life-threatening medical condition characterized by episodes of uncontrolled hypertension that occur in response to sensory stimuli after spinal cord injury (SCI)1. The fragmented understanding of the mechanisms underlying autonomic dysreflexia hampers the development of therapeutic strategies to manage this condition, leaving people with SCI at daily risk of heart attack and stroke2–5. Here we expose the neuronal architecture that develops after SCI and causes autonomic dysreflexia. In parallel, we uncover a competing, yet overlapping neuronal architecture activated by epidural electrical stimulation of the spinal cord that safely regulates blood pressure after SCI. The discovery that these adversarial neuronal architectures converge onto a single neuronal subpopulation provided a blueprint for the design of a mechanism-based intervention that reversed autonomic dysreflexia in mice, rats and humans with SCI. These results establish a path towards essential pivotal device clinical trials that will establish the safety and efficacy of epidural electrical stimulation for the effective treatment of autonomic dysreflexia in people with SCI.

 Most neurodevelopmental disorders with single gene diagnoses act via haploinsufficiency, in which only one of the two gene copies is functional1. SCN2A haploinsufficiency is one of the most frequent causes of neurodevelopmental disorder, often presenting with autism spectrum disorder, intellectual disability and, in a subset of children, refractory epilepsy2. Here, using SCN2A haploinsufficiency as a proof-of-concept, we show that upregulation of the existing functional gene copy through CRISPR activation (CRISPRa) can rescue neurological-associated phenotypes in Scn2a haploinsufficient mice. We first show that restoring Scn2a expression in adolescent heterozygous Scn2a conditional knock-in mice rescues electrophysiological deficits associated with Scn2a haploinsufficiency (Scn2a+/−). Next, using an adeno-associated virus CRISPRa-based treatment in adolescent mice, we show that we can correct intrinsic and synaptic deficits in neocortical pyramidal cells, a major cell type that contributes to neurodevelopmental disorders and seizure aetiology in SCN2A haploinsufficiency. Furthermore, we find that systemic delivery of CRISPRa protects Scn2a+/− mice against chemoconvulsant-induced seizures. Finally, we also show that adeno-associated virus CRISPRa treatment rescues excitability in SCN2A haploinsufficient human stem-cell-derived neurons. Our results showcase the potential of this therapeutic approach to rescue SCN2A haploinsufficiency and demonstrates that rescue even at adolescent stages can ameliorate neurodevelopmental phenotypes. Using SCN2A haploinsufficiency as a proof-of-concept, upregulation of the existing functional gene copy through CRISPR activation was able to rescue neurological-associated phenotypes in Scn2a haploinsufficient mice and human neurons."

 Land disturbances are fundamental drivers of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics, influencing biodiversity, carbon cycling and land–atmosphere interactions. An understanding of changes in their regimes is crucial for predicting future ecosystem trajectories and guiding sustainable land management. Here we leverage the long-term record of Landsat imagery to create high-resolution (30 m) maps of annual land disturbance agents across the contiguous USA from 1988 to 2022. We find that 178.50 million hectares of US land have been cumulatively disturbed over this period. Human-directed disturbances account for 65% of this total, driven by logging, agricultural disturbance and construction. Our analysis reveals a widespread decline in human-directed disturbances (−59.21 kha yr−1) alongside a countervailing surge (20.31 kha yr−1) in less controllable, undirected ‘wild’ disturbances (fire, wind/geohazard and vegetation stress), which account for 24% of the total disturbed area. The disturbance regime shift analysis finds that although human-directed disturbances are now declining in frequency, wild disturbance frequencies are increasing at an accelerated pace. The patch size of human-directed disturbances is shrinking, while the wild disturbance patch size shows both expanding and contracting trends. Disturbance severity is rising across most of the USA. Our findings highlight an urgent need to understand and adapt to these diverging disturbance trajectories, as they will profoundly shape the future of US landscapes. Direct human impact on land disturbances in the USA is declining, while less controllable, undirected wild disturbances are increasing, according to a long-term record of high-resolution satellite imagery."

 AI scientists powered by large language models have demonstrated substantial promise in autonomously conducting experiments and facilitating scientific discoveries across various disciplines. While their capabilities are promising, these agents also introduce novel vulnerabilities that require careful consideration for safety. However, there has been limited comprehensive exploration of these vulnerabilities. This perspective examines vulnerabilities in AI scientists, shedding light on potential risks associated with their misuse, and emphasizing the need for safety measures. We begin by providing an overview of the potential risks inherent to AI scientists, taking into account user intent, the specific scientific domain, and their potential impact on the external environment. Then, we explore the underlying causes of these vulnerabilities and provide a scoping review of the limited existing works. Based on our analysis, we propose a triadic framework involving human regulation, agent alignment, and an understanding of environmental feedback (agent regulation) to mitigate these identified risks. Furthermore, we highlight the limitations and challenges associated with safeguarding AI scientists and advocate for the development of improved models, robust benchmarks, and comprehensive regulations.

 Gonorrhoea is a prevalent sexually transmitted infection caused by the bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. N. gonorrhoeae has demonstrated a remarkable capacity to evolve antibiotic resistance, with emerging strains that show resistance to all standard treatment options. The development of new antibiotics for gonorrhoea, especially those with novel targets and no pre-existing resistance, is critical. One such untapped antibacterial target in N. gonorrhoeae is FabI, an enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase enzyme that is essential for fatty acid biosynthesis in this pathogen. In the current report, structure-based drug design using novel N. gonorrhoeae FabI inhibitor co-crystals guides medicinal chemistry toward increasing potency in the sub-nanomolar range and drives the discovery of Debio 1453. Debio 1453 is optimized for activity against N. gonorrhoeae and is highly active in vitro against diverse N. gonorrhoeae isolates including those resistant to the last remaining treatment options. Additionally, the compound presents a low propensity for selection of mutants with reduced susceptibility. Debio 1453 is efficacious in vivo against N. gonorrhoeae isolates with clinically relevant multi-drug resistance phenotypes in a murine vaginal gonorrhoea infection model underscoring Debio 1453 as a promising candidate for the treatment of gonorrhoea. Debio 1453, a FabI inhibitor, shows potent activity against antibiotic-resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae, rapidly killing bacteria in vitro and clearing infection in mice, supporting its potential for treating drug-resistant gonorrhoea."

 Mammals tightly regulate their core body temperature, yet how cells sense and respond to small temperature changes remains incompletely understood. Here, we discover RNA G-quadruplexes (rG4s) as key thermosensors enriched near splice sites of cold-repressed exons. These thermosensing RNA structures, when stabilized, mask splice sites, reducing exon inclusion. Specifically, rG4s near splice sites of a cold-repressed poison exon in the neuroprotective RBM3 are stabilized at low temperatures, leading to exon exclusion. This enables evasion of nonsense-mediated decay, increasing RBM3 expression at cold. Importantly, stabilizing rG4 through increasing intracellular potassium with an FDA-approved potassium channel blocker, mimics the hypothermic effect on alternative splicing, thereby increasing RBM3 expression, leading to RBM3-dependent neuroprotection in a mouse model of subarachnoid hemorrhage. Our findings unveil a mechanism how mammalian RNAs directly sense temperature and potassium perturbations, integrating them into gene expression programs. This opens new avenues for treating diseases arising from splicing defects and disorders benefiting from therapeutic hypothermia, especially hemorrhagic stroke. Here the authors identify RNA G-quadruplexes as temperature-sensitive regulators of alternative splicing and gene expression, opening potential therapeutic avenues such as neuroprotection with potassium channel blockers."

 Climate change has large economic costs for society. An important effect is the disruption of natural resource supply by climate-mediated disturbances such as wildfires, pest outbreaks and storms. Here we show that disturbance-induced losses for Europe’s timber-based forestry could increase from the current €115 billion to €247 billion under severe climate change. This would diminish the timber value of Europe’s forests by up to 42% and reduce the current gross value added of the forestry sector by up to 15%. Central Europe emerges as a continental hotspot of disturbance costs, with projected future costs of up to €19,885 per hectare. Simultaneous climate-related increases in forest productivity could offset future economic losses from disturbances in Northern and Central Europe but not in Southern Europe. We find high disturbance-related cost of unmitigated warming, highlighting that climate change adaptation in forestry is not only an ecological but also an economic imperative.

By altering biogeochemical cycles, global plastic pollution may substantially impact the ability of the ocean to absorb and store carbon in the coming decades. 
 Increasing plastic waste has triggered global concerns for the potential detrimental effects on marine ecosystems. The impact of plastic reaches beyond the immediate harm to marine life to encompass the marine biogeochemical cycle and the global carbon budget. We investigate these effects by integrating an oceanic plastic simulation with a marine ecosystem model. We find that oceanic plastic could disturb the marine carbon cycle through three pathways: the plastic carbon buried in sediments, the release of dissolved organic carbon from water-column plastic and the toxicity effect on marine phytoplankton. Our scenario analysis suggests that there are 0.70 (0.13–3.8) Tg of plastics entering the ocean every year, however, the overall impact of oceanic plastics on decreasing ocean carbon uptake could reach 12.1 TgC yr−1. Our model predicts that the global plastic released into the ocean could result in up to 1.6 PgC of lost ocean carbon uptake and storage by 2050, given the foreseeable growth of plastic production and its long-lasting impacts. We urge comprehensive control policies to mitigate the losses caused by marine plastics both in ecosystem integrity and addressing climate change.

Here the authors apply plasmonic nanoheating integrated interfacial polymerization to create RO membranes that can remove a wide spectrum of contaminants in water in addition to efficient desalination. 
 Global water scarcity motivates sustainable clean water production from non-traditional water sources. While existing reverse osmosis (RO) membranes dominate seawater desalination, they are far from ideal for purifying diverse water sources due to inadequate removal of various low-molecular-weight contaminants. Here we overcome this limitation by developing ultraselective polyamide RO membranes via in situ interfacial plasmonic nanoheating integrated interfacial polymerization (IP). The rapid localized heating at the nano-interface of IP boosts the reactivity of monomers, improves the local mass transfer of amine monomers, and facilitates interfacial degassing/vaporization. Consequently, the resultant RO membrane, featuring highly crosslinked polyamide with extensive internal nanovoids, exhibits superior removal for a wide spectrum of toxic and hard-to-remove contaminants found in different water sources, revealing transformative potential for various water treatment scenarios. It also shows a transcendent desalination performance (water permeance of 3.4 l m−2 h−1 bar−1 and NaCl rejection of 99.7%), which further enables efficient desalination of natural seawater for high-quality freshwater, indicating great promise for practical applications.

 Road traffic outside of cities (that is, extra-urban road traffic) contributes to ecological and environmental degradation, but the global extent of the ecological impact of extra-urban road traffic is unknown. Using global time-series data on traffic volumes, we generated high-resolution traffic exposure maps that enabled us to estimate road effect zones in which ecological and environmental conditions are likely to be influenced by road traffic. We estimate that the extent of the global terrestrial land influenced by moderate to very high extra-urban road traffic increased by 53% since 1975, reaching 239 million hectares in 2015. Large extents of Europe and North America have been impacted by road traffic since 1975, while the impacted area in large parts of Asia grew rapidly. Alarmingly, 63% of key biodiversity areas were impacted by moderate to very high traffic, with the expansion of road effect zones in these areas outpacing regional rates. Of all land uses, agricultural land was most affected by road traffic. As extra-urban road effect zones are considerably more extensive than urban areas, the ecological and environmental impacts of road traffic are of global concern.

 Amber, a fossilised resin, became widespread during the Barremian ( ~ 122 Ma), marking the onset of the Cretaceous Resinous Interval (125–72 Ma). While common in the Northern Hemisphere, amber containing terrestrial arthropod inclusions had not previously been reported from the Mesozoic of South America. Here, we report the major occurrence of such amber from the early Albian ( ~ 112 Ma) Hollín Formation in Ecuadorian Napo region. Discovered at the Genoveva quarry, the amber is associated with coeval pollen and plant macrofossils deposited in fluvio-lacustrine environments. Geochemical analyses suggest araucariacean trees as the resin source, while palynological and macrofloral data indicate moderately diverse forests and the earliest known angiosperm leaf assemblage from north-western South America. Arthropods (hexapods and arachnids) representing at least six orders are well preserved.

 Microbialites are organosedimentary structures that have existed since the Precambrian and have endured through geological time, serving as archives of Earth’s environmental evolution. Today, they persist in only a few environments markedly different from those in which they first arose. Here, we report a modern microbialite reef in Laguna Pozo Bravo (Puna region, Argentina), exposed to high radiation, low oxygen pressure, and volcanic inputs reminiscent of early Earth. Through physicochemical, mineralogical, spectroscopic, electron microscopy, and metagenomic analyses, we identified diverse microbial communities with metabolic capacities that induce mineralisation. Seasonal environmental fluctuations drive cyclical changes in community composition, producing potential mineralisation patterns. Our findings suggest that carbon fixation and the metabolic drivers of alkalinity in microbialites may have evolved over time. Moreover, the variability in prokaryotic compositions among modern microbialites demonstrates that carbonate precipitation is governed by metabolic potential rather than taxonomy, reinforcing their role as dynamic records of environmental conditions.

 Groundwater is a critical resource for supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in arid and semi-arid regions, such as the Mongolian Plateau (MP), which accounts for over 82 % of total water usage in Mongolia; however, its spatiotemporal dynamics remain underexplored. In this study, aiming to enhance the connection between the Groundwater Storage (GWS) and local SDG implementation, we established an integrated analytical framework encompassing groundwater change detection, driving force analysis, and groundwater sustainability assessment. This framework quantifies groundwater storage changes across the MP from April 2002 to December 2023. Results reveal an overall groundwater change rate of −2.96 mm/yr in the MP, which increases in the west and north and decreases in the east, center, and south. The Gobi area has shown increase trends in GWS. Attribution analysis reveals that areas with increasing GWS are more influenced by climatic conditions such as higher precipitation and lower evapotranspiration, while regions with significantly decreasing GWS are associated with insufficient natural recharge and stronger human activity intensity. By contrast, winter precipitation recharge played a crucial role in slowing down the decrease in groundwater storage. In the five major basins of the MP, the dominant factors leading to groundwater depletion varied and were driven by various social factors, such as population, livestock, agriculture, and mining. A dual-index classification combining precipitation minus evapotranspiration (P−ET) and GWS trends provides a convenient, interpretable and objective approach to assessing groundwater sustainability, offering strong correspondence with the Reliability–Resilience–Vulnerability (RRV) framework. This combined strategy not only captures groundwater trends but also enhances interpretability by linking local sustainability levels to both environmental and anthropogenic drivers, underscoring the need for targeted management to support SDG 6.6. The findings of the present study provide an accurate assessment framework and valuable scientific evidence for groundwater resource management in arid and semi-arid regions."

 Mountains provide vital ecosystem services that support the livelihoods of billions of people worldwide, playing a crucial role in biodiversity conservation and climate regulation. The United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development has established a specific target (SDG 15.4) dedicated to mountain protection. The Mountain Green Cover Index (MGCI) serves as a key indicator for assessing the health of mountain ecosystems. As the 2030 Agenda passes its midpoint, the mid-term assessment of the MGCI is essential for adjusting implementation strategies and ensuring the realization of the 2030 Agenda for the protection of mountain ecosystems. However, existing country-level MGCI values fail to account for the three-dimensional characteristics unique to mountains. Additionally, quantifying the detailed mechanisms of change and dynamics in highly heterogeneous mountain areas within countries remains challenging. In this study, we developed a high-resolution grid-based MGCI model for China and estimated MGCI values from 2000 to 2022 using 30 m annual land cover data and the true surface area of mountains. We analyzed the spatiotemporal patterns of the MGCI and quantified the impacts of anthropogenic and natural factors on MGCI dynamics during the 2022 mid-term assessment. The results show that from 2000 to 2022, China’s overall MGCI increased from 78.15 % to 82.23 %, with an average annual growth rate of 0.18 %. Notably, 8.48 % of mountains experienced an MGCI increase within the (0, 0.5) range, while only 0.03 % of areas saw a decrease greater than 0.5, primarily concentrated on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau. Spatial pattern analysis revealed clear variations in MGCI along elevation and hydrothermal gradients. Driving factor analysis indicated that water-related variables explain MGCI spatial distribution more effectively than thermal conditions. Furthermore, the interaction between grazing intensity and water factors demonstrated a strong synergistic effect on MGCI distribution. This research enhances the understanding of MGCI dynamics and its driving factors in China’s mountain ecosystems, offering valuable reference for the timely achievement of mountain sustainable development goals."

 ObjectiveThis study aimed to assess indoor NO2 and SO2 levels in selected clinical and hospital dental units, identify sources linked to dental activities, and evaluate site and health risks from these gaseous oxides for students, professionals and patients, including immunocompromised.MethodTen different hospitals and clinical dental units were selected for this assessment.Key findingsAnnual average of 14.5 ± 4.6 μg/m3 of NO2 and 8.0 ± 1.7 μg/m3 of SO2 were recorded. A significant difference (<0.05) in NO2 and SO2 levels was found, while non-significant differences (>0.05) were observed between hospital and clinical units. Winter was more polluted due to higher gas levels, while spring was cleaner. Dunn's test showed a significant seasonal trend. Regression analysis revealed a robust (R2 = 0.9) to moderately strong (R2 = 0.6) correlation between the concentration of NO2 and SO2 except during winter (R2 = 0.4). The highest levels of nitrogen oxides were found during anesthesia performance, and higher sulfur oxides were observed during dental implantation and impression performance. Negligible site risk was found except during winter. Indvisual HQ-SO2 and HQ-NO2 did not present significant health risks to dentists except for HQ-NO2 to immunocompromised adult patients. Synergistic ΣHQ posed a significant HQ risk to immunocompromised patients at most dental units, but to adults at a few clinical sites.ConclusionIndoor and outdoor sources of pollutants should be closely monitored and controlled for patient safety and long-term exposure to dentists. Improve winter ventilation and use of high-evacuation system during high-exposure procedures, ensuring temperature and relative humidity are controlled."

 The North Pacific Oscillation (NPO) is the second dominant mode in the Northern Pacific sea-level pressure, exerting significant influences on the tropical cyclone (TC) over the western North Pacific (WNP). While studies show that the spatial pattern of NPO has undergone interdecadal changes, the impact of these changes on the NPO-TC relationship is unclear. Here we reveal that this relationship experienced an interdecadal shift from positive to negative correlation around 2004/2005. During the earlier period (1986–2004), the NPO induced a persistent cold pool over the WNP, which promoted northerly winds, enhancing subsidence and reduced relative humidity to suppress TC genesis. In contrast, during the later period (2005–2023), the southern lobe of the NPO extended northwestward, which led to the development of a localized warm pool over the subtropical WNP. The expanding warm pool persisted into autumn and contributed to a cyclonic circulation centered over the Philippines Sea, which enhanced upward motion and moisture convergence to promote TC genesis. Our findings provide important insights into the mechanisms driving interdecadal variability in TC activity and highlight the role of springtime NPO in improving seasonal prediction models under ongoing climate change."

Under global warming, increasing attention has been paid to its seasonal shifts and nonstationarity characteristics. In our comprehensive research, we utilized daily precipitation data from approximately 2200 gauge stations across China to investigate the spatial patterns, interannual variability, and long-term changes in the seasonality characteristics of annual maximum daily precipitation from 1960 to 2018. In the northern river basins, such as Hai, Songliao, Yellow, and Northwest River Basins, extreme daily events exhibit lower magnitude but stronger seasonality, accompanied by later timing and less variability in the mean date. Conversely, the southern river basins, such as Yangtze, Pearl, and Southeast River Basins, display the opposite pattern. Trend analysis shows that the mean occurrence date of extreme precipitation has generally advanced across most basins. Changes in the seasonality index reveal a clear north–south contrast: in the northern basins, seasonality has weakened, implying that extreme precipitation events become more dispersed throughout the year. In the southern basins, seasonality has strengthened, with extreme precipitation becoming more concentrated. The seasonal pattern of total column water vapor partly explains the earlier timing of extremes, especially in northern and central regions. Notably, El Niño-Southern Oscillation exerts a discernible influence on the seasonality of extreme precipitation. El Niño induces delayed extremes in the Huai and lower Yangtze River Basin, but earlier events in the Northwest and Pearl River Basin. Notable reduced SI during El Niño versus La Niña phases, indicating La Niña intensifies precipitation seasonality. This study plays a pivotal role in advancing our understanding of extreme precipitation events, ultimately promoting resilience and reducing vulnerabilities to weather-related disasters."

Specifically, we develop a simple rule-based model to raise crop species diversity to various levels of spatial and temporal crop diversity (driven by crop rotations) already attained by farmers in areas with broadly similar soils and climate (‘attainable diversity’). We demonstrate that small changes on the local scale have sizeable cumulative effects. For example, switching crops in 3.4% of fields (corresponding to 12.4% of US cropland area) in the 75th percentile attainable diversity scenario would raise national-scale crop diversity by over 50% (effective number of crop species increased from 7.6 to 11.5). These simulated changes in crop diversity have clear spatial patterns associated with cropland extent and field size. Finally, we examine how the geographic redistribution of key commodity crops (maize, soybean, and wheat) resulting from these crop switches would influence crop yield and production outcomes. While geographic redistribution has limited influence on yields of these three crops, including some potential yield gains, net national production declines (by ∼10%–13% in our main spatial diversification scenario) due to their reduced share in the cropland portfolio as minor crop groups expand. By drawing on a pool of crops that are already grown in areas with similar field sizes, climate, and soils, our results can help inform realistic strategies toward national-scale crop diversification—illustrating potential ‘low-hanging fruit’ for crop transitions across different landscapes. Our proposed empirical attainable diversity framework adds nuance around the opportunities and barriers associated with efforts to raise agrobiodiversity."

Here, we use a novel SSP2-com scenario that integrates updated emissions trajectories, China’s carbon neutrality pledge, and mid-to-late 21st century carbon dioxide removal (CDR) deployment to assess Earth system responses under a 2 °C-aligned pathway. Employing a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we demonstrate that SSP2-com limits end-of-century warming to 1.87 °C (below 2 °C), 0.51 °C and 1.47 °C lower than SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, respectively. Despite a reduction in global carbon sinks, SSP2-com’s stringent mitigation avoids 0.08 °C and 0.29 °C of warming relative to SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0, respectively, attributed to China’s accelerated decarbonization. Our findings suggest that combining ambitious regional action (e.g. China’s 2060 net-zero goal) with global CDR deployment provides a critical pathway to stabilize below 2 °C, yet underscores unresolved risks from uneven cooling efficacy and ecosystem feedbacks. This work advances scenario design by reconciling national climate pledges with global targets, offering actionable insights for policymakers to prioritize equity-driven mitigation."

While these stressors will globally lead to the compression of marine habitats, their regional effects vary significantly and remain understudied. This is particularly true for the southeastern Pacific (SEP), which supports rich pelagic and benthic ecosystems closely linked to a complex seafloor featuring archipelagos and extensive seamount chains. Using model simulations from Phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project, this study examines future regional-scale environmental changes in the SEP. Our analysis builds on the observation that the South Pacific Ocean Gyre is among the regions experiencing the least warming globally and that the epipelagic zone within the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) may oxygenate in the future. These conditions may promote habitat expansion, which we assess using the climate velocities for temperature, oxygen, and pH. Estimates of climate velocities from the ensemble model mean under a pessimistic near future (2015-2050) yield values ranging from –730 to 449 km/year, exhibiting greater absolute climate velocities for oxygen than pH. Over the longer-term horizon (2015–2100), the area of zones where absolute climate velocity exceeded the 75th percentile increased by 65%, 72%, and 215% for temperature, oxygen, and pH, respectively. The strongest velocities (absolute value) occur in the equatorial sector and in the Humboldt system. While all regions mostly show a climate-driven habitat loss due to surface-to-200 m pH decline, two broad areas benefit from conservation below the surface: a region in the tropics extending from 10°S–100°W to the east of Rapa Nui and the coastal region of Peru and Chile, extending up to the Desventuradas and Juan Fernández archipelagos. While the former is due to the slow warming rates (<2.9 km yr−1), the latter results from both slow deoxygenation and oxygenation climate velocities (between −2.9 and 2.9 km yr−1) along the coast of those countries, a zone that overlaps with the lowest changes in pH in the SEP, giving them a unique conservation value. We demonstrate that epipelagic ecosystems within the OMZ may be less impacted by CC than those outside of it. These findings highlight key areas for conservation under future ocean warming, deoxygenation and pH changes."

Using the socio–ecological–technological systems (SETSs) framework, challenges were systematically coded to capture interdependencies across social, ecological, and technological (S/E/T) domains. The analysis of 35 peer-reviewed publications identified 100 distinct governance challenges, revealing that most cannot be categorised within single-system domains. Instead, challenges frequently span intersections between S/E/T systems, highlighting issues such as fragmented governance structures, ecological risks from technological interventions, and legitimacy concerns linked to deployment.

Our knowledge of these dynamics remains limited in the temperate mountains of Eastern Europe, which have experienced significant land-use shifts, especially following the collapse of the communist regime. It is noteworthy that the contribution of shrubs has not been evaluated, partly due to the difficulty of providing high-resolution mapping of shrublands. In this study, we integrated four decades of Landsat-derived NDVI time series with a customized land cover classification based on Sentinel-2 imagery to investigate greenness dynamics above 1500 m elevation in the Carpathian Mountains. The classification targeted key shrubland types using spectral indices tailored to seasonal pigment variations. We also conducted diachronic visual analysis of aerial photographs, including Cold War-era satellite images, to evaluate long-term vegetation changes. We found significant positive greenness trends in 44% of the study area, with the highest magnitude located at mid-elevations (1800–2300 m) and on north-facing slopes. High-resolution land cover mapping revealed that Ericaceous and Juniperus-dominated shrublands were the strongest contributors to greening. Visual interpretation of historical imagery confirmed widespread woody encroachment in these areas. We suggest that the decline of traditional land-use, particularly extensive grazing practices, is a key driver of these ecological shifts, promoting the resurgence of previously more widespread subalpine shrublands. Our findings highlight the importance of integrating high-resolution remote sensing observations and diachronic analysis of aerial photographs to disentangle the complexity of vegetation greening in high-elevation ecosystems."

We derive the data from a machine-learning-based 3D extrapolation of high-resolution 2D satellite data and an object-based detection algorithm. Cloud properties are not only affected by the surface type. Instead, our findings highlight the impact of convective cores on horizontal and vertical cloud and core properties and a potential prolonging of the cloud life cycle. 
 In this two-part study, we examine spatio-temporal patterns of convective clouds, their properties, and organisation. We use a machine-learning-based method to extrapolate a contiguous 3D cloud field of 2D satellite data. The predicted data are used to simultaneously track both the horizontal and vertical development of clouds. Our research focuses on West Africa, a region known for frequent convective events and severe weather. In Part 1, this study compares cloud and core properties and the cloud life cycle over land and ocean during a 6-month period from March to August 2019. Our analysis reveals that 65 % of tracked cloud systems contain only a single core and persist for less than 3 h. Despite their shorter lifespan compared to multi-core clusters, single-core clouds exhibit stronger changes in the radar reflectivity and a higher vertical growth. In contrast, multi-core clouds show greater horizontal growth, encompassing larger cloud and core areas, higher cloud-top heights (CTHs), and higher average reflectivity at 10 km altitude. We also find that, in systems with more cores, both the maximum number of cores and the peak core area occur later during the cloud life cycle. Notably, the differences in cloud characteristics between land and ocean are smaller than those associated with the number of convective cores. However, the results may not fully capture climatological differences. Further research using longer time series is needed to quantify the observed variability of tropical convection."

 This series of papers explores spatio-temporal patterns of convective cloud occurrence and organisation. We use a machine-learning-based method to extrapolate a contiguous 3D cloud field of 2D satellite data. In Part 2, we focus on convective organisation in tropical West Africa between March and August 2019, examining how it relates to the 3D properties of convective clouds and their core structures. We quantify organisation using three indices (SCAI, COP, ROME) to capture different aspects of spatial cloud clustering. Our findings highlight how cloud properties may interact with organisation. Hence, strong organisation may occur with larger cloud areas, lower cloud tops and core heights, and shorter lifespans compared to the average convective system. In contrast, weak organisation may be associated with smaller clouds and fewer cores but similarly shorter lifespans. We find an increasing frequency of convective organisation in the Northern Hemisphere during boreal summer months, likely linked to the northward migration of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). From March to May, patches of strong convective organisation emerge along the African coastlines and over the southern Atlantic Ocean. Between June and August, hotspots shift inland, particularly across the Sahel and wider West African Plains. Notably, oceanic regions show slightly stronger organisation overall. However, overlapping regions of strong and weak organisation may complicate the interpretation of regional statistics. While the machine-learning-based 3D perspective helps bridge observational gaps in the representation of cloud structures, the inherent complexity and variability of convective organisation highlight the need for continued investigation."

 Large-sample datasets are essential in hydrological science to support modelling studies and advance process understanding.  Here, we present the GRDC-Caravan dataset, an extension to the large-sample hydrology project Caravan. Caravan is a community initiative which aims to combine large-sample hydrology datasets of meteorological forcing data, catchment attributes and discharge data for catchments around the world.  The GRDC-Caravan extension is based on a subset of hydrological discharge data and station-based watersheds from the Global Runoff Data Centre (GRDC), which are covered by an open data policy. The GRDC is an international data centre operating under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which collects quality-controlled river discharge data and associated metadata from the National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) of WMO member states. The extension contains discharge data and catchment boundaries from GRDC, which can be released under a permissive license (CC-BY-4.0). In addition, the extension contains meteorological forcing data and catchment attributes from the global datasets ERA5-Land and HydroATLAS in a standardized format. The dataset covers stations from 5356 catchments and 25 countries and spans the years 1950–2023. Compared to the core version of Caravan, the extension takes the total number of Caravan catchments to be 22 372 (of which 1589 catchments are duplicates between the core and extensions). While in the core Caravan dataset mostly stations from North America, central Europe  and South America were included, the new extension significantly improves the global coverage of the dataset with new stations across Europe, South America, South Africa, Australia and Aotearoa New Zealand. In addition, the temporal extension of the time series could be significantly increased from 40–70 years. The extension strongly improves the global and temporal coverage of Caravan and represents a valuable dataset for global hydrological and climatological modelling studies.

With 12 ensemble members, the assimilation was carried out using the ensemble Kalman filter algorithm within NASA's Land Information System. The SM analysis for 2016 was fully validated against in situ observations from four different networks and compared with four other existing datasets. Results indicate that this SM analysis surpasses other datasets in top-layer SM distribution, including a machine-learning-based product, despite all SM estimates being less heterogeneous than observed. The analysis of anomalous errors suggests that large similarity in intrinsic errors is likely due to overlapping data sources among the selected SM datasets. More detailed evaluations were performed over two geographic areas. The observations collected by the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement facility in Oklahoma suggest that soil temperature and surface heat fluxes are concurrently simulated with good accuracy. Investigation into the 2016 southeastern US drought response further indicates drier conditions and higher evapotranspiration estimates compared to GLEAMv4.1. Notably, large errors are associated with grids having clay soil textures, underscoring the need for refined model treatments for specific soil types to further improve SM estimates.

 This research evaluates the performance of the CE-QUAL-W2 v4.5 sediment diagenesis model in simulating water temperature, dissolved oxygen, total phosphorus, total nitrogen, chlorophyll a, and biochemical oxygen demand in a Portuguese reservoir over a six-year period (2016–2021). The model was calibrated using 35 observed profiles of temperature and dissolved oxygen, as well as six annual measurements of total nitrogen, total phosphorus, chlorophyll a, and biochemical oxygen demand at multiple depths. To benchmark performance to the sediment diagenesis model, three alternative sediment oxygen demand formulations – a Zero-order, First-order, and a Hybrid model combining both approaches – were also implemented and compared. All models achieved NSE and RMSE values within or near the ranges reported in the literature, effectively capturing the system's water quality dynamics. Among them, the Hybrid model yielded the best overall performance while maintaining a simpler structure (Water temperature – NSE: 0.96±0.18; RMSE: 1.09±0.23 °C; Dissolved oxygen – NSE: 0.76±0.30; RMSE: 1.87±0.72 mg L−1).

Overall, the results suggest that the diagenesis model may be better suited for capturing detailed process-based dynamics over extended timeframes, whereas simpler models, such as the Hybrid model, are more appropriate for short- to medium-term applications or situations with limited data availability. Hopefully, the results of this study will help improve water management strategies by supporting more informed model selection tailored to the temporal scope and data constraints of reservoir monitoring programs."

Here, we investigate the genetic architecture of nuclear magnetic resonance-based metabolomics, analyzing 249 metabolic measures and 64 biologically plausible ratios in 254,825 participants. We conduct a genome-wide association study (GWAS) identifying 24,438 independent variant-metabolite associations across 427 loci, with effect sizes highly concordant with 19 previous studies. Fine-mapping pinpoints 3610 putative causal associations, 785 of which are novel. Additionally, we utilize whole exome sequencing data and uncover 2948 gene-metabolite associations through aggregate testing, underscoring the importance of rare coding variants overlooked in GWAS. Integrating our findings with disease genetics reveals potential causal associations, such as between acetate levels and the risk of atrial fibrillation and flutter. Collectively, this study delineates the complex genetic architecture of the plasma metabolome, offering a valuable resource for future investigations into disease mechanisms and therapeutic strategies.

Here, the authors find that sensory input from the thalamus to the apical dendrites of the main cortical output neurons enables the first stage of this combination process. 
 Dendritic calcium action potentials (APs) enable the main output neurons of the cerebral cortex – pyramidal tract neurons (PTs) – to associate inputs that arrive at different cortical layers. How synaptic inputs evoke calcium APs during in vivo conditions is yet unclear. We combine in vivo recordings in male rats with synaptic input reconstructions, multi-scale modelling and optogenetic manipulations. We find that thalamocortical (TC) synapses, which provide sensory input to cortex, target specifically and most densely the dendritic domain that initiates calcium APs in PTs. Sensory input from thalamus is hence a reliable, but weak source for activating the dendritic calcium domain. Because it is fast and local, this activation enables active dendritic coupling of sensory input with multiple sensory-evoked and ongoing input streams that arrive during and surprisingly before the stimulus. This ‘TC coupling’ mechanism accounts for the modulation of the first sensory responses that leave the cortex with bursts of APs. How the brain combines sensory with non-sensory information is unknown.

Here, authors combine a genetic strategy with a novel optochemical tool to show that spindle pole-localized F-actin is essential for proper meiotic spindle assembly and chromosome segregation. 
 Mammalian oocytes are notoriously prone to chromosome segregation errors leading to aneuploidy. The spindle provides the machinery for accurate chromosome segregation during cell division. Mammalian oocytes lack centrioles and, therefore, mouse meiotic spindle relies on the organization of numerous acentriolar microtubule organizing centers into two poles (polar microtubule organizing centers, pMTOCs). The traditional view is that, in mammalian oocytes, microtubules are the sole cytoskeletal component responsible for regulating pMTOC organization and spindle assembly. We identify a previously unrecognized F-actin pool that surrounds pMTOCs, forming F-actin cage-like structure. We demonstrate that F-actin localization on the spindle depends on unconventional myosins X and VIIb. Selective disruption of spindle-localized F-actin, using myosin X/VIIb knockdown oocytes or photoswitchable Optojasp-1, perturbs pMTOC organization, leading to unfocused spindle poles and chromosome missegregation. Here, we unveil an important function of spindle-localized F-actin in regulating pMTOC organization, a critical process for ensuring the fidelity of meiotic spindle formation and proper chromosome segregation.

They combine biophysical, biochemical, and computational methods to uncover its role in the activation of G protein and arrestin pathways. 
 Previous efforts in delineating molecular mechanisms of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) activation have focused on transmembrane regions and ligand-receptor contacts of the extracellular loops. The role of the highly flexible N-termini of rhodopsin-like GPCRs have not been well characterized to date. We hypothesize that transient contacts between the peptide ligand and the intrinsically disordered N-terminus (NT) of the neuropeptide Y (NPY) receptor Y2 (Y2R) will affect receptor signaling. We employ cross-linking mass spectrometry to capture ligand-receptor contacts including transient binding modes. A photo-reactive NPY analogue allows mapping the interaction between NPY and Y2R NT resulting in a total number of 40 cross-links. The cross-links provide distance constraints for deriving structural models of the interaction. Molecular dynamics simulations highlight the structural flexibility and rapid interconversion of ligand-receptor contacts. Mutagenesis of Y2R and functional characterization suggest that the cross-linking hotspots in the NT electrostatically control its conformational ensemble. The NT engages in transient contacts to the peptide and prolongs ligand residence time, which is required for efficient interaction of Y2R with arrestin-3, but not Gi. We delineate structure-function relationships for the intrinsically disordered Y2R NT and propose a functional role for transient binding modes involving the NT of a peptide-binding receptor.

 Efficient data transfer between memory and photonic components is crucial for a wide range of applications. However, this necessity brings forth energy-efficient data movement challenges associated with the memory wall, underscoring the demand for a fast and low-energy electro-optic photonic memory solution.

Among such devices, this article will describe in detail the integrated embodiment of a ferroelectric field-effect transistor with lithium niobate on insulator micro ring resonator. We achieve switchable and non-volatile multiple optical memory states (6 states per transistor) with ultra-low energy cost (femto Joule/state), while achieving robust 10 year data retention and read-write endurance exceeding 107 cycles. Furthermore, we demonstrate the possibility of linear memory state stacking.

 Understanding the solvation structures of OH− and H3O+ at metal interfaces is crucial for developing efficient electrochemical devices. In this paper, we present a detailed investigation of the solvation structures of OH− and H3O+ near gold electrodes under alkaline and acidic aqueous conditions, using ab initio molecular dynamics simulations at controlled surface charge density conditions. Our findings reveal that the adsorption tendencies of OH− and H3O+ are strongly influenced by the oscillating net atomic charge of water normal to the electrified interface in concert with the distinct solvation patterns of these charge defects. While OH− preferentially adsorbs onto the gold surface within the first water layer, the positive net atomic charge restricts the closest approach of H3O+ to beyond the first water layer. We unveil resting and active states that support charge transfer processes at the gold/water interface, which critically involve Au atoms in a unique Grotthuss-like mechanism.

 Coastal planning, mitigation and adaptation efforts rely on credible sea-level projections generated by physical models.

Here we provide an overview of the main sources of uncertainty in model projections of sea-level change on multi-decadal to centennial timescales and we offer perspectives on the use of observations to narrow uncertainties.

In study 2 (n = 333), similar effects were observed and extended to modest reductions in climate scepticism and policy support. It is noteworthy that the effects on reducing scepticism among sceptics are inconsistent across two studies and susceptible to decay over time. Increasing the conversation length from three to six rounds yielded no additional benefit.

This study finds that, deep in the Amazon, communities effectively protected an area 36 times larger than the area they were guarding, but also had to bear all of the costs. 
 Community-based conservation has gained traction in the Brazilian Amazon because of its potential in combining territorial protection, local well-being and biodiversity conservation. We assessed the footprint of effective protection, areas actively monitored and defended through community-led surveillance, where illegal activities such as poaching, fishing and logging are successfully prevented, within the largest community-based fisheries conservation arrangement in the Amazon. While the arrangement focused specifically on 13 lakes which were on average 47 ha in size, the effectively protected floodplain area was approximately eightfold larger than the extent of direct protection, defined as the immediate focal area sustaining financial returns through co-management. The additional protection of this ‘functional area’ was on average 11,188 ha, or 36-fold larger than the directly protected area. Although the average cost of effective protection was low (US$0.95 ha−1 yr−1), this was entirely incurred by low-income local communities. Our study underscores the remarkable effort leveraged by Amazonian rural communities in protecting natural ecosystems and the imperative need to develop compensation mechanisms to financially reward them, which are currently lacking.

To address side reaction, limited cycle life and other challenges, the authors formulate a dual-salt electrolyte that decouples the interfacial electrolyte from the bulk, enabling suppressed hydrogen evolution, fast zinc transport and resilience against low temperature. 
 Aqueous zinc batteries (AZBs) are promising for sustainable energy storage due to their safety and affordability. Conventional ‘lean-water’ electrolytes improve cell cyclability and the electrochemical stability window by stabilizing the interface; however, ionic transport in the bulk is limited and the use of high-concentration salt jeopardizes their practical adaptability. Here we report a dual-salt electrolyte involving ZnSO4 and Zn(ClO4)2 that decouples the interfacial chemistry from the bulk. Specifically, SO42− ions populate the Zn/electrolyte interface, whereas ClO4− anions dominate in the bulk. Strongly hydrated SO42− stabilizes interfacial water, while weakly hydrated ClO4− disrupts bulk hydrogen-bond networks, suppressing electrolyte freezing and enabling fast Zn2+ transport. In the absence of high salt concentrations and organic solvents, our decoupled electrolyte achieves a high ionic conductivity of 15.1 mS cm⁻1 and Zn plating/stripping reversibility of 99.97% at −40 °C. Assembled Zn//NaV3O8 pouch cells under practical configurations show a daily self-discharge rate of 0.13%, retain 93% capacity after 900 cycles at 25 °C, and deliver full capacity retention over 3,000 cycles at −40 °C.

 Aligning national food systems with global goals is required for sustainable transitions. We examine if realistic, context-specific dietary changes, mindful of Swedish food culture and in line with future scenarios, are sufficient to meet ambitious environmental goals. Here, we quantified diets based on the four Swedish Food Futures scenarios, which reflect prospects of technological development, behavioral change, import trends, and values. Scenario diet nutritional intakes and environmental impacts were quantified and related to health targets and nationally adapted climate, cropland, and biodiversity boundaries. Dietary changes in scenario diets reduced environmental impacts by 30% compared to current diets. No scenario stayed within the strictest climate boundary without removal of energy-related food chain emissions—resulting in 50–60% additional impact reduction. Food chain waste reduction by 50% resulted in an additional 8–10% reduction in impacts. Dietary changes can make substantial contributions to staying within global climate, cropland, and biodiversity boundaries and meet health targets, but improvements in production and waste reductions are also required.

 Multiple cropping, the simultaneous cultivation of several crops in space or time, is a global practice essential for intensifying and diversifying agriculture. Despite its substantial impact on environmental and socioeconomic outcomes of farming, multiple cropping is hardly accounted for in assessments of global food production, sustainability, and climate impacts. Such studies, often relying on modelling of cropping systems, land use change, and eventually the Earth system, are of growing importance in decision-making and policymaking. However, they primarily assume monocropping, neglecting carryover effects between crops and their implications for land use. This limitation compromises the representativeness of these studies and the conclusions they draw, essentially overlooking a substantial option space for sustainable intensification, nature-based solutions, and resulting land-atmosphere feedback. Herein, we outline the relevance of multiple cropping, reflect on its consideration in land-use models, and identify development requirements to enhance their inclusion in informing policymaking for sustainable food systems.

 Accurate topographic phase removal in Differential InSAR (DInSAR) processing relies on Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), yet limitations in DEM accuracy and currency hinder precise surface displacement measurement. Although modern SAR satellites feature a relatively narrow orbit tube, the phases induced by DEM errors cannot be safely ignored especially in areas under rapid urbanization. Current Multi-Temporal InSAR (MT-InSAR) methods, which estimate DEM errors alongside deformation, suffer from potential biases due to inaccurate deformation models and high computational cost from per-point processing. We present here a novel detection-and-estimation strategy for efficient DEM error mitigation. Our key innovation is a phase gradient direction consistency (GDC) criterion, which provides a direct and intuitive visualization of pixels affected by DEM errors (PEEs)—a capability not previously available. This is a significant advancement as it allows targeted correction instead of exhaustive estimation. We further develop a generalizable framework for DEM error retrieval applicable to various scenarios. Validation with simulated and real-world data from urban and mountainous environments demonstrates effective separation of DEM errors from various spatiotemporal deformation signals. In addition, the proposed method achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in processing efficiency compared to conventional approaches. By directly identifying and estimating DEM errors from wrapped phases, our approach streamlines deformation retrieval and is readily integrated into existing MT-InSAR workflows."

 Crown base height (CBH) is essential for characterizing forest vertical structure over time for sustainable forest management and serves as a key input in fire model and growth model. At plot level, the average CBH (CBHa) is mainly used to assess tree growth and construct biomass models while the minimum CBH (CBHmin) can indicate the fire risk and fire behaviour. However, there are currently few CBH products available at a national or global scale. Close-range light detection and ranging (Lidar) has shown great potential in collecting plot-level forest structure parameters and can be easily scaled up to national or global scale. But considering the integrity of point clouds, CBH estimation utilizing airborne Lidar data would be always overestimated compared with other close-range Lidar data such as TLS data or backpack data. This is mainly because of the significant difference in density between the upper and lower point clouds, as well as lacking considering the tree shape. By filling the point clouds with the same density and lowering the CBH condition which considers the tree shape, we proposed an improved CBH estimation method to reduce the overestimation when using airborne Lidar data. Verified by field-measured data in six plots, the proposed method improved the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by nearly 50 % compared with the original method. The mean absolute error (MAE) was 0.694 m, R2 was 0.777 and the RMSE was 1.039 m for the validation trees. Facing different sensors and point densities, this method generally generates stable CBH estimation results. Then, we developed a newly tree-based framework that uses machine learning and multiple source remote sensing data for generating CBH products across China. We collected over 1117 km2 close-range Lidar data and used the proposed method for estimating CBH. The CBH estimation results were converted to average value and minimum value in a 1 km × 1 km plot and served as training data to generate CBH maps across China at 1 km resolution. To our best knowledge, this is the first CBH map across China, and also the first national-scale average and minimum CBH maps around the world. The results showed that the average CBHa and CBHmin were 6.76 m and 2.70 m with standard deviations of 1.59 m and 0.85 m. The methods and maps would provide a new dimension in monitoring changes in forest structure, assessing fire risk and constructing biomass models in future studies."

 The Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Global Land Surface Phenology (GLSP) product (VNP22Q2 C2) has been operationally produced since 2013, and is designed to provide annual measurements of the phenologies of vegetated land surfaces at the global scale, succeeding the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Land Cover Dynamics (LCD) product (MCD12Q2 C61), which was first produced in 2001. Although separate validations have been conducted locally to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the detected phenometrics for each product, a comprehensive understanding of the differences between these two operational products is important for downstream applications. Therefore, this study conducted critical analyses and cross-comparisons of the land surface phenology (LSP) products to ensure long-term continuity in the global phenological dynamics. Specifically, we compared five LSP products at 500 m spatial resolution: two NASA operational products of MCD12Q2 C61 and VNP22Q2 C2, as well as three other LSP products that were generated by applying the VNP22Q2 C2 algorithm to different time series from NOAA-20 VIIRS only, both SNPP and NOAA-20 VIIRS, and MODIS on Aqua and Terra. First, we cross-validated the five products at 500 m using a high-quality reference LSP dataset at 30 m that was generated by fusing the Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) observations with near-surface PhenoCam time series across diverse ecosystems in North America, Europe, and Japan. Second, cross-comparisons were conducted between the five LSP products at 500 m across 12 golden tiles. Third, the long-term comparability and continuity between the MCD12Q2 C61 and the VNP22Q2 C2 products were assessed globally. These comprehensive evaluations demonstrated that the VNP22Q2 C2 product provides overall global continuity for the MCD12Q2 C61 record. Compared to independent reference data from the HLS-PhenoCam LSP product, the four LSP products derived from the VNP22Q2 C2 algorithm produced highly comparable results with a mean absolute difference (MAD) of ∼ 11 days and mean systematic bias (MSB) of ∼ 7 days. The cross-comparisons indicated a strong agreement among the five 500 m LSP products in the 12 selected golden tiles with MADs < 7 days; however, their agreement with the MCD12Q2 C61 was slightly lower with MADs ∼ 9–10 days. The global-scale evidence of continuity between the MCD12Q2 C61 and VNP22Q2 C2 products was an absolute difference of < 15 days, except in arid/semiarid, tropical, and high-latitude ecosystems. Finally, it is suggested that (1) the continuity from MODIS to VIIRS LSP products would be enhanced if the same phenological detection algorithm was applied to the MODIS data, and (2) the quality of the VIIRS GLSP product could be improved by integrating data from multiple VIIRS sensors."

 Extreme flood disasters are intensified by climate change, exposing an increasing share of the global population to flood hazards. Accurate monitoring of inundation extents during floods is crucial for disaster management and impact assessment. While remote sensing can provide strong support for flood monitoring, optical satellite images often face significant challenges due to weather conditions and infrequent revisits, particularly in cloudy and rainy regions. To address this limitation and achieve seamless flood mapping with cloudy satellite images, this paper proposes TerrainFloodSense, a novel method that fuses water occurrence with terrain data to enhance the reconstruction of cloud-covered flooding areas, especially under extreme and unprecedented flood scenarios. Specifically, TerrainFloodSense first generates enhanced water occurrence data by Bayesian fusion of terrain indices, including Digital Surface Model (DSM) along with Height Above the Nearest Drainage (HAND), and historical water occurrence data. Then, enhanced water occurrence data are used to fill gaps caused by clouds in water maps derived from optical satellite images, guided by the submaximal stability assumption. The basic idea is that prior terrain information can be incorporated into the initial water occurrence data to enhance the ability to predict the inundation probabilities for both regular pre-flood water and extreme floodwater and to help reconstruction of cloud-covered flooding areas even under extreme flooding scenarios. Simulated experiments and applications in large-area flood mapping cases confirmed that TerrainFloodSense significantly outperformed existing methods, achieving absolute accuracy improvements of 2.95%–8.86% in overall accuracy and 0.038–0.087 increases in F1-Score under extreme flooding scenarios. This study demonstrated that the fusion of water occurrence and terrain data can effectively improve seamless flood mapping by using optical satellite images, supporting disaster monitoring and impact assessment in cloudy and rainy environments.

 Tree decline affects many perennial orchards with potentially heavy impacts on production. In five years 3 % of national production of kiwifruit orchards were lost in France, leading to economic issues and jeopardizing the value chain. Some specific management practices could help to mitigate kiwifruit decline, but rapid and simple tools are needed to assess the development of the decline in response to these practices. As kiwifruit decline is characterized by a low-vigor canopy along with changes in canopy color and density, Sentinel-2 images were used to detect vine decline over large areas. We first selected 28 orchards, with varying characteristics (e.g. row grass cover, hail protection nets, fertilization practices) and characterized each vine (14000 in total) according to its agronomic status (i.e. vigor and presence of decline symptoms). Sentinel-2 images are made up of 10 x 10 m pixels. To classify them we fitted two models using a random forest procedure. The spectral model (SM) used only spectral inputs, while the agronomic and spectral model (ASM) used both spectral inputs from satellite images and agronomic inputs obtained from orchard characteristics. Spectral inputs included raw spectral bands (e.g., red, near-infrared, green) and vegetation indices (e.g., NDVI, GNDVI). Results show that vigorous and dead areas were well detected (more than 80 % of correct predictions). Declining areas were correctly detected when patches of decline were larger than 500 m2. Mixed pixels containing vines with different agronomic status were poorly predicted. Accuracy improves when agronomic information, such as soil texture, is incorporated into the model.

 Cervid browsing influences forest ecosystems worldwide, stressing the need for wildlife management founded in accurate estimates of available forage. In this study, we developed the first national-scale models for Sweden to estimate the abundance of cervid forage by combining data from the National Forest Inventory (NFI) and different remote sensing (RS) datasets. We focused on six key forage tree species for cervids in Sweden: Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris), birch (Betula spp.), European aspen (Populus tremula), rowan (Sorbus aucuparia), oak (Quercus spp.), and goat willow (Salix caprea).We combined airborne laser scanning and other auxiliary RS data with NFI data from 2016 to 2022 to model small tree abundance from 19 461 plots across Sweden in an area-based approach. We fitted generalized linear mixed models using likelihood-ratio tests to predict species-specific forage availability. Models were validated using an independent dataset of NFI data collected in 2023. Our models demonstrated moderate to strong predictive performance, with marginal R2 values ranging from 0.226 to 0.973. Model validation suggested higher RMSE and rRMSE values for tree species that are scarce throughout the country than for more abundant species.We provide maps for all six modelled tree species, both at a 1 ha and a 1 km2 spatial scale, with the aim for them to be used in wildlife management, forestry planning, and ecological research. Our map products can for example help stakeholders assess a region’s spatial distribution of cervid forage and thus inform habitat management and potentially mitigate browsing-related economic losses in forestry."

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the important pollutant groups because of their tremendous emissions and distribution in different environmental media. This study presented comprehensive PAH concentrations from olive leaves and ambient air samples collected over one year. The average concentrations of Σ12PAH in olive leaves and ambient air were 565 ± 402 ng/g DW and 22.4 ± 3.4 ng/m3, respectively. During warmer months, both leaf and ambient air samples exhibited reduced PAH concentrations. The leaf exchange is essential for understanding the accumulation of organic pollutants in trees. Some models estimate the exchange of pollutants between the air and leaves to understand their transport paths. In this study, eleven different models with various parameters were incorporated into the data. Although the octanol/air partition coefficient (KOA) was found to be the most influential parameter in the employed models, the physical and chemical parameters of the plant, including moisture, air, and lipid content, were effective in the partition. The leaf/air partition coefficient (KLA) was used to determine the direction of PAH movement. Calculated logKLA values in the models ranged from 5.5 to 14. PAH compounds with log KOA values less than 10 showed a similar trend and were close to each other for all models evaluated in this study. However, PAHs with logKOA>10 yielded scattered results for the applied models. A best-fit model was suggested by using the data obtained in this study. The suggested model agreed well with the measured data and other models."

 Air pollution is one of the major public health issues worldwide. Exposure to air pollution has been linked to various health-related issues, including respiratory and cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, although the exact pathophysiological mechanism remains elusive. The main focus of this study was to investigate the association between inflammatory and oxidative stress responses to indoor air pollution exposure. This study investigated the effect of indoor pollutants generated from biomass burning on biomarkers (i.e., Clara cell protein (CC16), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-8 (IL-8) and 8-hydrox-2′-deoxyguanosine [8-OHdG]). One hundred healthy rural women aged 25–65 were recruited to investigate their cardiopulmonary health, blood biomarkers, and pollution status inside their kitchen rooms. Pollutant concentrations were monitored indoors with the time-activity of carbon monoxide (CO), particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5, PM1), total volatile organic compounds (TVOCs), and formaldehyde (HCHO). Serum samples were analyzed for biomarkers using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) to ensure precise measurements and enhanced sensitivity. Study results revealed higher particulate and gaseous pollutant concentrations in kitchen rooms of biomass users (p < 0.001). In unadjusted analysis, baseline serum levels of CRP (7.96 vs. 1.68 mg/L; p < 0.001), IL-8 (51.26 vs. 9.56 pg/mL; p < 0.001), 8-OHdG (71.74 vs. 26.23 ng/mL; p < 0.001) and LDH (335.1 vs. 227.65 U/L; p < 0.001) were increased in biomass-exposed vs. clean fuel users, respectively, whereas serum levels of CC16 (4846.68 ± 832.37 pg/mL; p < 0.001) were decreased. Study results revealed that particulate matter has strong positive correlations with CRP and IL-8 and a negative association with CC16 among biomass users. These findings suggest that chronic exposure to indoor pollutants may be associated with differences in markers of inflammation, lung epithelial injury, and oxidative DNA damage among tribal women. Further, this study may help explain abnormal cardiovascular and respiratory complications among rural tribal biomass fuel users."

This dataset strongly suggest the use of Inverse Rainfall Correction (IRC) framework to produce physically-meaningful corrections for precipitation products in the mountains, where precipitation estimation is problematic due to topography blockage. Post-IRC precipitation estimation produces improved hydrological responses, and it shows a good agreement with raingauge observations. 
 Quantitative Flood Estimation (QFE) in complex terrain remains a grand challenge in operational hydrology due to the lack of accurate high-resolution Quantitative Precipitation Estimates (QPE) for operational forecasting and for calibrating hydrologic models. Here, we present a high-resolution (i.e., 250 m, 5-minute-hourly) QPE dataset for 215 extreme rainfall events occurred in 26 gauged mountainous basins in the Appalachian Mountains from 2008 to 2024. This dataset is developed by applying inverse rainfall corrections (IRC) derived from physically-based rainfall-runoff modeling (Liao and Barros, 2022 and 2023) to the Next Generation Weather Radar (NEXRAD) Stage IV analysis (4 km resolution, hourly). The corrected Stage IV analysis QPE is referred to as StageIV-IRC (StageIV with Inverse Rainfall Correction). The unique advantage of this StageIV-IRC QPE dataset is its agreement with ground-based rainfall measurements while achieving water budget closure at the storm-flood event scale within observational uncertainty of streamflow observations, which is the gold standard in hydrological modeling. This dataset is the first QPE dataset aiming to improve QFE in the complex terrain by reducing biases for extreme precipitation events, and it can be used to evaluate the skill of hydrologic models in the same basins and support model calibration. The StageIV-IRC QPE dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14028866, and improved initial soil moisture maps for the studied extreme precipitation events, derived from the same IRC framework, are available in the same repository (Liao and Barros, 2025c)."

 Urban environments are characterized by continuous transformation, with new buildings, innovative infrastructures, evolving landforms, and emerging vegetation constantly reshaping the urban fabric. These dynamic changes create previously unannotated land cover classes that modify surface albedo, alter drainage patterns, and influence carbon storage, thereby affecting local climates, resource flows, and ecosystem services. Therefore, traditional land cover mapping methods based on static semantic labels are inherently limited. Even the most meticulously annotated datasets cannot comprehensively account for the full spectrum of urban classes. As urban environments continue to evolve, these static methods fail to capture the continual appearance of previously unannotated classes. This limitation leads to maps that quickly become outdated, incomplete, and imprecise, thereby impeding accurate environmental monitoring. To address this critical challenge, we propose Land Cover Discovery Mapping (LCDM), which integrates novel class discovery with land cover mapping, and we present an innovative end-to-end hybrid supervision framework, 3DLCDM, to implement LCDM in 3D remote sensing. The system has been tested on two high-resolution 3D point cloud datasets: one acquired via airborne LiDAR in Canada and the other obtained primarily using UAV-based LiDAR in Germany. Experimental results reveal that our 3DLCDM framework increases the mIoU for novel classes by up to 16.95% on the DALES dataset and up to 24.43% on the H3D dataset compared to baseline methods, demonstrating effective discovery capabilities under evaluation conditions that are procedurally equivalent to encountering genuinely novel urban features in practice. The proposed 3DLCDM framework demonstrates the potential to enable the continuous generation of up-to-date land cover maps that capture dynamic changes in urban morphology, thereby significantly advancing land cover discovery mapping. Furthermore, strong generalization across multiple datasets and urban feature types demonstrates the robustness of the framework’s discovery mechanisms and its capability to deliver high-fidelity maps that scale across diverse urban environments."

 The Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) is a climate-sensitive region with profound implications for the atmospheric water cycle in both Asia and the globe. While global warming has increased precipitation and atmospheric water-holding capacity, energy constraints prevent a proportional relationship between atmospheric water content and global mean precipitation changes. In this study, we utilized multi-source precipitation datasets (ERA5-Land, CPC, CRU, CMAP, GPCP) and atmospheric water flux data (ERA5) to investigate the conversion of atmospheric water to precipitation, a fundamental water cycle process, across the QTP and its surrounding regions from 1979 to 2020 using the Capturability of Atmospheric Water (CAW) index. Our findings reveal a dipole evolution pattern in CAW, with strengthening in the north and weakening in the south. The QTP, a positive mismatch region with limited atmospheric water but efficient precipitation conversion, is highly sensitive to climate change. The evolution of CAW is driven by meteorological factors, with cloud cover and actual evapotranspiration enhancing CAW in the northeastern QTP, while potential evapotranspiration weakens CAW in the southeastern QTP. On a larger scale, CAW evolution is modulated by large-scale atmospheric circulation patterns, where the East Asian summer monsoon enhances CAW in the northeast, while the South Asian summer monsoon weakens CAW in the southeast. Additionally, a qualitative assessment of atmospheric water resource potential, integrating CAW and water vapor transport flux, identifies four distinct development models. These findings provide critical insights for water resource management and climate adaptation strategies in the QTP."

A key source of predictability is the strong connection between the western North Pacific anomalous circulation (WNPAC) and the preceding El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO). However, the potential change of this link under future greenhouse warming remains uncertain due to substantial internal variability and inter‐model discrepancies. Here, by leveraging emergent constraints from multi‐large ensemble simulations, we show that the trans‐seasonal ENSO‐WNPAC correlation robustly strengthens under high‐emission scenarios, with a 67% reduction in the projection uncertainty. This enhancement indicates a 9% increase in the ENSO‐contributed predictability (explained variance) of summer WNPAC. The spread across models primarily derives from their differing representations of ENSO‐decaying regimes. Our results indicate a more predictable East Asian‐western Pacific summer climate in a warmer world, offering encouraging prospects for adapting to anticipated increases in extremes associated with WNPAC."

However, it remains unclear what GS characteristic is most important in driving this lead time. Here, we show that the GS sensible heat flux (SHF) gradient specifically leads the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) by 1 month. This lag relationship occurs only when climatological sea‐surface temperature and SHF gradients are largest in late winter. Further analysis reveals that fine‐scale gradients (∼50 km) are critical. A month prior to a negative NAO, stronger than normal diabatic frontogenesis associated with anomalously strong SHF gradients is observed over the separated GS region. This is collocated with a North Atlantic eddy‐driven jet located in its Southern regime. These results suggest that knowledge of fine‐scale air‐sea heat flux gradients in late winter can potentially provide useful information about the NAO in weather forecasts and climate prediction systems."

The Jovian Auroral Distributions Experiment–Electron sensors on Juno detect these PUIs because of the combination of a fast‐moving spacecraft and the large Keplerian orbital speed of the dust near Jupiter.

The HNBs show more radiogenic Sr‐Pb and less unradiogenic Nd‐Hf isotopes compared to the adakites. Their Mo isotopic enrichment (δ98/95Mo), up to −0.12‰ relative to the depleted mantle (−0.21‰), is linked to FOZO (Focal Zone)‐like Sr‐Nd‐Hf‐Pb isotopic signatures.

Based on observational diagnostics, numerical experiments, and subseasonal‐to‐seasonal (S2S) forecasts, our results consistently indicate although the monsoon activity can exert a cooling effect on the PNW, on average, it had a warming influence in the specific case of 2021 and thus contributed to the heatwave that summer. The contrasting answers to the “can it” and “did it” questions highlight how background flow and specific forcing pattern during the event can modulate—or even reverse—the expected impact.

Under the greenhouse gas (GHG)‐induced near future warming, climate models project a weakened ISM circulation, limiting the rate of monsoon rainfall increase. However, we find that climate models commonly simulate a strengthened ISM circulation in favor of ISM rainfall increase during the mid‐Pliocene that is often considered analogous to the ongoing anthropogenic warming. This enhanced ISM circulation change is physically consistent with a dramatically strong warming over Eastern Eurasia, which strengthened the mid‐upper tropospheric meridional temperature gradient across the ISM region. Sensitivity experiments reveal that such an Eastern Eurasian warming was closely associated with the northern continental greening via local vegetation‐albedo feedback.

Here, analysis of the vertically‐integrated dry static energy (DSE) budget yields a new metric for tracking the timing and variability of the South China Sea Summer Monsoon (SCSSM). The method unifies previous approaches by linking changes in precipitation and outgoing longwave radiation to initiation of the divergent circulation, thereby establishing an observable proxy for monsoon overturning. The index captures critical transitions, including monsoon onset and organized intraseasonal variability (ISV), and demonstrates robust performance across multiple reanalysis and observational data sets. Composite analysis highlights the key role of ISV, both in SCSSM onset and in the rhythmic pulses that define the ensuing wet season. Our approach further affirms signatures of interdecadal variability in onset timing reported by previous studies. The proposed framework provides a strong foundation for investigating the SCSSM and its role in the regional and global monsoon."

In this study, we investigate the formation of compaction localizations in a rock‐like porous medium composed of sintered polymethyl methacrylate beads, using high‐resolution image analysis. By tracking deformation in real‐time, we reveal a complex localization process that couples compaction with shear. Moreover, following the initial localization, we observe a transient loss and subsequent recovery of stiffness within the medium.

This paper presents evidence for an extraterrestrial impact origin, including 3D seismic, computer simulations and ‘shocked’ minerals near the crater. 
 An impact origin for Silverpit Crater, on the UK continental shelf, has been contested over the last two decades, with a lack of definitive evidence – traditionally petrographic evidence of shock metamorphism – to resolve the debate. Here we present 3D seismic, petrographic and biostratigraphic data, and numerical impact simulations to test the impact hypothesis. The seismic data provide exceptional imaging of the entire structure, confirming the presence of a central uplift, annular moat, damage zone and numerous secondary craters on the contemporaneous seabed. The distribution of normal and reverse faults in the brim, and curved radial faults around the central uplift suggest a low-angle impact from the west. The pitted, flat-topped central uplift at the top chalk horizon may indicate significant devolatilization of chalk immediately following impact. Biostratigraphic data confirm that this event occurred during the middle Eocene, between 43-46 million years ago. Petrographic analysis from the reworked ejecta sequence in the nearby 43/25-1 well reveals two grains with shock lamellae, indicating shock pressures of ~10-13 GPa, consistent with results from our numerical models. This combination of data and modelling provide compelling evidence that Silverpit Crater is an exceptionally preserved hypervelocity impact structure.

 Semantic segmentation of remotely sensed images has become increasingly popular for a wide range of natural resource and urban application, yielding promising results. To an operational semantic segmentation mapping project, having more samples generally enables the model to better extract target features, achieving higher accuracies. However, annotating remote sensing image samples for model training is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process. Strategic sampling aims to minimize the efforts in collecting new training samples for a mapping project, which has been not well studied yet for semantic segmentation. To approach this topic, we employed a hybrid way for combining meta-analysis and case studies to investigate the best practices for strategic sampling. Three factors relating to strategic sampling will be investigated: sample size, distribution and transferring methods. We first reviewed 334 recently published papers that adopted semantic segmentation for operational mapping projects to summarize the current status of training sample design from various mapping scenarios. Subsequently, we constructed a large dataset of over 12,000 high-quality annotated image patches for cropland parcel mapping across five study sites, and evaluated various sampling strategies using a baseline segmentation model. We also proposed a novel balanced sampling method, which leveraged patch-based entropy and edge complexity to classify sample diversity. Our findings revealed that (1) both meta-analysis and the case studies suggested that ∼4 % of the total mapping patches were the optimal training sample size under random sampling, i.e., the minimum size to reach accuracy saturation; (2) compared to random sampling, the newly proposed balanced sampling was superior due to its decreasing the required sample size from ∼4 % to 2.5 % of the total patches in mapped areas; (3) sample transfer and model transfer present identical performance for relaxing the average local sample demand from 2.5 % to 0.5 % of total patches, with sample transfer being slightly more accurate than model transfer (Global Total-Classification errors: 0.298 vs 0.308). This study offers a heuristic framework for applying strategic sampling in semantic segmentation, providing valuable practical guidance for implementing deep learning in an operational scenario."

 The LuTan-1 (LT-1) mission, consisting of two nearly identical synthetic aperture radar (SAR) satellites, LT-1A and LT-1B, conducted unprecedented L-band bistatic data acquisition from June to December 2022, with the objective of generating high-precision digital elevation models (DEMs) and supporting applications in geology, surveying and mapping, and forest-related studies. Therefore, a systematic evaluation of coherence is necessary, as it facilitates a comprehensive understanding of system performance and data quality, thereby supporting the above applications more effectively. This study first analyzes several error sources that can cause LT-1 coherence loss and provides corresponding data processing workflows, calibration procedures, and compensation strategies. Specifically, the evaluation and analysis include the impacts of co-registration errors, baseline decorrelation, spectral shift, radio frequency interference, ambiguity, limited signal-to-noise ratio, and quantization errors. Subsequently, we focus on decorrelation caused by volume scattering and conduct a sensitivity and application analysis of volume decorrelation with respect to forest and building height, as well as penetration depth in desert and snow-/ice-covered areas. This analysis offers a valuable reference for its application in corresponding specific scenarios.

 Deforestation is gaining increasing importance due to its strong influence on the surrounding environment, especially in developing countries where the population has a disadvantaged economic condition and agriculture is the main source of income. In Ivory Coast, for instance, where the cocoa production is the most remunerative activity, it is not rare to assist the replacement of portions of ancient forests with new cocoa plantations. To monitor this type of deleterious activity, satellites can be employed to recognize the disappearance of the forest. In this study, Forest-Non-Forest map (FNF) has been refined (from 25m/px to 10m/px) to be used as target for models based on Sentinel images input. State-of-the-art models U-Net, Attention U-Net, Segnet and FCN32 are compared over different years, combining Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and cloud probability to create forest/non-forest segmentation. Although Ivory Coast lacks of local forest coverage datasets and is partially covered by Sentinel images, it is demonstrated the feasibility of creating models classifying forest and non-forest pixels over the area using open datasets to predict where deforestation could have occurred. Although a significant portion of the deforestation research is carried out on visible bands, SAR acquisitions and the cloud probability layer are employed to overcome the limits of RGB images over areas often covered by clouds. Finally, the most promising models are employed to estimate the forest that has been cut between 2019 and 2020."

 Ascent–Drift–Descent Radiosonde System (ADDRS), China's independently developed third-generation radiosonde system, employs navigation satellite (Beidou and GPS) positioning technology to enhance the accuracy and reliability of wind measurements. Meanwhile, by using double sounding balloons nested inside and outside, it can conduct the three-phase observation of ascent–drift–descent, thereby achieving two vertical profiles and one stratospheric trajectory by releasing sounding balloons only once. Based on the data from the ADDRS GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) wind-finding radiosonde (hereafter ADDRS radiosonde) during the ascent and descent phases from field experiments conducted in Inner Mongolia and Guangdong Province, this study compared the observation-minus-analysis (O−A) statistics between the radiosonde data and the fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis (ERA5) dataset. Furthermore, the data were assessed according to the uncertainty specified in the Observing Systems Capability Analysis and Review Tool (OSCAR) requirements, which are derived from the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) Rolling Review of Requirements (RRR) for upper-air measurements. Meanwhile, the operational L-band radar wind-finding radiosonde (hereafter L-band radiosonde) data at the same stations were taken as a reference. The results show that the wind components at all levels, as well as the temperature during nighttime, can be used directly. By contrast, it is recommended that positive bias corrections be applied to the temperature in the lower stratosphere in the ascent phase during daytime and the relative humidity at upper levels; while negative bias corrections be applied to the temperature at all levels in the descent phase during daytime and the relative humidity across the lower to middle troposphere, prior to distribution on the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) to increase their utility. Except for the relative humidity between 800 and 550 hPa, all other variables from the ADDRS radiosonde data perform better than the threshold values of OSCAR requirements uncertainty, demonstrating their suitability for numerical weather prediction (NWP) application. The wind components at all levels and the temperature below 100 hPa achieve the breakthrough values, indicating potential improvements for NWP performance."

 Accurate representation of nitrous acid (HONO) chemistry is critical for modeling atmospheric oxidation capacity and secondary pollutants like ozone (O3) in China, yet current air quality models systematically underestimate HONO. To address this deficiency in the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, we integrated five additional heterogeneous reactions: heterogeneous NO2 reactions on ground/aerosol surfaces, particulate nitrate photolysis, NOx oxidation, and acid displacement reactions. These updates were evaluated against wintertime HONO observations from the Lin'an Regional Atmospheric Background Station (LABS) in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). The revised model reduced HONO underestimation dramatically, improving normalized mean bias from −90.0 % to −34.4 %. The simulation results demonstrated that ground-surface heterogeneous reactions dominated overall HONO production (45.4 %), peaking at night (65.3 %), while daytime formation was primarily driven by acid displacement (53.3 %). The enhanced HONO simulation amplified atmospheric oxidation capacity, increasing hydroxyl (OH) and hydroperoxyl (HO2) radical concentrations by 87.6 % and 172.6 %, respectively. Consequently, O3 peak simulations improved by 6.0–17.0 %, significantly reducing model bias (NMB: −8.9 % to −2.0 %) and better capturing pollution episodes.

Oswald,The Potsdam Soil Moisture Observatory: High-coverage reference observations at kilometer scale,"This data paper describes a comprehensive collection of soil moisture and related data from an extensive cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) network at an agricultural research site in north-east Germany. The data set comprises not only soil moisture observations at different spatio-temporal scales, but also a wealth of accompanying data that provide the context to interpret soil moisture dynamics within a broader hydrological and environmental framework. 
 Cosmic-ray neutron sensing (CRNS) has gained popularity for estimating soil water content (SWC) due to its innovative capability to measure at an intermediate scale – a notable advantage over point-scale sensors, which are often sparsely installed and due to small-scale heterogeneity result in uncertain absolute values. CRNS serves as a crucial link between small and large scales and has been emerging as a reference measurement for remote sensing algorithm validation for its ability to link the small and large scales. Yet, the sparse availability of long-term datasets limits use of this possibility. Within the framework of project SoMMet (21GRD08), multi-scale soil moisture monitoring was implemented to integrate CRNS with complementary in-situ observations. In this paper, we present harmonized soil moisture data from different sensor types including a CRNS cluster, shallow soil moisture measurements and soil moisture profile data, creating a ready-to-use dataset as reference observation for remote sensing products, covering a highly-instrumented agricultural site in the northeast of Germany. The data include 16 stationary CRNS sensors, with co-located point-scale SWC sensors (mostly permanent), two groundwater observation wells, meteorological records, and data from intensive manual sampling campaigns (covering SWC, bulk density, organic matter, etc.). This dataset distinguishes itself from prior studies by the increased area of approx. 1 km² while still having a high sensor density and overlapping footprints of CRNS. This allows a reasonable degree of geostatistical interpolation to obtain complete coverage. The data are available under the (https://doi.org/10.23728/b2share.db88e149f7924919be376909856739f1) (Grosse et al., 2025), providing a new reference data set for remote sensing products, hydrological or land-surface models and for other products linked to soil water balance."

Instead of manually adjusting many parameters, the method uses a mathematical tool to find the most appropriate settings for the model. It can be especially helpful for researchers who introduce new physical parameters into climate models to assess their impact on model results and optimize them along with the old ones. 
 A new tool for objective parameter tuning of regional climate models is presented. The climate model output was emulated using a linear regression approach for each grid point on a monthly mean basis. This linear approximation showed decent accuracy over a 6-year period. The root-mean-square error norm between the Meta-Model and the observational data sets was minimized using the gradient-based, limited-memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno method with box constraints. We refer to this framework as LiMMo (Linear Meta-Model optimization). The LiMMo framework was applied to the state-of-the-art regional climate model ICON-CLM, tuned to the E-OBS and HOAPS observational data sets. Different optimization objectives were explored by assigning varying weights to model variables in the error norm definition. The combination of a linear emulator with fast gradient-based optimization allows the proposed method to scale linearly with the number of model variables and parameters, facilitating the tuning of dozens of parameters simultaneously."

Silber,Survey and Modeling of Windblown Ejecta Deposits on Venus,"Venus' thick atmosphere rotates in the same direction as the solid body, but ∼60 times faster. This atmospheric superrotation has produced dozens of windblown ejecta deposits (“parabolas”) on the surface of Venus. The formation and modification of parabolas is an interplay between impacts, aeolian modification, and atmospheric dynamics. We conducted a survey to explore the nature of these sedimentary surface features. First, we observe trends in parabolas' morphology that shed light on how they are deposited and gradated. Changes in the size and radar albedo of parabolas are likely linked to the height and density (respectively) of ejecta plumes at time of formation. Next, we discovered that parabolas show orientations inconsistent with present atmospheric dynamics. This discrepancy may record a change in these dynamics or geologically recent true polar wander at a rate of ∼1° Myr−1, which is similar to that observed on Earth over the past century. These results highlight how overlapping observations at different radar wavelengths provide important insights into the history and character of geologic processes on Venus.

Studies to date have only examined each effect independently, although moisture interactions with pore walls are likely coupled to mechanical stress. Here, we present experimental data specifically collected in sandstone and granite under simultaneous control of cyclic loading alongside ambient humidity approaching saturated vapor. Adsorption can account for 40% reduction in Young's modulus, which reduces to < ${< } $10% as uniaxial stress increases from below 1 MPa to below the elastic limit. The observation is explained by a micromechanical model linking grain‐scale contact stiffness to pore‐scale vapor adsorption, quantitatively capturing coupled stress‐induced stiffening and adsorption‐induced softening. The coupled behavior is interpreted as adsorption‐induced softening becoming inhibited under greater mechanical loads. Our results suggest the coupled effects are strongest at overburden stresses between 3.3 and 10.6 MPa (140–450 m) in sandstone and 6–30.3 MPa (235–1,200 m) in granite."

Here, we offer a novel perspective on rupture termination by examining the arrest of the 1906 M 8.0 Manas earthquake in northwestern China. Integrated field surveys, seismic profiles, and microseismicity data reveal that rupture terminated at the actively growing Xiaodushan anticline. This anticline lies parallel to and in the hanging wall of the seismogenic fault. We propose active folding acts as an efficient rupture‐arrest barrier, partitioning seismic energy into strata uplift and microseismicity. Furthermore, comparative analysis of global thrust earthquakes identifies two termination mechanisms: fault geometric complexities and external structural barriers. These findings contribute to deeper understanding of rupture lengths and earthquake magnitudes for seismic hazard assessment in convergent margins globally."

Relative to counter‐factual simulations, factual simulations exhibited overall more hail, particularly for diameters ≥3 cm. This is consistent with increased CAPE but minimal changes in melting depth over this region in the current day.

To investigate the effect of heating rate on stability of thermally induced fault slip, we conducted three experiments of thermally induced fault reactivation on a granite sample containing an inclined sawcut fracture under conditions of varying heating rates spanning two orders of magnitude. We find that the spatiotemporal evolution of temperature and the resultant thermal stress control the timing and size of induced stick‐slip events. A fast heating rate induces earlier but smaller stick‐slip events. In contrast, a slow heating rate promotes a uniform distribution of temperature and thermal stress, facilitating larger stick‐slip events that occur later and exhibit higher apparent frictional strength.

In simplified models, nonlinear phase trapping by high‐amplitude waves can increase electron energy by several MeV within seconds. However, the acceleration rate in realistic wave packets is slower due to small‐scale wave field structures reducing trapping efficiency. While previous studies focused on short field‐aligned amplitude modulations and phase jumps, we examine the effects of transverse modulations, which have been observed to reach scales comparable to ultrarelativistic electron gyroradii. Using test‐particle simulations, we demonstrate that these modulations disrupt the acceleration process. Our numerical results suggest that nonlinear trapping plays a negligible role in accelerating electrons above a certain energy limit, reinforcing the diffusive nature of wave‐driven electron transport at multi‐MeV energies. Unlike field‐aligned structures, transverse phase incoherence modifies the effective wave spectrum and allows for resonance, making amplitude modulations a necessary component for suppression of acceleration."

Analysis of coupled climate model output suggests that the main ENSO signatures in pb ${p}_{b}$ are intensified fluctuations in the Bellingshausen Basin and a large‐scale see‐saw between Pacific and Indian oceans.

 The redox state of Earth’s mantle is governed by the oxidation state of iron and carbon and influences key physical and chemical mantle parameters. Mantle xenoliths, and experimental and thermodynamic studies reveal a decrease in oxygen fugacity with depth, down to ~250 km. A further more modest drop is linked to the predicted stabilization of nickel-rich metallic alloy at 250–300 km. However, garnets from 250–500 km record more oxidized conditions, and no nickel-rich alloy has been reported from these depths to account as natural evidence for the predictions. Here we report nickel–iron metallic nanoinclusions and Ni-rich carbonate microinclusions in two diamonds from the Voorspoed mine, South Africa. Various pressure indicators confirm their origin in the deep upper mantle or the shallow transition zone (280–470 km). The coexistence of nickel-rich metal and carbonate indicates a reaction between oxidized carbonatitic melt and reduced metal-bearing peridotite that led to nickel enrichment and diamond growth. This reaction captures a snapshot of the dynamics of metasomatism, including the formation of intermediate products that may later react. The diamonds provide direct evidence for nickel-rich alloy at its predicted depth within the mantle. They also indicate the presence of deep carbonatitic–silicic melts, which episodically oxidize small volumes of the mantle and play a role in the formation of kimberlites and alkali basalts. Reduced nickel-rich metal and oxidized nickel carbonate inclusions within diamonds provide evidence of metasomatic redox reactions and support the role of carbonatitic melts in oxidizing small volumes of the deep upper mantle and transition zone."

Here, the authors show that epigenetic predisposition via NR3C1-dependent early postnatal 3D gene regulation primes astrocytes for lifelong immune vulnerability. 
 Astrocytes are critical contributors to brain disorders, yet the mechanisms underlying their selective vulnerability to specific diseases remain poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that NR3C1 acts as a key regulator of early postnatal astrocyte development, shaping long-term immune responses in mice. Through integrative analyses of gene expression, chromatin accessibility, and long-range chromatin interactions, we identify 55 stage-specific TFs, with NR3C1 uniquely associated with early postnatal maturation. Although mice lacking astrocytic NR3C1 exhibit no detectable developmental abnormalities, these mice display heightened susceptibility to exacerbated immune responses following adult-onset experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Many of the dysregulated EAE response genes are linked to candidate cis-regulatory elements altered by early NR3C1 loss, driving exacerbated inflammatory responses. Notably, only NR3C1 depletion during early, but not late, astrocyte development induces long-lasting epigenetic reprogramming that primes astrocytic immune responses. How genetic predisposition drives late-onset disease risk remains unclear.

 The evolution of land plants is marked by major innovations enhancing their vegetative and reproductive fitness. Despite their extensive adaptations to terrestrial habitats, plants rely on ecological interactions with microbes for various physiological processes. Beyond their role as critical partners in the conquest of, and diversification on land, fungi and bacteria also serve as sources of genetic tools. Analyses of the gene space of land plant model organisms suggest that such transfers are unique and ancient. However here, using genomic data spanning the diversity of mosses, we demonstrate that a metallophore-synthesis gene was acquired independently from distinct microbial donors by at least five plant lineages. Furthermore we find that the first NAS gene acquired by mosses was later replaced by another fungal copy, transferred to another major moss lineage. Such a complex history of acquisition of a gene may reflect a more general pattern of highly dynamic gene exchange across the tree of life.

 Sjögren’s disease (SjD) is an autoimmune disease that causes salivary gland dysfunction due to immune-mediated destruction. While autoantibodies such as anti-SSA and anti-centromere (CENT) are associated with distinct clinical manifestations, the molecular features remain to be elucidated. In this study, we apply multi-modal single-cell technologies: single-cell RNA sequencing, T cell and B cell receptor sequencing and spatial transcriptomics to salivary gland lesions, aiming to elucidate common and unique cellular and transcriptional signatures linked to different autoantibody profiles. Our analysis demonstrates that GZMB+GNLY+ CD8+ T cells are the main expanded subset across different autoantibody statuses, highlighting their central role in SjD pathogenesis, while the enrichment of memory B cells is more prominent in anti-CENT-positive patients. Cytokine signaling also differs by autoantibody profile, with an activated interferon signature in anti-SSA-positive patients, whereas TGFβ signaling is enhanced in anti-CENT-positive patients. Furthermore, spatial profiling reveals THY1+ fibroblasts, expressing complement genes and chemokines, as key hubs orchestrating inflammation within the salivary glands.

 Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease (PVOD) is a fatal disease characterized by the remodelling of pulmonary veins and haemosiderin accumulation in macrophages. Although (General Control Nonderepressible 2) GCN2 deficiency has been reported in PVOD patients, the underlying mechanism by which GCN2 deficiency affects the pulmonary venous cells and the surrounding cells, remains unclear. Here, we perform immunohistochemistry and scRNA-sequencing analyses to show that macrophages are the major population affected by GCN2 deficiency and ferroptosis pathway-related genes are upregulated in lung macrophages of PVOD patients. Treatment with the specific ferroptosis inhibitor ferrostatin-1 (Fer-1) reverses the changes in haemodynamic indices observed in Eif2ak4K1488X/K1488X hypoxia mice and PVOD model rats. Furthermore, GCN2 deficiency increases HMOX1 and iron levels to facilitate ferroptosis in macrophages, and enhances arterial marker expression in venous endothelial cells (VECs). Specifically, spatial transcriptome analysis shows increased expression of NRP1, KDR and EFNB2 through ETS1 in VECs from PVOD patients.

 Convergent evolution of proteins provides insights into repeatability of genetic adaptation. While local convergence of proteins at residue or domain level has been characterized, global structural convergence by inter-domain/molecular interactions remains largely unknown. Here we present structural convergent evolution on fusion enzymes of aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and alcohol dehydrogenases (ADHs). We discover BdhE (bifunctional dehydrogenase E), an enzyme clade that emerged independently from the previously known AdhE family through distinct gene fusion events. AdhE and BdhE show shared enzymatic activities and non-overlapping phylogenetic distribution, suggesting common functions in different species. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals BdhEs form donut-like homotetramers, contrasting AdhE’s helical homopolymers. Intriguingly, despite distinct quaternary structures and < 30% amino acid sequence identity, both enzymes forms resemble dimeric structure units by ALDH-ADH interactions via convergently elongated loop structures. These findings suggest convergent gene fusions recurrently led to substrate channeling evolution to enhance two-step reaction efficiency.

 Amid escalating climate impacts, understanding private sector adaptation is critical.

The agriculture sector leads in adaptation efforts, while transport, construction and utilities—that is potential sources of system-wide cascading effects—lag. Small, medium and large businesses prioritize hard and soft measures, barely investing in ecosystem-based adaptations. Adding to the multifaceted discourse on adaptation effectiveness, our panel data reveal positive, although inelastic in the short run, relationships between private sector adaptations and aggregate regional economic performance. Business adaptations in the construction, transport and health sectors associate positively with regional economic performance, with the accommodation and food services sector yielding the highest return per euro invested in adaptation.

 Retreating from coastlines is one potential human response to the increasing threats posed by coastal climate hazards. However, the global extent of coastal settlement retreat, its correlation with local vulnerabilities, and the adaptation gaps remain less understood. Here we analyse night-time light changes for 1992 to 2019 and show that settlements retreated from coastlines in 56% of coastal subnational regions, remained stable in 28%, and moved closer to coastlines in 16% of these regions. Retreat was weakly associated with historical experiences of coastal climate hazards but accelerated in regions with greater vulnerability to coastal climate hazards—indicated by lower infrastructure protection and less adaptive capacity. In 46% of low-income regions, particularly in Africa and Asia, settlements were forced to either maintain their current status quo or move closer to coastlines, revealing the large adaptation gap in addressing future climate change risks.

This work analyses voltage distributions within CO2 electrolysers, identifies the sources of inefficiencies and highlights opportunities for system optimization. 
 The electrochemical reduction of carbon dioxide (CO2) can produce value-added chemicals and fuels with reduced greenhouse gas emissions by leveraging renewable electricity. However, the economic viability of this technology is limited by high full-cell voltages due to the combination of various materials and processes between the anode and the cathode. Here we analyse voltage distributions within systems that are candidates for achieving energy-efficient CO2 electroreduction: CO2 reduction (CO2R) in acidic media, cascade CO2R-CO electroreduction and CO2 reactive capture. By measuring and resolving the individual contributions to the overall cell voltage, we show that the cascade approach is, at present, the most energy-efficient candidate for achieving economic and scalable CO2R. The membrane and cathode overpotentials dominate in direct CO2R approaches (acidic CO2R and CO2R with forward-biased bipolar membranes). By contrast, the reactive capture approach benefits from a low membrane overpotential (<0.2 V) as a result of the high proton conductivity of the cation exchange membrane, with remaining overpotentials at the cathode, anode and intrinsic Nernstian pH gradient. Applying these insights, we optimize the CO electroreduction system to reach a full-cell voltage of 1.95 V at 200 mA cm−2.

 Soil phosphorus (P) cycling microorganisms (PCMs) facilitate organic P mineralization (represented by the phoD gene) and inorganic P dissolution (pqqC), driving terrestrial P cycling and enhancing P availability to plants. However, the interactive effects (i.e., additive, synergistic, and antagonistic interactions) of multiple environmental stressors (i.e., acidification, salinization, drought, metal pollution and human disturbance) on PCMs remain unclear. Combining a large-scale survey and controlled experiments, we found that the interactive effects of stressors with significance on PCM abundance and diversity were more ubiquitous than the effects of individual stressors. Specifically, acidification and drought had antagonistic and synergistic effects on the abundances of organic P mineralization microorganisms and inorganic P dissolution microorganisms, respectively, while antagonistic effects between drought and metal pollution were observed on the diversity of these microorganisms. The PCM changes were associated with soil P-related stoichiometric parameters under interactive effects, indicating that interactive stressors strongly influenced microbial-regulated P cycling and P availability in soil. These findings underscore the need to incorporate interactive stressor effects into strategies for sustainable soil P management and ecosystem resilience.

 The Arctic Ocean constitutes a globally significant carbon sink, where carbon sequestration is predominantly mediated by the biological carbon pump (BCP). Quantifying BCP magnitude and efficiency persists as a key challenge in marine carbon cycle research. Net community production (NCP) serves as a critical proxy for quantifying carbon export fluxes and assessing carbon sequestration efficacy. This study introduces the Nitrate-based Semi-Analytical Model (NSAM), an innovative framework advancing Arctic NCP quantification through synergistic integration of satellite-based observations, biogeochemical model and hydrodynamic processes. By integrating seasonal nitrate budgets derived from satellite-based observations and reanalysis data using a machine learning algorithm, the NCP is computed by applying Redfield stoichiometry (C: N = 6.6) to convert seasonal nitrogen changes into carbon export estimates. Results demonstrate strong agreement between satellite-derived NCP and in situ measurements (RMSD = 9.52 mmol C m−2 d−1), underscoring the utility of NSAM for quantifying the Arctic BCP. Satellite-based NCP provides unprecedented pan-Arctic spatial coverage, overcoming the limitations of ship-based methods constrained to discrete cruise tracks. This advancement enables refined assessments of the Arctic Ocean's contribution to global carbon sequestration dynamics."

 Recent advancements in hyperspectral satellite technology, including sensors like EnMAP, are promising for monitoring grassland ecosystems at the landscape scale. These developments include detailed vegetation analysis capabilities, crucial for understanding plant traits and species composition. However, technical restrictions of recent hyperspectral satellite missions can hinder comprehensive coverage of research areas resulting in a temporal mismatch of field measurements and satellite data.Here we utilize hyperspectral data from the DESIS, PRISMA, and EnMAP mission, along with field measurements from 74 grassland plots of the German Biodiversity Exploratories in Schorfheide-Chorin and Hainich, collected in May 2020 and 2023. We focus on the impact of different satellite sensors and their acquisition timing grouped within five phenological seasons (early April to August) on the accuracy of biomass and species composition models using Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) and Procrustes randomization tests. Additionally, we are evaluating the effectiveness of two spectral transformations in improving model accuracy and reliability.Our findings reveal significant differences in the relationship of hyperspectral satellite data with grassland biomass and species composition. Even though comparison of DESIS biomass models indicated that sensor data from the beginning of April achieved best results for biomass (R2 = 0.48), sensor data covering the SWIR from late April and June showed slightly better modeling results (EnMAP: R2 = 0.51, PRISMA: R2 = 0.53). Species composition was significantly related to spectral composition, with sensor data from late April showing the strongest relationships. The performance of sensors, including VNIR and VNIR-SWIR, was almost equal (e.g., DESIS: R2 = 0.54, PRISMA: R2 = 0.59). Overall, the results highlight the benefit of SWIR bands for biomass modeling, while their importance was minor in relation to species composition. A trend of improved model performance was observed with mean normalization for EnMAP and PRISMA data, while continuum removal led to a decrease in performance. Our study underscores the critical role of temporal and spectral data selection in improving grassland models, suggesting potential pathways for refining remote sensing approaches in ecological monitoring and management."

 Digital twin systems for transportation are widely regarded as a core technology for enabling full life-cycle management of traffic information and providing intelligent decision support, with the goals of improving traffic efficiency and reducing accident risks. However, existing research primarily focuses on simulation and prediction of traffic flow, lacking a unified framework that integrates static infrastructure, dynamic states, and microscopic behaviors. To address this gap, this paper proposes a lightweight behavior-cognitive architecture for high-definition (HD) maps to support multiscale information representation in transportation digital twin. It consists of three layers: (1) a global road network layer that models transportation infrastructure and static geographic features; (2) a dynamic target layer organizing the real time status and trajectory of traffic participants; (3) a behavioral cognition layer for behavior interpretation and understanding. Based on this architecture, a construction method for transportation digital twin systems is developed and validated through experiments conducted in real-world traffic scenarios and simulation environments. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves high adaptability and accuracy, offering effective support for building digital twin systems in complex traffic environments."

 LiDAR point cloud semantic segmentation is the foundation of numerous practical applications. Recently, the Mamba, as a promising alternative to Transformer, has been getting intense attention in this field. However, the most of existing Mamba-based methods have to crop the input point clouds into patches, which limits its global modeling ability and hinders its further application in large-scale LiDAR point cloud processing. To this end, we thoroughly investigate the difficulties of Mamba in large-scale LiDAR point cloud learning and resolve this bottleneck by combining Mamba with convolution. Specifically, we introduce convolution as an information propagator to address the long-range collapse issue, which effectively enhances the global modeling ability of Mamba and enables it to handle the large-scale point clouds without patches. Besides, we redesign the bidirectional Mamba and serialization strategy to expand the receptive field of Mamba for point cloud semantic segmentation task. Furthermore, we further investigate the selectivity of Mamba, and exploit Mamba in the down-sampling stage for feature aggregation. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, extensive experiments are conducted on two indoor and two outdoor public point cloud datasets.

 Mapping standing dead trees is critical for assessing forest health, monitoring biodiversity, and mitigating wildfire risks, for which aerial imagery has proven useful. However, dense canopy structures, spectral overlaps between living and dead vegetation, and over-segmentation errors limit the reliability of existing methods. This study introduces a hybrid post-processing framework that refines deep learning-based tree segmentation by integrating watershed algorithms with adaptive filtering to enhance instance separation and boundary precision. Leveraging a dual-task learning architecture with a Self-Attention U-Net, the framework simultaneously predicts segmentation masks, centroid heatmaps, and hybrid boundary maps, optimizing for both pixel-level accuracy and instance-level detection. Tested on high-resolution aerial imagery from boreal forests, the framework, compared to the U-Net baseline, improved instance-level segmentation accuracy by 41.5% (Tree IoU of 0.3810 vs. 0.2694) and reduced positional errors by 57% (centroid error of 3.70 pixels vs. 5.10 pixels), demonstrating robust performance in the densely vegetated boreal forest regions tested. By balancing detection accuracy (F1-score of 0.5895) and over-segmentation artifacts, the method enabled the accurate identification of individual dead trees, which is critical for ecological monitoring. The framework’s computational efficiency supports scalable applications, such as wall-to-wall tree mortality mapping over large geographic regions using aerial or satellite imagery. These capabilities directly benefit wildfire risk assessment, carbon stock estimation, and precision forestry.

 The adverse effects of air pollution on human physical health are well established, but potential links with behavioural and mental health problems are also suggested. However, evidence is limited, with few studies employing spatial life course methods or considering the effects of unmeasured and residual confounding factors. This study addresses the identified gap by using prospective longitudinal data from the Christchurch Health and Development Study to examine associations between cumulative air pollution exposure and subsequent behaviour and mental health outcomes in adulthood. The study sample consists of a birth cohort of 1265 individuals born during 1977 in Christchurch, New Zealand. Individual-level residential address data were linked to air pollution estimates, including annual black smoke levels (micrograms per cubic meter of air or μg/m3) from during pregnancy to age 10 years (1976–1987), and PM10 (21–40 years), PM2.5 (30–40 years), and NO2 (40 years) in adulthood. Behavioural (i.e. nicotine, alcohol, cannabis, and other illicit substance use disorders) and mental health outcomes (i.e. depressive symptoms, anxiety disorders, and suicidal ideation) were prospectively assessed from age 21–40 years. Findings from unadjusted population-averaged GEE logistic regression models indicated only weak associations between cumulative air pollution exposure and some behavioural and mental health outcomes. In fully adjusted models, associations were fully attenuated, other than PM2.5 exposure and nicotine abuse/dependence (OR = 1.074 [1.0156, 1.136]).

 Despite being a leading cause of health issues, air pollution in smaller cities is often overlooked. To address this gap, annual monitoring of Fine Particulate Matter (PM2.5), Black Carbon (BC), and Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) was conducted at a residential site in a semi-urban area and, for comparison, in an urban area. The sampling site was affected by multiple, co-located sources, including the National Highway (NH-19), traffic intersections, street vendor stalls, and other commercial areas, resulting in high exposure levels. The collected data were analyzed to understand the dynamics, variations, morphology, and chemical composition of particles; these levels were then assessed concerning passive cigarette smoke (PSC) exposure, evaluating potential health impacts. Four health outcomes—cardiovascular mortality (CM), lung cancer (LC), low birth weight (LBW), and decreased lung function (DLF) in school-aged children—were assessed to quantify the burden. The results indicate that even minimal concentrations can significantly affect human health, as a rise of 10 μg/m3 in PM2.5 and NO2, along with 1 μg/m3 in BC, is associated with mean increases and standard errors of 8.1 (3.98), 8.5 (4.48), and 3.03 (1.22) PSC per day across the four health outcomes, respectively. Seasonally, the post-monsoon period showed predominance due to extensive use of biomass and fossil fuels for heating and cooking in semi-urban regions, leading to an elevated prevalence of decreased lung function (DLF), with 18 passive cigarettes identified as the most significant risk factor among the various outcomes.

While climate change influences the spatial and temporal patterns of transmission, its exact effect varies due to development efforts and malaria control strategies, which have significantly reduced the incidence. Mapping the decline in incidence over two decades shows the persistence of hotspots (Central India, from the borders of Rajasthan and Gujarat to Odisha, Jharkhand, Chhattisgarh and eastern Madhya Pradesh, and North–East) and areas of significant reduction. Statistical models used in this study delineate the role of temperature and rainfall (annual, seasonal and variability). Exposure to a minimum rainfall (60–120 mm; IRR = 1.001) and warm temperature (IRR = 1.037) are necessary for transmission, but a 1 °C temperature increase during the summer months leads to a 13% reduction in cases. The variability of the long-term average in temperature contributes to the incidence (IRR = 1.3) but precipitation thwarts (IRR = 0.98). Integrating socioeconomic factors emphasises the vulnerability of historically marginalised social groups (scheduled tribe (ST) individuals) to malaria and an enhanced adaptive capacity due to improved water sources and female education. It curtails the odds of high malaria incidence by 5.6% and 4.7%, respectively. The role of last-mile health access is noted in better reporting. The classification and regression tree (CART) model also recognises ST population, proportion of educated females and access to sanitation as dominant and interacting predictors of malaria prevalence. With the success of micro-level strategies like the DAMaN and Malaria Elimination Demonstration Project, the persistence of (‘tribal’) malaria can be addressed with women’s capacity building, education, and integration with national nutrition schemes for equitable malaria elimination."

The overarching goal of marine CDR methods is to contribute to offsetting remaining CO2 emissions as a means to stabilize global mean surface air temperature (SAT). However, AU also directly affects ocean heat uptake (OHU) through the upwelling of cold ocean interior water to the surface and the simultaneous backflow of warm surface water into the ocean interior. In this study, we challenge the carbon centered perception of AU. We simulate large-scale AU in an Earth system model of intermediate complexity between the years 2025 and 2100 with and without its direct impact on OHU under low, medium and high future CO2 emission scenarios. Thus, we can quantify the individual contributions of AU-induced carbon and heat effects to changes in global mean SAT. We find the direct impact of AU on OHU to be key for a significant reduction in global mean SAT and the atmosphere’s CO2 concentration under all simulated future CO2 emission pathways. If AU directly impacts OHU, we can attribute only 17% under RCP 2.6 to 27% under RCP 8.5 of the reduction in global mean SAT (−0.17 to −0.27 °C) until the end of the century to the reduction in the atmosphere’s CO2 inventory (−5.9 to −31.2 Pg C).

A realist synthesis of ex-post evidence,"To get on track for the rapid emissions reductions required to meet the Paris Agreement temperature goal, we need to understand what climate policies work, under what conditions, and why. In this review, we study how carbon pricing policies lead to emissions reductions and which context factors make each of these mechanisms more or less effective. We systematically review the evidence from 80 ex-post carbon pricing evaluations, covering 21 policy schemes across the globe. Using a realist synthesis methodology we collect 177 hypotheses on how and under what conditions this policy works, clustering hypotheses into nine mechanisms that explain why emission reductions were achieved. We extract 293 evidence statements from the primary studies to evaluate the relevance of each of the mechanisms across different sector and country contexts. We find that in the short term there is evidence that emissions reductions are achieved by a mix of fuel switching, efficiency improvements, downscaling of some emission-intensive activities, and leakage. The prevalence of these mechanisms varies by sector and country. For other emission reduction mechanisms identified in this study, such as low-carbon technology scaling, investments, and research and development activities, there is less robust evidence, suggesting that these need to be further evaluated through longer-term policy evaluations. To gain a rigorous understanding of what climate policies work, under what conditions, and why, we need to make best use of the emerging evidence base using evidence synthesis methods that address policy-relevant research questions."

Large-ensemble simulations show that warming drives distinct seasonal changes: in winter, an intensified ridge over the western U.S. enhances moisture transport to Alaska, increasing precipitation while promoting vegetation growth near the Alaska Range. In summer, rising temperatures intensify the fire weather index signaling greater wildfire potential and increase lightning activity. Although the links among these complex seasonal changes remain difficult to validate, temporal overlap—enhanced vegetation growth followed by more fire-conducive weather, and associated increase in lightning could collectively heighten wildfire risk. The robustness of our large-ensemble simulations provides compelling evidence for these cascading effects. Extreme lightning-driven events, such as the Swan Lake Fire, represent the emerging pattern in Alaska’s evolving fire regime. The concurrent rise in winter wetness and summer fire conditions underscore the urgent need for adaptive fire management strategies that address these interconnected climate drivers."

However, the unprecedented case of Super Typhoon Yagi (2024) challenges this conventional understanding. Using satellite observations, reanalysis datasets, and numerical simulations, we show that a summer marine heatwave (MHW) in the northern SCS played a critical role in fueling Yagi’s rapid intensification and sustaining its super typhoon strength. Notably, the MHW was abruptly dissipated by Yagi’s wind-driven mixing. Further statistical analysis reveals that MHWs may serve as a necessary precondition for super typhoon development in the SCS, providing valuable predictive insights for anticipating future extreme events."

Wind power generation also heavily depends on weather conditions, which affect wind speed. Winter weather in northern Europe is influenced by the polar vortex, a strong westerly wind dominating the wintertime polar stratosphere. The polar vortex can temporarily collapse during sudden stratospheric warming (SSW), which is often followed by cold and windless weather in northern Europe, including Finland. In this paper, we examine the influence of SSWs on wintertime EC and wind power generation in Finland. We show that cold temperature and low wind speed anomalies are more often observed in winters when an SSW happens and the so-called quasi-biennial oscillation of equatorial stratospheric winds is in the easterly phase. These changes are associated with higher EC and lower wind power generation. In contrast, winters without an SSW tend to have warm temperature and high wind speed anomalies, and thus, lower EC and higher wind power generation. When the probability of an SSW event is known, the results of this study show that it is possible to predict winter EC and wind power generation several months in advance."

Results indicate a substantial increase in the duration of dangerous heat stress. By the end of the century, up to 122 million people, or around 44 of the population may experience dangerous heat stress for more than 5 of the time annually (i.e. ∼18 days), compared to 1 of the population or around 1 million people for the period 2005–2016.

In this paper, we explore the interplay between EV plug-in behavior, building energy system investment decisions, and electricity pricing design, testing electricity tariffs with varying energy and grid components. Using a comprehensive techno-economic optimization framework, we analyze how various combinations of energy and grid charges impact HP adoption across six diverse Swiss residential buildings from 2025 to 2050. We incorporate three distinct EV plug-in behavior scenarios modeled from real-world travel data. Our findings reveal that time-of-use energy charges consistently lead to the highest HP adoption rates across all building types, outperforming both flat and hourly energy pricing structures. Among grid charges, increasing block charges generally support heating electrification more effectively than peak or volumetric charges. Building characteristics substantially affect HP adoption, while EV plug-in behavior has more impact on the choice of charging infrastructure.

Most studies utilized quantitative-descriptive designs and self-report measures, assessing a wide range of specific SIs and various types of PEBs. Eight categories of SIs based on their content were identified, spanning SIs referring to the environment, specific groups, or places, with most showing positive associations with PEB. To gain a clearer understanding of these categories, they can be further grouped based on two criteria: (1) whether the SIs refer to an external environment (e.g. a specific place) or a social group of people (e.g. an activist group), and (2) whether the SIs have an obvious link to the environment and/or environmental issues (e.g. environmental identity) or not (e.g. national identity). This review emphasizes the importance of focusing on single SI categories to delve deeper into the mechanisms and potential variations within and between the categories.

 The increasing number of biogas plants in Germany and Europe necessitate an appropriate strategy to quantify potential methane (CH4) losses to ensure the sustainability of renewable energy production. In addition to high uncertainties in emission factors, there is little information on the temporal variation in CH4 emissions from biogas plants. In this study, long-term measurements of CH4 emission rates at a biogas plant in Heidelberg, Germany, were performed over a period of 8 years using mobile measurements combined with a Gaussian plume model (GPM). To increase the accuracy of the emission rate calculations and harmonize the dataset, the methodology was evaluated through six controlled methane release experiments. The results of these experiments demonstrated that our method exhibits an uncertainty lower than 30 %, provided that the following recommendations are followed: wind and solar radiation should be measured on site, at least 10 transects should be driven at low speeds, and a minimum distance of 20 m should be maintained from the emission source. By integrating these improvements into long-term monitoring practices at a biogas plant in Heidelberg, we present a comprehensive and consistent dataset of mobile measurements from 26 campaigns. The data revealed only low temporal variations in CH4 emission rates, which is probably due to the continuous operation of the biogas plant with stable procedures. Notably, the average CH4 emission rate was 5.9 ± 0.5 kg CH4 h−1. The successful integration of data acquired over 8 years through multiple measurement setups increases the reliability of the dataset, providing valuable insights into methane emissions from biogas plants."

This product is reliable for de-aliasing, signal separation in satellite gravity missions, and climate change studies. 
 Modeling sub-daily mass changes, dominated by the atmosphere and the oceans, is a fundamental requirement for nearly all existing terrestrial or space-borne geodetic observations to perform signal separation. Removing these high-frequency mass changes, through the usage of so-called de-aliasing products, is of particular interest for satellite gravity missions such as GRACE and GRACE-FO to prevent the aliasing of short-term mass changes into seasonal and long-term mass variability. Ongoing efforts focus on simulating this high-frequency signal by driving atmospheric/oceanic numerical models with specific climate-forcing fields and assimilating observational data. In this study, we establish China's first de-aliasing computation platform, achieved by using the recently released CRA-40 (China's first generation of atmospheric reanalysis) as forcing fields to drive our in-house 3-D atmospheric integration model and the LASG/IAP (State Key Laboratory of Numerical Modeling for Atmospheric Sciences and Geophysical Fluid Dynamics/Institute of Atmospheric Physics) Climate System Ocean Model 3.0 (LICOM3.0).

Therefore, scientific applications that aim to understand the sub-daily atmospheric-oceanic water exchange, as well as mission design of future satellite gravity that seeks accurate gravity de-aliasing, can use our product as a reliable source.

 Data assimilation (DA) of time-variable satellite gravity observations, such as those from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO), and future gravity missions, can be used to constrain simulations of the vertical sum of water storage in Global Hydrological Models (GHMs). However, current DA implementations of these Terrestrial Water Storage (TWS) changes are often performed at regional scales or, if applied globally, at low spatial resolutions. This limitation is primarily due to the high computational demands of DA and numerical challenges, such as instabilities in covariance matrix inversion. To fully exploit the potential of satellite gravity observations and the high spatial resolution of GHMs, we developed PyGLDA, an open-source Python-based system that enables fine-scale and computationally efficient global DA. The key innovations of PyGLDA include (1) a global patch-wise DA approach using domain localization and neighboring-weighted global aggregation and (2) seamless compatibility between basin-scale and grid-scale DA implementations. PyGLDA represents a significant functional improvement over previous DA systems, offering wide-ranging and flexible options for user-specific applications. The modular structure of the system allows users to customize water storage compartments, modify observation representations, and potentially select different GHMs. This paper provides a comprehensive description of PyGLDA and its application in a case study of the Danube River Basin, along with a demonstration of global DA, where experiments involve integrating monthly GRACE TWS fields (2002–2010) with the daily W3RA water balance model at 0.1° spatial resolution."

We advanced a model of dyking, treating it as plastic deformation in a porous medium, unlike the classic model that treats dykes as fractures in elastic solids. Comparing the two, we found the plastic model aligns with the fracture model in dyke speed and energy consumption, despite quantitative differences. This new method could be a powerful tool for understanding volcanic processes during tectonic activity. 
 Magmatic dykes play an important role in the thermomechanics of tectonic rifting of the lithosphere. Our understanding of this role is limited by the lack of models that consistently capture the interaction between magmatism, including dyking, and tectonic deformation. While linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) has provided a basis for understanding the mechanics of dykes, it is difficult to consistently incorporate LEFM into geodynamic models. Here we further develop a continuum theory that represents dykes as plastic tensile failure in a two-phase Stokes–Darcy model with a poro-viscoelastic–viscoplastic (poro-VEVP) rheological law (Li et al., 2023). We validate this approach by making quantitative comparison with LEFM, enabled by a novel formulation for buoyancy-driven porous dykes (poro-LEFM). The comparison shows that dykes in our continuum theory propagate slowly – a consequence of Darcian drag on the magma. Moreover, dissipation of mechanical energy in the poro-VEVP model implies a high critical stress intensity in LEFM. We improve the poro-VEVP model by reformulating the compaction stress and incorporating anisotropic permeability in regions of plastic failure."

Comparing the volcanic forcings generated with these tools and the one from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 for the recent eruptions of Mount Agung (1963), El Chichón (1982) and Mount Pinatubo (1991), we identify some differences in the magnitude and latitudinal structure, particularly for the eruptions of Mount Agung and El Chichón. Using these forcings, we conduct a set of retrospective prediction experiments for these eruptions with the Barcelona Supercomputing Center decadal forecast system, following a specifically designed protocol. The predictions driven by the three forcing datasets show similar post-eruption radiative responses, with particularly good agreement for the eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The global mean top-of-atmosphere flux and global mean surface temperature responses in the hindcast experiments are indistinguishable across the three forcing sets and three eruptions. However, we find differences in the zonal mean and regional responses due to the latitudinally-varying structure of the volcanic forcings, particularly for the eruptions of Mount Agung and El Chichón. Significant differences among the datasets are found in the global mean lower stratospheric warming, where the responses are strongest. Comparing the predicted anomalies in these hindcasts with observations we show that overall there is better agreement when volcanic forcing is included, highlighting its importance to accurate predictions. Our study suggests that either EVA and EVA_H forcings can be used for predicting the post-volcanic radiative response, although the generated forcing datasets and simulations should be interpreted with care given the limitations of these reduced-complexity empirical models."

Here, we explore the potential relationship between initial fault heterogeneity and fracture energy during rupture. Relying on concepts of wear analysis, we combine results of direct shear laboratory experiments involving interlocked rough surfaces and results of modeling in a framework of damage‐breakage rheology. Our findings suggest that fracture energy per slip amount and fault area, normalized by the normal stress, increases with fault heterogeneity due to enhanced damage accumulation through shear. In faults exhibiting self‐affine geometrical irregularities with a constant scaling exponent, we find that fracture energy scales with rupture size and amplitude of heterogeneity.

 The copper-catalysed functionalization of aryl halides is one of the most preferred methods for the formation of carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bonds.1 Yet, the redox behaviour of the copper species in the catalytic cycle remains elusive and a subject of considerable debate.2 We report experimental and theoretical mechanistic investigations into the reaction of a well-defined Cu(I) complex with an electron-poor aryl iodide, which leads to the formation of an isolable Cu(III)−aryl complex, that subsequently reductively eliminates to forge a C(sp2)−CF3 bond. Our integrated experimental and theoretical findings indicate that the process proceeds through a redox sequence of Cu(I)/Cu(III)/Cu(II)/Cu(III)/Cu(I). Additionally, we managed to interrupt this sequence by temperature control and captured the reactivity of the copper species through various spectroscopic methods, facilitating in-depth mechanistic analysis. These findings shed light on the intricate behaviour of copper species and challenge the traditional mechanistic proposal for the reaction of Cu(I) with aryl iodide, thus providing fresh perspectives into the mechanistic aspect of the copper-catalysed coupling reactions."

 Forest soils hold the largest terrestrial carbon pool, derived from dead plant tissues and transformed by soil biota. Current frameworks emphasize the role of soil microbes in highly persistent forms of carbon. However, moderately persistent forms of carbon also contribute substantially to forest soil carbon pools through the iterative effects of plant litter inputs and outputs over multi-decadal timescales. These sources of soil carbon are not well constrained. Here we synthesize published field data of the finest roots (absorptive roots) of mycorrhizal woody plants across major forest ecosystem types in the Northern Hemisphere. We estimate that, owing to fast turnover and slow decomposition, the iterative effects of absorptive roots on soil carbon accrual generate 2.4 ± 0.1 MgC ha−1 over two decades, exceeding that of leaves by 65%. Further, roots associated with arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi contribute 43% more soil carbon than roots associated with ectomycorrhizal fungi, despite ectomycorrhizal forests dominating soil carbon storage in forest soils overall. We also find that specific root length, a readily measured trait, can be used as a proxy for iterative effects associated with root dynamics. Our findings thus provide a long-needed belowground metric for carbon modelling in the Earth system.

Santoro,Minor contribution of ammonia oxidizers to inorganic carbon fixation in the ocean,"Ammonia oxidizers contribute minimally to carbon fixation in the dark ocean despite their abundance at depth, according to enzyme inhibition experiments on water samples from two cruises. 
 Ammonia-oxidizing archaea are the most abundant chemolithoautotrophs in the ocean and are assumed to dominate carbon fixation below the sunlit surface layer. However, the supply of reduced nitrogen delivered from the surface in sinking particulate organic matter is insufficient to support the amount of nitrification required to sustain measured carbon fixation rates in the dark ocean. Here we attempt to reconcile this observed discrepancy by quantifying the contribution of ammonia oxidizers to dark carbon fixation in the eastern tropical and subtropical Pacific Ocean. We used phenylacetylene—a specific inhibitor of the ammonia monooxygenase enzyme—to selectively inhibit ammonia oxidizers in samples collected throughout the water column (60–600 m depth). We show that, despite their high abundances, ammonia oxidizers contribute only a small fraction to dark carbon fixation, accounting for 4–25% of the total depth-integrated rates in the eastern tropical Pacific. The highest contributions were observed within the upper mesopelagic zone (120–175 m depth), where ammonia oxidation could account for ~50% of dark carbon fixation at some stations. Our results challenge the current view that carbon fixation in the dark ocean is primarily sustained by nitrification and suggest that other microbial metabolisms, including heterotrophy, might play a larger role than previously assumed.

 PBK/TOPK is a mitotic kinase implicated in haematological and non-haematological cancers. Here we show that the key haemopoietic regulators Ikaros and Aiolos require PBK-mediated phosphorylation to dissociate from chromosomes in mitosis. Eviction of Ikaros is rapidly reversed by addition of the PBK-inhibitor OTS514, revealing dynamic regulation by kinase and phosphatase activities. To identify more PBK targets, we analysed loss of mitotic phosphorylation events in Pbk–/– preB cells and performed proteomic comparisons on isolated mitotic chromosomes. Among a large pool of C2H2-zinc finger targets, PBK is essential for evicting the CCCTC-binding protein CTCF and zinc finger proteins encoded by Ikzf1, Ikzf3, Znf131 and Zbtb11. PBK-deficient cells were able to divide but showed altered chromatin accessibility and nucleosome positioning consistent with CTCF retention.

Here, Xu et al. identify more than 45 diseases linked to marrow adiposity in over 48,000 people, including causal roles in musculoskeletal disease. 
 Bone marrow adiposity changes in diverse diseases, but the full scope of these, and whether they are directly influenced by marrow adiposity, remains unknown. To address this, we previously measured the bone marrow fat fraction of the femoral head, total hip, femoral diaphysis, and spine of over 48,000 UK Biobank participants. Here, we first use these data for PheWAS to identify diseases associated with marrow adiposity at each site. This reveals associations with 47 incident diseases across 12 disease categories, including osteoporosis, fracture, type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and other conditions that burden public health worldwide. Intriguingly, type 2 diabetes associates positively with spine bone marrow adiposity but negatively with marrow adiposity at femoral sites. We then establish PRSs based on bone-marrow-fat-fraction-associated SNPs and use PRS-PheWAS and Mendelian randomization to explore causal associations between marrow adiposity and disease. PRS-PheWAS reveals that genetic predisposition to increased marrow adiposity is positively associated with osteoporosis and fractures. Mendelian randomization further suggests that increased marrow adiposity at the diaphysis and total hip is causally associated with osteoporosis. Our findings substantially advance understanding of how marrow adiposity impacts human health and highlight its potential as a biomarker and/or therapeutic target for diverse human diseases.

Here the authors report a well-preserved, late surviving megaraptoran from Argentina that clarifies our understanding of the morphology of this group and potentially provides insights into its diet and feeding strategies. 
 Recent fossil discoveries have cast considerable light on the palaeobiology of Megaraptora, a group of large-clawed carnivorous theropod dinosaurs known from Cretaceous deposits in Asia, Australia, and especially South America. Nevertheless, many important aspects of megaraptoran morphology and evolution remain poorly understood, due in large part to the fragmentary nature of most fossils of these theropods and the scarcity of anatomically overlapping skeletal elements among the known taxa. Here we report a previously unknown megaraptoran genus and species represented by a partially articulated partial skeleton recovered from an uppermost Cretaceous stratum of the Lago Colhué Huapi Formation of south-central Chubut Province in central Patagonia, Argentina. Pertaining to the derived megaraptoran subclade Megaraptoridae, the taxon is among the most completely represented and latest-surviving megaraptorans. Its stratigraphic occurrence indicates that these dinosaurs likely persisted to the Cretaceous/Palaeogene boundary; moreover, the preservation of a crocodyliform humerus between the dentaries of the new theropod may provide information on megaraptoran dietary preferences and feeding strategies. Megaraptorids appear to have been the apex predators in central and southern Patagonian palaeoecosystems approaching the end of the Cretaceous, in contrast to more northerly areas of South America where these niches were occupied by other non-avian theropod groups.

 Access to water is crucial for all aspects of life. Anthropogenic global warming is projected to disrupt the hydrological cycle, leading to water scarcity. However, the timing and hotspot regions of unprecedented water scarcity are unknown. Here, we estimate the Time of First Emergence (ToFE) of drought-driven water scarcity events, referred to as “Day Zero Drought” (DZD), which arises from hydrological compound extremes, including prolonged rainfall deficits, reduced river flow, and increasing water consumption. Using a probabilistic framework and a large ensemble of climate simulations, we attribute the timing and likelihood of DZD events to human influence. Many regions, including major reservoirs, may face high risk of DZD by the 2020s and 2030s. Despite model and scenario uncertainties, consistent DZD hotspots emerge across the Mediterranean, southern Africa, and parts of North America. Urban populations are particularly vulnerable at the 1.5 °C warming level. The length of time between successive DZD events is shorter than the duration of DZD, limiting recovery periods and exacerbating water scarcity risks. Therefore, more proactive water strategies are urgently needed to avoid severe societal impacts of DZD.

Here, authors identify a population of spinal galanin-expressing neurons that regulate sexual arousal and mating in male mice, revealing a broader role for spinal circuits in copulation than previously acknowledged. 
 During sex, male arousal builds to the ejaculatory threshold, allowing genital sensory input to trigger ejaculation. While copulation and arousal are thought to be brain-regulated, ejaculation is a reflex controlled by a spinal circuit. In this framework, the spinal cord is assumed to be strongly inhibited by descending input until the ejaculatory threshold, playing no role in the regulation of copulatory behavior. However, this remains untested. Here we mapped the spinal circuit controlling the bulbospongiosus muscle, essential for sperm expulsion in mice. Our findings show that bulbospongiosus muscle-motor neurons receive input from galanin-expressing neurons, which integrate genital sensory signals. Stimulating these neurons induces bulbospongiosus activity, but responses vary with spinalization, internal state, and decrease with repeated stimulation. Ablating galanin-positive neurons altered ejaculation latency and copulatory patterns. These results suggest that spinal circuits influence not only ejaculation but also copulation and arousal, challenging the traditional view of spinal control in copulation. The precise role of the spinal cord in copulatory behavior remains not fully understood. Here, authors identify a population of spinal galanin-expressing neurons that regulate sexual arousal and mating in male mice, revealing a broader role for spinal circuits in copulation than previously acknowledged."

 Over the past four decades, seasonal snow cover has declined rapidly in temperate alpine regions. However, the fine-scale dynamics of snowmelt preceding the ongoing warming period remain largely unknown, limiting our understanding of the long-term influence of past snow cover on alpine ecosystems. Here we rely upon the spatial similarities in melt-out patterns and a temperature-based model of fractional snow cover area, to reconstruct fine-scale snow cover changes over the past 250 years in instrumented catchments of the southwestern Alps. We provide evidence that, until the 1980s, prolonged snow cover in many late-lying snowfields delayed ecosystem development and explain why current vegetation cover, soil organic matter content, and mineral weathering are significantly lower in these areas than in surrounding ecosystems. These findings highlight the long-term legacy of snow cover on alpine landscapes and underscore the need to re-evaluate its effects on ecosystem structure, functioning, and responsiveness to ongoing changes.

A selection of 21 cases shows that waves propagate on average for at least 19 h and may endure up to more than 48 h. These ISW trains may travel from one edge of the PCT, across its meridional width, to the other edge.

 Tropical peatlands storing ∼18–25 % of global peat volume contribute significantly to the global carbon cycle. To balance preservation and protection of tropical peatlands requires assessment of their ecohydrological conditions and continuous monitoring through seasons. This is challenging to achieve using in situ sampling, but there is a great promise to use C-band Sentinel-1 data for this due to its weather-independence, and particularly its increased acquisition capacity and spatial/temporal resolution compared to L- and P-band current sensors. Acknowledging that Small BAseline Subset (SBAS) Interferometry using C-Band Sentinel-1 data has been shown previously to be useful for retrieving peatland surface displacement, but also that the amplitude and phase of the SAR signal are dependent on surface hydrology; there remains a critical question about the extent to which the efficacy of SBAS approaches is themselves sensitive to surface hydrological conditions. This is a particular methodological concern in tropical peatlands due to the dynamically changing hydrological conditions arising from significant rainfall events, which can cause groundwater level (GWL) to vary from 1 m to −2 m. The research area was situated in lowland Central Kalimantan (Indonesia) using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations from the 2017–2022 period. We used SBAS-derived ground displacements and compared to groundwater level (GWL) and peat surface elevation acquired from local networks of monitoring sites. Our work shows that the prevailing hydrological condition affects the area efficacy of the SBAS approach using C-band SAR data. When surface water significantly floods above the ground surface during the wet season, the coherence is not sustained for a long time. This is the opposite of the dry season, when coherence is preserved in longer intervals between acquisitions. Additionally, the range of correlation values between SBAS-derived displacements and in-situ peat surface and ground water table measurements is higher for the dry season than for the wet and whole hydrological year. We show that the SBAS approach can retrieve surface displacement for 34.4 % to 59.8 % on the peat soils of the tested area (391 to 826 km2), excluding areas of dense forests and open water, due to C-band SAR limitations, i.e. volume scattering mechanism and/or loss of signal coherence on water bodies. We show that appropriate hydrological conditions must be met to determine the change in water level above the ground surface. Too large fluctuations in water level may not be detected because of wavelength limitations, and outliers from the assumed linear model may be filtered out or removed due to the specific properties of this approach. These findings underpin the application of Sentinel-1C-band SAR for monitoring tropical peatlands' ecohydrological conditions."

 Long-term time series of global leaf area index (LAI) and fraction of absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (FAPAR) are required for characterizing vegetation dynamics in global change studies. The recently developed Copernicus Land Monitoring Service GEOV2-CLMS products were demonstrated to outperform other existing LAI and FAPAR products in terms of completeness, temporal smoothness, consistency across variables and accuracy. However, these GEOV2-CLMS products are derived from the SPOT/VGT and PROBA-V constellation with temporal coverage from 1999 to 2020 which limits its applicability for global change studies. We present here an adaptation of the GEOV2-CLMS algorithm to AVHRR to extend these time series and generate long-term global vegetation products from July 1981 to December 2022. The GEOV2-AVHRR algorithm was specifically designed to maximize the temporal consistency over the successive AVHRR sensors on board NOAA and MetOp-B satellites while keeping high agreement with GEOV2-CLMS products. Neural networks first transform AVHRR surface reflectance into LAI and FAPAR values at the daily time step. The daily estimates are then filtered, smoothed, gap filled and composited every 10-day.GEOV2-AVHRR showed accuracy error between −0.2 and 0.3 LAI and ∼ −0.03 FAPAR and uncertainty <1 LAI and ∼ 0.10–0.15 for woody and non-woody sites of both DIRECT2.1 and GBOV V3 datasets. GEOV2-AVHRR agreed well with GEOV2-CLMS (MODIS): 92 % (76 %) of land pixels are within ±max(20 %, 0.5) LAI and 71 % (34 %) within ±max(10 %, 0.05) FAPAR uncertainty requirements. The gap filling and temporal filters applied in GEOV2-AVHRR proved effective in improving the completeness (only 1 % of missing data) and temporal precision (smoothness) of LAI and FAPAR time series as compared to MODIS. The intra-annual consistency of GEOV2-AVHRR highly agree with GEOV2-CLMS, indicating it is mostly driven by the algorithm. On the contrary, the inter-annual consistency of LAI and FAPAR datasets appears to be very sensitive to the consistency of the input surface reflectance. GEOV2-AVHRR showed high stability as evaluated with MODIS LAI/FAPAR and improves the stability of GEOV2-CLMS. Some residual inter-annual inconsistencies from the transition to sensors are observed for GEOV2-AVHRR as well as for other long term AVHRR datasets (i.e. GIMMS, GLASS and C3S). GEOV2-AVHRR shows overall greening trends in ∼70 % (∼50 % significant at p < 0.05) of land pixels, and the magnitude and spatial pattern of trends highly agree with those of GIMMS."

 With the rapid advancement of the Internet of Things (IoT), sensor technologies, and remote sensing, spatiotemporal data has emerged as a crucial data source across diverse industries, extensively utilized in environmental monitoring, intelligent transportation, socio-economic analysis, and other domains. Spatiotemporal data encompasses the locations, states, and interrelationships of objects within specific temporal and spatial contexts. It is characterized by dynamic properties, high dimensionality, and large data volumes, which pose significant challenges for storage, querying, and analysis. To address the challenges associated with managing large-scale spatiotemporal data, geospatial grid subdivision, grid encoding, grid indexing, and grid storage technologies offer essential support and have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness. In the past, existing reviews have typically focused on a single aspect, such as the fundamental methods of grid subdivision, the implementation details of encoding and indexing techniques, or solely on spatiotemporal databases. Although these reviews provide in-depth discussions of specific technologies, they lack a systematic analysis of the interrelationships among multiple technical modules, resulting in an inability to fully reveal the collaborative potential between modules. Additionally, current research provides limited comprehensive discussions on grid indexing technologies. This paper aims to address this gap by providing a systematic review of the development status of grid indexing technologies. Furthermore, it reviews and summarizes the key technologies, interrelationships, research advancements, and future directions of grid subdivision, grid encoding, grid indexing, and grid storage, thereby providing references for enhancing the storage and querying efficiency of spatiotemporal data."

 Opuntia stricta is a globally widespread invasive species that degrades dryland ecosystems and threatens pastoral livelihoods. Accurate, high-resolution distribution maps are essential for effective management, but its spectral similarity to native vegetation complicates remote sensing-based classification. We developed an interpretable Random Forest model, incorporating SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to map Opuntia stricta and co-occurring land cover types at 10  m resolution across heterogeneous arid and semi-arid lands in Laikipia County, Kenya. The model integrated monthly Sentinel-2 imagery, climate, topographic, landscape structural, and anthropogenic factors. Field surveys were combined with manual labeling using Google Maps and Street View to address annotation gaps in remote areas. Grid-based spatial blocking at multiple scales was used to reduce spatial autocorrelation and assess generalizability. The multi-temporal model achieved 0.91 overall accuracy and an F1-score of 0.92 for Opuntia stricta on the spatial validation set (100 m grid), and 0.86 accuracy with an F1-score of 0.85 on the independent test set, substantially outperforming single-month models (accuracy: 0.62–0.79; F1: 0.67–0.82), with February identified as the most informative single-time window. SHAP analysis identified July precipitation, population density and nighttime land surface temperatures as top predictors, linking invasion patterns to dry-season aridity, wet-season rainfall, and warm night conditions, underscoring the role of climate seasonality and human activity in shaping detectability and distribution. Invasion hotspots were concentrated near Dol-Dol and in degraded group ranches, with lower levels on private ranches and conservancies.

 Semantic segmentation of satellite imagery plays a vital role in applications such as sustainable development, agriculture, forestry, urban planning, and climate change monitoring. Despite its importance, optimizing deep learning models for this task remains challenging. This study evaluates several advanced deep learning architectures UNet, LinkNet, DeepLabV3+, and a modified version, AE-DeepLabV3+ in combination with different backbone networks, including ResNet101, ResNet152, Xception, MobileNetV2 and, EfficientNetV2. The objective is to identify the most effective model for classifying satellite images into eight land cover categories: built-up areas, roads, water bodies, agricultural land, shrubland, forest, grassland, and others. A high-resolution dataset with corresponding segmentation masks was developed to support this analysis and serve as a resource for future research. Preprocessing steps included normalization and data augmentation techniques such as vertical and horizontal flipping and random brightness adjustments. Experimental results indicate that UNet with the Xception backbone, LinkNet with ResNet152, DeepLabV3+ with the Xception backbone, and AE-DeepLabV3+ with the Xception backbone achieved Dice coefficients of 85.7%, 86.7%, 90.4%, and 91.3%, respectively.

 The rapid urbanization of urban riverbank soft ground poses significant geotechnical challenges, particularly in densely populated coastal areas like the Yangtze River Delta. This study employs an enhanced multi-temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) approach to reveal decadal deformation patterns (2015–2024) in soft ground along the Yangtze River in Nanjing, China. Leveraging 275 Sentinel-1 SAR images and improved data processing strategies, we reconstruct the subsidence dynamics and validate them against leveling measurements with an accuracy of 6.5 mm/a. Results reveal that while the overall Nanjing’s urban riverbank remains stable, localized deformations are concentrated in urban riverbank development zones: Jiangbei New Area (JBA) and Hexi New Town (HXT). The highest intensity of development in JBA shows a cumulative settlement of more than 600 mm over ten years. The soft ground deformation is driven by engineering activities, specifically (i) groundwater drawdown during foundation pit dewatering and (ii) consolidation under surcharge loads from riverbank urban infrastructure. The earlier-developed HXT provides a valuable reference for predicting surface deformation trends in JBA. Furthermore, decadal InSAR deformation analyses of critical urban riverbank infrastructure (river-crossing bridges) confirm the effectiveness of bedrock anchoring in mitigating soft ground settlement. Wavelet analyses reveal that temperature fluctuations primarily drive cyclic displacement in the metal truss main spans of the Beijing-Shanghai High-Speed Railway Nanjing Yangtze River Bridge. This work demonstrates the decisive influence of anthropogenic activities in accelerating subsidence and reveals the efficacy of InSAR in supporting adaptive risk mitigation strategies. The findings provide actionable insights for sustainable urban riverbank development in soft ground regions, emphasizing the need for integrated monitoring and ground improvement measures to enhance infrastructure resilience in global deltaic cities undergoing riverbank urbanization."

 Earth science data exhibit inherent complexity characterized by heterogeneous spatiotemporal attributes, high collinearity among variables, and diverse input formats. Despite rapid advancements in deep learning, geographic modeling lacks unified frameworks for integrating heterogeneous spatiotemporal data and diverse factor types. While Mamba architecture has demonstrated efficiency in large language models, computer vision and remote sensing, its applicability to geographic modeling remains unexplored. This study introduces Geo-Mamba, a novel framework addressing these challenges through three key innovations. First, we propose a systematic geographical factor classification method that categorizes elements into dynamic, static, and categorical factors, enabling standardized integration of heterogeneous data within a unified paradigm. Second, we design a selective encoder module based on Mamba architecture that leverages its linear complexity and scanning mechanism to establish selective state spaces for geographical inputs, revealing intricate associations between diverse feature types. Third, we incorporate Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers as intermediate components replacing multilayer perceptron linear layers, enhancing numerical regression accuracy in geographical applications. Experimental validation across three tasks demonstrates Geo-Mamba’s effectiveness: in net ecosystem exchange modeling (R2 = 0.92, RMSE = 0.37 μmol·m–2·s–1), groundwater storage anomaly downscaling (R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 1.916 cm), and land cover classification (accuracy = 88.12 %, F1-Score = 84.27 %).

 Emissions of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from on-road vehicle fleets were investigated through tunnel tests conducted in 2014 and 2019 in Guangzhou, China, to assess the impacts of upgraded vehicle emission standards and changing fleet composition. The emission factors of PM2.5-bound PAHs (four-ring and above) significantly decreased by 76.4 %, from 45.22 to 10.66 μg km−1 veh−1 during this period. Although the diesel fleet share fell by ∼75 % from 13.0 % to 3.3 %, diesel vehicles remained the dominant source of PAHs, exhibiting emission factors 9–50 times higher than gasoline vehicles. Notably, emissions of some 5- and 6-ring PAHs declined much less and even increased, suggesting that non-exhaust emissions, particularly tire wear, have become increasingly significant sources of PAHs. The overall toxicity, expressed in terms of toxic equivalency quotients (TEQBaP), declined by 66.7 %, yet benzo[a]pyrene consistently dominated total toxicity (69–74 %). Persistent nocturnal emission risks associated with diesel-dominated freight traffic highlight the need for targeted emission control policies. These results reveal the effectiveness of stringent regulatory measures in reducing vehicle exhaust emissions and stress the emerging importance of mitigating non-exhaust emission sources in urban pollution control strategies."

 On 21 July 2021, extreme rainfall hit central and northern Henan, China, with Xinxiang recording an hourly rainfall of 149.9 mm and 10-h accumulations exceeding 400 mm (the 7.21 Xinxiang rainstorm). This rainstorm, a critical episode in the “21·7” Henan rainstorm event occurring one day after the high-impact 7.20 Zhengzhou rainstorm, was triggered by the development and merger of two meso-β-scale convective systems (NMCS and SMCS). Using convection-permitting ensemble simulations and targeted data assimilation, this study first examines the roles of key mid-to-lower tropospheric synoptic systems (which influenced the 7.20 Zhengzhou rainstorm) in the subsequent 7.21 Xinxiang rainstorm, then identifies and verifies critical mesoscale factors governing the two MCSs' development and merger. Results indicate that a mid-level low-pressure system (corresponding to a lower-level trough) and a high-pressure ridge extending from the southwestern periphery of the western Pacific subtropical high were critically important synoptic-scale systems influencing both consecutive rainstorm events. For the 7.21 Xinxiang rainstorm, the low primarily governed the total precipitation amount, while the ridge mainly influenced the rainfall spatial pattern in central Henan by modulating the SMCS organization. Furthermore, two mesoscale shear lines are found to drive convection evolution. One, formed by the near-surface southeasterly flow ahead of the trough turning into a northeasterly barrier flow parallel to the terrain, influenced the southern tip of the NMCS. The other, from converging ridge-edge southwesterlies and southeasterlies, drove SMCS development. Radar radial velocity assimilation confirms that refining these pivotal shear lines can enhance convective and quantitative precipitation forecasts."

We find that the fog droplet number concentrations, the amount of liquid water in the fog, and the vertical structure of the fog are highly sensitive to the parameterization that simulates droplet formation and growth. The changes we propose could improve fog forecasts significantly without increasing computational costs. 
 Aerosols influence fog properties such as visibility and lifetime by affecting fog droplet number concentrations (Nd).  Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models often represent aerosol–fog interactions using highly simplified approaches. Incorporating prognostic size-resolved aerosol microphysics from climate models could allow them to simulate Nd and aerosol–fog interactions without incurring excessive computational expense. However, microphysics code designed for coarse spatial resolution may struggle with sub-kilometer-scale grid spacings. Here, we test the ability of the UK Met Office Unified Model to simulate aerosol and fog properties during case studies from the ParisFog field campaign in 2011. We examine the sensitivity of fog properties to variations in Nd caused by modifications to simulated aerosol activation.Our model, with a 500 m horizontal resolution and interactive aerosol and cloud microphysics, significantly underpredicts Nd, although it only slightly underestimates the cloud condensation nuclei concentration. With an updated version of the Abdul-Razzak and Ghan (2000) activation scheme, we produce Nd that are more consistent with those predicted by a cloud parcel model under fog-like conditions. We activate droplets only by adiabatic cooling. We incorporate more realistic hygroscopicities for sulfate and organic aerosols and explore the sensitivity of simulated Nd to unresolved updrafts. We find that both Nd and simulated fog liquid water content are very sensitive to the updated activation scheme but remain less affected by the update to hygroscopicities. Our improvements offer insights into the physical processes regulating Nd in stable conditions, potentially laying foundations for improved operational fog forecasts that incorporate interactive aerosol simulations or aerosol climatologies."

By incorporating droplet formation and growth driven by radiative cooling, our model better simulates the total liquid water in foggy atmospheric columns. We show that both adiabatic and radiative cooling play significant, often equally important, roles in driving droplet formation and growth. We discuss strategies to address droplet number overpredictions by improving model physics and addressing model artifacts. 
 Aerosol–fog interactions affect the visibility in, and life cycle of, fog and are difficult to represent in weather and climate models. Here we explore processes that impact the simulation of fog droplet number concentrations (Nd) at sub-kilometer scale horizontal grid resolutions in the UK Met Office Unified Model. We modify the parameterization of aerosol activation to include droplet activation by radiative cooling in addition to adiabatic cooling and determine the relative importance of the two cooling mechanisms. We further test the sensitivity of simulated Nd to: (a) interception of droplets by trees and buildings, (b) overestimation of updrafts in temperature inversions (which leads to artificially high Nd values), and (c) potential mechanisms for droplet deactivation due to downward fluctuations in supersaturation.We evaluate our model against observations from the ParisFog and LANFEX field campaigns, building on evaluation described in the companion paper. Including radiative cooling in the activation mechanism improves how accurately we represent the liquid water path and the vertical structure of the fog in our LANFEX case study. However, with radiative cooling, the Nd are overestimated for most of the ParisFog cases and for the LANFEX case. The time-averaged overestimate exceeds a factor of three (the normalized mean bias factor exceeds 2.0) in 4 out of 11 ParisFog cases. Our sensitivity studies demonstrate how these overestimates can be mitigated. Assuming the overestimate affects both radiative and adiabatic cooling, we find that although radiative cooling is more often the dominant source, both cooling sources can sometimes dominate activation."

The conversion process of cloud droplets to raindrops is dominant near the ground, whilst the collisional coalescence of cloud droplets and raindrops dominates above the layer within convective clouds. These processes depend strongly on static stability and are more likely to be associated with humid environments. 
 The drop size distribution (DSD) is an important property for characterising precipitation processes that sometimes lead to more intense rainfall in different climate regions. Previous studies have shown that a stationary distribution with a breakup signature can be obtained not only with ground-based disdrometers but also with remote sensing instruments such as vertically pointing radars and/or wind profilers. However, these observations do not explain how the underlying microphysical processes within convective clouds that generate more rain occur and how the environmental conditions affect these processes. This study aims to investigate the environmental conditions for the development of convective clouds having a breakup signature on a ground-based observation near Kumagaya in eastern Japan. In situ observations and operational C-band polarimetric weather radar data are used to extract the convective clouds by applying a cell-tracking algorithm, and upper-air sounding data are used to diagnose their environmental conditions. The larger diameter of the DSD is likely to be associated with higher instability, whilst the larger liquid water content is likely to be associated with the higher moisture contents in the lower layer under the weaker vertical shear condition. Convective clouds that generate more rain should have a similar three-dimensional structure within them when the DSD has a breakup signature at ground level under a humid environment. These characteristics can be diagnosed as the microphysical processes of converting from cloud drops to raindrops and/or coalescing cloud drops and raindrops."

The stable isotope ratio of Fe has emerged as a potential tracer for discriminating and quantifying sources of aerosol Fe. In this review, we examine the state of the field for using Fe isotopes as an aerosol source tracer, and constraints on endmember signatures. 
 Deposition of atmospheric aerosols is recognized as a major source of iron (Fe) to the surface oceans, where it acts as a key micronutrient for primary productivity and the metabolic functions of marine microbes. Initially, natural desert dust was thought to be the main source of aerosol Fe, albeit largely insoluble; however, in the last few decades, the role of anthropogenic and wildfire sources in providing soluble Fe to aerosols has been increasingly recognized. The stable isotope ratio of Fe (δ56Fe) has emerged as a potential tracer for discriminating and quantifying sources of aerosol Fe. In this review, we examine the state of the field for using δ56Fe as an aerosol source tracer, and constraints on endmember signatures. We begin with an overview of the methodology of δ56Fe analysis for aerosol samples. We then describe knowledge of δ56Fe endmember signatures of different source materials, and review existing knowledge of the δ56Fe signature of ambient aerosols collected from around the globe, and how these measurements can be used to enhance atmospheric Fe deposition modelling. We also examine the various chemical processing mechanisms which might influence δ56Fe source signatures of aerosol Fe during its transport in the atmosphere. This review paper is concluded with a perspective on the state of the field and a call for future work. Overall, we find aerosol δ56Fe to be a promising tracer, but highlight that greater constraints on both source endmembers and processing mechanisms are needed to fully utilize this tracer."

 Two retrieval methods for the determination of Arctic surface skin temperature and surface type based on radiance measurements from the thermal infrared (TIR) imager VELOX (Video airbornE Longwave Observations within siX channels) were developed. VELOX captured TIR radiances in terms of brightness temperatures for wavelengths from 7.7 to 12 µm in six spectral channels. The imager was deployed on the High Altitude and LOng Range research aircraft (HALO) during the HALO–(𝒜𝒞)3 aircraft field campaign conducted in the framework of the Arctic Amplification: Climate Relevant Atmospheric and SurfaCe Processes and Feedback Mechanisms (𝒜𝒞)3 research programme. The measurements were taken over the Fram Strait and the central Arctic in March and April 2022. Radiative transfer simulations assuming cloud-free atmospheric conditions were performed showing that the influence of water vapour on the measured brightness temperature can be neglected. Therefore it was possible to apply a single-channel retrieval technique to obtain the surface skin temperature from the VELOX data. The retrieval results were compared with data from the MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) showing an agreement within 2.0 K. Secondly, a pixel-by-pixel surface classification retrieval was developed using a random forest algorithm. It classifies surfaces into types of open water, sea-ice–water mixture, thin sea ice, and snow-covered sea ice. The resulting sea-ice concentrations were compared with satellite data, yielding a mean absolute difference (MAD) of 5 %. In addition, the classified pixels were aggregated into segments of the same surface type, providing different segment size distributions for all surface types. When grouped by the distance to the sea-ice edge, the segment size distribution showed a shift to fewer but larger floes in the direction of the pack ice."

It can be used to guide infrastructure upgrades, assess sustainable development goal, and analyze its impacts on traffic safety, energy consumption, ecological environment, and economic development. 
 Road surface types not only influence the accessibility of road networks and socio-economic development but also serve as a critical data source for evaluating United Nations Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 9.1. Existing research indicates that Africa generally have a low road paved rate, limiting local socio-economic development. Although the International Road Federation (IRF) provides statistical data on paved road length and road paved rates for certain African countries, this data neither covers all African country nor specifies the surface type of individual roads, making it challenging to offer decision-making support for improving Africa's road infrastructure. To fill this gap, this study developed the first dataset for 50 African countries and regions, incorporating the surface type of every road. This was achieved using multi-source geospatial data and a tabular deep learning model. The core methodology involved designing 16 proxy indicators across three dimensions—derived from five open geospatial datasets (OSM road data, GDP data, population distribution data, building height data, and land cover data)—to infer road surface types across Africa. Key findings include: The accuracy of the African road surface type dataset ranges from 77 % to 96 %, with F1 scores between 0.76 and 0.96. Total road length, paved road length, and road paved rates calculated from this dataset show high correlation (correlation coefficients: 0.69–0.94) with corresponding IRF statistics. Notably, the road paved rate also exhibits strong correlation with GNI per capita and HDI (correlation coefficients: 0.80–0.83), validating the reliability of the dataset. Spatial analysis of African road paved rates at national, provincial, and county scales revealed an average paved rate of only 17.4 % across the 50 countries and regions. A distinct ""higher in the north and south, lower in the central region"" pattern emerged, the average paved rate north of the Sahara is approximately three times that of Sub-Saharan (excluding South Africa). The African road surface type dataset developed in this study not only provides data support for enhancing road infrastructure and evaluating SDG 9.1 progress in Africa but may also facilitate research on how road surface types impact road safety, energy consumption, ecological environments, and socio-economic development."

However, these models are computationally very demanding. Here, we present a recently developed atmosphere–ocean model which is able to resolve most of these processes and is less expensive to run due to its computational design. Our model can be used for a wide range of applications like the investigation of marine heatwaves or future projections. 
 Recent years have seen significant efforts to refine the horizontal resolutions of global and regional climate models to the kilometer scale. This refinement aims to better resolve atmospheric and oceanic mesoscale processes, thereby improving the fidelity of simulations. However, these high-resolution simulations are computationally demanding, often necessitating trade-offs between resolution and simulated timescale. A key challenge is that many existing models are designed to run on central processing units (CPUs) alone, limiting their ability to leverage the full computational power of modern supercomputers, which feature hybrid architectures with both CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs).In this study, we introduce the newest model version of ROMSOC, a recently developed regional coupled atmosphere–ocean model. This new model version integrates the Regional Oceanic Modeling System (ROMS) in its original CPU-based configuration with the Consortium for Small-Scale Modeling (COSMO) model (v5.12), which can utilize GPU accelerators on heterogeneous system architectures. The combination efficiently exploits the hybrid CPU–GPU architecture of the Piz Daint supercomputer at the Swiss National Supercomputing Centre (CSCS), achieving a speed-up of up to 6 times compared to a CPU-only version with the same number of nodes.We evaluated the model using a configuration focused on the northeast Pacific, where ROMS covers the entire Pacific Ocean with a telescopic grid, providing full-ocean mesoscale-resolving refinement in the California Current System (CalCS; 4 km resolution). Meanwhile, COSMO covers most of the northeast Pacific at a 7 km resolution. This configuration was run in hindcast mode for the years 2010–2021, examining the roles of different modes of air–sea coupling at the mesoscale, including thermodynamical coupling (associated with heat fluxes) and mechanical coupling (associated with wind stress and surface ocean currents).Our evaluation indicates that the hindcast generally agrees well with observations and reanalyses. Notably, large-scale sea surface temperature (SST) patterns and coastal upwelling are well-represented, but SSTs show a small cold bias, resulting from wind forcing that is too strong and biases in the radiative forcing. Additionally, the coupled model exhibits a deeper and more realistic simulation of the ocean mixed-layer depth with a more pronounced seasonal cycle, driven by the enhanced wind-driven mixing. On the other hand, our ROMSOC simulations reveal a negative cloud cover bias and related biases in surface radiative fluxes off the coast of southern California, a common issue in climate models."

Since then, sea ice age has been largely overlooked, despite its value in evaluating climate model skill in capturing sea ice dynamics. Comparing modeled sea‐ice age with observations is limited by differing methods for determining age, making fair comparison difficult. Here, we apply an ice‐tracking algorithm to diagnose sea ice age from daily concentration and drift data in a climate model and compare it to satellite‐derived estimates using the same method. We show that the derived sea ice age retains the spatial pattern and long‐term trends of the reported model age, but with less than half the bias. Changes in sea‐ice age highlight shifts in sea‐ice dynamics more clearly than thickness or volume. This shows that using a common algorithm enables both a fair model validation and improves insight into sea‐ice dynamics."

While the radar sampled different parts of the hurricane circulation of the two cases, the observed maximum near‐surface wind and frictional velocity were similar. Radar‐retrieved wind profiles in both hurricanes revealed a boundary‐layer jet generally >1 km AGL, descending toward smaller radii as the hurricanes moved inland. A “knee‐like” structure in most wind profiles below the jet suggests an internal boundary layer (IBL) below 200 m and a log layer above it. Among the three methods for estimating near‐surface sustained winds from radar‐retrieved winds, leveraging low‐level IBL winds improves estimation accuracy and reduces the uncertainty to the selection of upstream surface roughness length. These findings offer valuable guidance for developing future probabilistic near‐surface wind products."

We measured a subsidence of up to 7 cm in few months during a drought in 2020, which was compensated by uplift in the following rainy season in some but not all regions. The magnitude of the drought‐induced subsidence was spatially correlated with specific surface water management and land use zones, with the largest impact in rain‐fed, rice growing regions. We argue that the uncompensated surface drop in two regions, reaching up to 3.5 cm, was caused by inelastic deformation. Such irreversible subsidence has a major impact on the delta's future elevation, especially under the assumption that the frequency of droughts will increase under climate change and an increasing water demand."

We find that both models successfully reproduce the observed pattern of changes in Europe and the Mediterranean, Asia, and Central America. However, they perform less well for Western North America, South America, and Oceania, and the simulated changes are also generally too small in their magnitude.

Here, we investigate changes in environmental factors important to storm formation in the past warm‐cold transition during 130–115 ka, in which climatic characteristics were comparable to future projections, though with an opposite sign. Based on a non‐accelerated transient global climate simulation at ∼1° resolution, we illustrate that the annual cycle of environmental conditions supporting TC genesis over the NIO bifurcates into two discrete periods during the warm‐cold transition, manifested by a shift from a unimodal to bimodal seasonal distribution. The shift is largely linked to the increased favorability for TC genesis in pre‐monsoon season (April–May–June) toward the last glacial inception (∼115 ka), which is in turn tied to the orbitally‐induced weakening of Indian monsoon‐like circulations."

In this study, we use ensembles of atmosphere‐model integrations for the period 1993–2013 to investigate the mechanisms of the wintertime cooling over Eurasia. We find that the cooling was primarily driven by intrinsic atmospheric variability, specifically the North Atlantic Oscillation, and to a lesser extent by multidecadal ocean variability such as the Interdecadal Pacific Variability. There was not much influence of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability on Eurasian cooling.

To evaluate this theory, we investigate the seasonality of TD‐type waves and their relation to the Hadley Cell in ERA5 and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models. On the basis of the theory, a Hadley Cell instability metric is defined whose variability is largely determined by the background meridional moisture gradient and the sensitivity of rainfall to moisture fluctuations. Results show that both TD‐type wave column moisture variance and eddy moisture fluxes peak when the Hadley Cell instability metric is a maximum.

OHUE, defined as the ratio of ocean heat uptake rate to changes in global mean surface temperature anomalies, has exhibited significant variability over recent decades. We found a relatively low OHUE in the late 1980s, a peak around 2000, and a subsequent decline. A key finding is the significant influence of volcanic eruptions, particularly the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, which caused abrupt cooling followed by a gradual recovery, leading recent variation of OHUE. Moreover, the Southern Ocean is becoming less efficient at absorbing heat into interior ocean in recent period associated with increased stratification. These results highlight the role of natural external forcing in climate dynamics and the importance of mid‐latitudes in global OHUE variability, underscoring the need for idealized experiments to quantify the potential effects of future volcanic eruptions on OHUE."

Here, we present a comprehensive analysis of MHW diversity based on temporal evolutions, classifying global events into six types with distinct patterns in evolution, spatial distribution, and temporal variability. Notably, bimodal MHWs, which are strongly linked to El Niño events, show the largest area growth rate when compared to other types, such as the canonical type, which features a single peak and balanced growth and decay phases. Furthermore, subsurface analysis reveals a strong correlation between subsurface structure and surface evolution. Finally, using a classification approach, we quantify MHW type predictability.

Understanding multi‐scale uncertainties in fracture network conductivity is crucial for mitigating risks and reliably modeling upscaled fault leakage rates. Conventional models, such as the Cubic Law, which is based on mechanical aperture measurements, often neglect fracture roughness, leading to model misspecifications and inaccurate conductivity estimates. Here, we develop a physics‐informed, AI‐driven correction of these model misspecifications by automatically integrating roughness effects and small‐scale structural uncertainties. Using Bayesian inference combined with data‐driven and geometric corrections, we reconstruct local hydraulic aperture fields that reliably estimate fracture conductivities. By leveraging interactions across scales, we improve upon traditional empirical corrections and provide a framework for propagating uncertainties from individual fractures to network scales. Our approach thereby supports robust calibration of conductivity ranges for fault leakage sensitivity analyses, offering a scalable solution for subsurface risk assessment."

These models provide estimates of historical post‐eruption climates where observations and paleorecords are lacking. However, as we show, simulations of the last millennium's largest eruptions broadly disagree on resulting climates and typically produce more extreme outcomes than the moderate cooling and ordinary precipitation conditions recorded in tree rings. We demonstrate that strong cooling greatly strengthens the post‐eruption precipitation anomalies in simulations. Conversely, simulations with paleoproxy‐consistent volcanic surface cooling show post‐eruption precipitation to be unexceptional at most locations. Climate models hence do not substantiate the claims that intense eruption‐induced wet and dry anomalies have caused widespread historical catastrophes.

 The rise of green industrial policy is transforming efforts to decarbonize the global economy and mitigate climate change. The first three decades of climate policy centred on international cooperation on dividing up the costs of mitigation. In the new era of green industrial policy, geoeconomic competition for the benefits of decarbonization has emerged alongside international cooperation on emissions reductions. Governments invest in the manufacturing and deployment of clean technologies to advance economic development, energy security and emissions cuts. Geoeconomic competition has the potential to accelerate global decarbonization by facilitating greater technology deployment, speeding up technology cost declines and, thus, lowering the barriers to climate action. However, it also creates major pitfalls by facilitating the rise of trade protectionism, creating international conflict, and reproducing economic divides between richer and poorer, yet growing, countries. It is thus uncertain how the geoeconomic turn will impact global decarbonization. Meanwhile, policymakers are asking fundamental questions about how to design industrial policy, manage politics, develop institutions, and deal with the trade-offs between economic, climate and security goals. This Perspective demonstrates the recent geoeconomic turn in decarbonization, lays out its implications for policymaking, identifies global spillovers and addresses research needs.

 Among the many types of qubit presently being investigated for a future quantum computer, silicon spin qubits with millions of qubits on a single chip are uniquely positioned to enable quantum computing. However, it has not been clear whether the outstanding high-fidelity operations and long coherence times shown by silicon spin qubits fabricated in academic settings1–8 can be reliably reproduced when the qubits are manufactured in a semiconductor foundry9–11.

 Elucidating the complex network of communication between tumour cells is central to understanding cell fate decisions and progression of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)1,2. We previously showed that constant suppression of BMP activity by the BMP antagonist GREM1 secreted by mesenchymal PDAC cells is essential for maintaining the fate of epithelial PDAC cells3. Here we identify SPP1 (also known as osteopontin)4 as a key regulator of mesenchymal cell fate in pancreatic cancer. Proteomic analysis of plasma from patients with PDAC showed that SPP1 is substantially upregulated in late-stage disease. Inactivation of Spp1 led to a delay in tumorigenesis in mouse PDAC models and abolished metastasis formation. Spp1 was expressed in epithelial PDAC cells, and Spp1 inactivation resulted in a conversion of mesenchymal to epithelial PDAC cells. Mechanistically, SPP1 bound the CD61 receptor on mesenchymal PDAC cells to induce Bmp2 and Grem1 expression, and GREM1 inhibition of BMP signalling was required for Spp1 expression in epithelial cells, thereby forming an intercellular regulatory loop. Concomitant inactivation of Grem1 reverted the epithelial phenotype of Spp1 knockout to fully mesenchymal PDAC. Conversely, Grem1 heterozygosity combined with Spp1 knockout resulted in wild-type PDAC histology, a result that confirmed the direct antagonistic functions of these factors. Hence, mesenchymal and epithelial PDAC cell fates are determined by the reciprocal paracrine regulation of the soluble factors GREM1 and SPP1. Mutual paracrine regulation of the cytokines GREM1 and SPP1 mediate mesenchymal and epithelial cell fate in pancreatic cancer."

 The evolution of a single-dentary-boned lower jaw and its secondary craniomandibular articulation between the dentary condyle and the squamosal glenoid has been regarded as a pivotal vertebrate innovation and defining mammalian trait1–7. Here we report two mammaliamorphs with novel shapes of secondary jaw joint, offering insight into the evolution of the mammalian jaw. The first, Polistodon8, a Middle Jurassic herbivorous tritylodontid with a relatively large body size and a lifestyle that is likely to have been fossorial, uniquely evolved a dentary–jugal articulation. The second, an Early Jurassic morganucodontan, exhibits a dentary–squamosal joint that lacks a bulbous condyle, supporting the hypothesis that the mammalian dentary condyle was formed by expansion of the lateral ridge of the dentary9. These diverse joints reflect repeated evolutionary experimentation in advanced cynodonts, in which secondary jaw joints arose independently7,10, and in which the load-bearing dentary–squamosal joint is a synapomorphy of mammaliaforms. Although body miniaturization might have driven this transformation11, our findings indicate that other factors were involved, such as jaw-muscle reorganization, feeding ecology and masticatory behaviour7,12–17. The ecomorphological diversity of these taxa suggest that phenotypic plasticity and environmentally induced morphological changes18–20 could have shaped jaw-joint evolution, emphasizing how ecological pressures and developmental flexibility guided the diversification of jaw structures in mammalian ancestors.

 Metabolic dysregulation can lead to inflammatory responses1,2. Imbalanced nucleotide synthesis triggers the release of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) to the cytosol and an innate immune response through cGAS–STING signalling3. However, how nucleotide deficiency drives mtDNA-dependent inflammation has not been elucidated. Here we show that nucleotide imbalance leads to an increased misincorporation of ribonucleotides into mtDNA during age-dependent renal inflammation in a mouse model lacking the mitochondrial exonuclease MGME14, in various tissues of aged mice and in cells lacking the mitochondrial i-AAA protease YME1L. Similarly, reduced deoxyribonucleotide synthesis increases the ribonucleotide content of mtDNA in cell-cycle-arrested senescent cells. This leads to mtDNA release into the cytosol, cGAS–STING activation and the mtDNA-dependent senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which can be suppressed by exogenously added deoxyribonucleosides. Our results highlight the sensitivity of mtDNA to aberrant ribonucleotide incorporation and show that imbalanced nucleotide metabolism leads to age- and mtDNA-dependent inflammatory responses and SASP in senescence.

 Polymer electrolytes paired with lithium-rich manganese-based layered oxide (LRMO) cathodes and anode-free cell design are considered one of the most promising high-energy-density and high-safety systems1–4. However, the unstable anode morphological changes and the irreversible anionic reactions at the electrolyte–cathode interfaces induce oxygen escape and catalytic decomposition of polymer electrolytes, resulting in severe interfacial degradation and poor cycling stability. Here we design an in-built fluoropolyether-based polymer electrolyte composed of strongly solvating polyether and weakly solvating fluorohydrocarbon pendants, creating an anion-rich solvation structure and thus anion-derived fluorine-rich interfacial layers on the cathode and anode to resist interfacial issues. The LRMO cathode exhibits improved oxygen redox reversibility with substantially reduced oxygen-involving interfacial side reactions. This quasi-solid-state polymer electrolyte with 30 wt% trimethyl phosphate enables an LRMO cathode with a reversible high-areal-capacity cycling (>8 mAh cm−2) in pouch cells and long-term stability (>500 cycles at 25 °C) in coin cells, respectively. The pouch cells exhibit an energy density of 604 Wh kg−1 (1,027 Wh l−1) and excellent safety under a nail penetration at a fully charged condition. Our work, therefore, provides a promising direction for creating practical high-energy-density and high-safety lithium batteries.

 Worldwide, freshwater systems contain more than 18,000 fish species1–3, which are critical to the functioning of these ecosystems4 and are vital cultural and economic resources to humans5–7; despite this value, fish biodiversity is at risk globally8,9. In the USA, leading threats to fish communities in rivers and streams include climate change and invasive fish introductions and game fish stocking by humans10–14. Here we harmonized US federal biomonitoring datasets with 389 species spanning 27 years (1993–2019) and 2,992 sites to analyse trends in fish biodiversity. In cold streams (past summer stream temperatures below 15.4 °C), fish abundance and richness declined by 53.4% and 32% over 27 years, respectively, and uniqueness increased. Periodic (large-bodied, late-maturing) fishes increased, and opportunists (small-bodied, short generation time, ‘r-selected’) decreased, possibly due to proliferation of native or introduced game fishes. In warm streams (stream temperatures greater than 23.8 °C), fish abundance and richness increased by 70.5% and 15.6% over 27 years, respectively, and communities homogenized. Small opportunistic fishes replaced large periodic fishes. Intermediate streams (stream temperatures 15.4–23.8 °C), representing the average stream, had minimal changes in fish biodiversity through time. Interactions between warming and introduced fish were associated with increased rates of degradation to local fish biodiversity. Given the magnitude of these changes in a relatively short time span, there is an urgent need to curb degradation of fish biodiversity caused by fish introductions and warming water temperatures. In the past three decades, fish abundance, richness and uniqueness have diverged across cold and warm streams, and the effects on native fish communities of stream warming and increases in introduced fishes have magnified each other."

 Volcanic crises, driven by renewed magma inflow and migration, result in surface deformation and seismicity that can provide unique insights into the structure of volcanic systems and magmatic processes. Although the highly explosive volcanoes of Santorini and Kolumbo1,2 in the Greek Aegean Sea are just 7 km apart, their potentially coupled deep magmatic feeding systems are only poorly understood3,4. The 2025 volcano–tectonic crisis of Santorini simultaneously affected both volcanic centres, providing insights into a complex, multistorage feeder system. Here we integrate onshore and marine seismological data with geodetic measurements to reconstruct magma migration before and during the crisis. Gradual inflation in the Santorini caldera, beginning in mid-2024, preceded the January 2025 intrusion of a magma-filled dike sourced from a mid-crustal reservoir beneath Kolumbo, indicating a link between the two volcanoes. Joint inversion of ground and satellite-based deformation data indicates that approximately 0.31 km3 of magma intruded as an approximately 13-km-long dike, reactivating principal regional faults and arresting 3–5 km below the seafloor. The 2024–2025 resurgence of magmatic activity beneath both volcanic centres and their apparent coupling provides insights into the dynamic interplay of magma storage, transport and reservoir failure beneath neighbouring volcanoes.

 Neural activity in awake organisms shows widespread, spatiotemporally diverse correlations with behavioural and physiological measurements1–4. We propose that this covariation reflects in part the structured, nonlinear dynamics of an underlying arousal-related process that organizes brain-wide and body-wide physiology on the timescale of seconds. By framing this interpretation within dynamical systems theory, we arrive at a surprising prediction: a single, scalar measurement of arousal (for example, pupil diameter) should suffice to reconstruct the continuous evolution of multidimensional, spatiotemporal measurements of large-scale brain physiology. Here, to test this hypothesis, we perform multimodal cortex-wide optical imaging5 and behavioural monitoring in awake mice. We demonstrate that the seconds-scale spatiotemporal dynamics of neuronal calcium, metabolism and brain blood oxygen can be accurately and parsimoniously modelled from a low-dimensional, nonlinear manifold reconstructed from a time delay embedding6,7 of pupil diameter. Extending this framework to behavioural and electrophysiological measurements from the Allen Brain Observatory8, we demonstrate the ability to integrate diverse experimental data into a unified generative model via mappings from a shared arousal manifold. Our results support the hypothesis9 that spontaneous, spatially structured fluctuations in brain-wide physiology on timescales of seconds—widely interpreted to reflect regionally specific neural communication10,11—are in large part expressions of a low-dimensional, organism-wide dynamical system. In turn, reframing arousal itself as a latent dynamical system offers a new perspective on fluctuations in brain, body and behaviour observed across modalities, contexts and scales. Reframing of arousal as a latent dynamical system can reconstruct multidimensional measurements of large-scale spatiotemporal brain dynamics on the timescale of seconds in mice."

 Protein design has focused on the design of ground states, ensuring that they are sufficiently low energy to be highly populated1. Designing the kinetics and dynamics of a system requires, in addition, the design of excited states that are traversed in transitions from one low-lying state to another2,3. This is a challenging task because such states must be sufficiently strained to be poorly populated, but not so strained that they are not populated at all, and because protein design methods have focused on generating near-ideal structures4–7. Here we describe a general approach for designing systems that use an induced-fit power stroke8 to generate a structurally frustrated9 and strained excited state, allosterically driving protein complex dissociation. X-ray crystallography, double electron–electron resonance spectroscopy and kinetic binding measurements show that incorporating excited states enables the design of effector-induced increases in dissociation rates as high as 5,700-fold. We highlight the power of this approach by designing rapid biosensors, kinetically controlled circuits and cytokine mimics that can be dissociated from their receptors within seconds, enabling dissection of the temporal dynamics of interleukin-2 signalling. A fresh approach to protein design that incorporates excited intermediate states enables precise control over the lifetime of protein interactions, with potential applications in cell-signalling modulation and in biosensors and synthetic circuits."

 The concentration of proteins containing intrinsically disordered regions must be tightly controlled to maintain cellular homeostasis1,2. However, mechanisms for collective control of these proteins, which tend to localize to membraneless condensates, are less understood than pathways mediated by membrane-bound organelles3,4. Here we report ‘interstasis’, a homeostatic mechanism in which increased concentration of proteins within RNA–protein condensates induces the sequestration of their own mRNAs. The selectivity of interstatic mRNA capture relies on the structure of the genetic code and conserved codon biases, which ensure that similar multivalent RNA regions encode similar low-complexity domains. For example, arginine-enriched mixed charge domains (R-MCDs) tend to be encoded by repetitive purine-rich sequences in mRNAs. Accumulation of proteins containing R-MCDs increases the cohesion of nuclear speckles, which induces selective capture of purine-rich multivalent mRNAs. The multivalent regions are bound by specific RNA-binding proteins, including TRA2 proteins, which relocalize to speckles upon interstasis to promote selective mRNA capture. CLK-mediated phosphorylation of TRA2 proteins counters their localization to speckles, thereby modulating interstasis. Thus, the condensation properties of nuclear speckles act as a sensor for interstasis, a collective negative-feedback loop that co-regulates mRNAs of highly dosage-sensitive genes, which primarily encode nuclear condensation-prone proteins. The authors discover a homeostatic process termed interstasis, in which an increased concentration of proteins within RNA–protein condensates induces the sequestration of their own mRNAs."

 Despite decades of investigation, it remains unclear (and hard to predict1–4) how the outcomes of chemical reactions change over multidimensional ‘hyperspaces’ defined by reaction conditions5. Whereas human chemists can explore only a limited subset of these manifolds, automated platforms6–12 can generate thousands of reactions in parallel. Yet, purification and yield quantification remain bottlenecks, constrained by time-consuming and resource-intensive analytical techniques. As a result, our understanding of reaction hyperspaces remains fragmentary7,9,13–16. Are yield distributions smooth or corrugated? Do they conceal mechanistically new reactions? Can major products vary across different regions? Here, to address these questions, we developed a low-cost robotic platform using primarily optical detection to quantify yields of products and by-products at unprecedented throughput and minimal cost per condition. Scanning hyperspaces across thousands of conditions, we find and prove mathematically that, for continuous variables (concentrations, temperatures), individual yield distributions are generally slow-varying. At the same time, we uncover hyperspace regions of unexpected reactivity as well as switchovers between major products. Moreover, by systematically surveying substrate proportions, we reconstruct underlying reaction networks and expose hidden intermediates and products—even in reactions studied for well over a century. This hyperspace-scanning approach provides a versatile and scalable framework for reaction optimization and discovery. Crucially, it can help identify conditions under which complex mixtures can be driven cleanly towards different major products, thereby expanding synthetic diversity while reducing chemical input requirements.

 Enabling vertical-stack proximal cooperation between multirotor flying robots can facilitate the execution of complex aerial manipulation tasks. However, vertical-stack proximal flight is commonly regarded as a dangerous condition that should be avoided because of persistent and intense downwash interference generated between flying robots1,2. Here we propose a cooperative aerial manipulation system, called FlyingToolbox, that can work stably with sub-centimetre-level docking accuracy under vertical-stack flight conditions. The system consists of a toolbox micro-aerial vehicle (MAV) and a manipulator MAV. The robotic arm of the manipulator MAV can autonomously dock with a tool carried by the toolbox MAV, in which the docking accuracy reaches 0.80 ± 0.33 cm in the presence of downwash airflow of up to 13.18 m s−1. By enabling midair tool exchange in proximity, FlyingToolbox resolves the paradox between flight proximity and manipulation accuracy, suggesting a new model for heterogeneous and interactive flying robot cooperation in diverse applications3–5.

 Kinetically trapping the high-temperature states through rapid cooling solidification is widely used for the synthesis of high-entropy alloys (HEAs), especially those with intrinsically immiscible elemental combinations1–4. However, strategies need to be developed to overcome the fundamental limitations of rapid cooling solidification in controlling the crystallinity, structure and morphology of HEAs. Here we introduce an isothermal solidification strategy for the synthesis of HEAs by rapidly altering the metal alloy composition through liquid–liquid interface reactions at low temperatures, for example, from 25 °C to 80 °C. We use gallium (Ga)-based metal as the sacrificial reagent and mixing medium. By directing the reactions to the interfaces between the Ga-based liquid metal and an aqueous metal ion solution, the foreign metal ions can be reduced at the interfaces and incorporated into the liquid metal quickly. HEAs with various crystallinity (single crystal, mesocrystal, polycrystal and amorphous), morphology (zero, two and three dimensions) and compositions can be achieved through the isothermal solidification. Ga can be completely consumed, resulting in Ga-free HEAs. If desired, Ga can be one of the metal elements in the final products. In situ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy (TEM) studies and theoretical analysis show the isothermal solidification mechanisms. Our direct observations show the enhanced mixing of liquid metal elements and the solidification process with fluctuating nucleation dynamics. The isothermal solidification marks a powerful strategy for HEA synthesis through an unexplored pathway of kinetically trapping the high-entropy states. Gallium is used as a sacrificial agent and mixing medium for the isothermal solidification synthesis of high-entropy alloy nanomaterials with diverse crystallinities and morphologies."

 Holliday junctions (HJs) are branched four-way DNA structures that link recombining chromosomes during double-strand break repair1. Despite posing a risk to chromosome segregation, HJs accumulate during meiotic prophase I as intermediates in the process of crossing-over2,3. Whether HJs have additional regulatory functions remains unclear. Here we establish an experimental system in budding yeast that enables conditional nucleolytic resolution of HJs after the establishment of meiotic chromosome synapsis. We find that HJ resolution triggers complete disassembly of the synaptonemal complex without disrupting the axis–loop organization of chromosomes. Mechanistically, HJs mediate the continued association of ZMM proteins with recombination nodules that form at the axes interface of homologous chromosome pairs. ZMM proteins, in turn, promote polymerization of the synaptonemal complex while simultaneously protecting HJs from processing by non-crossover pathways. Thus, reciprocal feedback between ZMMs, which stabilize HJs, and HJs, which retain ZMM proteins at future crossover sites, maintains chromosome synapsis until HJ-resolving enzymes are activated during exit from prophase I. Notably, by polymerizing and maintaining the synaptonemal complex structure, the HJ–ZMM interplay suppresses de novo double-strand break formation and recombination reinitiation. In doing so, this interplay suppresses the DNA damage response, enabling meiotic progression without unrepaired breaks and supporting crossover assurance. Holliday junctions maintain chromosome synapsis to enable crossover assurance in budding yeast."

 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable success in treating blood cancers, but CAR T cell dysfunction remains a common cause of treatment failure1. Here we present CELLFIE, a CRISPR screening platform for enhancing CAR T cells across multiple clinical objectives. We performed genome-wide screens in human primary CAR T cells, with readouts capturing key aspects of T cell biology, including proliferation, target cell recognition, activation, apoptosis and fratricide, and exhaustion. Screening hits were prioritized using a new in vivo CROP-seq2 method in a xenograft model of human leukaemia, establishing several gene knockouts that boost CAR T cell efficacy. Most notably, we discovered that RHOG knockout is a potent and unexpected CAR T cell enhancer, both individually and together with FAS knockout, which was validated across multiple in vivo models, CAR designs and sample donors, and in patient-derived cells. Demonstrating the versatility of the CELLFIE platform, we also conducted combinatorial CRISPR screens to identify synergistic gene pairs and saturation base-editing screens to characterize RHOG variants. In summary, we discovered, validated and biologically characterized CRISPR-boosted CAR T cells that outperform standard CAR T cells in widely used benchmarks, establishing a foundational resource for optimizing cell-based immunotherapies.

 Neuroblastoma is a highly lethal childhood tumour derived from differentiation-arrested neural crest cells1,2. Like all cancers, its growth is fuelled by metabolites obtained from either circulation or local biosynthesis3,4. Neuroblastomas depend on local polyamine biosynthesis, and the inhibitor difluoromethylornithine has shown clinical activity5. Here we show that such inhibition can be augmented by dietary restriction of upstream amino acid substrates, leading to disruption of oncogenic protein translation, tumour differentiation and profound survival gains in the Th-MYCN mouse model. Specifically, an arginine- and proline-free diet decreases the amount of the polyamine precursor ornithine and enhances tumour polyamine depletion by difluoromethylornithine. This polyamine depletion causes ribosome stalling, unexpectedly specifically at codons with adenosine in the third position. Such codons are selectively enriched in cell cycle genes and low in neuronal differentiation genes. Thus, impaired translation of these codons, induced by combined dietary and pharmacological intervention, favours a pro-differentiation proteome. These results suggest that the genes of specific cellular programmes have evolved hallmark codon usage preferences that enable coherent translational rewiring in response to metabolic stresses, and that this process can be targeted to activate differentiation of paediatric cancers.

Here we used a genome-scale CRISPR–Cas9-based screen to identify LRP8, an apolipoprotein E and reelin receptor with high expression in the brain, as a TBEV receptor. LRP8 downregulation reduced TBEV infection in human cells, and its overexpression enhanced infection. LRP8 bound directly to the TBEV E glycoprotein and mediated viral attachment and internalization into cells.

 Barley is one of the oldest cultivated crops, with a complex evolutionary and domestication history1. Previous studies have rejected the idea of a single origin and instead support a model of mosaic genomic ancestry2,3. With increasingly comprehensive genome data, we now ask where the haplotypes — the building blocks of this mosaic — originate, and whether all domesticated barleys share the same wild progenitors or whether certain wild populations contribute more heavily to specific lineages. To address these questions, we apply a haplotype-based approach to investigate the genetic diversity and population structure of wild and domesticated barley. We analyse whole-genome sequences from 682 genebank accessions and 23 archaeological specimens, tracing the spatiotemporal origins of haplotypes and identifying wild contributors during domestication and later gene flow events. Ancient DNA supports our genome-wide findings from modern samples. Our results suggest that a founding domesticated population emerged in the Fertile Crescent during a prolonged period of pre-domestication cultivation. A key practical insight is that the high haplotype differentiation among barley populations — arising independently, or layered on top, of selection — poses challenges for mapping adaptive loci.

 Robertsonian chromosomes are a type of variant chromosome that is commonly found in nature. Present in 1 in 800 humans, these chromosomes can underlie infertility, trisomies and increased cancer incidence1–5. They have been recognized cytogenetically for more than a century6, yet their origins have remained unknown. Here we describe complete assemblies of three human Robertsonian chromosomes. We identified a common breakpoint in SST1, a macrosatellite DNA located on chromosomes 13, 14 and 21, which commonly undergo Robertsonian translocation. SST1 is contained within a larger shared homology domain7 that is inverted on chromosome 14, which enables a meiotic crossover event that fuses the long arms of two chromosomes. Robertsonian chromosomes have two centromeric DNA arrays and have lost all ribosomal DNA. In two cases, we find that only one of the two centromeric arrays is active. In the third case, both arrays can be active but owing to their proximity, they are often encompassed by a single outer kinetochore. Thus a combination of array proximity and epigenetic changes in centromeres facilitates the stable propagation of Robertsonian chromosomes. Investigation of the assembled genomes of chimpanzee and bonobo highlights that the inversion on chromosome 14 is unique to the human genome. Resolving the structural and epigenetic features of human Robertsonian chromosomes at a molecular level provides a foundation for a broader understanding of the molecular mechanisms of structural variation and chromosome evolution. Analysis of human Robertsonian chromosomes originating from 13, 14 and 21 reveal that they result from breaks at the SST1 macrosatellite DNA array and recombination between homologous sequences surrounding SST1."

 Chromosomal linkages formed through crossover recombination are essential for the accurate segregation of homologous chromosomes during meiosis1. The DNA events of recombination are linked to structural components of meiotic chromosomes2. Imperatively, the biased resolution of double Holliday junction (dHJ) intermediates into crossovers3,4 occurs within the synaptonemal complex (SC), the meiosis-specific structure that mediates end-to-end synapsis of homologues during the pachytene stage5,6. However, the role of the SC in crossover-specific dHJ resolution remains unclear. Here we show that key SC components function through dependent and interdependent relationships to protect dHJs from aberrant dissolution into non-crossover products. Conditional ablation experiments reveal that cohesin, the core of SC lateral elements, is required to maintain both synapsis and dHJ-associated crossover recombination complexes (CRCs) during pachytene. The SC central region transverse-filament protein is also required to maintain CRCs. Reciprocally, the stability of the SC central region requires the continuous presence of CRCs effectively coupling synapsis to dHJ formation and desynapsis to resolution. However, dHJ protection and CRC maintenance can occur without end-to-end homologue synapsis mediated by the central element of the SC central region. We conclude that local ensembles of SC components are sufficient to enable crossover-specific dHJ resolution to ensure the linkage and segregation of homologous chromosomes. Conditional ablation experiments show that key components of the synaptonemal complex protect double Holliday junction recombination intermediates to ensure their resolution into crossover products, which are required for accurate chromosome segregation during meiosis."

 Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are highly effective in haematological malignancies1. However, progressive loss of CAR T cells contributes to relapse in many patients2–4. Here we performed in vivo loss-of-function CRISPR screens in CAR T cells targeting B cell maturation antigen to investigate genes that influence CAR T cell persistence and function in a human multiple myeloma model. We tracked the expansion and persistence of CRISPR library-edited T cells in vitro and at early and late time points in vivo to track the performance of gene-modified CAR T cells from manufacturing to survival in tumours. The screens revealed context-specific regulators of CAR T cell expansion and persistence. Ablation of RASA2 and SOCS1 enhanced T cell expansion in vitro, whereas loss of PTPN2, ZC3H12A and RC3H1 conferred early growth advantages to CAR T cells in vivo. Notably, we identified cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (encoded by CDKN1B), a cell cycle regulator, as the most important factor limiting CAR T cell fitness at late time points in vivo. CDKN1B ablation increased CAR T cell proliferation and effector function, significantly enhancing tumour clearance and overall survival. Our findings reveal differing effects of gene perturbation on CAR T cells over time and in different environments, highlight CDKN1B as a promising target to generate highly effective CAR T cells for multiple myeloma and underscore the potential of in vivo screening for identifying genes to enhance CAR T cell efficacy.

 Fast, reliable logical operations are essential for realizing useful quantum computers1–3. By redundantly encoding logical qubits into many physical qubits and using syndrome measurements to detect and correct errors, we can achieve low logical error rates. However, for many practical quantum error correction codes such as the surface code, owing to syndrome measurement errors, standard constructions require multiple extraction rounds—of the order of the code distance d—for fault-tolerant computation, particularly considering fault-tolerant state preparation4–12. Here we show that logical operations can be performed fault-tolerantly with only a constant number of extraction rounds for a broad class of quantum error correction codes, including the surface code with magic state inputs and feedforward, to achieve ‘transversal algorithmic fault tolerance’. Through the combination of transversal operations7 and new strategies for correlated decoding13, despite only having access to partial syndrome information, we prove that the deviation from the ideal logical measurement distribution can be made exponentially small in the distance, even if the instantaneous quantum state cannot be made close to a logical codeword because of measurement errors. We supplement this proof with circuit-level simulations in a range of relevant settings, demonstrating the fault tolerance and competitive performance of our approach. Our work sheds new light on the theory of quantum fault tolerance and has the potential to reduce the space–time cost of practical fault-tolerant quantum computation by over an order of magnitude.

 The periplasm of gram-negative bacteria facilitates critical functions, including nutrient uptake, cell wall metabolism, antibiotic resistance, and virulence. Efficient quality control of proteins involved in these processes is crucial for bacterial fitness and survival. The limited size of the periplasm has hindered high-resolution mechanistic investigations of complex processes within this compartment. Using in-cell NMR spectroscopy, we dissect the mechanism of periplasmic quality control of the metallo-β-lactamase NDM-1 under conditions of zinc starvation, which destabilizes its native structure promoting its degradation. We show that the protease Prc targets membrane-bound NDM-1 at specific residues and secondary structure motifs, while DegP processes peptides generated by Prc. This approach discloses the concerted mechanism of these proteases at atomic resolution in the periplasm of live cells. In-cell NMR reveals the molecular details of NDM-1 degradation, an enzyme linked to antibiotic resistance, and sheds light on protein quality control in the periplasm of live bacteria at an atomic level."

 Applying artificial intelligence (AI) for systematic literature review holds great potential for enhancing evidence-based medicine, yet has been limited by insufficient training and evaluation. Here, we present LEADS, an AI foundation model trained on 633,759 samples curated from 21,335 systematic reviews, 453,625 clinical trial publications, and 27,015 clinical trial registries. In experiments, LEADS demonstrates consistent improvements over four cutting-edge large language models (LLMs) on six literature mining tasks, e.g., study search, screening, and data extraction. We conduct a user study with 16 clinicians and researchers from 14 institutions to assess the utility of LEADS integrated into the expert workflow. In study selection, experts using LEADS achieve 0.81 recall vs. 0.78 without, saving 20.8% time. For data extraction, accuracy reached 0.85 vs. 0.80, with 26.9% time savings.

 Impaired musical rhythm abilities and developmental speech-language related disorders are biologically and clinically intertwined. Prior work examining their relationship has primarily used small samples; here, we studied associations at population-scale by conducting the largest systematic epidemiological investigation to date (total N = 39,358). Based on existing theoretical frameworks, we predicted that rhythm impairment would be a significant risk factor for speech-language disorders in the general adult population. Findings were consistent across multiple independent datasets and rhythm subskills (including beat synchronization and rhythm discrimination), and aggregate meta-analyzed data showed that non-linguistic rhythm impairment is a modest but consistent risk factor for developmental speech, language, and reading disorders (OR = 1.33 [1.18 – 1.49]; p < .0001). Further, cross-trait polygenic score analyses (total N = 7180) indicated shared genetic architecture between musical rhythm and reading abilities, suggesting genetic pleiotropy between musicality and language-related phenotypes.

 Mass transport through nanochannels involves interactions across six distinct regions, including the “real first interface” (RFI), a region formed by functional elements extending into the bulk solution and their surrounding bulk solution. While previous studies have revealed the roles of the bulk solution, outer surface, and inner wall, the contribution of RFI remains unclear due to its susceptibility to interference from neighboring regions, which makes its individual role difficult to isolate. Herein, we show that a diblock DNA probe can be used to independently investigate the RFI by keeping the properties of the other five regions constant. Our results demonstrate that the RFI’s role in regulating ionic current in our system is mainly determined by charge effects. These findings highlight the distinct and previously underappreciated role of the RFI in nanochannel transport and suggest that resolving its function may provide the final piece in understanding ion transport mechanisms in confined systems.

 The activation entropy of dislocation glide, a key process controlling the strength of many metals, is often assumed to be constant or linked to enthalpy through the empirical Meyer-Neldel law-both of which are simplified approximations. In this study, we take a more direct approach by calculating the activation Gibbs energy for kink-pair nucleation on screw dislocations of two body-centered cubic metals, iron and tungsten. To ensure reliability, we develop machine learning interatomic potentials for both metals, carefully trained on dislocation data from density functional theory. Our findings reveal that dislocations undergo harmonic transitions between Peierls valleys, with an activation entropy that remains largely constant, regardless of temperature or applied stress. We use these results to parameterize a thermally-activated model of yield stress, which consistently matches experimental data in both iron and tungsten. Our work challenges recent studies using classical potentials, which report highly varying activation entropies, and suggests that simulations relying on classical potentials-widely used in materials modeling-could be significantly influenced by overestimated entropic effects.

Here the authors conduct cross-disease genome wide association studies using multi-trait analyses to uncover shared genetic mechanisms contributing to overlapping risk profiles. 
 The extensive co-occurrence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), as evidenced by epidemiological studies, is supported by positive genetic correlations identified in comprehensive genetic investigations, suggesting a shared genetic basis. However, the precise genetic mechanisms underlying these associations remain elusive. By assessing genetic correlations, genetic overlap, and causal connections, we aim to shed light on common genetic underpinnings among major CVDs. Employing multi-trait analysis, we pursue diverse strategies to unveil shared genetic elements, encompassing SNPs, genes, gene sets, and functional categories with pleiotropic implications. Our study systematically quantifies genetic overlap beyond genome-wide genetic correlations across CVDs, while identifying a putative causal relationship between coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure (HF). We then pinpointed 38 genomic loci with pleiotropic influence across CVDs, of which the most influential pleiotropic locus is located at the LPA gene. Notably, 12 loci present high evidence of multi-trait colocalization and display congruent directional effects. Examination of genes and gene sets linked to these loci unveiled robust associations with circulatory system development processes. Intriguingly, distinct patterns predominantly driven by atrial fibrillation, coronary artery disease, and venous thromboembolism underscore the significant disparities between clinically defined CVD classifications and underlying shared biological mechanisms, according to functional annotation findings.

Here the researchers find that inappropriate development policies could have a greater effect on exposure to flooding than sea-level rise up to 2100 in China. 
 Effective coastal exposure assessments are crucial for adaptively managing threats from sea-level rise (SLR). Despite recent advances, global and regional assessments are constrained by omitting critical factors such as land-use change, failing to disaggregate potential impacts by land uses and oversimplifying land subsidence. Here we address these gaps by developing context-specific scenarios to 2100 based on a comprehensive analysis of Chinese coastal development policies. We integrate high-resolution simulations of population and land-system changes with inundation exposure assessments that incorporate SLR, land subsidence, tides and storm surges, offering a more nuanced understanding of coastal risks. Across our plausible set of downscaled scenarios of shared socioeconomic and representative concentration pathways, policy decisions have a bigger effect on what is exposed to coastal flooding until 2100 than does the magnitude of SLR. Hence, coastal policy decisions largely influence coastal risk and adaptation needs to 2100, demonstrating the necessity of appropriate policy design to manage coastal risks. Coastal risk assessment under future climate change is important for effective adaptation, but multidimensional analyses are still rare.

 The Arctic Ocean has seen a profound sea ice loss during the summer, with changes most pronounced in the Western Arctic. This has resulted in the Chukchi Sea, located just north of Bering Strait, being ice-free by the end of summer, i.e. September, since 2000, except during 2024. Here using the ice thickness budget, we investigate the processes responsible for the return of summer sea ice to the region during 2024. We show that an exceptional ice convergence event in February 2024, along with additional events in the winter and spring, resulted in ice thicknesses along the Siberian coast of the Chukchi Sea through the summer months that exceeded values last seen in the region during the late 20th century. The reduced penetration of shortwave radiation through the anomalously thick ice contributed to a delay in melt, contributing to the presence of sea ice in the region during the summer of 2024. We also argue that a thinner and more mobile ice pack contributed to this remarkable return of summer sea ice after a 25-year hiatus, opening the possibility of similar events in the future."

 Hydrothermal fluid migration and supercritical phase transitions around the brittle–ductile transition are key to understanding volcanic activity and geothermal energy, but it remains challenging due to limited subsurface imaging. Here we conducted active-source seismic surveys at Kuju volcano, Japan, applying extended common-reflection-surface analysis to image magma-related and hydrothermal structures. We further estimated earthquake hypocenters, focal mechanisms, and seismic velocity. A continuous horizontal reflector could indicate a low-permeability seal confining supercritical fluids, while a low-amplitude reflection zone reveals fractures disrupting the seal. This permeable window, located at the magma margin, coincides with earthquake clusters of various focal mechanisms, suggesting upward fluid migration. A plume-shaped zone with low P-wave and S-wave velocity ratio (Vp/Vs) above the permeable window indicates thermally-altered formations and gas release from phase transitions. These results provide 3D visualization of the interplay among trapped supercritical fluid, its migration through permeable window, and related seismicity near the brittle-ductile transition.

 Sedimentary DNA is becoming an invaluable tool for biodiversity assessments across spatial and temporal scales. Accurate interpretation, however, requires a clear understanding of its origin and taphonomy, from transport to preservation processes within lake systems. Insights into these processes are crucial for developing efficient sampling methods for precise ecological monitoring. Our analysis of 42 adjacent surface sediment sample replicates shows that deeper, central samples, with reduced influence from aquatic taxa, exhibit greater taxonomic richness compared to near-shore samples. By comparing these results to systematic vegetation surveys, we demonstrate that central cores are optimal as they capture the main taxonomic richness in the catchment, while marginal samples near inflows are essential for detecting rarer, spatially restricted taxa. This study highlights the potential of central-core sampling to effectively capture vegetation profiles in small, bathymetrically simple lakes, while enhancing the understanding of DNA transport mechanisms in catchments with similar topographic or hydrological characteristics.

 Ancient DNA and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers are powerful tools to reconstruct past ecosystems and climate in high-latitude lakes, but often require contrasting redox conditions for reliable interpretations. Here, we present a new approach using adjacent oxic and seasonally suboxic lakes from Iceland to 1) better understand the impacts of redox potential on these molecular proxies, and 2) reconstruct Holocene climate, human settlement, and plant history. We observe that oxic lakes provide more reliable branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers-based paleotemperature records, possibly due to the diminished presence of bacterial communities associated with reducing environments. On the other hand, oxic conditions in shallow lakes, which are often targeted for ancient DNA, can lead to poor preservation. By combining oxic and suboxic lake sediment records, we show that natural climate, and not humans, has controlled Holocene vegetation changes in northeast Iceland, and therefore provides ideal constraints for Earth system models.

 Changes in weather persistence have important implications for flood risk and regional climate resilience. In recent decades, the winter North Atlantic Oscillation index has shown a sustained shift toward more strongly positive values, exceeding the range projected by climate models under high greenhouse gas scenarios. Here we investigate whether this shift has influenced the persistence of warm and wet winter conditions in north-western Europe. We use daily temperature and precipitation records from weather stations across Europe and daily values of the North Atlantic Oscillation index from 1950–1980 and 1990–2020. Using quantile autoregressive models applied to the temperature data, we find significant increases in the persistence of warm weather. Moreover, we observe a rise in precipitation persistence. To assess the robustness of our findings, we also evaluate the influence of the Scandinavian teleconnection pattern and the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation. The increased persistence of warm and wet winter weather in north-western Europe increases the likelihood of prolonged wet spells and associated flood risk.

 Glaciers serve as sensitive indicators of climate change, influencing both regional water supplies and global sea-level rise. Contrasting to the global tendency towards retreat, glaciers in the Karakoram exhibits an unusual pattern of stability and modest thickening. However, the spatial variability and underlying causes of the mass balance anomalies remain insufficiently understood, primarily due to the limitations in previous measurement methods. To address this gap, we conducted a comprehensive geodetic analysis of glacier elevation changes in the central and eastern Karakoram, covering 681 glaciers of over 10,000 km2 between 2011 and 2019. The elevation was measured exclusively with TanDEM-X InSAR data to reduce penetration bias and temporal ambiguities. The geodetic analysis was conducted using a three-module DEM Differencing framework. In this framework, the first module generates high-quality InSAR DEM with an iterative approach to address the challenges of mountainous terrain for InSAR processing; the second module employed an innovative voids filling method using Gaussian Process Regression for robust elevation change mapping; and the third module incorporates a non-stationary uncertainty analysis for rigorous uncertainty quantification. The results reveal a regional mean elevation change rate of 0.0038±0.0042myr−1 and a specific mass balance of 0.0032±0.0052mw.e.yr−1, indicating slight overall thickening during the study period. The spatial patterns of elevation change display pronounced heterogeneity and clear differences between surge-type and non-surge glaciers, reflecting the complex interplay of dynamic, climatic, and morphological factors in the region.

 Forests are a key element for reaching the EU climate neutrality targets, but natural disturbances, climate change and human activities, make it urgent to set up a continuous monitoring system of the main parameters affecting forest ecosystems. A key parameter is the annual felling: the volume of trees felled during a given reference period.We combine National Forest Inventory data, based on direct field measurements, with yearly time series data derived by remote sensing, to assess the amount of fellings carried out in Italy between 2000 and 2023. Italy was selected as a representative case study as harvest statistics are missing or partially inconsistent, which is also the case for other European countries.We highlighted that no data source, considered individually, can provide a comprehensive estimate of the harvest level and its evolution in time.Between 2000 and 2023, total fellings ranged from a peak of 16.5 million m3 in 2006 to a low of 10.4 million m3 in 2014.A near real-time assessment of the harvest level, such as estimated within our study, is increasingly important to quantify the impact of human activities on forest ecosystems. According to our results, the fellings rate, i.e. the ratio between fellings and increment, was about 0.38 within the latest years. Nevertheless, considering the uncertainty of all input data, the total fellings ranged by about ± 50 %, and the corresponding fellings rate could be significantly larger. From this arises the urgent need to set up a continuous monitoring system, integrating National Forest Inventory surveys and remote sensing data reliably, not only in Italy, but across the EU."

 Learning-based Digital Elevation Model (DEM) super-resolution (SR) remains a challenge due to the complexity of real-world terrains. Existing approaches typically treat DEMs as digital grids or triangulated irregular networks, solving numerical fitting problems to densify points through learning models. However, these methods often overlook the spatial context and structural textures inherent in the terrain. To address this limitation, we propose utilizing relative depth maps derived from open-source remote sensing images by a foundational Depth Anything Model (DAM), which provide complementary structural information about the terrain and enhance the elevation details in DEMs. A novel DEMSR dataset, DEM-OPT-Depth SR, is constructed, pairing open-source remote sensing images, DEMs, and their corresponding relative depth maps. Additionally, we present a benchmark method, the Multi-modal Fusion Super-Resolution (MFSR) network, which extracts features through multi-branch pseudo-siamese networks and performs multi-scale feature fusion. Extensive experiments on the DEM-OPT-Depth SR dataset demonstrate a 24.63% improvement in RMSE-Elevation, a 22.05% improvement in RMSE-Slope, and an 11.44% improvement in RMSE-Aspect, showing the superiority and generalization capabilities of the MFSR model over previously proposed state-of-the-art baselines in DEMSR tasks.

 In the Himalayan region of Nepal, the majority of households are single-cell houses (SCH) where families cook, heat, sleep, and perform daily activities in a single shared space. Firewood and other biomass fuels are commonly used for cooking and heating, especially during cold seasons. This combustion process releases harmful pollutants, such as carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO2), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5), significantly degrading indoor air quality (IAQ) and posing serious health risks to residents. This study aims to assess indoor air quality and evaluate pollutant exposure and associated health risks among occupants of SCHs.Continuous real-time monitoring of IAQ parameters was conducted for 24 h over five consecutive days in each house under varying ventilation conditions. CO and PM2.5 concentrations were found to be 25.11 ± 14.24 ppm and 793.8 ± 117.36 μg/m3, respectively—exceeding international health guidelines by up to 3.6 times for CO and 32 times for PM2.5. Residents are exposed to elevated pollutant concentrations for up to 14 h daily due to extended fire use for both cooking and heating. Inhalation exposure modeling revealed average daily pollutant intakes of 248.59 mg of CO and 6849.74 μg of PM2.5 per person. The Air Quality Index (AQI) across monitoring scenarios ranged from 150 to 430, indicating unhealthy to hazardous levels.These findings highlight the urgent need for improved ventilation systems and cleaner cooking technologies to mitigate indoor air pollution and reduce health risks in firewood-dependent households in cold regions."

 Extreme precipitation events are among the most damaging hydroclimatic hazards, particularly in monsoon-dominated, topographically complex, and data-scarce regions of South Asia. Despite advances in global and regional climate modeling, accurate simulations of such extreme events remain challenging due to the nonlinear interactions between deep convection, orography, and large-scale circulation. This study evaluates the performance of the Regional Climate Model RegCM5, developed by the Abdus Salam International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP), and reproduces two severe monsoon-driven precipitation events: July 2010 and August 2022. High-resolution simulations were conducted using convection-permitting (3 km) non-hydrostatic cores (MOLOCH and MM5) and are compared with coarser hydrostatic (12 km, MM4) simulations employing parameterized convection. Model outputs were validated against ERA5 and ERA5-Land reanalysis, satellite-based GPM precipitation, the Gloh2 ensemble product, and in-situ observations. Results indicate that the 3 km MOLOCH configuration significantly improves the simulation of precipitation intensity, spatial distribution, and temporal variability relative to hydrostatic runs. Notably, RegCM5-MOLOCH effectively captures the 500 hPa geopotential height patterns associated with the extreme event of the 2010 Russian blocking ridge, underscoring its utility in resolving key synoptic drivers.RegCM5-MOLOCH reproduces the large-scale moisture transport while capturing terrain-induced convergence along the Sulaiman mountain ranges of Balochistan. Diagnostics of Moisture Flux Convergence (MFC) and Integrated Vapor Transport (IVT) further reveal strong southwesterly moisture inflow from the Arabian Sea converging over Sindh and Balochistan during August 2022, consistent with the flood-affected areas. Furthermore, Spearman rank correlation analysis reveals robust linkages between simulated precipitation and sea surface temperature-related changes in La Niña and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD). This highlights the combined influence of large-scale ocean-atmosphere modes on monsoon extremes. Whilst, overall, convection-permitting simulations reduce biases, some persistent wet biases remain, likely due to the unresolved uncertainties in cloud microphysics, land–atmosphere coupling, and moisture transport. These findings enhance the application of high-resolution regional modeling for enhanced flood risk assessment, improved early warning systems, and more effective climate adaptation strategies in monsoon-affected regions."

 Investigating atmospheric boundary layer height (ABLH) holds significant value for the understanding and numerical simulations of the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL). Based on the 20 years (2003−2022) of radiosonde data and 10 years (2013−2022) of microwave radiometer observations, this study applied two methods to determine the ABLH and comprehensively investigated the ABLH characteristics over Hong Kong, a densely populated subtropical city strongly influenced by tropical cyclones (TC). The analysis includes the interannual and seasonal variability of ABLH, as well as its relationships with atmospheric stability and wind shear exponent (WSE) under both TC and non-tropical cyclone (NTC) conditions. The results indicate higher ABLH in summer and autumn compared to spring and winter, and higher ABLH under weakly unstable boundary layer conditions. Nevertheless, the interannual variation in the ABLH is insignificant. Notably, the relationships between ABLH, atmospheric stability, and WSE exhibit distinct differences under TC and NTC conditions. It is revealed that on NTC days, the ABLH increases with the WSE under neutral or weakly stable stratification, while this increase is not significant during TC days due to turbulence saturation. The findings of this study are expected to enhance the understanding of ABL dynamics and provide scientific insights for wind energy assessment, urban pollutant dispersion modeling, and thermal comfort evaluation."

 Despite playing a crucial role in regulating Earth's radiative balance and driving the hydrological cycle, clouds remain inadequately characterised by both models and observations due to their substantial spatiotemporal variability. In tropical urban environments, cloud characteristics are further complicated by anthropogenic heat, abundance of aerosols, and local atmospheric dynamics. The present study characterises the clouds over an Urban region, Hyderabad, India, by studying the seasonal and diurnal variability of cloud base height (CBH) using long-term Ceilometer observations (July 2019–March 2025). The monsoon season had the highest cloud occurrence frequency (70.5 %), followed by postmonsoon (28.1 %), premonsoon (12.5 %), and winter (7.8 %). Single-layer clouds dominated (≈ 67.8 %) irrespective of seasons, and the multi-layer clouds were more prevalent during the monsoon. Most clouds occurred below 2 km, with noticeable bimodal distributions during the monsoon and premonsoon seasons. While the primary mode at 1–2 km is closely linked to the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, the second prominent cloud vertical mode is associated with the 0 °C isotherm level. The diurnal variation of primary cloud mode closely follows the PBL evolution, especially during the monsoon and postmonsoon seasons. The cloud occurrence frequency also shows a strong diurnal cycle with high occurrence of clouds during the daytime in all the seasons, probably associated with daytime heating by insolation. The efficacy of reanalysis datasets in producing accurate cloud characteristics is assessed by comparing ERA5 products with long-term statistics obtained in the present study. It is noted that ERA5-derived CBH overestimates (underestimates) low (high)-level clouds."

The new theory thus provides a basis for an improved description of ice nucleation in the atmosphere. 
 Ice nucleation plays a critical role in cloud formation and atmospheric processes, influencing precipitation and climate. In this study, we present a theoretical approach for describing homogeneous ice nucleation within adsorbed water films on insoluble substrates and suggest that it may be a mechanism for deposition ice nucleation with non-porous ice nuclei that induce ice premelting. Our theory is based on the Frenkel–Halsey–Hill (FHH) adsorption model, which characterizes the substrate–adsorbate interaction, and the classical nucleation theory of homogeneous freezing, which describes the probability of ice formation. We use the theory to model the melting point (MP), critical ice nucleus size, and nucleation rates as functions of adsorbed water film thickness and substrate properties. Our results indicate that the melting point depression can be as much as 5 K on hydrophilic substrates when the thickness of the water film is 1 nm. The onset temperature for homogeneous ice nucleation (235 K for cloud droplets) can shift 1–2 K lower in adsorbed films. At temperatures below 235 K, the humidity at which ice nucleation occurs is determined by the condition that the adsorbed water film must be thick enough to accommodate the critical ice nucleus.  Comparisons of calculated relative humidity conditions with experimental ice nucleation data for silica particles show promising agreement, validating the FHH model as a framework for describing deposition ice nucleation in the atmosphere."

These findings provide critical insights into the formation mechanisms of Cl-OOMs in polluted settings. 
 Chlorine (Cl) atoms generated from the photolysis of atmospheric reactive chlorine species can rapidly react with various volatile organic compounds (VOCs), forming chlorine- and non-chlorine-containing low-volatile oxygenated organic molecules. Yet, the formation mechanisms of chlorine-containing oxygenated organic molecules (Cl-OOMs) from reactions of Cl atoms with aromatics in the presence and absence of NOx are not fully understood. Here, we investigated Cl-OOMs formation from Cl-initiated reactions of three typical aromatics (i.e., toluene, m-xylene, and 1,2,4-trimethylbenzene (1,2,4-TMB)) in the laboratory and searched for ambient gaseous Cl-OOMs in suburban Shanghai. From our laboratory experiments, 19 Cl-containing peroxyl radicals and a series of Cl-OOMs originating from the Cl-addition-initiated reaction were detected, which provides direct evidence that the Cl-addition-initiated reaction is a non-negligible pathway. In addition, a total of 51 gaseous Cl-OOMs were identified during the winter in suburban Shanghai, 38 of which were also observed in laboratory experiments, hinting that Cl-initiated reaction of aromatics could serve as a source of Cl-OOMs in an anthropogenically influenced atmosphere. Toxicity evaluation of these Cl-OOMs shows potential adverse health effects. These findings demonstrate that Cl-OOMs can be efficiently formed via the Cl-addition pathway in the reactions between aromatics and Cl atoms and some of these Cl-OOMs could be toxic."

We studied a photovoltaic power plant's impact on climate and soil. The panels increased radiation, reduced wind, and caused daytime warming but nighttime cooling. Soil stayed colder and wetter, extending the frozen period by 50 days. These changes may help stabilize permafrost but could also affect biodiversity and water cycles. 
 Rising global energy demand and the transition to low-carbon sources have driven the rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV) power plants, introducing significant land-use changes with largely unexplored ecological consequences. This study examined the microclimatic and soil hydrothermal impacts of a pastoral-integrated PV power plant in an alpine meadow ecosystem on the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Year-round observations from two 10 m towers, located inside and outside the PV power plant, revealed that PV installations increased annual net radiation by 28.9 %, while reducing albedo and wind speed by 31.6 % and 36.2 %, respectively. Air temperature responses were highly asymmetrical, with daytime and summer warming but nighttime and winter cooling. The PV power plant induced strong spatial heterogeneity in soil temperature and moisture: At 5 cm depth, PV array gaps exhibited cold and moist conditions, whereas areas beneath the panels were cold and dry. These changes extended the soil frozen period by approximately 50 d and reduced the soil moisture depletion rate by 1.3 to 3.5 times compared to the reference site. These findings indicate that the PV power plant can alter local energy and water balances in ways that may buffer ecosystem responses to climate warming. However, further multi-year studies are needed to evaluate their long-term impacts on vegetation dynamics, carbon fluxes, and permafrost processes."

This study combines satellite millimeter-wave radar and radiometer observations to estimate the vertical distributions of physical parameters of ice particles such as mass, size, and number densities. CPR radar and GPM radiometer observations together reduce the estimation errors of the physical parameters and provide information on the optimal ice particle shape. 
 Satellite remote sensing of frozen hydrometeors in deep convective systems is essential for understanding precipitation systems and the formation of upper-level clouds. To reduce uncertainties in ice cloud microphysical properties inside convective clouds, a combined use of millimeter-wave sensors sensitive to frozen particles in deep convective clouds is a promising strategy. This study uses the CloudSat Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) and the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Microwave Imager (GMI) to retrieve the vertical profiles of ice water content (IWC), number concentration (Nt), and mass-weighted diameter (Dm). A new retrieval method is developed by a combination of a deep neural network (DNN) and an optimal estimation method (OEM). In the first step of the algorithm, an initial guess is estimated by DNN based on an a priori database, followed by the next step where OEM seeks a more optimal frozen hydrometer profile.The retrieval performance is evaluated against selected match-up observations of CloudSat and GPM. The combined use of CPR and GMI observations reduces retrieval errors compared to the CPR-only observations. The retrieved frozen hydrometer profiles excellently reproduce CPR reflectivity and GMI brightness temperatures (Tb) when computed by forward simulations. The Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) reflectivity is also reasonably reproduced, indicating some ability to retrieve large snow and graupel particles detectable by the low-frequency radars. A significant spread in simulated Tb is found for large ice water paths (IWPs) among different ice habit models tested, of which the optimal models are dendrite snowflake and soft sphere for the ice density model used in this algorithm. The combined algorithm developed by this work implies the potential of passive and active millimeter-wave instruments for retrieving multiple aspects of the cloud ice properties when combined in tandem. Future work will incorporate new satellite missions, including EarthCARE Doppler millimeter-wave radar and submillimeter-wave radiometers such as Ice Cloud Imager."

Here we present a daily 1 km shortwave albedo product for Antarctic sea ice from 2012 to 2021, based on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) reflectance data. The albedo for missing pixels due to cloud cover was also reconstructed. This dataset can be used to assess changes in Antarctic sea ice, radiation budget, and the strength of sea ice albedo feedback, as well as their potential interconnections. 
 Sea ice albedo is a critical parameter for quantifying the energy budget in the Antarctic region. High spatiotemporal resolution sea ice albedo product is essential for Antarctic climate and environmental research. In this study, based on Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) reflectance data, we use the Multiband Reflectance Iteration (MBRI) algorithm to calculate sea ice albedo. This algorithm fully utilizes multi-band observations from single-angle/date observed information to correct the anisotropy of the sea ice surface. Additionally, spatiotemporal information is utilized to reconstruct albedo under cloudy-sky conditions, while correcting for cloud radiative forcing effects. A new daily seamless Antarctic sea ice albedo product with a 1 km resolution is then generated for the period 2012 to 2021. Monte Carlo simulations show that the average retrieval uncertainty of this product is 0.022, with higher uncertainty in backward observations. MBRI albedo product was validated using in situ measurements from Automatic Weather Stations (AWS). The results show that the bias is 0.02, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.071. After upscaling to 25 km resolution and applying a 5 d temporal aggregation, the RMSE decreased to below 0.055. Compared to existing albedo products, the MBRI product exhibits improved spatial continuity due to the reconstruction of cloudy-sky pixels. Statistical analysis shows that albedo under cloudy-sky conditions is higher than under clear-sky conditions (mean difference: 0.035–0.064). The MBRI albedo product can be used to estimate sea ice albedo feedback, energy balance analysis and sea ice monitoring.

Sampling was conducted using consistent protocols across stations, allowing for long-term comparison. All data have undergone validation and standardization to ensure their usability for environmental assessment and modeling purposes. The dataset provides valuable insights into the evolution of coastal water quality under the influence of climate change and anthropogenic pressures. Notable trends include increasing winter temperatures (especially since 2010), progressive ocean acidification at Blainville-sur-Mer, and changing nutrient regimes across the region, with a marked phosphate decline and spatial contrasts in nutrient limitation (phosphorus-limited on the East coast, nitrogen-limited on the West coast).

 The Dutch real-time gauge-adjusted radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) product provides 5 min accumulations every 5 min on a ∼1 km2 grid covering the Netherlands and the area around it (∼4.5×105 km2). It plays a key role in hydrological decision-support systems and as input for nowcasts in order to inform decision makers. Major changes to the production of this QPE product were implemented on 31 January 2023, and include (polarimetric) fuzzy logic clutter removal, rain-induced attenuation correction, and vertical profile of reflectivity correction. Moreover, the mean-field bias rain gauge adjustment was replaced by a spatially variable rain gauge adjustment. We evaluate the potential quality improvement resulting from these changes by comparing the last year of the old and the first year of the renewed QPE product. Clutter leading to overestimation in the old radar product is effectively removed in the renewed radar product. The evaluation against rain gauge accumulations shows a strong improvement. The average underestimation decreases by about 10 percentage points to 15 % over the Netherlands. Improvements of the statistics are clear for the daily precipitation over a large part of the QPE product domain, but also show the potential for incorporating rain gauge accumulations outside the Netherlands. The 1 h and daily extremes over the Netherlands are also better captured by the renewed product. Improvements in daily precipitation accumulations for the renewed product are stronger in the winter period than in the summer period.

 Datasets of soil multi-element concentrations are essential for advancing our understanding of ecological functioning and responses to global change in mountain regions.

Over the analysis period 2000–2009, the model demonstrates a stable and realistic upper ocean mean state compared to observation-based products. We use ocean biomes to delineate the major subregions and evaluate the biogeochemical properties of the model, including surface chlorophyll and partial pressure of carbon dioxide. BIOPERIANT12 captures key spatial and temporal features of SO biogeochemistry (BGC), though it tends to overestimate biological biomass and underrepresents high-frequency variability.

For highly variable quantities, we demonstrate that a model might perform evaluation poorly or favourably compared to the single realisation of the world that the observations represent, highlighting the need for large ensembles for model evaluation. 
 Observations can be considered as one realisation of the climate system that we live in. To provide a fair comparison of climate models with observations, one must use multiple realisations or ensemble members from a single model and assess where the observations sit within the ensemble spread. Single model initial-condition large ensembles (LEs) are valuable tools for such an evaluation. Here, we present the new Multi-Model Large Ensemble Archive (MMLEAv2) which has been extended to include 18 models and 16 two-dimensional variables. Data in this archive have been remapped to a common 2.5 × 2.5° grid for ease of inter-model comparison. We additionally introduce the newly updated Climate Variability Diagnostics Package version 6 (CVDPv6), which is designed specifically for use with LEs. The CVDPv6 computes and displays the major modes of climate variability as well as long-term trends and climatologies in models and observations based on a variety of fields. This tool creates plots of both individual ensemble members, and the ensemble mean of each LE, including observational rank plots, pattern correlations, and root mean square difference metrics displayed in both graphical and statistical output that is saved to a data repository. By applying the CVDPv6 to the MMLEAv2, we highlight its use for model evaluation against observations and for model intercomparisons. We demonstrate that for highly variable metrics a model might evaluate poorly or favourably compared to the single realisation the observations represent, depending on the chosen ensemble member. This behaviour emphasises that LEs provide a much fairer model evaluation than a single ensemble member, ensemble mean, or multi-model mean. By leveraging the combination of the CVDPv6 and MMLEAv2 presented in this paper we can determine which climate variables need a LE for fair assessment against observations."

Colwell,Megathrust Earthquake Legacy Linked to Changes in Widespread Potential for Methane and Iron Cycling in Glaciated Wetlands,"Freshwater wetlands are major sources of global methane emissions through biogenic methanogenesis, a process increasingly influenced by climate change. High latitude wetlands are subject to uniquely altered biogeochemical inputs due to disproportionate warming. For example, glacial meltwater delivers metal‐rich sediments that are easily reducible. Additionally, if the wetland is located upon a subduction zone, periodic and dynamic geological forces, such as megathrust earthquakes, can disrupt these systems further. To explore these interactions, we analyzed the genomic potential of microbial communities across a glaciated wetland located in an active forearc region subject to repeated megathrust ruptures. We found that sediment microbial communities contained the complete potential for methanogenesis and iron cycling, yet the relative abundance of key methanogenic genes was reduced in recently deposited freshwater sediments despite high levels of organic matter and iron. These findings suggest that megathrust fault activity and associated uplift exerts broad, abrupt change on microbial metabolic potential, and that overlying sediments reflect modern glacial input which modify the development of metabolic potential. Glacial influence likely disrupts methanogenesis by supporting communities capable of dissimilatory iron reduction, which may increase metal‐dependent methanotrophy. As climate change accelerates glacial melt, extant and newly developing microbial communities will likely respond rapidly to shifting carbon and mineral inputs, altering carbon cycling dynamics in these sensitive ecosystems. Our work links small scale microbial metabolic potential with some of the largest processes on our planet, revealing how cyclical tectonic events can overprint broad scale biogeochemistry by homogenizing microbial metabolisms and disrupting elemental cycling."

To address this, we performed grain‐size and X‐ray fluorescence scanning analyses on two cores from paleochannels in the Lower Meuse (the Netherlands). The downcore ln(Zr/Rb) ratio proves to be a reliable grain‐size proxy, allowing reconstruction of flood‐related sediment input variations. We find the flood intensity record displays a ∼300‐year cycle, synchronous to the North Atlantic Oscillation record at this band. Importantly, the recurring quasi‐decadal (7–10 years) oscillation indicates an active and stationary high‐frequency flooding regime despite significant climatic and human impacts in the Late Holocene.

However, MOST is based on assumptions of steady state and horizontally homogeneous turbulence that can lead to prediction errors in and around convective storms. To understand the nature of these errors, we used wind and eddy covariance flux measurements from the Atmospheric Radiation Measurement Southern Great Plains Atmospheric Observatory to evaluate MOST wind profiles in fair‐weather and convective storm environments, specifically those of mesoscale convective systems and ordinary thunderstorms. MOST wind profiles agreed well with observations in fair‐weather cases, while in convective storm cases the theory systematically overestimated shear in cold pools after gust front passage. Surface layer stability was found to be important in assessing MOST within convective storm environments. The overestimation of wind shear in cold pools suggests the role of non‐local fluxes in transferring momentum downward. We discuss reasons for differences and agreement with past studies, and conclude with recommendations to improve prediction of surface winds and fluxes in convective storm simulations."

Previous studies showed that an anomalous upper‐level anticyclone and associated subsidence heating, fueled by upwind latent heat release, were the main drivers. Land‐atmosphere interactions have generally been found to play a secondary but important role; however their temporal evolution and state dependence on prior soil moisture (SM) and evaporative regimes remain largely unexplored. To assess this, we run 100 ensemble members of the heatwave with varying initial land surface conditions in the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2). The circulation outside the PNW is constrained to observations, ensuring that the large‐scale dynamical drivers are reproduced while local land‐atmosphere interactions are free to evolve in the PNW region under differing soil‐moisture states. While circulation largely dictates the heatwave's magnitude (peak day temperatures about 17° ${}^{\circ}$C above the climatological mean), perturbations of the SM preconditioning across a realistic range for the time of year lead to about 3° ${}^{\circ}$C spread in CESM2. We demonstrate how the land‐atmosphere interactions evolve as ensemble members fall below a critical SM threshold where evapotranspiration reduces substantially. We also investigate how an antecedent rain event might have affected this heatwave event. Finally, we simulate the same circulation induced heatwave but in a future climate state with higher greenhouse gases and drier soils. Beyond mean warming effects, drier soils increase the probability of shifting from a wet regime into a transitional regime, exacerbating and elongating the heatwave."

Root architecture reflects land cover and soil heterogeneity, enabling vegetation access to resources that vary temporally and spatially while shaping soil structure and formation. However, how land use can influence roots and soil structure relatively deep in the subsurface (>30 cm) remains poorly understood. We investigate how cropland‐related land use and subsequent vegetation recovery alter rooting dynamics and soil structure in deeper horizons. Using a large‐scale data set representing multiple land uses as a means of varying root abundance across four soil orders, we demonstrate that B horizon root loss and regeneration are linked to changes in multiple soil structural attributes deep within soil profiles. Our findings further suggest that the degree of soil development modulates the extent of structural transformations, with less‐developed soils showing greater susceptibility to root‐associated structural shifts. The greatest change in structural development and distinctness was observed in Inceptisols, while Ultisols exhibited the least change. Such soil structural changes affect water flowpaths, carbon retention, and nutrient transport throughout the subsurface. This work thus underscores the need for Earth system models to capture dynamic soil structural attributes that respond to land‐use change. We suggest that changes in deep‐rooting abundance, such as those accelerating in the Anthropocene, may be an important agent of subsurface structural change with meaningful implications for contemporary and future ecosystem feedbacks to climate."

Up to one‐third of the country's area, mostly the country's south, was flooded. Effective response to intensifying and compounding hazards requires a better understanding of these processes. We can gain insights if impact assessments include socio‐economic components and uncertainties arising from the interactions between impacts. However, the quantitative evidence from impact assessments remains limited and fragmented, due to methodological challenges and data limitations. Using the open‐source impact assessment platform CLIMADA, we study to what extent flood‐related hazards can be used to quantify displacement outcomes in a data‐limited region. Using flood depth, exposed population, and impact functions, we link flood vulnerability to displaced people. This allows us to estimate internal displacement resulting from the flood event, and to further assess how displacement varies across the region. We find that a flood depth threshold of 0.67 m, with a confidence interval (CI) from 0.35 to 1.10 m, provides a best fit to all data from Sindh province. We find a negative correlation between displacement and the degree of urbanization. By testing the performance of our model in explaining differing displacement estimates reported across Pakistan, we show the limitations of existing impact assessment frameworks. We emphasize the importance of estimating potential displacement alongside other impacts to better characterize, communicate, and ultimately mitigate the impacts of flooding hazards."

In a warming climate, sea‐level rise (SLR) is expected to change the frequency of HTF via a direct non‐linear change in the mean water level. In this study, we investigate the impacts of SLR on HTF along the Gulf and Atlantic Coasts of the United States. We quantify the extent to which SLR is expected to exacerbate the HTF regime in the coming decades if no more flood protection is implemented. We estimate SLR at 10 km intervals using regression models, add it to numerically simulated tidal levels, and compare the results with estimated HTF thresholds. Our results provide continuous spatial coverage along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, showing a projected average rise of 0.35 ± 0.10 m in tidal levels above the mean higher high water (MHHW) by 2050, whereas Chesapeake Bay is projected to experience a greater rise of 0.39 ± 0.05 m, and Maine is expected to see a lower increase of 0.27 ± 0.08 m. This yields an increase of 10 days/year and 110 days/year in HTF hours in the years 2050 and 2100, respectively. Moreover, Pamlico Sound and Chesapeake Bay are expected to experience the most significant changes in HTF frequency, with more than 90 days of HTF by 2050s.

Here, we identified Relevant Sites for Amphibian Conservation (RSAC) for Europe (50 km x 50 km grid cells), defined as regions having the highest taxonomic diversity and/or presence of endangered species. We determined regional vulnerability by examining temporal trends of temperature and precipitation over the past 40 years, future climate projections, and the spatial distribution of roads. We integrated this information into a threat‐level index and estimated the potential resilience of the amphibian communities based on the species' reproductive capacity. We identified 525 RSAC, half of which are in Central and Eastern Europe, and the other half distributed along the Mediterranean Basin. Mean annual temperature increased in almost all RSAC, but increments were smaller in the Mediterranean and Atlantic regions. RSAC in the Mediterranean showed changes toward shorter droughts and increasingly extreme rainfall, whereas RSAC in Central and Eastern Europe presented trends toward lower daily precipitation and fewer days of uninterrupted rainfall. Regions with the highest concentration of roads may further exacerbate the impacts of the acute climatic changes observed in RSAC of Central Europe.

In subsoil of C‐middle soil, SOC storage in passively and actively restored grasslands were 81% and 25% greater, respectively, than in non‐restored grassland. In the topsoil of C‐rich soil, passively restored grassland had less SOC storage (7.5 kg·m−2) than non‐restored grassland (10 kg·m−2), because the greater aboveground biomass increased SOC decomposition caused by the priming effects driven by organic inputs from litter. The CO2‐Q10 in C‐rich topsoil in passively restored grasslands (1.1) was less than in non‐restored grassland (1.3). These findings emphasize that effective restoration management should consider initial organic C content of the degraded grassland to develop the best ecological restoration approaches to maximize C storage and limit CO2 emission into the atmosphere."

However, current methods cannot adequately capture high‐altitude hydrological processes, leading to flawed assessments of climate change impacts on FRS in such regions. Here, we improve the methodology for estimating the supply‐demand dynamics of FRS and quantify this relationship from 1990 to 2020 within the Asian Water Tower (AWT) and its downstream region. By integrating climate model data with bias correction, we estimate the supply‐demand ratio (SDR) of FRS during 2020–2050 on multiple scales. Our findings show that the FRS imbalance in the AWT and its downstream region will persist and intensify. Specifically, more than 44% of the region experienced a significant decline in the SDR during 1990–2020. It is projected that 65.8 ± 2.1% of the region will experience a significant decline in the SDR during 2020–2050 (SSP5‐8.5 scenario). Climate and socioeconomic changes have jointly exacerbated this imbalance, with relative contributions of 58.4% and 41.6%, respectively, and such an imbalance further amplifies flood risk. We propose addressing the FRS imbalance from both the supply and demand sides and strengthening cooperation among upstream and downstream regions and internationally within the Indus and Ganges‐Brahmaputra basins."

Weather modulates dengue transmission by influencing the life cycles of vector mosquitoes and the virus. Three teleconnections are known to affect the weather in Sri Lanka. Those are El Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and ENSO Modoki. We studied correlations between dengue incidence (DI) in the Western Province (WP) of Sri Lanka as a whole and three districts of the province and indices of ENSO, IOD and ENSO Modoki. We used four indices of ENSO and one index each of IOD and ENSO Modoki. We acquired notified dengue cases in WP, population data and monthly indices of three teleconnections for the 2005–2019 period. We used wavelet time series analysis to determine correlations between indices of teleconnections and DI. Two indices of ENSO were correlated with the DI of the WP and all three districts of the WP individually. The other two indices were correlated with the DI of two districts. The index of IOD was correlated with DI of two districts. The index of ENSO Modoki was correlated with the DI of WP and one district of it. Both positive and negative extremes of at least one teleconnection index were followed by the rise of DI in all districts. We concluded that three teleconnections modulate DI of different districts of WP in different ways. Monitoring of indices of these teleconnections and escalating dengue preventive work after extremes of indices can potentially blunt impending dengue peaks."

 The theory of plate tectonics describes how continents are separated from each other by lateral movement that is accommodated by transform faults connecting mid-ocean ridge sections, which leaves inactive fracture zones on the ocean floor. The occurrence of continental crustal slivers in these fracture zones at distances of hundreds of kilometres to 1,000 kilometres from continents has been documented worldwide, yet their occurrence is not expected from classical plate tectonic theory. Here we use three-dimensional magmatic-thermomechanical numerical simulations to investigate the transition from continental rifting to the birth of oceanic transform fault zones and their relationship to mantle melting and crustal tectonics. These simulations show that continental slivers are entrapped within shear zones in the oceans inherited from preceding continental rifting stage. They also show three distinct stages of transform fault zone formation—continental rift linkage, proto-transform, oceanic transform—resulting from progressive strain localization into a narrowing extension-parallel strike-slip shear zone. Additionally, continental sliver emplacement into oceanic lithosphere is shown to be associated with specific stages of subsidence and uplift linked to the changing transtensional and transpressional stress field, thereby notably modifying the ocean floor morphology, mid-ocean ridge melting conditions and transform fault seismicity.

 In the Arctic Ocean, polar amplification drives warming rates that are two to three times the global average, and this enhanced warming and the associated freshening are expected to accelerate methane cycling, impacting regional and global carbon cycling. However, our understanding of methane cycling in a warmer and fresher Arctic is limited by short observational records. Here we present biomarker evidence for prevalent aerobic methanotrophy in the Arctic Ocean during the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum (PETM; ~56 million years ago), identified through the occurrence of a hopanoid compound, hop-17(21)-ene, with a distinct isotopic signature characteristic of bacterial methanotrophy. During the PETM, intensified hydrological cycling atop an overall low-sulfate ocean of the early Cenozoic limited sedimentary sulfate availability, suppressing sulfate-dependent anaerobic methane oxidation and facilitating aerobic methane oxidation in the water column, consistent with our geological evidence and sediment diagenesis model results. Unlike anaerobic oxidation, which generates alkalinity, aerobic methane oxidation consumes oxygen and produces CO2. Our biomarker-based CO2 reconstructions indicate that the Arctic Ocean became a net CO2 source, particularly during the recovery stage, contributing to prolonged carbon input, temperature rise and ocean acidification during the PETM. These findings highlight potential major perturbations to Arctic carbon cycling under future climate change.

 The synthesis of heavily substituted chiral cyclopropanes presents a significant challenge in organic chemistry due to the inherent strain and steric congestion of these three-membered rings. In this work, we report a highly enantioselective intramolecular cyclopropanation of tri-substituted alkenes via a sulfoxonium-Rh-carbene intermediate, resulting in the formation of highly congested penta-substituted chiral cyclopropanes. The cationic sulfur-substituted Rh-carbene was produced by reacting an I,S-ylide with a paddlewheel Rh catalyst, which undergoes highly enantioselective cyclopropanation. Notably, the incorporation of a sulfoxonium group at one of the bridgehead carbons enhances the chemical versatility of the products, enabling diverse transformations through multiple mechanistic pathways. This work expands the toolkit for synthesizing penta-substituted chiral cyclopropanes and demonstrates the viability of using cationic carbenes in enantioselective transformations.

 The melanocortin-4 receptor is a G protein-coupled receptor and a key regulator of appetite and metabolism. It can interact with the melanocortin-receptor accessory protein 2, a single transmembrane helix protein known to interact with several different G protein-coupled receptors. However, the consequences of this interaction are not completely understood. Here we report that co-expression of melanocortin-receptor accessory protein 2 has multiple effects on the melanocortin-4 receptor: it enhances G protein-mediated signaling and simultaneously impairs β-arrestin2 recruitment and, consequently, internalization. In addition, co-expression of melanocortin-receptor accessory protein 2 leads to an increased number of monomers of melanocortin-4 receptor by disrupting receptor oligomers. A structural homology model of the active state melanocortin-4 receptor – melanocortin-receptor accessory protein 2 – Gαs complex suggests interaction sites that are relevant for receptor activation. Our data indicate that melanocortin-receptor accessory protein 2 is an accessory protein that interacts with and influences melanocortin-4 receptor structure, biasing its signaling towards G protein-mediated effects.

 Transposable elements (TEs) are repetitive DNA sequences that move within genomes and play important roles in gene regulation and genome evolution. Accurate TE annotation in genomes is crucial for downstream analyses but challenging due to their sequence diversity and frequent fragmentation, including the occurrence of nested copies. We here present TEtrimmer, a tool that automates and replaces key steps of traditional manual curation of TEs.

 Dopaminergic neurons (DANs) in the substantia nigra pars lateralis (SNL) project to the tail of striatum, where they contribute to threat behaviors. Auditory cortex contributes to threat conditioning, but whether it directly modulates DANs is unclear. Here, we show that SNL DANs fire irregularly, achieve rapid maximal firing rates, exhibit distinct ionic conductances, and receive predominantly excitatory input. This contrasts with substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) DANs that fire regularly and receive mainly inhibitory input, establishing SNL DANs as a physiologically distinct dopaminergic subpopulation. Functional mapping revealed robust excitatory input from auditory and temporal association cortices to SNL DANs, but not SNc DANs. In behavioral experiments, inhibiting neurotransmitter release from either SNL DANs or cortical afferents to SNL resulted in impaired auditory threat conditioning. Thus, our work reveals robust functional corticonigral projections to SNL DANs which directly regulate threat behaviors.

Here, the authors demonstrate that clinical immunity to Plasmodium vivax develops rapidly after a single controlled human malaria infection, reducing inflammatory responses and protecting against symptoms, while not significantly affecting parasite load. 
 Clinical immunity to malaria can lead to asymptomatic infection, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. To examine the development of clinical immunity, we conducted a multi-cohort, repeat controlled human malaria infection (CHMI) study with Plasmodium vivax, and a heterologous rechallenge with P. falciparum (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03797989). Malaria-naïve adults underwent CHMI up to three times, by administration of red blood cells infected with P. vivax PvW1 clone or P. falciparum 3D7 clone. Nineteen participants underwent primary CHMI with P. vivax, 12 returned for secondary homologous CHMI and 2 for tertiary homologous CHMI. Six participants who had completed P. vivax CHMI then underwent heterologous rechallenge with P. falciparum. We find that clinical immunity to P. vivax develops rapidly after a single CHMI, protecting participants against fever and laboratory abnormalities. This is underpinned by the attenuation of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines, as well as reduced coagulation and endothelium activation. In contrast, there is no evidence of anti-parasite immunity, suggesting that mechanisms of clinical immunity can operate independently of pathogen load to reduce the damage caused by malaria infection. In addition, we show that clinical immunity to P. vivax is parasite species-specific and provides no protection against CHMI with P. falciparum. Understanding the mechanisms behind clinical immunity to malaria is crucial for developing effective interventions. Here, the authors demonstrate that clinical immunity to Plasmodium vivax develops rapidly after a single controlled human malaria infection, reducing inflammatory responses and protecting against symptoms, while not significantly affecting parasite load."

 Learning and solving governing equations of a physical system, represented by partial differential equations (PDEs), from data is a central challenge in many areas of science and engineering. Traditional numerical methods can be computationally expensive for complex systems and require complete governing equations. Existing data-driven machine learning methods require large datasets to learn a surrogate solution operator, which could be impractical. Here, we propose a solution operator learning method that requires only one PDE solution, i.e., one-shot learning, along with suitable initial and boundary conditions. Leveraging the locality of derivatives, we define a local solution operator in small local domains, train it using a neural network, and use it to predict solutions of new input functions via mesh-based fixed-point iteration or meshfree neural-network based approaches. We test our method on various PDEs, complex geometries, and a practical spatial infection spread application, demonstrating its effectiveness and generalization capabilities.

 Wildfire is among the fastest-growing economic risks of climate change, yet cost-effective adaptation strategies remain underexplored. In the electric power sector, where utility infrastructure has ignited some of the most destructive fires, companies are investing heavily to reduce risk. Here we evaluate the costs, reliability implications and risk-reduction benefits of the largest utility wildfire mitigation programme in the United States. Using weather and vegetation data for 25,000 miles of high-risk power lines, we develop a predictive model of ignition risk and compare outcomes across locations that had similar risk profiles but received different interventions. A newer strategy—adjusting protective device sensitivity during high-risk conditions—has reduced more wildfire risk at lower cost per avoided structure burned than conventional approaches such as undergrounding or vegetation management. Our results underscore the importance of comprehensive accounting of costs, risks and reliability when evaluating adaptation investments, particularly where capital-intensive measures may be over-incentivized.

This flux is sixfold greater than that in the United Nations Environment Programme’s last report and twofold to sevenfold that of deep-sea sediment burial, making continental shelves the largest marine mercury sinks. Since industrialization, mercury levels in surface shelf sediments have tripled, indicating that most buried mercury is of anthropogenic origin. However, this sink is increasingly threatened by climate-related processes, bottom trawling and dredging, which physically remobilize mercury through diffusion, stirring, redistribution and off-shelf transport. Empirical extrapolations suggest that ongoing trawling, dredging and warming may transform coastal sediments from mercury sinks to net sources. This shift may have already occurred in parts of Europe’s shelves, though additional verification is required. Our findings highlight the urgent need to reduce anthropogenic mercury and greenhouse gas emissions and balance fishery demand with ecosystem conservation to sustain these critical mercury sinks.

 Over the past four decades, forests have experienced major disturbances, highlighting the need for Near Real-Time (NRT) monitoring. Traditional optical-based detection is cloud-sensitive, whereas Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)-based frameworks enable all-weather observation. Yet, SAR monitoring has mainly focused on humid tropical forests, with reduced performance in regions showing strong seasonal backscatter variation, such as tropical savannas. Detecting small-scale forest loss also remains difficult due to the spatial resolution loss from speckle filtering. This paper presents an unsupervised SAR-based disturbance detection method with NRT capabilities, using Bayesian inference. Building on an existing methodology, the approach processes single-polarization Sentinel-1 SAR time series through Bayesian conjugate analysis. Forest disturbance is framed as a changepoint detection problem, where each new observation updates the probability of forest loss using prior information and a data model. The algorithm uses a hidden Markov chain to adapt recursively to seasonal variation and bypasses spatial filtering, preserving native data resolution and enhancing small-scale forest loss detection. Additionally, a methodology accounts for proximity to past disturbances. The method is tested on two 2020 reference datasets from the Brazilian Amazon and Cerrado savanna. The first covers small validation polygons (0.1–1 ha, excluding selective logging), totaling 2,650 ha in the Amazon and 450 ha in the Cerrado. The second includes larger clearings totaling 11,200 ha in the Amazon, and 12,700 ha in the Cerrado. A further comparison is conducted with operational NRT forest loss monitoring approaches. Results show substantial gains in detecting small-scale disturbances with reduced false alarms. In the Amazon, the method achieves an F1-score of 97.3% versus 93.1% for the current leading NRT approach. In the Cerrado, it reaches an F1-score of 97.4%, far exceeding the 33.3% of the optical-based method. For larger clearings, performance matches existing SAR approaches in the Amazon. While combined optical-SAR monitoring increases true positives, it also raises false alarm rates. In the Cerrado, the proposed method clearly outperforms optical monitoring, and in both regions it improves timeliness relative to individual operational approaches."

 The centimeter level deformation generated by small and medium-sized earthquakes contains rich information on tectonic activity, which is of great value for improving the coseismic deformation database and fault dynamics models. InSAR is an important means of observing coseismic deformation, but there is a problem of insufficient observation accuracy for centimeter level coseismic deformation in complex environments. Time-series InSAR advances achieve millimeter-scale deformation monitoring, yet detecting subtle coseismic signals from Mw 5.0–6.5 earthquakes remains challenging in complex environments by computational limits and step-like model discontinuities. We develop a method incorporating SBAS-InSAR and a hyperbolic tangent (tanh) step function to overcome these barriers. Simulations based on Sentinel-1 and MintPy demonstrate 15–55 % RMSE reductions (0.08–0.45 cm) in coseismic fields versus conventional DInSAR/Stacking methods. Applied to the 2021 Yangbi Mw5.9 event, our approach reveals: (1) The tanh-based model maintains phase continuity during abrupt deformation and decouples linear tectonic motion. (2) It enhances displacement field accuracy with 18–61 % noise suppression and the reliability of finite fault inversion. The model enables seconds deformation estimation for single earthquakes on standard hardware, advancing detection thresholds to sub-centimeter levels in high-coherence region.

 Forests play a crucial role in global carbon sequestration, and the varying carbon storage capacities of tree species underscore the need for accurate vegetation classification. This study introduces 3D-M2C-ResNet, a deep learning model for high-resolution, fine-scale tree species classification. The model leverages fused remote sensing inputs, combining Zhuhai-1 hyperspectral imagery with phenological parameters derived from Sentinel-2 time-series data. A Multi-Scale Cascaded Dilated Convolution (MCDC) module was developed to expand the receptive field through a three-branch architecture, enabling comprehensive spectral–spatial feature extraction. Additionally, a Multi-level Feature Enhancement Strategy (MFES) adaptively refines shallow and deep features, enhancing semantic–spatial integration across layers. The model was evaluated against support vector machine (SVM), VGG16, and ResNet50 on a test set of 22,380 pixels. 3D-M2C-ResNet achieved an overall accuracy of 98.08% and a Kappa coefficient of 97.88%, outperforming baseline methods. Ablation experiments confirmed the effectiveness of the MCDC and MFES modules. Notably, incorporating phenological information substantially improved classification performance, particularly for spectrally similar tree species.

 The concept of city image plays a pivotal role in urban branding, serving as a strategic tool for promoting sustainable urban development. A city’s image not only shapes its identity but also enhances its global competitiveness, attracting tourism, investment, and new residents. Traditional media such as newspapers and television offer limited perspectives on city image, whereas emerging platforms like short video apps provide richer and more diverse insights. Nevertheless, existing studies remain dominated by traditional media analysis, with insufficient examination of how short video platforms represent the spatial, landscape, social, and emotional dimensions of a city’s image. This study proposed a novel approach by leveraging the diverse and extensive short video data from Douyin to thoroughly deconstruct Shanghai’s comprehensive city image. We constructed a geotagged short video database, categorizing landscape and social images based on visual features and assessing emotional tones through audio-text analysis. The findings revealed distinct spatial patterns, with core areas highly concentrated and peripheral areas more dispersed. The analysis further identified nine core image areas, three major development axes, and ten prominent zones that defined Shanghai’s unique geographic and cultural identity. This approach could provide a quantitative characterization of city image, highlighting the potential for improved public space design and enhanced citizen engagement through short videos. Moreover, these results underscored the significant role of social media platforms, especially short video apps, in shaping public perception of cities.

 Accurate tree species mapping is essential for effective forest management but is often constrained by manual, labour-intensive workflows that limit scalability. While airborne laser scanning (ALS) supports large-scale forest attribute prediction, species classification remains difficult in complex, multi-species forests. To address this, we propose an automated, data-driven dual-stream deep learning framework that integrates ALS data with point-cloud metrics to identify individual tree species. Our framework incorporates an automated approach to individual tree segmentation and species labelling using existing forest inventory and field data, resulting in a dataset of 16,269 labelled individual tree point-clouds of four species across a 630,000 ha boreal mixed species forest in Ontario, Canada. Our dual-stream deep learning model integrates a Point Extractor to generate feature representations from raw ALS point-clouds and a complementary Metrics Network to process the point-cloud metrics. Results, based on the split test set of 2441 trees, showed that the inclusion of the Metrics Network improved tree species classification accuracy by approximately 11 % compared to models that rely solely on the Point Extractor. A weighted F1-score of 0.70 and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.88 was achieved using this dual-stream approach, along with enhanced predictive probabilities for all species thus improving the reliability of the predicted results. This approach reduces the manual processing bottleneck of individual tree segmentation and labelling and demonstrates the value of combining raw point-clouds and point-cloud metrics into a deep learning framework, offering a scalable and operational solution for reliable species predictions."

 The southwesterly flow (SW) is a synoptic-scale strong wind system that transports warm, moist air toward Taiwan and plays a crucial role in Taiwan's precipitation during the mei-yu season (May 15–June 15). Using ERA5 data (fifth-generation reanalysis from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) and rainfall observations from surface weather stations in Taiwan, this study examines the flow and rainfall characteristics of prolonged SW (PSW) cases and their relationship with extreme precipitation events around southern Taiwan during the 1979–2022 mei-yu seasons. Statistical analysis reveals a strong co-occurrence between PSW and persistent heavy rainfall (PHR), with 75 % of PHR cases occurring during PSW and 60 % of PSW cases featuring PHR. Furthermore, 83 % of R99.9 events (the 99.9th percentile rainfall intensity) are associated with PSW. Composite analysis demonstrates that the formation and maintenance of PSW involve specific synoptic-scale flow patterns: a slight eastward migration of the western North Pacific subtropical high, sustained intensity of the South Asian high, and persistent low-pressure systems over East Asia. These pressure patterns collectively establish sustained southwesterly winds, leading to significant wind speed intensification and moisture accumulation around Taiwan over an extended period (84–126 h). These findings highlight the crucial role of synoptic-scale pressure patterns in maintaining PSW and facilitating PHR occurrence, offering quantitative criteria for forecasting PSW during the mei-yu season."

In the morning and afternoon hours, when the shadows are visible, the proposed models detect OTs with a probability of detection reaching 97% and estimate their height with an average error of 0.25 km.

 The physical mechanisms underlying sea-breeze (SB) conditions in the Palma basin (Mallorca island, western Mediterranean Sea) are analyzed using the Copernicus European Regional Reanalysis (CERRA) model outputs from 2009–2020.

The comparison of model results with multiple sources of observations (automatic weather stations [AWS], satellite products and radiosondes) shows its ability to reproduce the main SB characteristics.Taking as reference the classification of SB conditions from a previous AWS-based study, a new methodology is now proposed that consists of the application of selecting filters to the CERRA data. The characteristics of the SB events show good agreement with those selected from the AWS. CERRA is able to reproduce the majority of SB patterns: the evolution from land breeze to SB, the cold and moist air advection from the sea during the steady state, the height and intensity of the SB maximum, the importance of the soil moisture and the horizontal and vertical temperature differences. CERRA has difficulties in reproducing SB events which are strongly conditioned by the topography of the basin, due to the insufficient spatial resolution to include the effect of surface heterogeneities, as is the case for upslope winds. However, this method is applicable to other complex terrain regions, and CERRA presents itself as a very useful tool for the study of the physical mechanisms that occur under SB conditions."

However, known and unforeseen project uncertainties hinder the monetary quantification of all project objectives. Future cost and benefit projections of civil infrastructure such as water resources projects are influenced by uncertainties in societal preferences and behavioral patterns, policies and their implementation, as well as distribution and sustainability of benefits under changing climate. It is especially difficult to measure the projected benefits of public goods like water infrastructure because they have no direct or standard valuation approach. With advancement in technology, improvement to analytical tools and methods, and the science of decision making under uncertainty, there has been more research interest in CBA under uncertainty. This paper: (1) reviews the historical evolution of analytical approaches for water infrastructure evaluation; (2) explains the limitations on CBA imposed by uncertainties such as climate change; (3) describes analytical techniques applied to manage uncertainty in CBA; and (4) proposes methods for improved incorporation of socio-economic factors into economic evaluation. Our review of 302 manuscripts showed that standard practice differs from academic assumptions. For instance, there is limited uptake of analytical techniques that support robust characterization of deep uncertainties such as climate change (e.g. the climate stress test) and the incorporation of socio-economic factors such as equity. The paper suggests ways to reconcile academia and practice, provides direction for future work, and presents recommendations for improving current approaches to CBA. To strengthen water resource management efforts and improve policy making, we recommend more collaborative partnerships that identify opportunities to integrate academic recommendations into standard practice. Better documentation of systematic approaches to water project evaluation under uncertainty and holistic consideration of equity at the various stages of water project planning are also required."

A case study of France,"Climate change is expected to cause increasingly severe economic and social disruptions, making adaptation a key pillar of climate policy. Assessing the economic costs of climate impacts is essential to inform adaptation strategies, especially when these costs are used to calibrate the scale of adaptation investments and to weigh adaptation needs against other policy priorities. Yet, estimates of these costs vary widely across studies. Here we compare the estimated economic cost of climate change for France across two lines of evidence: international macroeconomic studies and national policy documents. We find that recent macroeconomic literature, especially econometric studies, produces much higher cost estimates than those that can be inferred from aggregating national policy assessments. This discrepancy could be attributed to methodological lag, limited sectoral coverage, lack of monetization, and the omission of cross-border effects. It could also be attributed to an overestimation of climate impacts in the latest econometric studies. Besides, we also show that while the national institutional literature is extensive, many broad impact categories lack comprehensive quantification, and even fewer are monetized."

Being surrounded by water, the use of marine energy within Puerto Rico and the USVI represents an opportunity to increase renewable energy usage. Marine energy includes wave, tidal, and current energy as well as thermal and salinity gradient energy, and has a large potential to provide reliable and efficient power. While marine energy is usually perceived to bring power to the grid, it can also be used to power activities at sea, particularly offshore aquaculture. In the US Caribbean islands, the development of co-located offshore aquaculture and marine energy could help boost the ocean economy. This study highlights a real-world assessment of the suitability to co-locate offshore integrated multi-trophic aquaculture (IMTA) and wave energy off Puerto Rico and the USVI. The feasibility for co-location was determined through a spatial analysis to identify suitable areas for co-location, field work to collect environmental data, and a readiness analysis of wave energy devices. Combining key environmental, regulatory, and logistical parameters, the spatial analysis identified potential suitable areas for co-location off the coast in the northwest corner of Puerto Rico, northwest of Culebra, east of Vieques, and north of St. Thomas in the USVI. Wave energy was identified as the most limiting parameter for co-location in the study area. The wave energy data collected were comparable to the model predictions, showing the usefulness of fine-scale environmental conditions from wave models to assess the feasibility for co-location. Through the combination of spatial analysis, environmental monitoring, and information on wave energy device readiness, several key components for the technical feasibility of co-locating offshore IMTA and wave energy have been demonstrated in the US Caribbean islands."

However, existing research lacks a unified quantitative framework to describe the multivariate processes of flood regulation. In this study, we introduce the FRAMES framework (i.e., Flood Regulation Assessment as a MultivariatE System), in which we conceptualize the flood regulation as the responses of water infrastructures to keep floodplain settlement under certain flood exposure levels (ELs) under diverse hydroclimatic conditions. To explicitly model the interactions, we introduce (i) ELs of floodplain settlements, calculated using the cumulative distribution of the height above nearest drainage for urban pixels, (ii) flood return periods to represent hydroclimatic factors, and (iii) operational load (OL) of water infrastructures to describe the capacity allocated for flood control. Additionally, a flood regulation surface is introduced to synthesize the three-variable interactions in a continuous manner. To demonstrate our method, we apply it to the Ganjiang River Basin in China to study the interactions of Ji’An city and the upstream Wan’An Dam under various flood levels. We find a general intensification of the OL of Wan’An Dam (e.g., from 14.1% to 26.6% at a 10% EL under 100-year floods) due to the urban expansion of Ji’An city between 1985 and 2015. Moreover, the flood regulation surface reveals that due to the sparsely distributed settlements closest to the river, there is a disproportionate increase in the OL per unit decrease in EL. This indicates diminishing returns from dam-centered flood regulation strategies and suggests a critical threshold where alternative measures (e.g. local embankments, floodplain restoration) may be needed. Our study establishes a quantitative and extensible framework to describe the multivariate flood regulation processes, offering a promising tool to inform flood management tailored to the regional interplay of flood regulation."

The frequency of dry heatwave in Asia has been observed to increase by 0.9 d per decade, whereas the wet HTs have demonstrated a considerably more pronounced trend of 1.9 d per decade. Furthermore, the growth percentage in excess of 50% is evident in the majority of regions across Asia, including West Asia, Southeast Asia, South Asia and East Asia, which collectively account for 99% of the continent’s elderly population. Relative to the period 2001–2020, the exposure to wet heatwave is projected to increase from 1.4 times to 3.2 times in EA, from 1.6 to 13 times in WA, from 1.3 to 9 times in CA, from 1.3 to 8.4 times in SA and from 2.2 to 15.7 times in SEA from 2030 to 2100. This represents a rate of increase which is more than twice that of the dry heatwave in 2100 across most regions of Asia. The rise in temperature and the growth in the population aged 65+ are responsible for the increase in exposure to wet heatwaves, and the population effect has more contribution than the climate effect across all regions."

 Accurate precipitation forecasting hinges on the representation of microphysical processes within numerical models. A key approach to understanding these processes is through the analysis of hydrometeor drop size distribution (DSD). The characteristics of DSD bulk parameters – Mass Weighted Mean Diameter (Dm) and the Normalized Intercept Parameter (Nw), are estimated from the double moment cloud microphysical scheme (CASIM: Cloud-Aerosol Interacting Microphysics) employed in the operational convection permitted model of National Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasting (NCUM-R). The observations from the Joss-Valdvogel Disdrometer (JWD) and the Global Precipitation Mission – Dual Frequency Precipitation Radar (GPM-DPR) are analyzed for providing essential validation. An algorithm for separating the monsoon precipitation into convective and stratiform types in NCUM-R and a new parameter estimation module to obtain DSD parameters from the CASIM are established in the study. The model exhibits agreement with the characteristics of the DSD of raindrops with Dm ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 mm marking the majority of the monsoon precipitation events. However, the underestimation when it comes to the larger drops (with Dm > 3.25 mm and Rainrate ≥ 8 mm h−1) demands a reassessment in microphysical parameterizations. The advanced autoconversion parameterization scheme applied in CASIM favored the growth of large drops compared to the existing scheme. The enhanced growth of larger drops is reflected in the increased accuracy in the prediction of extreme precipitation associated with a convective event. The current study underscores the importance of refining microphysical parameterizations to improve the accuracy of precipitation forecasts offering a pathway for enhanced model performance in future operational forecasting systems."

Field;Benjamin J. Murray;Daniel P. Grosvenor;Floortje van den Heuvel;Kenneth S. Carslaw,Different responses of cold-air outbreak clouds to aerosol and ice production depending on cloud temperature,"Cold-air outbreak (CAO) clouds play a vital role in climate prediction. This study explores the responses of CAO clouds to aerosols and ice production under different environmental conditions. We found that CAO cloud responses vary with cloud temperature and are strongly controlled by the liquid–ice partitioning in these clouds, suggesting the importance of good representations of cloud microphysics properties to predict the behaviours of CAO clouds in a warming climate. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions and ice production processes are important factors that influence mixed-phase cold-air outbreak (CAO) clouds and their contribution to cloud-phase feedback. Recent case studies of CAO events suggest that increases in ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations cause a reduction in cloud total water content and albedo at the top of the atmosphere. However, no study has compared the sensitivities of CAO clouds to these processes under different environmental conditions. Here, we use a high-resolution nested model to quantify and compare the responses of cloud microphysics and dynamics to cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), INP concentration, and efficiency of the Hallett–Mossop (HM) secondary ice production process in two CAO events over the Labrador Sea, representing intense (cold, March) and weaker (warmer, October) mixed-phase conditions. Our results show that variations in INP concentrations strongly influence both cases, while changing Nd and the HM process efficiency affects only the warmer October case. With a higher INP concentration, cloud cover and albedo at the top of the atmosphere increase in the cold March case, while the opposite responses are found in the warm October case. We suggest that the CAO cloud response to the parameters is different in ice-dominated and liquid-dominated regimes and that the determination of the regime is strongly controlled by the cloud temperature and the characteristics of ambient INP, which both control the glaciation of clouds. This study provides an instructive perspective to understand how these cloud microphysics affect CAO clouds under different environmental conditions and serves as an important basis for future exploration of the cloud microphysics parameter space."

The results show similar predictions for 8 h O3 but significant variability for SIA and radicals, with differences up to 30 % for SIA and 200 % for radicals across chemical mechanisms and inventories. The findings highlight that evaluating control strategies for SIA and atmospheric oxidation capacity requires an ensemble approach. 
 In this study, three photochemical mechanisms of varying complexity from the Statewide Air Pollution Research Center (SAPRC) family and two widely used anthropogenic emission inventories are employed to quantify the discrepancies in the predicted effectiveness of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission controls on ozone (O3), secondary inorganic aerosols (SIAs), and hydroxyl (OH) and nitrate (NO3) radicals using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. For maximum daily average 8 h O3 (O3-8 h), relative reductions predicted using different emission inventory and mechanism combinations are consistent for up to 80 % NOx or VOC reductions, with maximum differences of approximately 15 %. For SIA, while the predicted relative changes in their daily average concentrations due to NOx reductions are quite similar, very large differences of up to 30 % occur for VOC reductions. Sometimes even the direction of change (i.e., increase or decrease) is different. For the oxidants OH and NO3 radicals, the uncertainties in the relative changes due to emission changes are even larger among different inventory–mechanism combinations, sometimes by as much as 200 %. Our results suggest that while the O3-8 h responses to emission changes are not sensitive to the choice of chemical mechanism and emission inventories, using a single model and mechanism to evaluate the effectiveness of emission controls on SIA and atmospheric oxidation capacity may have large errors. For these species, the evaluation of the control strategies may require an ensemble approach with multiple inventories and mechanisms."

Krieger,Initiation of linoleic acid autoxidation with ozone exposure in levitated aerosol particles,"The initiation of autoxidation by ozonolysis was investigated on levitated linoleic acid droplets using electrodynamic balance–mass spectrometry. Exposing the droplets to ozone for 1 h before switching the gas phase to air without ozone led to a shortening of the autoxidation initiation phase in comparison to experiments without ozone exposure. Results were compared to a bulk reaction model to investigate the synergistic effects of ozonolysis and autoxidation. 
 When atmospheric aerosol particles undergo oxidation, their physico-chemical properties are altered, influencing their environmental impact. Recent work has revealed that ozonolysis and autoxidation both contribute to the decay of linoleic acid. However, the observed linoleic acid decay rates could only be explained if the autoxidation induction period was shorter in experiments with ozone than without ozone. In this study, we investigate whether linoleic acid autoxidation in levitated aerosol particles can be initiated by ozonolysis. Linoleic acid droplets were levitated in an electrodynamic balance, exposed to air with and without ozone, and subsequently analysed by mass spectrometry. Specifically, droplets were first exposed to air containing 39 ppb or 619 ppb ozone for 1 h and thereafter, the gas phase was switched to air without ozone. The observed autoxidation rates were compared with reference experiments without the initial ozonolysis phase, the latter showing an extended induction period. These findings indicate that ozonolysis produces considerable radical concentrations, leading to the observed shortening of the induction period. A comparison of the measurements to a simple one-compartment bulk reaction model was used to estimate the radical contribution from ozonolysis. To explain the observed shortening of the induction period, assuming that radicals are formed from the decomposition of linoleic acid oxidation products, a reaction rate constant for the decay of 5.1×10−8 s−1 is obtained. Studies under extreme conditions, such as highly elevated ozone concentrations, may overlook the role of the synergistic effects discussed here, which are only of importance at atmospherically relevant oxidant concentrations."

Using a set of model experiments, we found that some parameters have a strong effect on humidity and ice, especially during fast ascents. These findings could help improve weather and climate models and may also be relevant for future climate engineering studies. 
 Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) play a crucial role in Earth's climate by transporting water vapor and hydrometeors into the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS), where they influence radiative forcing. However, a major source of uncertainty in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and climate projections stems from the parameterization of microphysical processes and their impact on cloud radiative properties as well as the vertical re-distribution of water. In this study, we use Lagrangian data from a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of a WCB case study to investigate how variations in microphysical parameterizations influence water transport into the UTLS and the outflow cirrus properties. We find that the thermodynamic conditions (pressure, temperature, specific humidity) at the end of the WCB ascent show little sensitivity to the explored parameter perturbations. In contrast, ice content and relative humidity exhibit substantial variability, primarily driven by the capacitance of ice (CAP) and the scaling of ice formation processes directly influenced by ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations. Different combinations of CAP and INP scaling yield vastly different ice and relative humidity distributions at the end of the ascent and in the subsequent hours. These differences are particularly pronounced in fast-ascending air parcels, where modifications to the saturation adjustment scheme (SAT) introduce small variations in pressure and temperature at the end of ascent. Our findings have potential implications for parameter choices in cloud models and considerations for geoengineering strategies. Future comparisons with high-quality observational data could help constrain the most realistic parameter choices, ultimately improving weather and climate forecasts."

This study developed a hybrid ship clutter identification algorithm based on artificial intelligence and heuristic criteria, effectively mitigating the issue. The successful reproduction of ship tracks in the Gulf of Finland supports this conclusion. 
 With the rapid development of active-phased arrays and solid-state transmitters, pulse compression technology has become increasingly important. Currently, pulse compression waveforms with peak sidelobe levels better than −50 dB have been developed, enabling the broader application of pulse compression technology in weather radar systems. However, existing sidelobe suppression levels are still insufficient to ensure that radar data quality is unaffected by range sidelobes for ship clutter, which have a high echo intensity and cannot be removed by conventional quality control methods. In this study, we introduce a hybrid ship clutter identification (HSCI) algorithm to address this issue in pulse compression polarimetric radar observations. The HSCI algorithm comprises two parts: mainlobe and sidelobe identification (including the range and antenna sidelobes). Mainlobe identification uses a random forest model that integrates multiple features to identify the mainlobe of ship clutter. Sidelobe identification uses a series of heuristic criteria derived from the statistical characteristics of ship clutter to distinguish them from precipitation echoes. The analysis results of two typical cases indicate that after implementing the HSCI algorithm, the impact of ship clutter on radar data is visually imperceptible. The statistical results show that the HSCI algorithm achieves a promising performance in ship clutter mainlobe identification on a test dataset comprising 400 ship clutter gates and 2500 range gates of precipitation echoes, with the precision, recall, and F1-score all exceeding 97 %. Application of this algorithm to the University of Helsinki C-band dual-polarization Doppler weather radar data successfully reproduced ship tracks in the Gulf of Finland."

 Marine spatial planning and environmental management in Antarctica require reliable data to address challenges such as climate change impacts, sea level changes, and the dynamics of fragile ecosystems. Deception Island, a volcanic caldera in the South Shetland Islands, presents unique hydrodynamic conditions influenced by extreme weather, glacial melt, and its complex geomorphology. To improve understanding of these processes, we present an open-access, integrated dataset spanning 16 years, from 2005 until 2020, combining high-resolution atmospheric and hydrodynamic variables.

This dataset fills the gap in remote sensing image–text datasets for farmland, alleviates the challenge of spatiotemporal heterogeneity in farmland segmentation, and provides valuable data to support large-scale farmland monitoring and mapping. 
 Understanding and mastering the spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland are essential for accurate farmland segmentation. The traditional deep learning paradigm that solely relies on labeled data has limitations in representing the spatial relationships between farmland elements and the surrounding environment. It struggles to effectively model the dynamic temporal evolution and spatial heterogeneity of farmland. Language, as a structured knowledge carrier, can explicitly express the spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland, such as its shape, distribution, and surrounding environmental information. Therefore, a language-driven learning paradigm can effectively alleviate the challenges posed by the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of farmland. However, in the field of remote sensing imagery of farmland, there is currently no comprehensive benchmark dataset to support this research direction. To fill this gap, we introduced language-based descriptions of farmland and developed the FarmSeg-VL dataset – the first fine-grained image–text dataset designed for spatiotemporal farmland segmentation. Firstly, this article proposed a semi-automatic annotation method that can accurately assign captions to each image, ensuring a high data quality and semantic richness while improving the efficiency of dataset construction. Secondly, FarmSeg-VL exhibits significant spatiotemporal characteristics. In terms of the temporal dimension, it covers all four seasons. In terms of the spatial dimension, it covers eight typical agricultural regions across China, with a total area of approximately 4300 km2. In addition, in terms of captions, FarmSeg-VL covers rich spatiotemporal characteristics of farmland, including its inherent properties, its phenological characteristics, its spatial distribution, its topographic and geomorphic features, and the distribution of surrounding environments. Finally, we perform a performance analysis of the vision language model and a deep learning model that relies only on labels trained on FarmSeg-VL. Models trained on the vision language model outperform deep learning models that rely only on labels by 10 %–20 %, demonstrating its potential as a standard benchmark for farmland segmentation.

These ratios vary depending on local geology and are useful for tracing the origins of people, animals, and food. By combining new data from across Australia with global datasets and a machine learning model, we produced a national prediction that supports research in archaeology, ecology, and forensic science. 
 Strontium isotope ratios (87Sr/86Sr) at the Earth's surface offer powerful tools for geological, environmental, and archaeological applications. In minerals and biological materials, 87Sr/86Sr reflects the isoztopic composition of the local bedrock and derived soils. In Australia, however, large regional-scale surveys of bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr remain scarce. Here, we present a new dataset of bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr ratios from 278 catchment outlet (floodplain) sediment samples, spanning inland southeastern Australia (South Australia, New South Wales, Victoria), northern Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland (north of 21.5° S), and the Yilgarn Craton in southern Western Australia. Combined with more than 20 000 global Sr isotope measurements, this dataset was used to generate a high-resolution isoscape of Australia using a well-established random forest spatial regression framework (Bataille et al., 2020).Australian bioavailable 87Sr/86Sr values span a narrower range (0.70501–0.78121) compared to co-located bulk sediment values (0.70480–1.09089) (de Caritat et al., 2022, 2023, 2025b), reflecting the influence of soluble and exchangeable mineral phases and atmospheric inputs such as rain and dust/seaspray. The predicted isoscape reproduces major geological patterns, with higher values over ancient crustal provinces like the Yilgarn Craton and eastern Palaeozoic orogens, and lower values across younger sedimentary basins and coastal margins. Model uncertainty, assessed via quantile random forest regression, is lowest across well-sampled, geologically stable regions where the model is well-trained and highest in poorly-sampled regions and lithologically complex zones. Despite remaining spatial gaps and areas of high prediction uncertainty, our model offers significantly improved coverage and resolution for Australia compared to other global or regional isoscapes. It also provides a scalable framework for updating the Australian isoscape as sampling density increases. This isoscape establishes a robust baseline for applications in provenance research, palaeoecology, and environmental geochemistry.

In our study, simulated Arctic and Southern Ocean total freeboard and Arctic winter sea ice thickness are assessed with data from NASA's Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) mission, providing an additional constraint beyond traditional passive microwave sea ice area comparisons used extensively in previous studies. Freeboard comparisons benefit from accurate observations from satellite laser altimetry but motivate increased focus on bulk sea ice density estimates across models and observations. The short observational time period also increases the role of internal variability. We undertake a plausibility assessment where we account for both observational uncertainty and internal variability across our different metrics for both hemispheres. In general, we see more plausible metrics in the Arctic compared to the Southern Ocean, with important differences when analyzing annual means vs. March and September means. We provide an example of this plausibility assessment by producing constrained estimates of 2015–2035 seasonal sea ice volume, using model subsets constrained using either area metrics or the combined area, freeboard and thickness metrics, with freeboard and thickness providing important additional impacts in terms of the mean seasonal cycle and spread. Finally, we present regional comparisons and a composite analysis, with models showing systematic underestimation of thicker ice in the Western Arctic and clear differences in the simulation of Eastern/Western Arctic sea ice. Overall, our study provides novel insights into sea ice model evaluation and emphasizes the potential benefits of integrating altimetry data from ICESat-2, as well as providing a discussion on the potential utility of these model constraints and future research priorities."

While previous work focused on transient prediction, lacking future prediction capability, we propose a method and evaluate on data from laboratory experiments with different slip behaviours. It shows stable predictions in modelling slip moments, intervals, and predictions beyond trained horizons, especially for challenging slip scenarios, which is crucial for cyclic geophysical process such as seismicity. 
 Fault activity modelling is vital for earthquake monitoring, risk management, and early warning. Studies on laboratory earthquakes are instrumental for modelling natural fault ruptures and enhancing our understanding of natural earthquake dynamics. Recently, machine learning methods have proven effective in predicting instantaneous fault stress in laboratory settings and fault activities on Earth. However, these methods have struggled to obtain steady future predictions because of the lack of understanding of the complex dynamics of highly non-linear laboratory fault slip systems. To address this, we introduce the Hankel–Koopman autoencoder (HKAE), a novel method inspired by dynamic system theories. The HKAE performs dynamic modelling of laboratory fault systems and provides a continuous estimation of the future state of the system. It has been used in experiments with different slip behaviours and has the ability to predict shear stress variation during a slip cycle and slip activity during long-term seismic cycles. The HKAE outperforms traditional statistical methods while achieving results comparable to cutting-edge deep-learning methods across multiple prediction scales. This is particularly evident in its accurate prediction of the stress release phase and precise estimation of the slip interval. More importantly, through dynamic theory and operator analysis in latent space, the HKAE provides insights into the stability of laboratory slip systems rather than full end-to-end black-box predictions. The ability of the HKAE to decompose, model, and reveal complex temporal dynamics highlights its potential in the monitoring of sparsely observed geophysical systems with cyclic characteristics, such as natural faults."

Utilizing four experimental versions, Prototypes 5–8, the study finds that although the UFS generally captures the MJO's propagation characteristics near the initialization time, it encounters difficulty in accurately predicting the propagation speed and decay rate of the MJO beyond 15 days. Specifically, the phase transition rate of the MJO in the UFS is slower than observed, although this behavior is improved in Prototype 8. The UFS overestimates intraseasonal east Pacific genesis potential index anomalies as a function of the MJO phase. Analysis of the vertically integrated moist static energy (MSE) budget reveals that all four UFS prototypes underestimate the damping effect of vertical MSE advection and the amplifying effect of longwave radiative heating, indicating weaknesses in tropical convective parameterization and cloud radiative feedbacks, although these biases are somewhat improved in Prototype 8. These deficiencies result in less efficient vertical MSE export, weaker damping of MJO convection, slow MJO propagation, and delayed MJO's impacts on the EP. Thus, improving the UFS's ability to simulate MJO propagation and maintenance processes is crucial for better predicting the MJO's effects on EP TC genesis and enhancing S2S forecast capability for MJO‐modulated TC activity."

Using hourly meteorological data measured at Dome Argus (Dome A) and nearby Kunlun stations during a 3‐year period (2018–2020), we present the characteristics of the SEB components along with the frequency and intensity of the near‐surface temperature inversion. Due to the strong radiative imbalance at the surface, a quasi‐continuous temperature inversion persisted throughout the observational period (frequency 96%), with an average temperature gradient exceeding 1°C/m between the surface and 4 m height. The combination of relatively strong near‐surface winds and significant vertical temperature gradients resulted in monthly average surface turbulent sensible heat gains of up to 30W·m−2 $30\,\mathrm{W}\cdot {\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ in June, largely compensating for the concurrent net surface radiation loss. In contrast, the monthly average surface turbulent latent heat gains reached only 0.1W·m−2 $0.1\,\mathrm{W}\cdot {\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ due to the minimal atmospheric‐surface moisture gradients caused by the extremely low near‐surface air temperatures. Persistent surface‐based temperature inversions typically emerge under conditions of strong radiative cooling, characterized by reduced variability in surface temperature Ts $\left({T}_{s}\right)$ and subsurface heat fluxes, enhanced turbulent mixing and the sustained moisture. This represents the first comprehensive attempt to quantify near‐surface atmospheric heat exchange processes in the Dome A area, shedding light on interactions between the snow surface and near‐surface atmosphere at the East Antarctic inland plateau."

This study proposes a new perspective in which the thermal contrast between the NCP and Mt. Taihang to its west can enhance the southerlies in planetary boundary layer (PBL) during SMS episodes and thus plays an important role in the production of ER. Based on reanalysis data, this study finds 145 SMS episodes in 30 warm seasons from 1988 to 2017, during which the NCP encountered 66% of the ER. These episodes feature strong poleward transport of moisture in the PBL. The diabatic heating over Mt. Taihang produces strong low‐level baroclinicity, which together with synoptic forcing in the free atmosphere drives the strong PBL southerlies. The south wind components in PBL and in low troposphere are only moderately correlated, whereas their difference is closely related to the zonal temperature gradient. Based on convection‐permitting numerical simulations, this study further investigates the impacts of mountain‐plain thermal contrast on the production of ER during a 20‐day SMS episode in the summer of 2024. A sensitivity experiment reveals significantly weakened PBL southerlies and moisture transport over NCP when the PBL over Mt. Taihang is cooled by ∼1 K. The simulated ER amount is 38.7% less than that in the control experiment. Additional experiments indicate that the low‐level temperature over mountain modulates the diurnal variation of the PBL wind over plain via the Holton mechanism."

Freezing Level Height as an Essential Indicator of Glacier‐Climate Regime Shifts,"Tropical glaciers are rapidly retreating under anthropogenic global warming, posing significant hydrological, ecological, and socio‐environmental risks. In this commentary, I show that the freezing level height (FLH) is a robust, yet underutilized, indicator of glacier regime change in the tropical Andes. Building on recent work by Turner et al. (2025, https://doi.org/10.1029/2024jd042963), I argue that the strong association between FLH and glaciers' equilibrium line altitude (ELA) offers a simplified and simultaneously physically meaningful tool to anticipate glacier responses to atmospheric warming. Turner et al. (2025, https://doi.org/10.1029/2024jd042963) used FLH data from reanalysis and Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version model output to project 21st century ELA trajectories under two shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5), predicting a nearly unabated rise in the ELA across studied regions, regardless of the emission scenario. While some observational constraints remain, the findings are applicable to most existing tropical glacier regimes. Importantly, rising FLH reflects a transition from humidity‐ to temperature‐driven mass balance, activating a cascade of positive feedbacks that accelerate ice loss. By reformulating an energy balance equation to express snowfall as a compensatory term, I demonstrate how the FLH can help identify resilient glacier landscapes, thereby informing conservation and adaptation priorities."

The analysis is conducted using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model through 1‐km high‐resolution simulation and terrain modification experiments. The results indicated that the MPRB formed through backbuilding processes, primarily over horizontal convective rolls (HCRs), elevated by low mountains along the coastline. The results showed that mountains from 200 m in valleys to 600 m at peaks did not disrupt HCR formation. Instead, mountains of these heights helped elevate HCRs, thereby facilitating convection initiation. However, after increasing the mountain heights above valley heights by 50%, the higher terrain and larger distance between valleys and peaks decreased boundary layer wind and 0−1 km vertical wind shear, preventing HCR formation and thereby suppressing the development of the MPRB. In contrast, lowering the terrain height reduced the HCR height, thereby weakening or even eliminating MPRB even though it enhanced the organization of HCRs. HCR formation in this case was attributed to convective instability with high vertical wind shear and rich moisture. Coastal mountains functioned as barriers, blocking the flow of moisture from the southern sea, which was also essential for HCR formation and convection initiation."

In this study, we put forward a model for the collision and fragmentation of snow particles with a rigid bed surface based on the discrete element method and investigate the intrinsic mechanism of snow particle fragmentation under various impact conditions. The results demonstrate that the fragmentation of snow particles is predominantly governed by the normal component of the impact velocity relative to the bed surface. After the collision, snow particles generally break into one major fragment and several small fragments. Among them, the size of the major fragment decreases power exponentially with the normal impact velocity. The number of effective fragments (i.e., equivalent diameter is greater than 0.1 times the initial diameter.) initially increases and subsequently decreases with the normal impact velocity, peaking at around 8 m/s, and the size of small fragments follows a lognormal distribution. Furthermore, the critical velocity for snow particle fragmentation decreases linearly with the increase of the impact angle. Moreover, a complete fragmentation scheme for snow particle‐snow bed collision is given, which can provide an effective fragmentation model for blowing snow and further deepen the understanding of the movement of the two‐phase flow of wind and snow."

Using an ensemble of 32 climate models across four emission scenarios, we project changes in solar photovoltaic potential for 2066–2100 relative to 1980–2014 across 46 global regions. Our analysis employs novel methodologies, including atmospheric forcing decomposition and extreme event attribution, to identify the physical drivers of changes in solar resources. Under high‐emission scenarios, tropical regions face severe solar potential losses of 10%–15%, particularly in sub‐Saharan Africa and South Asia, driven by increased cloud cover and temperature‐induced efficiency declines of 0.4%–0.5% per °C. Conversely, mid‐ and high‐latitude regions could see 5%–10% increases under low‐emission scenarios, primarily during summer. Aerosol effects consistently reduce solar potential (up to 10.24 W/m2), while cloud changes show mixed regional impacts. Extremely high‐productivity solar days decline drastically (16%–99%) across most seasons and scenarios, posing a threat to grid stability. These findings reveal a fundamental restructuring of global solar resources that could exacerbate energy inequalities. Tropical regions—critical for sustainable development—face the most significant losses, while high‐latitude areas may benefit. Substantial climate mitigation preserves solar potential in most regions, while high‐emission pathways pose significant risks. Our results suggest the need to integrate climate projections into solar energy planning and develop climate‐resilient photovoltaic technologies to ensure equitable energy access in a changing climate."

In radar observations, a preexisting bright band experiences a descent and then rises back to its initial height after a little while over an hour. During the two transitions, a weak and a strong double bright band occurs, respectively. When the double bright band arises, hydrometeors undergo incomplete melting in the upper ML and subsequently refreeze before entering the lower ML. Reanalysis and radiosonde data show that there is no significant change in the zonal and meridional winds, but a strong updraft is induced due to the occurrence of atmospheric instability. Analysis indicated that the instability is caused by intense atmospheric convergence; in the meantime, there are lots of upward Doppler velocities for hydrometeors in the radar measurement, confirming the occurrence of convection due to the instability. Hence, the expansion effect of updrafts causes cooling, and then, the temperature gradually recovers from the high to low levels as the updrafts weaken and ultimately cease, leading to the thermal inversion layer associated with the double bright band."

In this work, we use the benefits of the high resolution climate model and apply it to model irrigation effects and feedbacks on the local and regional climate, focusing on the interaction of irrigation with soil, surface, atmosphere, and vegetation processes. We employ the RCM REMO2020 interactively coupled to its vegetation module iMOVE and incorporate our newly developed irrigation parameterization. We conduct two simulation sets with and without the irrigation parameterization. In the first set, we employ the hydrostatic model version at 0.11° horizontal resolution for Southwestern Europe. For the second set, we repeat the experiment employing the non‐hydrostatic model version at convection‐permitting resolution of 0.0275° for Northern Italy. Our results indicate that improved vegetation conditions due irrigation, such as an increased canopy conductance, lead to effects in the atmosphere. For the atmosphere, we find more distinct and localized irrigation effects for the simulations at convection‐permitting resolution with enhanced near‐surface cooling of up to −2 K compared to the simulations at 0.11°. In the boundary layer, irrigation effects are highly influenced by turbulence, transporting the irrigation effect to higher levels. The largest differences in representing irrigation effects on the two resolutions were found in precipitation. While at 0.11° horizontal resolution, precipitation increases due to favorable convection conditions, explicitly resolving convection leads to rather mixed effects with a decrease of precipitation above irrigated areas, where the convection inhibition increased."

This study uses the high‐resolution variable‐resolution Community Earth System Model Version 2 (VR‐CESM2) to simulate the impacts of AHR on the summer climate in SWC from 1995 to 2014 while also exploring the possible climate feedback mechanisms considering the complex terrain of SWC. The results indicate that AHR significantly enhanced southeastward moisture transport and weakened southwestward moisture transport in SWC. This shift results in increased vertical upward motion over the western Sichuan Basin and the western and southeastern parts of the Yunnan‐Guizhou Plateau, leading to increased precipitation with a regional average increase of 0.1 mm per day. AHR contributes to wetter summers in SWC and increased cloud cover, which further affects the surface energy balance. In the Sichuan Basin, AHR significantly raised summer temperatures, with a regional average increase of 0.04°C; in some areas, temperatures have risen by as much as 0.4°C. Compared to previous findings obtained from coarse‐resolution models, the high‐resolution VR‐CESM model provided a more accurate simulation of the climatic effects of AHR, as it better accommodates the unique terrain of SWC. In summary, this study uses the high‐resolution VR‐CESM2 to explore the impacting mechanisms of AHR on the climate in SWC, which is crucial for understanding climate change in this region."

Hence, this study incorporated the General Circulation Model and Shared Socioeconomic Pathway projections into the hydraulic modeling framework, to analyze the flood risk to the elderly in Europe under climatic and socioeconomic changes. Results demonstrated that central Europe has experienced an increase in both surface runoff and streamflow (exceeding 50%), which have jointly contributed to intensified flooding in the major basins (Loire, Rhine, Elbe, and Danube) within the region. Among them, the Elbe basin exhibited a significant increase in 100‐year flood peak (∼107%) and elderly population (∼15%), resulting in 51,300 (CI: 45,300–60,500) of the elderly population being exposed to high‐hazard floods under a high greenhouse gas scenario (SSP5‐8.5), with at most 58% (29,800, CI: 25,100–33,700) of them being densely settled or in low‐& middle‐income groups.

Grieshop,Impacts of Improved Cookstove Interventions on Personal Exposure to Carbon Monoxide and Particulate Matter in Zambia,"Eighty‐four percent of sub‐Saharan African households rely on polluting fuels (e.g., wood, charcoal) for cooking, leading to high levels of household air pollution (HAP). While switching to modern fuels/stoves could decrease HAP levels, they are not always available or affordable. Improved biomass cookstoves could provide an intermediate step supporting transitions from traditional biomass to clean burning fuels/stoves. We conducted two stove intervention trials in Lusaka, Zambia using targeted marketing/incentives to motivate participants to use improved biomass stoves, either the Mimi Moto (pellet) or the EcoZoom (charcoal). Before the intervention, 65% of participants exclusively used charcoal, while 27% relied on electricity to some extent for cooking. We measured 24‐hr personal exposure to CO (n = 747) and PM2.5 (n = 90) of primary cooks. We implemented several statistical approaches to estimate the effects of interventions on exposure: household‐specific endline minus baseline exposure, ranksum testing, difference‐in‐differences analyses, and cross‐sectional analyses. We found that switching from traditional charcoal stoves to either intervention stove was not associated with significantly reduced exposures. However, cooks using electric stoves independent of the intervention did have significantly lower CO exposures than those using traditional charcoal, with greater electric stove use corresponding to greater exposure reductions. Variability in exposure was dominated by seasonal, regional, and neighborhood differences rather than household stove/fuel choices. A focus on HAP exposure from cooking in urban settings is unlikely to yield expected exposure reductions. Policy makers should consider pollution reduction policies/interventions that target ambient air quality in tandem with HAP‐mitigating strategies to address air pollution health burden."

 Humans have increased atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2), causing major changes in global climate while concurrently increasing the supply of biologically limiting nutrients especially nitrogen (N). Despite myriad negative effects on ecosystems and human health, nutrient pollution can increase the storage of soil carbon (C) in grasslands and retired farmland, potentially reducing atmospheric CO2. However, the persistence of nutrient-induced soil carbon gains remains a knowledge gap at the heart of a potential policy dilemma: whether reducing nutrient pollution could lead to the release of soil carbon that accumulated under high nutrient supply. Here we use a four-decade experiment conducted on retired, marginal cropland to demonstrate that nutrient addition increased soil C storage after intensive tilling, and that these soil C gains persisted for at least three decades following fertilizer and tilling cessation. This occurred despite plant biomass rapidly returning to pre-fertilization levels and plant community composition recovering from the effects of fertilization. These results demonstrate that nutrient-induced increases in soil C can persist for decades following reduced nutrient pollution as long as the soil remains untilled.

 Drought impedes the lateral flux of carbon along continental river networks to the oceans due to reduction in water flow. Here we show that, in addition to lower flow, drought also exacerbates secondary carbonate formation and atmospheric CO2 emissions. We report sub-hourly field measurements of major ion chemistry in the upper Sangamon River in North America, revealing that drought accelerates the characteristically rapid pace of carbonate mineral formation at the watershed scale. Over 195 consecutive days of moderate hydrologic drought, we observe a 17% decrease in annual riverine lateral carbon flux due to secondary carbonate formation, in addition to the restrictions imposed by low flow rates, indicating a natural limit to the inorganic carbon carrying capacity of rivers. We use historical datasets and a compilation of global river geochemistry measurements to show that this phenomenon is reproducible and widespread during periods of drought.

 The elastic degree of freedom is widely exploited to mediate magnetoelectric coupling between ferromagnetic films and ferroelectric substrates. For epitaxial Fe films grown on clean BaTiO3 substrates, shear strain can determine the underlying magnetoelastic coupling. Here, we use PhotoEmission Electron Microscopy of ferroic Fe and BaTiO3 domains, combined with micromagnetic simulations, to directly reveal an inverted interfacial magnetoelastic coupling in the low-dimensional limit. We show that the magnetocrystalline anisotropy competes with the epitaxial shear strain to align the local magnetization of ultrathin Fe films close to the local polarization direction of the ferroelectric BaTiO3 in-plane domains. Poling the BaTiO3 substrate creates c-domains with no shear strain contribution with the local magnetization rotated by ~45°. Tuning shear strain magnetoelastic contributions suggests new routes for designing magnetoelectric devices.

 Random fluctuations can lead to cooperative effects in complex systems. We here report the observation of noise-induced quantum synchronization in a chain of superconducting transmon qubits with nearest-neighbor interactions. The application of Gaussian white noise to a single site leads to synchronous oscillations in the entire chain. We show that the two synchronized end qubits are entangled, with nonzero concurrence, and that they belong to a class of generalized Bell states known as maximally entangled mixed states, whose entanglement cannot be increased by any global unitary. We further demonstrate the stability against frequency detuning of both synchronization and entanglement by determining the corresponding generalized Arnold tongue diagrams. Our results highlight the constructive influence of noise in a quantum many-body system, and initiate the exploration of collective synchronization effects with stronger than classical correlations.

Here, the authors show that these neurons have more mature dendritic spines than neighboring cells, this maturation requiring concurrent plasticity in the amygdala. 
 Flexible decision making is fundamental to day-to-day life. It often requires us to form expectations regarding the consequences of potential actions and to later retrieve those memories to guide choices. We used a task in which mice must develop, remember, and recall novel strategies to obtain rewards. Chemogenetically inactivating neurons within the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) that are active during memory encoding obstructed later memory retrieval, impeding action flexibility. Meanwhile, stimulating these same neurons induced action flexibility. Thus, OFC neurons form stable memory traces (MTs) that are necessary and sufficient for action flexibility. Long-term storage of action variables may require new experiences to trigger durable cellular changes. Accordingly, MT neurons had higher proportions of mature dendritic spine types than neighboring non-MT neurons, this profile closely associated with successful learning. Further, activity of excitatory neurons and neurotrophin signaling within the basolateral amygdala were necessary for new memory formation and concurrent dendritic spine plasticity on MT neurons in the OFC. Thus, amygdalo-OFC interactions encode new reward information, which is retained by specific structurally-plastic neurons within the OFC and utilized during choice behavior. Key neurons in the orbitofrontal cortex form memories for best action strategies when mice seek rewards.

Here, the authors use mathematical modelling to assess the potential impacts of broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccines for a hypothetical “SARS-X” outbreak. 
 COVID-19 has underscored the need for more timely access to vaccines during future pandemics. This has motivated development of broad-spectrum vaccines providing protection against entire viral families, which could be stockpiled and deployed rapidly following detection. Using mathematical modelling, we assess the utility of a broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine during a hypothetical SARS-X outbreak, for a range of implementation strategies including ring-vaccination, spatial-targeting and mass vaccination of high-risk groups. Broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine ring- or spatial strategies alone are insufficient to contain epidemics driven by a SARS-CoV-2-like virus, but when paired with rapid isolation and quarantine, can achieve containment of a SARS-CoV-1-like virus. Where suppression fails, broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine utilisation still reduces the effective reproduction number and slows epidemic growth - buying valuable time for health-system response and virus-specific vaccine development. Vaccination of high-risk populations with the broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine ahead of virus-specific vaccine availability could reduce mortality and enable shorter and less stringent non-pharmaceutical interventions to be imposed; results are sensitive to vaccine properties (e.g., efficacy), health system capabilities (e.g. rollout speed) and timeline to virus-specific vaccine availability. Our modelling suggests that broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccine delivery to those aged 60+ years could have averted 21-78 % of COVID-19 deaths during the pandemic’s first year, depending on the size of the stockpile. Realising this potential impact will require investment in manufacturing, delivery capacity and equitable access ahead of future pandemics. Broad-spectrum vaccines have been proposed as a tool for rapid response to emerging infectious disease threats and are in pre-clinical development. Here, the authors use mathematical modelling to assess the potential impacts of broadly protective sarbecovirus vaccines for a hypothetical “SARS-X” outbreak."

Here, authors derive a field theory for such interactions, revealing nonreciprocal couplings that generate diverse collective behaviors through simple manipulations. 
 Field theories for complex systems traditionally focus on collective behaviours emerging from simple, reciprocal pairwise interaction rules. However, many natural and artificial systems exhibit behaviours driven by microscopic decision-making processes that introduce both nonreciprocity and many-body interactions, challenging these conventional approaches. We develop a theoretical framework to incorporate decision-making into field theories using the shepherding problem from swarm robotics as a paradigmatic example of a multi-agent control system, where agents, the herders, must coordinate to confine another group of agents, the targets, within a prescribed region. By introducing continuous approximations of two key decision-making elements - target selection and trajectory planning - we derive field equations that capture the essential features of this distributed control problem. Our theory reveals that different decision-making strategies emerge at the continuum level, from average attraction to highly selective choices, and from undirected to goal-oriented motion, driving transitions between homogeneous and confined configurations. The resulting nonreciprocal field theory not only describes the shepherding problem but provides a general framework for incorporating decision-making into continuum theories of collective behaviour, with implications for applications ranging from robotic swarms to traffic and crowd management systems. Decision-making in multi-agent systems often involves control goals that break reciprocity.

In the Mekong River Basin, replacing some hydropower dams with solar, wind and energy storage facilities could maintain energy supply while reducing impact on sediment transport. 
 Hydropower is vital for climate mitigation by enabling low-carbon energy systems, but hydropower dams also trap sediment, a crucial resource for ecosystems and climate adaptation along downstream coastlines. Here we present a multisectoral integrated water–sediment–energy planning framework that fully internalizes the impacts of hydropower expansion, both on energy system costs and on foregone ecosystem services from reduced sediment supply for the Mekong River Basin. Our analysis indicates that full development of large hydropower could reduce sediment flows to the Mekong Delta by 41.2 ± 6.6 megatonnes per year (75 ± 9%). However, strategically replacing 19 high-sediment-trapping hydropower plants with solar, wind and energy storage alternatives could preserve up to 98% of sediment supply, with only a 4–6% (US$15.7–26.0 billion) increase in energy system costs over 2020–2050. Crucially, when sediment-related benefits—valued at US$12–28 million per megatonne per year—are considered, the additional costs of preserving sediment supply are nearly offset. The proposed framework offers a transferable approach to support sustainable low-carbon energy transitions while safeguarding sediment-dependent ecosystems worldwide.

 Internal climate variability (ICV) remains a major source of uncertainty in climate projections, complicating impact assessments across critical sectors, especially at stakeholder-relevant scales. Given that ICV emerges from the nonlinear interactions of the climate system, we argue that nonlinear dynamical (NLD) approaches can improve its characterization, providing physically interpretable insights that strengthen adaptation strategies and support multisector decision-making. However, despite their suitability for such problems, NLD approaches remain largely underutilized in the analysis of initial condition large ensembles (LEs). We argue that a diverse suite of NLD approaches offers a promising pathway for systematically extracting robust insights from LEs. If effectively applied and systematically integrated, these methods could fully harness the potential of LEs, uncovering underlying patterns and variability across ensemble members to refine fundamental insights from climate projections. This will help bridge the gap between complex climate dynamics and practical resilience strategies, ensuring that decision-makers, resource managers, and infrastructure planners have a more reliable foundation for navigating irreducible uncertainty."

Abrupt warming occurred after 1970 at 93.6% of Eurasian grid points, with 78.0% concentrated between 1970 and 1990. This abrupt warming is driven largely by the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), explaining 58% of the variation. Early warming hotspots appeared on the Mongolian Plateau and Central Asia, spreading outward. The most significant warming occurs in middle and high latitudes. Regional differences in hydrothermal conditions and cloud cover lead to varying warming timings across Eurasia.

 Submillimeter-scale redox archives in organic-rich mudrocks elucidate dynamic environmental stress shaping early marine animal ecosystems. During the late Cambrian, benthic animals, including trilobites, thrived in intermittently oxygen-deficient (predominantly euxinic) outer shelf environment where the astronomically-tuned Scandinavian Alum Shale was deposited. We present ultrahigh-resolution (0.25 mm) molybdenum and uranium isotope (δ98Mo-δ238U) and concentration profiles, revealing millennial-scale redox fluctuations that intermittently disrupted bottom-water euxinia. Varying ocean circulation, redox buffer supplies, and/or reduced productivity likely created short-lived aerobic niches for opportunistic benthic animals. Distinct δ98Mo-δ238U patterns indicate recurrent chemocline shoaling with toxic hydrogen sulfide incursions into surface waters, resembling metal drawdown in modern restricted basins. These fluctuations punctuated a million-year-long global oceanic anoxic event linked to the Steptoean Positive Carbon Isotope Excursion. Following this excursion, local redox conditions oscillated around a globally more oxygenated baseline, coinciding with animal diversifications in Baltica and worldwide. These millennial-scale redox changes underscore the need for higher-resolution geochemical approaches in paleoenvironmental reconstructions.

 The Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) is widely used in forest ecosystem research. Photon cloud classification is crucial for ICESat-2's application in sub-canopy topography and forest structure parameter estimation. However, steep topography, complex canopy structure, and dense canopy cover are important error factors affecting the results of photon cloud classification in forest areas. The existing basic photon cloud classification methods classify ground and canopy photons based on the spatial distribution of photons in the elevation direction. However, in areas of steep topography, it is difficult for the existing photon cloud classification methods to distinguish ground photons from canopy photons because ground photons and some canopy photons will have the same elevation, making their characteristics unclear. In addition, the complex canopy structure and dense canopy cover cause the distribution of photons in the elevation direction to have complex multi-peak characteristics, increasing the difficulty of distinguishing ground photons from canopy photons. In this paper, we propose a novel photon cloud classification method coupling slope and complex canopy structure to account for the abovementioned error factors in photon cloud classification. The proposed model describes the spatial distribution of photons under various slopes and canopy structures based on the probability distribution function (PDF) of the photon cloud elevation. The proposed model generates PDFs with simple or complex canopy structures under every slope to characterize the photons' spatial distribution in the elevation direction. A slope lookup table is then introduced to find the most appropriate PDF based on the constructed essential criteria with physical meaning. Finally, the coupling of the proposed model is solved by the most appropriate PDF, and the slope and photon cloud classification results can be obtained. The proposed model was tested in 130 forest plots covering various topographies and canopy structures. The results show that the root-mean-square error (RMSE) of the retrieved slopes, the RMSE of the classified ground photons, and the F-value of the ground photons classified by the proposed model reach 1.95°, 1.4 m, and 0.82, respectively. These accuracy indicators illustrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the existing basic models in the case of steep topography and complex forest structure. This study will substantially improve the accuracy of ground elevation and forest structure parameter estimation through the use of ICESat-2 data worldwide."

 In 2024, China experiences frequent and severe hydrological extremes, including record-breaking rainfall and widespread droughts, reflecting the intensifying impacts of climate change. The significant changes in terrestrial water storage (TWS) caused by these extreme precipitation events require more detailed analysis to assess short-term hydrological dynamics. Here, we first analyze precipitation anomalies (PA) and percentage of PA (PPA) across mainland China from April to August 2024. The results reveal that PA and PPA in most regions exhibit extreme values in different months, resulting in severe droughts, floods, and abrupt drought-to-flood transitions. To assess the associated water storage changes, we define and apply the terrestrial water flux (TWF), the differenceof GRACE/GRACE-FO-derived TWS anomalies in two adjacent months, as a diagnostic indicator of short-term hydrological variability. Relative to 2002–2024, the grids with TWF percentiles within the 0-10th and 90-100th ranges respectively account for 36.52%, 46.22%, 44.79%, and 46.48% of the total grids from April to August in China. Additionally, 19.89% of grids have the maximum TWF value in 2024. These extremes closely align with variations in precipitation, suggesting that intensified TWF is primarily driven by meteorological factors rather than GRACE-FO data uncertainties. Overall, this study demonstrates the effectiveness of TWF in capturing rapid hydrological changes under climate extremes. The findings provide critical insights into the impacts of climate change on regional hydrological processes and offer a valuable reference for future climate risk management and adaptation strategies at both national and global scales."

 Snow and ice are among the most important components of the cryosphere; therefore, accurate identification of snow and ice is key to improve the understanding of the influence of various studies on global warming, e.g., studies on global water cycling, climate change and the radiation budget balance. The spectral information at single-view, e.g., the normalized difference snow index (NDSI) has been widely used in the recognition of snow cover at both local and global scales. However, special information sources related to the angular pattern of snow reflectance have rarely been considered in such applications. In this study, we proposed an angular index named the snow anisotropic reflectance index (SARI) based on the RossThick–LisparseReciprocal–Snow (RTLSRS) bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF) model to achieve snow identification. The POLarization and Directionality of the Earth’s Reflectances (POLDER) database is one of the most widely-used multiangular database because of the abundant measurements and the pixels marked as “snow” are served as the data foundation in this study. The purpose of this study is to explore the potential of multiangular information to differentiate these pixels over Arctic in various situations. First, we preprocess the POLDER snow database to select the pixels with a good BRDF sampling distribution. Then, the SARI is used to preliminarily classify these POLDER datasets as snow and nonsnow, together with the classification result derived by single-view reflectances as comparison in the red and NIR bands. Next, the classification result is validated by using the MODIS MOD10A2 product. Finally, further analysis of the BRDF variations, regarding the SARI, for the classification results is performed by using the ArcticDEM and the Arctic Vegetation Map, a more detailed snow BRDF database over Arctic is obtained. The main results are as follows: (1) The potential of multiangular information (SARI) in recognizing snow had been confirmed according to MOD10A2 product as indirect validation data, the overall accuracy can reach to 86.9%, higher than the conventional single-view method (81.7%). (2) Within–pixel variations in surface terrain and components have a significant influence on the variability in BRDF shapes in the forward and backward scattering directions; in turn, these variations can be easily captured by using several simple thresholds for subcategorization for this POLDER snow database in Arctic Circle.

 Land surface temperature (LST) is a critical parameter for understanding land–atmosphere interactions, hydrology, and ecological dynamics. While thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing has traditionally been used for LST retrieval, its effectiveness is limited by cloud cover and atmospheric interference. Passive microwave (PMW) remote sensing offers a significant advantage by enabling all-weather LST retrieval, as microwave signals can penetrate clouds and precipitation. However, PMW-based LST observations from a single satellite platform suffer from significant orbital gaps, particularly in middle and low latitudes, due to the limited swath width of current sensors. Additionally, the intraday revisit frequency of PMW LST is constrained to a maximum of two times per day (ascending and descending modes), which is insufficient for capturing rapid diurnal temperature variations or supporting high-temporal-resolution applications.In this study, therefore, we address these limitations by proposing an innovative framework for intraday LST estimation with enhanced spatial coverage. This is achieved by fusing PMW data from two polar-orbiting satellites, Fengyun-3D (FY-3D) and Fengyun-3F (FY-3F), which operate at different equatorial crossing times. A sophisticated gap-filling algorithm is introduced, leveraging temporally adjacent LST estimates from intraday brightness temperature (TB) observations. Results demonstrate that the gap-filled LST from the optimal data fusion scheme exhibits a minimal positive bias of approximately 0.1–0.2 K compared to the original LST retrievals, while achieving an intraday revisit frequency of up to four times per day in middle latitudes. This represents a significant improvement over the pre-gap-filling frequency of 2.5 times per day. The framework not only enhances the spatial coverage of PMW-based LST but also provides a foundation for future satellite missions to further improve global LST monitoring. By enabling all-weather, high-frequency LST observations, this framework advances our understanding of land–atmosphere interactions, supports climate modeling, and enhances environmental monitoring capabilities."

 The New Particle Formation (NPF) mechanism plays a significant role in regulating the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN). Here, we present results from a campaign mode study during 3 January - 4 February 2023 obtained from simultaneous measurements of particle number concentration within a size range 10–300 nm (N10-300) using the scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS) and CCN concentrations (NCCN) using a CCN Counter (CCNc) over an urban location, Dibrugarh, in the Eastern Himalayan Foothills. The mean diurnal variation of NCCN at supersaturations (SS) 0.2 %–1.0 % exhibits similar variation to the total number concentration of aerosols (N10-300) measured by the SMPS. Both exhibit higher concentrations during nighttime and lower during daytime, primarily influenced by atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) dynamics. We have identified four NPF events during the study period. The new particle burst appeared below 25 nm, while the growth process sustained for 12 to 17 h at the growth rate from 4.5 to 7.2 nm h−1. The growth process begins with coagulation, followed by condensation, which becomes the dominant mechanism in the formation of CCN. Further, the enhancement factor of CCN due to NPF (E_NCCN) was estimated to examine the aerosol-CCN interaction. E_NCCN was found to vary between 2 and 8 for the four NPF events at the SS range 0.2–1 %, which are comparable to those over many urban places across the globe."

 Microplastics (MPs) are becoming well-known as widespread airborne pollutants with potential consequences for human respiratory health. In this study, we examined the occurrence, morphology, and polymer type of MPs in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) samples from 30 patients with respiratory issues in a health care setting in southwestern Iran, in relation to airborne MPs collected contemporaneously from the ambient environment. Individual MPs were separated by the use of chemical digestion and density gradient centrifugation; these were analyzed by Raman spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Overall, 129 MPs were identified in BALF, with a corrected mean of 3.2 particles/10 mL in BALF; however, the majority were white or transparent fibers ranging from a diameter of 20–100 μm, and were predominantly polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (PP), and polystyrene (PS). Air samples, collected using a high-volume OMNI sampler, ranged from 2.2 to 6.7 MP/m3, while in ambient air variation included shapes and colors with fragments, films, and spherules. Additionally, a statistically significant and strong positive correlation (ρ = 0.996 (p < 0.001)) was found between the weekly ambient MP concentration and the BALF MP counts, supporting inhalation as a likely route of exposure. Both morphologically and polymerically, the airborne MPs will likely pass through and deposit in the lower respiratory tract.

 Rare earth elements (REEs) are commonly used to trace sources and geochemical processes due to their coherent chemical properties and systematic variations. However, with the rapid expansion of their industrial applications, REEs have increasingly become emerging atmospheric pollutants, while their anthropogenic sources and associated health risks remain poorly understood. In this study, a year-long observation (April 2021–March 2022) of total suspended particles (TSP) and size-segregated aerosol was conducted in Nanchang, a major Chinese REE industry city. We found the average annual concentration of total REEs (ΣREE) was in the order of spring > winter > autumn > summer. Most REEs showed low enrichment factors (EFs), suggesting a primarily crustal origin. However, the elevated Ce and Eu EFs, combined with positive Ce and Eu anomalies pattern, indicated anthropogenic influence. A significant positive correlation of Ce and Eu EFs across both TSP and size-segregated samples further suggests a common anthropogenic source. Photoelectric industry emissions were identified as the primary contributors to the observed anomalies, accounting for 39 % ± 18 % of Ce and 24 % ± 11 % of Eu annually. Notably, both Ce and Eu anomalies showed comparable degree across fine and coarse PM, demonstrating the unique particle size distribution characteristics of photoelectric Ce and Eu. While Ce inhalation showed no significant non-carcinogenic health risks in Nanchang, concerns should be raised for workers and residents near photoelectric industry sites due to high Ce exposure levels. Furthermore, the urgent establishment of threshold values for REEs, particularly Eu, is necessary given its notable enrichment."

We find that any single boundary current captures ∼30% of subpolar MOC interannual variability. However, to fully resolve MOC variability, a wide swath across the eastern subpolar basin is needed; in the Labrador Sea both boundaries are needed. Through a volume budget analysis for the subpolar basins' lower limbs, we estimate the magnitude of unresolved processes (e.g., diapycnal mixing) required to close the mean budget (∼2 Sv). We find that in the eastern subpolar basin surface‐forced transformation variability is linked to lower limb volume variability, which translates to MOC changes within the same year.

We find that CESM2‐LE reproduces observed net impacts but exhibits compensating biases, where fewer intense cyclones reach the MIZ but decrease ice area more than observed. In a future emission scenario, CESM2‐LE predicts more frequent intense cyclones, but as the Arctic warms and late summer ice cover lessens, fewer storms will interact with the retreating ice edge. Subsequently, the largest effects shift earlier in the year, and ice loss from these storms declines after present day, suggesting intense summer cyclone impacts have reached a maximum."

Results demonstrate that the MTZ exerts a significant control on plume behavior, with some plumes ascending directly while others stall and generate secondary upwellings (“baby plumes”), which may contribute to scattered, localized magmatism. The transition from direct ascent to stagnation of the primary (“parent”) thermochemical plume is influenced by temperature, plume volume, Clapeyron slopes, and compositional heterogeneities.

We find unique interannual variations in fine dust (0.2–30 μm) flux and chemical composition between sites. The greatest average dust flux occurs during July–November (0.14–3.50 g m−2 y−1), followed by March–July (0.24–4.07 g m−2 y−1) and is lowest during November–March (0.29–2.76 g m−2 y−1). Wildfires led to significant increases in dust flux, with the highest dust flux occurring at the lowest elevation site following the 2020 Snow Creek fire. Greater enrichment of metals and depletion of rare earth elements at higher relative to lower elevations indicate spatial and temporal variability in dust sources, consistent with variations in natural and anthropogenic inputs. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) indicates that high elevation sites on average receive a higher proportion of anthropogenic dust input (64%–75%), whereas low‐elevation sites receive a higher proportion of alluvium and local rock inputs (35%–63%), particularly on the north side of the mountain.

In this study, we quantify the ST‐AT coupling strength via the correlation between 1‐day ST and the subsequent 21‐day mean AT over the summer season (June‐July‐August) in Chinese mainland. Daily ST for 1961–2016 (with 5,152 total days) is segmented into quartiles based on its anomalies, and then ST‐AT coupling strength is quantified under different quartiles. We find that the persistence of ST anomaly is prolonged in the outer quartiles (first and fourth quartiles). Correspondingly, the ST‐AT coupling strength is also relatively strong, enhancing the AT variability and predictability. Analysis of the land‐surface energy budget indicates that ST anomalies in the outer quartiles amplify AT variability through enhancing the subsequent surface outcoming longwave radiation, sensible heat flux, ground heat flux, and atmosphere boundary layer height altogether. Furthermore, the ST‐AT coupling strength shows regional variations, being stronger in arid regions and weaker in humid regions.

In the simulation results, local SBs initiated over several coast segments converge in the morning and form a front near the peninsula. As the marine atmospheric boundary layer is stably stratified, the front generates an undular bore featuring gravity waves (GW). Despite the absence of cloud signatures, the GW are detected in the LiDAR horizontal scans, providing a direct observation. The GW have a low propagation speed, a small wavelength, and their amplitude decreases with increasing distance from the coastline. The GW amplitude increases with the strengthening of the local convergence and then decreases when the local SBs merge into a regional SB. The turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) profile in the SB without GW forms a peak in the center of the SB cell. Within the GW, a significant part of the TKE calculated from simulation results is related to the GW horizontal motion. A method is proposed to extract only the part originating from the turbulent field. A peak in the TKE profile is also observed, and its intensity is 50%–100% higher near the crests than at the troughs. Analysis of the TKE budget demonstrates that, at the peak height, the shear production is positive only in the ascending phase of the GW, and that the TKE maximum at the crests mainly results from the advection process."

 Estimating landslide volumes remains challenging because of the limited availability of high-resolution terrain data. Traditional methods often rely on empirical area-to-volume conversion formulas, which introduce significant uncertainties due to terrain variability and simplified assumptions. This study proposes a deep learning framework that integrates multitemporal satellite imagery, LiDAR-derived Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), terrain attributes, and a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to simulate the DEM of Difference (DoD) and estimate landslide-induced volumetric changes. The input DEMs were resampled to 20-meter resolution for publicly available coverage exceeding 78,183 km2. A total of 2,881 map frames contained two DEM epochs, and 348 frames had three epochs, with time intervals typically ranging from 5 to 8 years. From these, 198 deep-seated landslide cases were extracted for analysis, covering approximately 7.12 km2, including 4.89 km2 of erosion area and 2.23 km2 of deposition area. The proposed model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 0.66, with F1-scores of 0.46 for erosion, 0.30 for deposition, and 0.78 for background. Volumetric estimations revealed a consistent underestimation trend, with median erosion errors of approximately − 50 % and deposition errors approaching − 100 % across the five-fold cross-validation. The framework effectively captures three-dimensional spatial distributions and enables accurate volumetric estimation without the need for post-event DEMs, offering a practical solution for data-scarce regions. Additionally, it enhances sediment volume assessments that are crucial for disaster prevention and sediment management, bridging the gap between empirical estimation and modern deep learning techniques."

 New particle formation (NPF) is a fundamental process governing atmospheric aerosol production and, consequently, climate and air quality. Despite the extensive study of acid-base interactions in nucleation, the role of organic nitrogen compounds, particularly urea, remains inadequately explored. Here, we employ quantum chemical calculations and kinetic simulations via the Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code (ACDC) to elucidate the mechanisms by which urea modulates nucleation processes. Our investigation reveals that urea, through its dual hydrogen-bonding capability and proton-accepting -C=O group, stabilizes clusters formed with methanesulfonic acid (MSA), sulfuric acid (SA), and nitric acid (NA). In binary systems, MSA-Urea clusters exhibit intermediate stability, higher than those of MSA-NH3 but lower than MSA-MA. Notably, in ternary MSA-MA-Urea systems, urea markedly enhances nucleation rates, particularly under low-temperature conditions. These results indicate that urea can compensate for the low ambient concentrations of more potent bases such as methylamine (MA), thus playing a pivotal role in atmospheric nucleation. Our findings underscore the need to incorporate organic nitrogen chemistry into atmospheric models to improve predictions of aerosol formation and its broader climatic impacts."

 Fine particulate matter with a diameter ≤2.5 μm (PM2.5) can penetrate the respiratory system and generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), posing a threat to human health. The ability to generate ROS can be represented by the oxidative potential (OP) of PM2.5 in air. Herein, PM2.5 was collected from Kyoto and Suzu, Japan, which are downwind regions in East Asia. Kyoto represents a typical densely populated urban center situated in one of Japan's plains, and Suzu is a remote coastal town. This pairing provides a representative framework for assessing OP-related health risks across different environmental settings in Japan. Composite extraction using water and methanol as solvents was used to extract the chemical components of samples, and the OP values of their water-soluble (OPWs-DTT) and methanol-soluble (OPMs-DTT) fractions were assessed via dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. The daily average of the total DTT consumption rate (OPWs-DTT + OPMs-DTT) was 436.8 ± 249.7 pmol/min/m3 in Kyoto and 141.0 ± 54.0 pmol/min/m3 in Suzu. The OPMs-DTT/OPWs-DTT ratio exceeded 30 % in both locations, indicating that methanol could effectively complement water in estimating the OP of PM2.5. Positive matrix factorization analysis revealed seven pollution sources in Kyoto and six in Suzu. Biomass burning and secondary sulfate with soil were the main OP contributors in both locations. Kyoto (inland) and Suzu (coastal) were both influenced by marine aerosols. Additionally, transboundary pollution from northeast Asia was observed in Suzu. These results highlight significant differences in the OP-relevant PM2.5 sources between locations and the variable, non-negligible contribution of water-insoluble components."

 A multiradar mosaic is a key solution to the insufficient detection range of a single radar. In the traditional grid-preprocessed mosaicking method (GPM), radar polar coordinate data are interpolated into Cartesian grids to compensate for vertically undersampled regions in radar volume scans. However, such interpolation fails to accurately reconstruct the polarization parameters in these regions. Therefore, this study presentss a polar coordinate direct-mosaicking method (PDM) for the high-density radar network in South China, which directly operates on polar coordinate data and avoids initial interpolation. Based on typical precipitation cases from May to August 2021, three key issues in the PDM are addressed: First, horizontal reflectivity (ZH) biases and differential reflectivity (ZDR) offsets are corrected; second, the number of radars in the mosaicking process is evaluated, with five radars determined to be optimal; and third, the weights of different radar data are optimized by considering vertical and horizontal distances, along with the melting layer position. Compared with the GPM, the PDM yields a more accurate representation of the melting layer, with a smaller mean height error (192 m compared with 470 m) and a more realistic estimation of thickness (661 m compared with 1507 m). It also improves the continuity of polarimetric parameters within convective core regions. The case studies indicate that the PDM enables earlier identification of ZDR columns and more accurate estimation of their heights. These results demonstrate that the PDM improves the accuracy of polarization parameter mosaics and offers potential for future applications in cloud microphysics research."

 The Indian-Burma Trough (IBT) can modulate winter precipitation across East and South Asia on various timescales, yet traditional climatological indices fail to capture its synoptic-scale variability. This study defines an event-based frequency index by objectively identifying the individual IBT events from 1981 to 2019, revealing an average of 18.3 events per winter that originate over the northern Bay of Bengal and propagate eastward along the subtropical westerlies. The interannual variability of IBT frequency is closely linked to a tripole pattern of the tropical Indo-Pacific sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA), showing significant positive correlations with the SSTAs in tropical western Indian Ocean and central-eastern Pacific Ocean, and a negative correlation with the equatorial SSTAs east of the Philippines. This SST configuration modulates IBT frequency through dual pathways. (1) Tripole-organized Walker circulation suppresses convection near the Maritime Continent, triggering a northern Indian Ocean anticyclone that enhances westerlies and cyclonic vorticity over the Bay of Bengal for IBT occurrence. (2) SST-induced meridional thermal contrasts between the tropical Indo-Pacific Ocean, particularly the Indian Ocean, and the Tibetan Plateau regulate IBT formation via thermal wind-topography interactions."
