However, the relative impacts of these two major drivers to continental weathering remain poorly constrained. The South China Block was located near the paleo‐equator under a relatively stable tectonic setting during the late Paleozoic, and therefore provides valuable insights into silicate weathering dynamics. Here, we report a 60‐Myr‐long record of the chemical index of alteration (CIA) from a continuously deposited slope succession in South China. By integrating existing records of weathering proxies, we concluded that the Hercynian orogeny played an overwhelming role in enhanced silicate weathering rates during 333–291 Ma, whereas paleotropical forest ecosystems demonstrated their significant influences on weathering patterns during their rapid expansion phase (333–316 Ma)."

The mean horizontal momentum fluxes have comparable or greater magnitudes than vertical fluxes, highlighting their essential contribution to angular momentum redistribution. The horizontal components of diffusive tendencies contribute at magnitudes comparable to the vertical components.

We conducted constant‐load shear deformation experiments on talc aggregates at 1 GPa confining pressure, 420–700°C, and <150 MPa shear stress, and derived a low temperature plasticity flow law at lithospheric conditions. We show that tectonic displacement rates can be accommodated on talc‐rich shear zones with effective viscosities as low as 1013 ${10}^{13}$ Pa·s, and that slow slip displacement rates can be accommodated by a meters‐thick talc‐dominated shear zone, with strain rates orders of magnitude greater than antigorite at the same conditions.

Even after accounting for observational uncertainty through a Monte Carlo approach, both products systematically underestimate IAV relative to water balance‐based ET, by more than 60% on average. This result is further supported by long‐term tower measurements from AmeriFlux.

This study uses multi‐century experiments with two coupled global climate models under idealized abrupt solar forcing changes of ± $\pm $1%, 2%, 4%, and 6%.

One model undergoes runaway ice growth, while the other has slower ice expansion and even transient sea ice retreat in the north Pacific. The latter is linked to the development of a strong Pacific meridional overturning circulation, which transports heat northward and slows ice growth. The model with less ice growth also exhibits greater “cold uptake into” (or heat release from) the deep ocean.

 Abrupt climate changes repeatedly occurred during glacial periods, caused by intrinsic instabilities of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) leading to Dansgaard–Oeschger events, and by the AMOC’s response to massive iceberg discharges in the North Atlantic, known as Heinrich events. This AMOC-driven millennial-scale climate variability is most prominent in the North Atlantic but also propagates to the Southern Ocean, where its imprint is particularly strong during cold (Stadial) phases featuring Heinrich events. Here we use an Earth system model to show that the qualitative differences between Heinrich Stadials and non-Heinrich Stadials seen in proxy records can be explained by a sudden start of convection in the Southern Ocean triggered by a strong weakening of the AMOC during Heinrich events. The sudden convection onset leads to rapid warming and sea ice retreat in the Southern Ocean, and the resulting ventilation of the deep ocean explains the rapid CO2 increase of ~15 ppm on centennial timescales during some Heinrich Stadials. We propose a general mechanism whereby a shutdown of convection in the North Atlantic triggers convection in the Southern Ocean—a phenomenon we refer to as a bipolar convection seesaw—which could also be activated by a potential future weakening of the AMOC.

 Evergreen conifers are key components of temperate broadleaf and mixed forests, playing a significant role in shaping ecosystem structure, function, and resilience to climate change. While very high-resolution (VHR) satellite imagery enables accurate classification of evergreen conifers and creation of reference fractional cover maps, scaling this capability to regional levels using coarser-resolution time-series satellite data remains challenging. Traditional machine learning approaches are limited by their inability to fully exploit the spatial detail of VHR imagery and capture sequential patterns in satellite time series. To address these limitations, we developed a deep learning-based framework for mapping evergreen conifer fractional cover at 30 m resolution in mountainous forests. The framework integrates a 3D U-Net model to extract spatial and spectral features from bi-temporal WorldView imagery—while mitigating terrain shadows—and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network to learn sequential dependencies from Landsat time series for regression. We compared our framework against a random forest baseline. Independent spatial and temporal transferability assessments showed that our approach achieved an R2 of 0.71 and an RMSE of 0.14, outperforming the benchmark method. To further interpret the spatial predictions, we quantified the spatial configuration of evergreen conifers using landscape metrics across areas with varying conifer cover. Our findings demonstrate the value of combining multi-source, multi-resolution imagery with deep learning models tailored for spatial and temporal complexity. This framework improves the accuracy and transferability of fractional cover mapping and offers a scalable solution for ecosystem monitoring in topographically complex forested landscapes."

However, due to the diversity and complexity of natural environments and agricultural management practices, there is currently no widely transferable mapping strategy for these crop types, particularly in regions with diverse perennial species. To address this gap, we propose a novel perennial crop mapping strategy based on intra-annual changing patterns of spectral endmembers (CPSEM). This strategy integrates a unified spectral endmember (EM) space with a harmonic model to characterize and quantify the biophysical processes and morphology of vegetation. Using Linear Spectral Mixture Analysis (LSMA), Sentinel-2 time-series data (2020−2022) were unmixed into a unified spectral EM space comprising green vegetation (GV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), soil (SL), and dark surfaces (DA), enabling the reconstruction of land surface component (LSC) trajectories at the pixel level. We developed two EM-based morphology indices to capture structural and compositional relationships among EMs. A harmonic model was applied to extract key parameters from the EM fractions and EM-based morphology indices, representing vegetation biophysical processes. Finally, a Random Forest model was used to classify perennial crop types. The results show that perennial crops of the same type exhibited similar biophysical processes and morphology, while distinct types exhibited substantial differences. Our method effectively maps perennial crop types across diverse environments and planting conditions, achieving classification accuracies of 87.27 %–90.91 %. Compared to traditional spectral-based methods, the proposed strategy improves perennial crop classification by 1.7 %–3.9 % and overall vegetation classification by 5.3 %–8.4 %. Additionally, this strategy effectively addressed the limitations inherent in traditional phenological indices for accurately classifying perennial crops, demonstrating robust performance even in complex classification scenarios. Incorporating synthetic aperture radar (SAR) features did not further improve classification accuracy. This strategy enhances interpretability and transferability through the use of a unified spectral EM space and detailed biophysical characterization. Thus, the CPSEM-based perennial crop mapping strategy provides a robust and scalable approach for accurately identifying perennial crops and land cover at large scales."

 In the context of recent, highly destructive conflicts in Gaza and Ukraine, reliable estimates of building damage are essential for an informed public discourse, human rights monitoring, and humanitarian aid provision. Given the contentious nature of conflict damage assessment, these estimates must be fully reproducible, explainable, and derived from open access data. This paper introduces a new method for building damage detection– the Pixel-Wise T-Test (PWTT)– that satisfies these conditions. Using a combination of freely-available synthetic aperture radar imagery and statistical change detection, the PWTT generates accurate conflict damage estimates across a wide area at regular time intervals. Accuracy is assessed using an original dataset of over 2 million labeled building footprints spanning 30 cities across Palestine, Ukraine, Sudan, Syria, and Iraq. Despite being simple and lightweight, the algorithm achieves building-level accuracy statistics (AUC=0.87 in the full sample) rivaling state of the art methods that use deep learning and high resolution imagery. The workflow is open source and deployed entirely within the Google Earth Engine environment, allowing for the generation of interactive Battle Damage Dashboards for Ukraine and Gaza that update in near-real time, enabling the public and humanitarian practitioners to immediately get estimates of damaged buildings in a given area."

Pinto;Andreas Christen,Is satellite land surface temperature an appropriate proxy for intra-urban variability of daytime heat stress?,"•Can land surface temperature (LST) be used to predict urban heat stress (UTCI)? •Extensive comparison of Landsat LST and modelled microscale UTCI at pedestrian level. •LST poorly represents UTCI in dense urban areas, especially during heat waves. •LST-UTCI relationship nonlinear and inconsistent, with large intra-urban variability. •Models considering urban morphology and land cover outperform LST-only models. 
 Adaptation of urban areas to heat extremes requires adequate information on intra-urban variability patterns of outdoor thermal comfort (OTC). Remotely sensed Land Surface Temperatures (LST) are often used to map heat hotspots in urban areas. However, this approach has limitations as LST and OTC are influenced by different physical processes. This study investigates the relationship between satellite-derived Landsat Level-2 LST data and pedestrian-level Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) predictions from a microscale thermal comfort model across Freiburg, Germany. A cluster analysis of the differences is performed, and multiple random forest models are trained using different combinations of LST, ERA5-Land reanalysis, and local-specific urban morphology and land cover data as predictors.While a linear relationship between LST and UTCI exists under non-heat stress conditions (UTCI <26 °C) and in vegetated or open areas, this becomes non-linear and spatially inconsistent under heat stress, particularly in compact urban environments. The growing divergence between LST and UTCI along an urbanization gradient ranging from −1 K to +9 K highlights the significant impact of urban morphology on the LST-UTCI relationship, leading to substantial intra-urban variability. This variability appears to persist even within similar urban typologies (e.g. LCZs/clusters), with only limited reduction in spatial variability. Random forest models confirm these findings: those based solely on LST or global-scale predictors struggle to capture intra-urban UTC variability, while models incorporating local urban morphology and land cover data outperform them (even without LST input). This suggests that the contribution of LST to neighborhood-scale UTC modeling is limited under certain conditions and environments."

 Satellite observations offer a unique way of monitoring the spatial distribution, vertical structure and temporal variation of volcanic sulfur dioxide (SO2) plumes. In this study, we use observations from the Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS) constellation on board China's FengYun-3 (FY-3) meteorological satellites flying in three different sun-synchronous orbits, including dawn-dusk, mid-morning, and afternoon orbits. The constellation provides six global coverages (roughly every 4-h) each day, with equatorial overpass times at 5:30 am/pm for FY-3E, 10:00 am/pm for FY-3F, and 2:00 am/pm for FY-3D. We retrieve SO2 total column and layer height from the Ruang volcanic eruptions in April 2024. The retrievals show consistency among the different HIRAS and are highly correlated with IASI and TROPOMI observations. The e-folding time of the volcanic SO2 mass is estimated to be 9.0 ± 2.8 days, which is representative of a plume in the Upper Troposphere-Lower Stratosphere (UTLS). Lastly, we apply the methods to the eruptions of the Russia's Sheveluch volcano in November 2024 at high latitudes and show the effectiveness and high consistency among the HIRAS sensors in detecting the SO2 signal.

 The green fractional vegetation cover (FVC) is an essential parameter used to characterize the spatial pattern of vegetation coverage. Remote sensing provides the most efficient way to estimate FVC at regional and global scales. However, existing FVC-estimation approaches based on remote sensing fail to achieve high accuracy, broad applicability, and ease of use simultaneously, thus limiting their practical implementation. Based on the unique spectral shapes of green vegetation and soil within the visible to near-infrared spectrum (400–1000 nm), we proposed the vegetation coverage index (VCI), which is a novel index for directly indicating the FVC. VCI utilizes the spectral reflectance from the blue, green, red, and near-infrared bands to quantify the vegetation signal and soil signal as 1 and 0, respectively, and then establishes a quantitative relationship with FVC through the linear spectral mixing model. The performance of VCI in FVC estimation was first tested using simulated datasets generated by the radiative transfer model LESS under varying factors, including the vegetation structure, leaf area index, soil background, and solar zenith angle. It was then validated at 15 in-situ test sites in China, using UAV-derived reference FVC and Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data. These sites covered 10 vegetation and land cover types, 4 phenological phases, and 10 soil types. Additionally, VCI was compared against existing FVC products across another 40 in-situ comparative sites in China, using Landsat-8/9, Sentinel-3, and MODOCGA data at spatial resolutions of 30 m, 300 m, and 1000 m, respectively. Simulation results demonstrated that VCI performed comparably or slightly better than the dimidiate pixel model (DPM), reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) by 0.21 % to 14.42 %. Validation at 15 test sites showed that during the green-up to peak phase, when pixels are primarily composed of green vegetation and soil, VCI and DPM exhibited similar average accuracy (VCI: RMSE = 0.13; DPM: RMSE = 0.12). In contrast, during the peak to dormancy phase, with the presence of non-photosynthetic vegetation, VCI (RMSE = 0.11) clearly outperformed DPM (RMSE = 0.21), achieving a 46.8 % reduction in RMSE. At the 40 comparative sites, VCI yielded RMSE comparable to the MultiVI FVC product and outperformed the GEOV3 FVC and GLASS FVC products, with RMSE reductions of 20.00 % and 30.77 %, respectively. VCI provides a simple and efficient approach for FVC estimation through basic spectral band calculations. Moreover, VCI demonstrates broad applicability across widely used remote sensing sensors, including the Sentinel-2 Multispectral Instrument, Sentinel-3 Ocean and Land Colour Instrument, Landsat-8 Operational Land Imager, and Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, showing strong potential for FVC monitoring across various spatial and temporal scales."

 Semantic segmentation, as a basic tool for remote sensing image understanding, plays a vital role in many Earth Observation (EO) applications. Nowadays, accurate semantic segmentation of remote sensing images remains a challenge due to the complex spatial–temporal scenes and multi-scale geo-objects. Driven by the wave of deep learning (DL), CNN– and Transformer-based semantic segmentation methods have been explored widely, and these two architectures both revealed the importance of multi-scale feature representation for strengthening semantic information of geo-objects. However, multi-scale feature fusion often comes with the semantic redundancy issue due to homogeneous semantic contents in pyramid features. To handle this issue, we propose a novel Mamba-based segmentation network, namely PyramidMamba. Specifically, we design a plug-and-play Mamba-based decoder, which develops a dense spatial pyramid pooling (DSPP) to encode rich multi-scale semantic features and a pyramid fusion Mamba (PFM) to reduce semantic redundancy in feature fusion. Ablation experiments illustrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in enhancing multi-scale feature representation as well as the great potential for real-time semantic segmentation. Moreover, our PyramidMamba yields state-of-the-art performance on four public datasets, i.e. the OpenEarthMap (70.8% mIoU), ISPRS Vaihingen (84.8% mIoU) and Potsdam (88.0% mIoU) datasets, and the LoveDA (54.8% mIoU) dataset."

 The association between long-term air pollution exposure and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains inconclusive. A total of 133,261 participants from the UK Biobank, a prospective cohort were included. Incident IBD cases were ascertained from the administrative database of the National Health Services. Air pollution exposure (PM2.5, PM10, NO2 and NOx) at participants’ residential addresses was estimated by spatio-temporal models. Cox regression models were used to assess the associations between air pollution and IBD. Metabolic signatures were constructed by summing selected plasma metabolites associated with air pollution through elastic net regression. Afterwards, mediation analyses were conducted to investigate the potential mediation of metabolic signatures on the air pollution-IBD associations. During a mean follow-up of 11.61 years (SD: 1.78), 824 incident IBD cases were identified. Long-term exposure to PM2.5, PM10, NO2, and NOx was positively associated with IBD risk: hazard ratios were 1.019 (95 % CI: 0.933, 1.112), 1.033 (95 % CI: 0.942, 1.132), 1.112 (95 % CI: 1.026, 1.227), and 1.121 (95 % CI: 1.028, 1.223), respectively. As PM2.5 and PM10 were not significantly associated with incident IBD, subsequent metabolic analysis was only conducted for NO2 and NOx. The metabolic signatures for NO2 and NOx included 26 and 18 metabolites (mostly related to amino acids, glucose metabolism, and lipid metabolism), respectively. The significant associations of NO2 and NOx with incident IBD were explained by their metabolic signatures (mediation: 10.13 % (95 % CI: 4.56 %, 42.87 %) and 9.17 % (95 % CI: 3.87 %, 38.64 %), respectively).
