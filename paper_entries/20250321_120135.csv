10.5194/acp-25-3347-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了利用武汉地区Ka波段连续毫米波雷达估算对流边界层高度（CBLH）的演变。论文通过分析雷达观测的垂直速度方差，并与激光雷达和无线电探空仪的数据进行对比，验证了毫米波雷达在不同天气条件下监测CBLH的有效性。研究结果表明，毫米波雷达能够准确捕捉CBLH的日变化，并且受沙尘和厚云的影响较小。该研究对于理解对流边界层的动态过程以及改进空气质量监测和污染物扩散模型具有重要意义。,"['convective boundary layer height', 'Ka-band millimeter wave cloud radar', 'vertical velocity variance', 'lidar', 'radiosonde', 'atmospheric dynamics', 'air quality', 'pollutant dispersion']",Zirui Zhang;Kaiming Huang;Fan Yi;Wei Cheng;Fuchao Liu;Jian Zhang;Yue Jia,Technical note: Evolution of convective boundary layer height estimated by Ka-band continuous millimeter wave radar at Wuhan in central China,"The height of the convective boundary layer (CBLH) is related to our health due to its crucial role in pollutant dispersion. The variance of vertical velocity from millimeter wave cloud radar (MMCR) can accurately capture the diurnal evolution of the CBLH, due to a small blind range and less impact by the residual layer. The CBLH is affected by radiation, humidity, cloud, and precipitation; thus, the MMCR is suitable for monitoring the CBLH, owing to its observation capability in various weather conditions. 
 Using the vertical velocity (w) observed by a Ka-band millimeter wave cloud radar (MMCR) at Wuhan, we investigate the evolution of the convective boundary layer height (CBLH) based on a specified threshold of vertical velocity variance (σw2). The CBLHs from the MMCR w in the selected durations are compared with those estimated by the lidar range-corrected signal (RCS) and radiosonde temperature based on different algorithms, showing good agreement with each other. Although these algorithms are based on different dynamic and thermodynamic effects, the diurnal evolution of the CBLH from MMCR is generally consistent with that from lidar, except for a few hours post-sunrise and pre-sunset due to the influence of the aerosol residual layer on the lidar RCS. Meanwhile, the CBLH from MMCR shows less variation with the occurrence of sand and dust and a swifter response for thick clouds relative to that from lidar. In this case, σw2 of the MMCR w identifies the CBLH based on a dynamic effect, which can accurately capture the diurnal evolution of the CBLH compared with that from the change in long-time-mixing aerosol concentration. The monthly and seasonal features of the CBLH at Wuhan are revealed via the MMCR measurement. Hence, considering that the MMCR is capable of continuous observation in various weather conditions, the MMCR w with high resolution can be applied for monitoring the evolution of the CBLH in different atmospheric conditions, which is helpful for improving our comprehensive understanding of the convective boundary layer (CBL) and dynamic processes in the CBL."

We analyzed the size-resolved characteristics of hygroscopicity and volatility, the relationship between hygroscopic and volatile properties, and the hygroscopicity of heated submicron aerosols. 
 The hygroscopicity and volatility of submicron ambient aerosol particles with diameters of 50, 80, 110, and 150 nm and the hygroscopicity of their non-volatile cores were measured using a volatility hygroscopicity tandem differential mobility analyzer (VH-TDMA) system at a relative humidity of 90 % and a thermal denuder temperature of 270 °C from 11 October to 6 November 2023 in Beijing. The mean hygroscopic growth factor (HGF) for particles of 50, 80, 100, and 150 nm diameter was 1.15 ± 0.07, 1.24 ± 0.08, 1.30 ± 0.09, and 1.36 ± 0.10, respectively, while the mean volatile shrink factor (VSF) was 0.51 ± 0.05, 0.55 ± 0.04, 0.56 ± 0.05, and 0.56 ± 0.07, respectively. Both the HGF probability density function (HGF PDF) and the VSF probability density function (VSF PDF) for all selected particle sizes exhibited a pronounced bimodal distribution, indicating that the particles were primarily in an external mixing state. Hygroscopicity was observed to increase with particle size in both clean and pollution periods, while volatility decreased slightly with particle size during the clean period, without an apparent trend during the pollution period. A positive correlation was identified between hygroscopicity and volatility, as well as between the number fraction of nearly hydrophobic (NH) and non-volatile (NV) particles. Furthermore, this study measured the HGF of the non-volatile core (HGFcore) of submicron ambient aerosol particles heated at 270 °C and derived the HGF of the volatile coating (HGFcoating). The mean HGFcoating for particles of 50, 80, 100, and 150 nm diameter was 1.17 ± 0.08, 1.27 ± 0.10, 1.35 ± 0.10, and 1.41 ± 0.10, respectively, which is 2 % to 7 % higher than the mean HGF for the same particle sizes.  The mean HGFcore for particles of 50, 80, 100, and 150 nm diameter was 1.08 ± 0.03, 1.07 ± 0.03, 1.07 ± 0.03, and 1.09 ± 0.04, respectively. The HGFcore values were increased when the air mass passed over or originated from the Bohai Sea."

An exposure scaling factor is defined, allowing  regional-scale simulations to be corrected to evaluate population exposure. Urban heterogeneities strongly influence NO2, black carbon, and ultrafine particles but less strongly PM2.5. 
 This study focuses on mapping the concentrations of pollutants of interest to health (NO2, black carbon (BC), PM2.5, and particle number concentration (PNC)) down to the street scale to represent the population exposure to outdoor concentrations at residences. Simulations are performed over the area of Greater Paris with the WRF-CHIMERE/MUNICH/SSH-aerosol chain, using either the top-down inventory EMEP or the bottom-up inventory Airparif, with correction of the traffic flow. The concentrations of the pollutants are higher in streets than in the regional-scale urban background, due to the strong influence of road traffic emissions locally. Model-to-observation comparisons were performed at urban background and traffic stations and evaluated using two performance criteria from the literature. For BC, harmonized equivalent BC (eBC) concentrations were estimated from concomitant measurements of eBC and elemental carbon. Using the bottom-up inventory with corrected road traffic flow, the strictest criteria are met for NO2, eBC, PM2.5, and PNC. Using the EMEP top-down inventory, the strictest criteria are also met for NO2, eBC, and PM2.5, but errors tend to be larger than with the bottom-up inventory for NO2, eBC, and PNC. Using the top-down inventory, the concentrations tend to be lower along the streets than those simulated using the bottom-up inventory, especially for NO2 concentrations, resulting in fewer urban heterogeneities. The impact of the size distribution of non-exhaust emissions was analysed at both regional and local scales, and it is higher in heavy-traffic streets. To assess exposure, a French database detailing the number of inhabitants in each building was used. The population-weighted concentration (PWC) was calculated by weighting populations by the outdoor concentrations to which they are exposed at the precise location of their home. An exposure scaling factor (ESF) was determined for each pollutant to estimate the ratio needed to correct urban background concentrations in order to assess exposure. The average ESF in Paris and the Paris ring road is higher than 1 for NO2, eBC, PM2.5, and PNC because the concentrations simulated at the local scale in streets are higher than those modelled at the regional scale. It indicates that the Parisian population exposure is underestimated using regional-scale concentrations. Although this underestimation is low for PM2.5, with an ESF of 1.04, it is very high for NO2 (1.26), eBC (between 1.22 and 1.24), and PNC (1.12). This shows that urban heterogeneities are important to be considered in order to represent the population exposure to NO2, eBC, and PNC but less so for PM2.5."

We analyse changes in waves and infrasound characteristics related to streamers using continuous Doppler soundings and arrays of microbarometers in Czechia. Ground measurements using infrasound arrays showed that gravity wave propagation azimuths were more random during streamers than during calm conditions. Measurements in the ionosphere during streamers did not differ from those expected for the given time. 
 For a better understanding of atmospheric dynamics, it is very important to know the general conditions (dynamics and chemistry) of the atmosphere. Planetary waves (PWs) are global-scale waves, which are well-known as main drivers of the large-scale weather patterns in mid-latitudes on timescales from several days up to weeks in the troposphere. When PWs break, they often cut pressure cells off the jet stream. A specific example is so-called streamer events, which occur predominantly in the lower stratosphere at mid-latitudes and high latitudes. For streamer events, we check whether there are any changes in gravity wave (GW) or infrasound characteristics related to these events in ionospheric and surface measurements (continuous Doppler soundings, two arrays of microbarometers) in the Czech Republic.Phenomena in infrasound arrival parameters undoubtedly related to streamer events were not identified in observations of two stations located in Central Europe. Simulations of infrasound propagation show influences of the streamer events on the waveguide formed near the tropopause. Microbarom propagation is influenced by the tropopause waveguide in a limited azimuth sector and at limited distances. Due to the typical occurrence of the streamer events over the North Atlantic, infrasound stations in western Europe can be of particular interest for future studies of streamer event signatures in infrasound arrivals. Arrivals to Central Europe are through the waveguide formed between the ground and the upper stratosphere. The upper-stratosphere waveguide is not influenced by the streamer events.Supplementary ground-based measurements of GW using the WBCI array in the troposphere showed that GW propagation azimuths were more random during streamer and streamer-like events compared to those observed during calm conditions. GW propagation characteristics observed in the ionosphere by continuous Doppler soundings during streamer events did not differ from those expected for the given time period."

The aim of this paper is to make this valuable dataset available to help decipher the local and global influences of anthropogenic activities in a world increasingly affected by climate change. 
 This article presents a 45-year data series (from 1978 to 2023) acquired under the IGA (Impact des Grands Aménagements in French, Impacts of Major Developments in English) program conducted by IFREMER for EDF (Électricité de France, the French multinational electricity utility company). The IGA program was established to monitor the ecological and environmental quality of the coastal area surrounding the Gravelines Nuclear Power Plant (GNPP) located in the South Bight of the North Sea. The main objective of this program is to assess medium- and long-term environmental evolution by providing the means to identify possible changes in local marine habitats. Since 1978, the IGA program has measured key parameters, including temperature, salinity, nutrient concentrations, oxygen levels, chlorophyll-a concentrations, and the abundance of phytoplankton and zooplankton species. These measurements have been taken at different sampling stations around the GNPP, including the Canal d'amenée sampling station, for which hydrological and biological characteristics are considered representative of the broader coastal area of the South Bight of the North Sea. This data paper provides an overview of the main statistical characteristics of the time series (available at https://doi.org/10.17882/102656, Lefebvre et al., 2024), including long-term trends and shift analysis. Despite the importance and length of this dataset, one of the longest available for this region, its application in advancing knowledge of hydrological and biological processes has been surprisingly limited. The aim of this paper is to make this valuable dataset available to the scientific community, stakeholders, and society to help decipher the local and global influences of anthropogenic activities in a world increasingly affected by climate change. Since all the main statistics and patterns are still available thanks to our analysis, users should be able to use these data and combine them with other sources (in situ, satellite, and modeling) in order to dive into deeper analyses and investigate new key scientific challenges and more specific ones."

 The continuous development of remote sensing techniques provides ample opportunities for high-resolution land-cover mapping. Although global 10-m land-cover products have made considerable progress over past few years, their simple classification system makes it difficult to meet the needs of diverse applications. In this work, we propose a hierarchical land-cover mapping framework to produce a novel global 10-m land-cover dataset with a fine classification system (called GLC_FCS10) using Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 time-series observations from 2023. First, the globally distributed training samples are hierarchically obtained from multisource prior products after applying a series of refinements. Then, a combination of hierarchical land-cover mapping, local adaptive modeling, and multisource features is used to produce land-cover maps for each 5 × 5 geographical tile. Next, using 56121 globally distributed validation samples and a third-party validation dataset (LCMAP_Val), the GLC_FCS10 is assessed. The GLC_FCS10 achieves an overall accuracy of 83.16 % and a kappa coefficient of 0.789 globally and an overall accuracy of 85.09 % in the United States. Meanwhile, comparisons with five released 10- or 30-m land-cover products also demonstrate that GLC_FCS10 has higher accuracy and captures more diverse land-cover information than three of the released global 10-m land-cover products. In summary, the novel GLC_FCS10 land-cover maps can provide important support for high-resolution land-cover related research and applications. The GLC_FCS10 can be freely access via https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14729665 (Liu and Zhang, 2025)."

The changes in the physical and chemical characteristics of aged MNPs significantly influence their environmental behavior by releasing additives, forming byproducts, and adsorbing contaminants. However, a systematic review is lacking on the effects of aged MNPs on ecological and human health regarding the increasing but scattered studies and results. This Review first summarizes the unique characteristics of aged MNPs and methods for quantifying their aging degree. Then we focused on the potential impacts on organisms, ecosystems, and human health, including the “Trojan horse” under real environmental conditions. Through combining meta-analysis and analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model, we demonstrated that, compared to virgin MNPs, aged MNPs would result in biomass decrease and oxidative stress increase on organisms and lead to total N/P decrease and greenhouse gas emissions increase on ecosystems while causing cell apoptosis, antioxidant system reaction, and inflammation in human health. Within the framework of ecological and human health risk assessment, we used the risk quotient (RQ) and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBK) models as examples to illustrate the importance of considering aging characteristics and the degree of MNPs in the process of data acquisition, model building, and formula evaluation. Given the ecological and health risks of aged MNPs, our urgent call for more studies of aged MNPs is to understand the potential hazards of MNPs in real-world environments."

However, excessive use of Fe3O4 NPs may pose unassessed ecological risks in soils, particularly concerning the regulatory role of two most common surface modifiers as polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) and citric acid (CA) which influence the interactions of NPs with soil organisms and potential toxicity. This study evaluated the nanotoxic effects of bare Fe3O4 NPs (B–Fe3O4 NPs), CA-Fe3O4 NPs, and PVP-Fe3O4 NPs on Eisenia fetida in soil ecosystems. After 7 days of exposure, the B-, CA- and PVP-Fe3O4 NPs decreased the weight of the earthworms, caused oxidative stress and tissue damage. Functional Fe3O4 NPs showed increased accumulation in earthworms while alleviating oxidative stress and homeostatic imbalance by accelerating the activation of related enzymes. Moreover, hyperspectral and pathological observations indicated that CA and PVP modifications effectively alleviated tissue damage caused by Fe3O4 NPs via an improvement in NP biocompatibility, dispersion and stability evidenced by the levels of inositol metabolites, which has been upregulated more significantly by B–Fe3O4 NPs. Significant metabolic disturbances were observed, indicating that functional modifications forced earthworms to adjust amino acid metabolism and consume more energy to detoxify and repair damage. This work supplements the toxic assessment of Fe3O4 NPs and provides crucial insights for optimizing the safety of NPs through functionalization."

However, most of the existing descriptors are based on static molecular properties and show limited correlation with reactivity and mechanisms. In this work, we proposed descriptors based on molecular thermodynamic state changes during reactions.

Multiscale characterizations elucidate the DOTP mechanism in this system, explaining ΔE2e1p’s superior performance and highlighting the critical role of pollutant proton transfer. A comprehensive analysis of the new and existing descriptors reveals the limitations of previous descriptors and the influence of the substrate range on applicability. Additionally, ΔE2e1p demonstrates broad applicability across diverse HCPO systems and practicality in real water matrices.

Granular sludge (size >0.2 mm) demonstrated a robust capacity to resist immigration effects from competing immigrants, whereas flocculent sludge (size <0.2 mm) was more susceptible. Importantly, flocculent sludge harbored functional microbial groups such as active nitrifiers and fermentative polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs) belonging to Ca. Phosphoribacter, while granular sludge enriched for active conventional PAOs such as Ca. Accumulibacter. These findings provide valuable insights for engineers to design and operate AGS systems by optimizing microbial aggregate sizes and emphasizing the importance of influent microbial characterization in the design of wastewater treatment plants to enhance the functionality and activity of AGS systems."

PET-hydrolyzing enzymes (PHEs) such as IsPETase and variants like FAST-PETase demonstrate promising PET depolymerization capabilities at ambient temperatures and can be utilized to recycle and upcycle plastic waste. Whole-cell biocatalysts displaying PHEs on their surface offer high efficiency, reusability, and stability for PET depolymerization. However, their efficacy in fully breaking down PET is hindered by the necessity of two enzymes: PETase and MHETase. Current whole-cell systems either  display only one enzyme or struggle with performance when displaying larger enzymes such as the MHETase–PETase chimera. We developed a Saccharomyces cerevisiae-based whole-cell biocatalyst for complete depolymerization of PET into its constituent monomers with no accumulation of intermediate products. Leveraging a cellulosome-inspired trifunctional protein scaffoldin displayed on the yeast surface, we co-immobilized FAST-PETase and MHETase, forming a multi-enzyme cluster. This whole-cell biocatalyst achieved complete PET depolymerization at 30 °C, yielding 4.95 mM terephthalic acid (TPA) when tested on a PET film. Furthermore, we showed improved PET depolymerization ability by binding FAST-PETase at multiple sites on the scaffoldin. The whole cells had the added advantage of retained activity over multiple reusability cycles. This breakthrough in complete PET depolymerization marks a step toward a circular plastic economy."

However, regardless of whether AERs are regenerable or single use, the disposal of end-of-life AERs presents significant challenges. Conventional waste management strategies, such as landfill disposal and incineration, are increasingly under scrutiny and may face impending bans due to environmental concerns. This study introduces a nonthermal, solvent-free process for the effective destruction of PFAS on AERs by co-milling piezoelectric boron nitride (BN) powders with contaminated AERs and stainless steel (SS) balls. The approach achieved complete PFOS destruction in two types of AERs (PFA694E and AmberLite IRA 67), with near-quantitative (∼100%) defluorination observed in the treatment of PFA694E AER. Comprehensive targeted PFAS analysis and suspect screening analysis of transformation products (TPs) elucidated the reaction mechanisms and confirmed that the functional groups of AERs did not participate in the reaction. The process’s effectiveness was further validated in treating field-collected single-use AERs (PFA694 and AmberLite PSR2 Plus) contaminated with PFAS mixtures of varying chain lengths and head groups. After treatment, PFAS levels on the AERs were reduced to below the nanogram per gram detection limits, and no PFAS release was observed in standard leaching tests."

This study provides year-round speciation and source identification for PM2.5-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in the East African city of Nairobi. The ∑19PAH concentrations ranged between 5–20 ng m–3 with an average of 11 ± 4 ng m–3 in the urban background and were dominated by heavy molecular weight compounds (four or more fused benzene rings). The PAH loadings in Nairobi stayed rather invariant through the year with limited seasonal variability. The observed PAH concentrations in Nairobi were higher than those reported in cities with more stringent emission controls. Furthermore, the calculated benzo[a]pyrene equivalent in Nairobi’s background atmosphere exceeded 1 ng m–3, signaling a severe health concern. Source identification using molecular diagnostic ratio analysis suggests the PAH in Nairobi are predominantly of pyrogenic (combustion of fossil fuels and biomass burning) origins. Overall, this study provides a baseline reference data set for future local and regional studies and contributes to scientific underpinnings to motivate the urgent need to develop emission control initiatives in Nairobi, among other rapidly growing African cities."

However, the changing role of the two drivers in a warming climate remains unclear. Using large‐ensemble climate model simulations and Ridge Regression, this study quantifies the changing relative importance of the two drivers from 1861 to 2100. Up until recent years, low September sea ice largely enhanced sea ice growth via a negative feedback, as open water allows more freezing when the water is still cold enough. However, this negative feedback weakens with rising Arctic air and ocean temperatures that increasingly limit and delay sea ice freezing. Atmospheric circulation will relatively play an increasing role in driving sea ice growth in the next few decades. These findings are useful in guiding future studies for improving Arctic sea ice seasonal forecasts and long‐term projections."

These indicated that the penetration electric field was rapidly and long‐lastingly canceled by shielding electric field, which had rarely been reported. In this period, the enhanced Region‐2 field‐aligned current shifted to mid‐latitudes and the enhanced sunward convection penetrated to low‐latitudes, indicating the shielding layer might closely move to Earth.

Petty,Impacts of Terrain Slope and Surface Roughness Variations on Turbulence Generation in the Nighttime Stable Boundary Layer,"Terrain slopes with and without upslope large surface roughness impact downstream shear‐generated turbulence differently in the nighttime stable boundary layer (SBL). These differences can be identified through variations in the relationship between turbulence and wind speed at a given height, known as the HOckey STick (HOST) transition, as compared to the HOST relationship over flat terrain. The transport of cold surface air from elevated uniform terrain reduces downstream air temperature not much air stratification. As terrain slope rises, the increasing cold and heavy air enhances downstream hydrostatic imbalance, resulting in increasing turbulence for a given wind speed. That is, the rate of turbulence increase with wind speed from downslope flow is independent of terrain slope. Upslope large surface roughness elements enhance vertical turbulent mixing, elevating cold surface air from the terrain. Horizontal transport of this elevated, cold, turbulent air layer reduces the downstream upper warm air temperature. Benefiting from the progressive reduction of downstream stable stratification with increasing height in the SBL, wind shear can effectively generate strong turbulence. In addition to the turbulence enhancement from the cold downslope flow, the rate of turbulence increase with wind speed is elevated. This study demonstrates key physical mechanisms for turbulence generation captured by the HOST relationship. It also highlights the influence of terrain features on these mechanisms through deviations from the HOST relationship over flat terrain."

Although analog signals of the detectors were severely saturated, timing of the five gamma ray pulses were well constrained and compared with radio observations of discharges. We detected four slow positive radio pulses associated with the first four gamma ray pulses. Another radio pulse candidate associated with the fifth gamma ray pulse was also seen. The polarity of the slow pulses suggests that the TGF were upward directed, and our detectors were observing it backward. This is the first detection of this kind on ground. The radio slow pulses were located in a thunderstorm cell located 3–6 km south from a nearly simultaneously on‐going ascending negative stepped leader emerged in another thunderstorm cell.

We dynamically downscale two contemporary summers, one dry and one moist, relatively to their respective seasonal‐mean specific humidity across AZ. Urban expansion impacts on HS are assessed by performing two identical simulations for each contemporary summer using different land use‐land cover representations: one simulation with the current urban landscape, and one simulation replaces the urban cover with the region's most representative MODIS vegetation type. Climate change impacts on HS are evaluated by performing four additional future simulations, two via dynamical downscaling of relatively dry conditions (one summer under the RCP8.5 and one summer under the RCP4.5 emissions pathways) and two of relatively moist conditions (one summer for each RCP pathway). The selection of future summers is based on their respective seasonal‐mean specific humidity across AZ from an end‐of‐century analysis of 2086–2100. We characterize impacts on HS by examining changes in near‐surface air temperature, Heat Index (HI), and the Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) across urban areas under dry and moist warm conditions. Our results demonstrate that climate change impacts on HS are not well captured by examining only the projected changes in air temperature and are dependent on the bioclimate index considered. Additionally, we apply a new human heat balance (HHB) approach to evaluate the number of hours per day that an acclimatized and non‐acclimatized person would experience uncompensable HS and compare these results (with the number of hours per day) that we obtain when the HI and UTCI surpass commonly used thresholds considered “dangerous” and of “extreme heat stress”, respectively. The HI and UTCI overestimate the number of hours per day that a healthy, acclimatized person would experience uncompensable HS and underestimate dangerous HS for a non‐acclimatized person under both dry and moist conditions, emphasizing that standard metrics may not produce the most informative physiological estimates of HS."
10.1029/2024GH001245,True,GeoHealth,该研究论文探讨了韩国不同地区长期暴露于颗粒物（PM10和PM2.5）空气污染与心血管疾病（CVD）发病率之间关联的空间差异，并试图找出导致这些差异的区域特征。研究使用了韩国国家健康保险服务-国家样本队列中的数据，评估了个体在地区层面的长期暴露情况，并使用时间依赖的Cox比例风险模型来探索PM暴露与CVD发病率之间的关系。研究结果表明，不同地区PM对CVD发病率的风险比存在显著差异，城市化程度和排放源与总体CVD的风险比显著相关。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其对PM10和PM2.5的长期暴露评估，以及对空气质量的监测和预测模型的使用，都与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为这些技术可以提供大范围、长时间序列的空气污染数据，为类似的研究提供支持。,"['PM10', 'PM2.5', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Long-term Exposure Assessment', 'Exposure Prediction Models']",Ok‐Jin Kim;Sun‐Young Kim,Regional Difference in the Association Between Long‐Term PM and Cardiovascular Disease Incidence and Potential Determinants of the Difference,"While short‐term studies of the adverse effects of air pollution have found regional differences, there has been insufficient evidence from long‐term studies. This study investigated the spatial variation of the association between long‐term exposure to particulate matter (PM) air pollution and cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and their relevant regional characteristics. We selected 155,017 adults who have lived over 13 years in each of the 16 regions of South Korea from the National Health Insurance Service‐National Sample Cohort. We assessed the individual long‐term exposure as a 5‐year average concentration at district‐level residential addresses estimated by previously validated exposure prediction models. We applied time‐dependent Cox‐proportional hazard models to explore the spatial variation of long‐term PM exposure's association with CVD incidence. After adjusting for individual‐level characteristics, we estimated the region‐specific hazard ratios (HRs) of incident CVD per 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10 and PM2.5. Then, we calculated the correlation coefficients between region‐specific HRs and 80 regional attributes in 13 categories across 16 regions to identify the related regional characteristics. Region‐specific HRs of CVD incidence for PM showed considerable variation in magnitude and direction across 16 regions. HRs of PM10 and PM2.5 were higher in major urban areas and lower in rural areas. Urbanicity and emission sources exhibited significant correlations with HRs of overall CVD. Our findings offer an opportunity to explore regional characteristics that derive the difference in air pollution‐associated health effects and help us provide guidance to target specific characteristics to avoid the adverse health effects of air pollution."

 The discovery of superconductivity in the Ba-La-Cu-O system (the cuprate) in the 30 K range marked a significant breakthrough, which inspired extensive explorations of oxide based layered superconductors to identify electron pairing with higher critical temperatures (Tc)1. Despite recent observations of superconductivity in nickel-oxide-based compounds (the nickelates), evidence of Cooper pairing above 30 K in a system that is isostructural to the cuprates, but without copper, at ambient pressure and without lattice compression, has remained elusive2–5. Here, we report superconductivity with a Tc approaching 40 K under ambient pressure in the d9-x hole-doped, late rare-earth infinite-layer nickel oxide (Sm-Eu-Ca-Sr)NiO2 thin films with negligible lattice compression, supported by observations of a zero resistance state at 31 K and the Meissner effect. The material can be synthesized with essentially no Ruddlesden–Popper type structural defects, exhibiting ultralow resistivity of ~ 0.01 mΩ∙cm with a residual-resistivity-ratio of up to 10. Our findings demonstrate the potential of achieving high-temperature superconductivity using strongly correlated d-electron metal oxides beyond copper as the building blocks for superconductivity, offering a promising platform for further exploration and understanding of high-temperature Cooper pairing."

 Small modular reactors are the nuclear fission reactors with electric power output less than 300 MWe. To apply the enhanced safety of small modular reactors to build large-scale nuclear plants with any desired power ratings, the multi-modular scheme is recommended to be adopted, where multiple reactor modules are utilized to drive the common load equipment for power generation or cogeneration. The feasibility of multi-modular scheme is not verified until several plant-wide tests were carried out recently on the high temperature gas-cooled reactor pebble-bed module (HTR-PM) nuclear plant. The HTR-PM plant consists of two inherently safe nuclear reactors of 200 MWt, adopts the scheme of two reactor modules driving a common steam turbine, and operates commercially since December 6, 2023. In this paper, the responses of key process variables of HTR-PM plant in the tests of power ramping, turbine trip and reactor trip are provided, and the related multi-modular coordinated control method is also proposed. This result manifests the feasibility of multi-modular scheme practically, and shows the promising future of building large-scale nuclear plants with a system of small modular reactors.

Here, the author shows that physics-based models for predicting lifetime of lithium-ion batteries must include how degradation modes evolve over lifetime, otherwise the models may be overfitting the experimental data. 
 Predicting lithium-ion battery lifetime remains a critical and challenging issue in battery research right now. Recent years have witnessed a surge in lifetime prediction papers using physics-based, empirical, or data-driven models, most of which have been validated against the remaining capacity (capacity fade) and sometimes resistance (power fade). However, there are many different combinations of degradation mechanisms in lithium-ion batteries that can result in the same patterns of capacity and power fade, making it impossible to find a unique validated solution. Experimentally, degradation mode analysis involving measuring the loss of lithium inventory, loss of active material at both electrodes, and electrode drift/slippage has emerged as a state-of-the-art requirement for cell degradation studies. This work represents the integration of five distinct degradation mechanisms. We show how three models with different levels of complexity can all fit the remaining capacity and resistance well, but only the model with five coupled degradation mechanisms could also fit the degradation modes at three temperatures. This work proves that parameterizing using only capacity and power fade is no longer sufficient, and experimental and modelling degradation studies should include degradation mode analysis for parameterization in the future. Accurately predicting battery lifetime is desirable. Here, the author shows that physics-based models for predicting lifetime of lithium-ion batteries must include how degradation modes evolve over lifetime, otherwise the models may be overfitting the experimental data."

Here, the authors introduce sandwiched hole transport configuration for more balanced carrier transport, achieving efficiency of 26.05%. 
 While individual perovskite and organic solar cells have demonstrated remarkable performance, achieving similar success in high-efficiency perovskite/organic tandem solar cells (TSCs) has been challenging, primarily due to large voltage deficits and severe non-radiative recombination. By exploring the fundamental mechanisms of carrier losses, we identify that imbalanced carrier transport, particularly inadequate hole transport in the organic subcell significantly limits the overall performance of perovskite/organic TSCs. Herein, we implement a hole transport self-assembled monolayer (SAM) anchored to MoO3, which converts the inherently n-type MoO3 to a p-type surface. Further, a SAM/MoO3/SAM sandwich hole transport configuration is introduced, which significantly enhances hole extraction, facilitating a more balanced carrier transport, and markedly suppressing non-radiative recombination at the interconnection layer (ICL). The resulting perovskite/organic TSCs achieve a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 26.05%, with an open-circuit voltage of 2.21 V (certified at 2.216 V) and enhanced operation stability.

 Emerging evidence has unveiled heterogeneity in phenotypic and transcriptional alterations at the single-cell level during oxidative stress and senescence. Despite the pivotal roles of cellular metabolism, a comprehensive elucidation of metabolomic heterogeneity in cells and its connection with cellular oxidative and senescent status remains elusive. By integrating single-cell live imaging with mass spectrometry (SCLIMS), we establish a cross-modality technique capturing both metabolome and oxidative level in individual cells. The SCLIMS demonstrates substantial metabolomic heterogeneity among cells with diverse oxidative levels. Furthermore, the single-cell metabolome predicted heterogeneous states of cells. Remarkably, the pre-existing metabolomic heterogeneity determines the divergent cellular fate upon oxidative insult. Supplementation of key metabolites screened by SCLIMS resulted in a reduction in cellular oxidative levels and an extension of C. elegans lifespan. Altogether, SCLIMS represents a potent tool for integrative metabolomics and phenotypic profiling at the single-cell level, offering innovative approaches to investigate metabolic heterogeneity in cellular processes.

Here, the authors report an injectable bioadhesive and lubricating hydrogel, that prevents cartilage wear, provides long-term anti-inflammatory effects, and repairs damaged cartilage for RA therapy. 
 Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic autoimmune condition accompanied by lubrication dysfunction, inflammatory infiltration, and cartilage wear. Long-term improvements in joint lubrication, inflammation elimination, and worn cartilage repair are crucial for effective RA treatment. Herein, we present an injectable bioadhesive and lubricating hydrogel containing a dopamine-modified hyaluronic acid (DA-HA) network, sulfonated hyaluronic acid (SO3−-HA) network, and kartogenin (KGN)-grafted dopamine-hybridized graphene quantum dot-supported Cu single-atom nanozyme (DAGQD@Cu@KGN SAN) designed to restore cartilage lubrication and repair worn cartilage in RA. DA within the hydrogel networks provides bioadhesion, allowing it to persist in the joint cavity for extended periods. The hydrogel with SO3− group offer lubricity, reducing friction coefficient and alleviating cartilage wear. The DAGQD@Cu@KGN SAN exhibits excellent superoxide dismutase, catalase, and •OH scavenging activities, effectively inhibiting inflammation. KGN is sustainably released from the hydrogel, recruiting bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells to repair damaged cartilage by promoting their differentiation into chondrocytes. In vivo experimental results demonstrate that this injectable bioadhesive and lubricating hydrogel not only prevents cartilage wear and tear, providing long-term anti-oxidation and anti-inflammatory effects in early RA, but also repaired damaged cartilage in late-stage RA. This bio-adhesive and lubricating hydrogel presents a potential full-cycle strategy for RA therapy.

They show that drought delays springtime phenology, primarily through exogenous environmental memory effects, and suggest that future spring advances may be dampened by increasing drought. 
 Global warming has increased the frequency and intensity of droughts, causing large impacts on the structure and functioning of terrestrial ecosystems. The direct effect of droughts on autumn senescence is well-documented, but the extent to which the legacy effects influence plant phenology of the following year remains unclear. Using satellite greenness data and long-term in situ observations, we demonstrate that droughts substantially delay the green-up and leaf unfolding of the next spring, particularly following prolonged events with delayed soil moisture recovery. These delays cannot be explained by state-of-the-art phenology models and are strongly linked to postdrought temperature, local climate, drought characteristics and reductions in photosynthesis. Compared to the endogenous memory effects within plants themselves, the exogenous memory effects through changes in environment are five times stronger in drylands and twice as strong in non-drylands. Given projections of increased drought frequency and severity, future advances in spring phenology may be less pronounced than previously anticipated.

 The future of the northern peatland carbon (C) sink is uncertain as the effects of warming on microbial metabolisms are unclear. While increased microbial CO2 emissions are expected under warming, the response of microbial photosynthesis remains unknown, complicating predictions of net microbial effects on peatland carbon emissions. Here, using a continental-scale experimental study, we show that warming amplifies microbial photosynthesis by 3.4 mgC m−2 h−1 per 1 °C increase. By 2100, this increase translates to a gain of 51.1 Tg of carbon per year from the northern peatland area under the pessimistic SSP 5-8.5 climatic change scenario, offsetting ~14% of projected heterotrophic CO2 emissions in northern peatlands. By linking field and microcosm experiments, we further show that enhanced microbial photosynthesis accelerates peatland CO2 uptake as photosynthetic microbial-C subsidies stimulate nutrient mineralization. These results underscore the importance of photosynthetic microbes for mitigating carbon emissions and supporting long-term carbon storage in peatlands.

 Heatwaves pose serious risks to human health and lives, but how their occurrence patterns may change under global warming remains unclear. Here we reveal a systematic westward shift of heatwave hotspots across the northern mid-latitudes around the late 1990s. Both observational analysis and numerical simulation show that this shift is caused by intensified soil moisture–atmosphere coupling (SAC) in eastern Europe, Northeast Asia and western North America under recent background warming. The strengthened SAC shifted the atmospheric high-amplitude Rossby wavenumber-5 pattern westwards to a preferred phase position, which increased the probability of the occurrence of high-pressure ridges over these 3 hotspots by a factor of up to 39. Our results highlight the importance of SAC in shaping heatwave patterns and large-scale atmospheric circulation and challenge the conventional view that the land surface only passively responds to atmospheric forcing. Heatwaves are expected to become more frequent with warming, but how their spatial patterns change is not well understood.

 The imaging features of oil spills in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images have significant differences due to factors such as marine environment, SAR sensors, oil film thickness and types, which makes it difficult to obtain a generalized model, and the limited number of SAR images obtained from new oil spill events hampers the effective training of deep learning networks. To solve these issues, an enhanced unsupervised domain adaptation with iterative pseudo-label refinement (EUDA-PLR) approach is proposed for inter-event oil spill SAR image segmentation. Specifically, the freely downloaded and collected Sentinel-1 and ERS-1/2 oil spill historical data are used as source domains, respectively, which are migrated to each new oil spill event with limited training samples based on adversarial training to improve the timeliness and accuracy of processing new oil spill events. Subsequently, the target domain is divided more rationally by combining the knowledge of the resolution and polarization mode of the satellite images, the wind speed information of the marine environment, and the computable oil-seawater power ratio. Finally, high-probability oil spill features are stored and updated based on top-K marginal probabilities to improve the completeness of oil spill features in the pseudo-labeling of strong samples in the target domain, and adversarial training is utilized to enhance the ability to extract oil spill features from weak samples in the target domain. EUDA-PLR is applicable to a variety of current mainstream SAR satellites. In the experiments, the source domain data contains the Sentinel-1 dataset from 2014 to 2021 and the ERS-1/2 dataset from 1991 to 2002, and the target domain data contains the GF-3 dataset of an oil spill event in the Bohai Bay region in 2018, the GF-3 and COSMO-SkyMed dataset of an oil spill event in the South China Sea region in 2019, the GF-3 dataset for an oil spill event in the East China Sea region in 2020, and the Radarsat-2 dataset for an oil spill event in the Bohai Bay region in 2021.

 The automated extraction of building facade footprints (BFFs) is a critical task in surveying and remote sensing. Existing methods primarily use mobile laser scanning point cloud as the data source, with limited methods utilizing airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. This is mainly because current methods require explicit building extraction and wall detection, and the facade points in ALS point clouds are naturally sparse and prone to incompleteness, leading to insufficient robustness in rule-based wall extraction. To address this challenge, this paper presents an end-to-end method named deep projective prediction (DPP), which directly predicts BFF masks from ALS point clouds, avoiding explicit extraction of buildings and facades, thereby simplifying the BFF extraction process. Meanwhile, we introduce a back-projective attention (BPAtt) module that guides the decoding process while performing differentiable projections, enhancing the model’s sensitivity to projected feature locations. Additionally, a sparse feature completion (SFC) strategy is proposed to alleviate the impact of point cloud sparsity on footprint mask prediction. To validate the effectiveness of the DPP and facilitate relevant future research, an ALS-based BFF dataset is established, which provides more than 3k BFF annotations. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed DPP achieves promising results on the BFF extraction task. The BPAtt module and SFC strategy also promote the BFF extraction performance, particularly at the boundaries of footprints."

 Under anthropogenic disturbances and global warming, coral reef ecosystems are degrading, and there is growing concern about the changes in benthic habitats in shallow coral reef waters. As an essential parameter, bottom reflectance can be used to indicate the health of benthic habitats in coral reefs. However, accurately determining bottom reflectance from satellite data remains challenging. This study presents an equation-based analytical method to estimate the bottom reflectance from high-spatial-resolution multispectral images in shallow coral reef waters by establishing two equations independent of bottom type and water depth. With the required parameters estimated from the sampling pixels of the multi-spectral image, the bottom reflectance data for the blue and green bands were derived by solving the two equations without a prior knowledge of bottom types, water properties, and water depths. To evaluate the method, simulated remote-sensing reflectance datasets from various combinations of the water properties, depths, and bottom types were used to derive the bottom reflectance. The root mean square errors (RMSEs) of the derived bottom reflectance in the blue band were generally <0.02 for most cases, except when the colored dissolved organic matter spectral absorption coefficient at the 440 nm wavelength [aCDOM (440)] was 0.1 m−1 and concentration of chlorophyll (CCHL) was ≥0.5 μg/L. Comparatively, the lower RMSEs in the green band were observed only when aCDOM(440) < 0.05 m−1, concentration of non-algal particles (CNAP) < 0.25 mg/L, and CCHL < 0.5 μg/L. Furthermore, the proposed method was applied to the two real satellite multispectral images to derive the bottom reflectance. By visually comparing to the subsurface reflectance images and validating with the field-measured reflectance data, we demonstrated that the satellite derived bottom reflectance in the blue and green bands was accurate in both magnitude and shape by the proposed method. Finally, the impacts of the spatial inhomogeneity of the water properties, purity of sampling pixels for estimating the band ratio of the total diffused attenuation coefficients, and errors in the radiometric correction on the bottom reflectance retrieval were discussed and analyzed."

 Considering the importance of greenspace for the health and life of urban citizens, different levels of greenspace exposure (GE) have received increasing attention. However, the understanding of human travel-related greenspace exposure is still limited, especially the lack of quantitative description of the fine-grained dynamics of greenspace exposure for active travel. Therefore, this study aims to quantify and analyse the spatio-temporal dynamics and equality of greenspace exposure during daily travel using dockless bike-sharing data in Beijing. Firstly, this study analysed the spatio-temporal patterns and community structure of bike-sharing travel using graph networks. Second, the daily travel-related greenspace exposure dynamics were estimated using a population-weighted exposure model. Finally, the spatial heterogeneity and equality of greenspace exposure during daily travel were assessed. The results show that greenspace exposure is shaped by both human mobility and greenspace distribution. Greenspace exposure is higher during the daytime than the early morning, and there are no significant changes of the average greenspace exposure across weekdays and weekends. In addition, there is an imbalance between greenspace coverage and exposure, with high greenspace coverage not implying high greenspace exposure and vice versa. Areas with lower greenspace coverage (less than 30 %) occurred for more than 80 % of the travels. We also found significant inequality of greenspace exposure during daily travel, with an average Gini index above 0.50. Driven by human mobility, inequality varied over time, with the highest inequality occurring between midnight and early morning, when the Gini index is higher than 0.65. This study provides a detailed understanding of greenspace exposure in active travel modes and may offer valuable insights for urban greenspace planning and health-oriented mobility strategies."

 Quantitative remote sensing-based forest parameter estimation is challenging in tropical mountainous conditions with complex topography and vegetation.

The results showed that optical remote sensing provided the highest estimation accuracy in mountainous terrain, significantly outperforming both GEDI and SAR data. The combination of multiple remote sensing datasets further enhanced the estimation accuracy. Incorporating slope and geographic location data also improved model performance. Among all methods, the RF model was most sensitive to topographic variations, whereas the DMR model consistently delivered excellent performance across different slope conditions.

Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive geospatial code evaluation framework, incorporating option matching, expert validation, and prompt engineering scoring for LLMs, and systematically evaluate GeoCode-GPT-7B using the GeoCode-Eval dataset. Experimental results reveal that GeoCode-GPT significantly outperforms existing models across multiple tasks. For multiple-choice tasks, its accuracy improves by 9.1% to 32.1%.

 Rainwater water-soluble organic matter (WSOM) constitutes a complex mixture that holds a pivotal role in biogeochemical cycles and climate change. Understanding its chemical composition helps better to reveal its atmospheric behavior. In this study, rainwater samples were collected from three Chinese cities to explore their WSOM molecular composition and sources. These rainwater samples contained significant amounts of both natural and anthropogenic WSOM owing to diverse environmental settings and extensive human activities. Ultrahigh-resolution Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) was employed to analyze the molecular diversity of rainwater WSOM. A total of 1684, 2024, and 1104 molecular formulas were identified in rainwater WSOM from Anshan, Guangzhou, and Nanjing, China, respectively. The results reveled that sulfur-containing compounds (including CHOS and CHONS) dominated the rainwater WSOM in Anshan (74.9 %), with a notable presence of nitrooxy-organosulfates. In contrast, in Guangzhou, typical biogenic derivatives of CHO compounds contributed more to the rainwater WSOM (50.5 %). In Nanjing, the sulfur-containing compounds and CHO compounds were primarily composed of nitrooxy-organosulfates and saturated fatty acids, respectively, comprising 48.6 % and 43.8 % of the rainwater WSOM.

 Against the background of global warming, the increasing frequency of extreme high-temperature events (EHTF) in East China poses a huge threat to societal development and public health, and this was starkly demonstrated by the record-breaking EHTF observed in China in summer 2022. In this study, it was found that the record-breaking dust storm in May 2022 over the Arabian Peninsula accounted for approximately 65.2 % of the abnormal amplitude of July–August EHTF in China in the ensuing summer. Mechanistically, the dust aerosols of this heavy dust storm over the Arabian Peninsula were transferred downstream by the trade winds, whereupon they cooled the Indian Ocean via radiative processes and warmed the Tibetan Plateau through the so-called “snow-darkening effect”. These dust effects persisted until late summer and consequently strengthened the Indian summer monsoon and wetted the Indochina Peninsula. Subsequently, the associated enhanced and eastward-shifted South Asian high and westward-shifted western Pacific subtropical high contributed to the record-breaking EHTF in 2022. A physical–empirical forecast model was developed based on the preceding May dust signals over the Arabian Peninsula, and results showed that it skillfully predicts the interannual variability of July–August EHTF in East China during 2009–2022, and especially the record-breaking amplitude in 2022."

 Fundamental research on refined observations and structural characteristics of the spatial and temporal evolution of precipitation-producing weather in the Mount Everest region (MER) is lacking. Via the second comprehensive scientific investigation and research plan of the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau, in this paper, we report the first observation experiment with multisource remote sensing detection equipment for studying convective cloud precipitation on the northern slope in the MER from 2019 to 2023, revealing the unique mechanism triggering summer convective cloud precipitation and the spatial and temporal evolution of its macro- and microscale physical structural characteristics. Multisource detection equipment, including X-band dual-polarization Doppler weather radar, ground automatic stations, 2D video disdrometers, microwave radiometers and radio sounding, were employed to construct an observation network. Secondary inversion data were derived from these multisource observation data. Compared with observation data from other regions, such as Chengdu, summer convective cloud precipitation data in the MER revealed two unique macro- and microstructural characteristics. The internal physical mechanism underlying the influence of the northern slope on summer convective cloud precipitation in the MER is that the extremely high elevation, complex topography, summer South Asian monsoon and intense solar radiation jointly promote the formation of intense thermal vertical motion throughout the troposphere and weak dynamic uplift and poor water vapor conditions in the boundary layer. This study may bridge the gap in detailed observations of the weather structure of the convective cloud precipitation for the northern slope of the MER in summer and provide a significant reference for further studies of Tibetan Plateau weather changes and their potential impacts on the global climate."

 Effective management of water resources and the development of climate adaptation strategies in arid and semi-arid regions increasingly rely on a comprehensive understanding of water cycle processes in the context of global climate change. This study focuses on the Hunshandake Sandy Land, a key ecological barrier in northern China. It analyzes the influence of climate conditions and moisture sources on precipitation isotope composition using 394 precipitation samples collected between 2014 and 2021. Precipitation δ18O and d-excess show significant variability and distinct seasonal patterns, with δ18O values ranging from 1.78 ‰ to −24.51 ‰ and d-excess values from −26.28 ‰ to 39.08 ‰. Temperature is identified as the primary factor influencing precipitation δ18O and d-excess, accounting for 42 % of the monthly δ18O variation and 16 % of the monthly d-excess variation. The Local Meteoric Water Line, δ2H = 6.66δ18O – 3.48, highlights the dry, low-rainfall, and high-evaporation characteristics of the Hunshandake Sandy Land. The backward trajectory calculations reveal that northern China, central China, and Mongolia are the primary sources of moisture absorption, contributing 38.25 %, 26.20 %, and 14.21 % of the moisture to Hunshandake Sandy Land precipitation, respectively. The influence of monsoon climates varies over time, leading to significant variability in the contribution of different moisture source regions to Hunshandake Sandy Land precipitation. Specifically, northern China contributes 36.09 % of the moisture in the wet season and 40.42 % in the dry season, whereas central China contributes 29.39 % in the wet season and 23.02 % in the dry season. The Hunshandake Sandy Land precipitation sample index (IHSL) was defined, and a multiple linear model for monthly precipitation δ18O values was developed using temperature, relative humidity, and IHSL: (δ18O = 0.320 T - 0.068RH + 0.022 IHSL - 11.615). This model can explain 49 % of the monthly precipitation δ18O variability.These findings enhance the understanding of the water cycle in arid and semi-arid regions."

 Extreme precipitation events have recently increased due to global warming, leading to higher humidity and temperatures. Therefore, accurate, updated, and comprehensive precipitation estimations are essential to mitigate the severe losses caused by these extreme events. Satellite precipitation products provide high spatiotemporal resolution and global coverage, enabling improved detection and estimation of precipitation, especially in areas with limited ground observations. This research leverages some of the advanced satellite precipitation products and atmospheric dataset reanalysis available, enhancing the accuracy of precipitation estimates, particularly during heavy and extreme precipitation events. In this work, we use Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and optimization techniques to introduce a two-step methodology for improving satellite-based estimation and detection of heavy and extreme precipitation events. In the first step, feature centroids are integrated into a resampling method to increase the diversity of samples. The second step applies the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm to refine categorical evaluation criteria, enhancing prediction accuracy. This study uses the ACO meta-heuristic algorithm to optimize a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model, using CNN-based precipitation estimates as input. The performance of the models and products in estimating and detecting heavy and extreme precipitation events is evaluated using various metrics, including Pearson correlation (r) and Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE). The results show that the Ant Colony-optimized MLP (ACO-MLP) outperforms the satellite precipitation products and CNN models in estimating the extreme and heavy precipitation with r = 0.89, 0.82, and KGE = 0.71, 0.65, over the continental area of Australia. The result of utilizing the proposed ACO-MLP and CNN models in Australia showed that the spatial pattern of the extreme precipitation event over the country's east coast on 23 February 2022 is effectively captured. This work contributes to improving water resources management and advancing climate studies, particularly in understanding and addressing extreme precipitation conditions."

 Understanding and predicting pyrocumulonimbus (pyroCb) thunderclouds is challenging due to their unpredictable nature and potential to exacerbate wildfires. This study employs a three-dimensional (3D) numerical model with a non-inductive electrification mechanism to explore how fire-produced aerosol concentrations influence the charge structure and lightning activity in pyroCb. Aerosol particle concentrations ranging from 100 to 20,000 cm−3 were considered to generate realistic thundercloud charge structures, with the cumulus cloud setup based on environmental conditions derived from an inverted-V sounding profile. The SP98 non-inductive electrification scheme models charge transfer in pyroCb, and the Poisson equation is solved to identify regions where lightning discharges are likely to initiate, though actual discharges are not simulated. For aerosol concentrations between 500 and 5000 cm−3, negative non-inductive charging dominates, while extreme aerosol cases (≥5000 cm−3) enhance positive charging at altitudes of 3–7 km. These findings suggest that non-inductive charge separation between ice crystals and graupel leads to realistic charge structures under pyroconvective conditions simulated in this study, reflecting moderate-to-high aerosol environments characteristic of wildfire-driven pyroCb events. As aerosol concentrations increase from 500 to 5000 cm−3, the charge structure evolves from a dipole to a tripole (at 1000 cm−3) and eventually to an inverted dipole, enabling intra-cloud (IC) and negative cloud-to-ground (-CG) lightning. At higher concentrations (10,000–20,000 cm−3), a multi-layer charge configuration emerges, favoring intense positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) strokes. Sensitivity analysis reveals that low-to-moderate aerosol levels with strong wind shear promote IC lightning, while high aerosol levels favor +CG flashes. These findings highlight the complex interactions driving pyroCb dynamics and the importance of integrated modelling to predict wildfire-induced thunderstorms."

Notably, the Tregcell response to self-peptide did not affect protective Tconvcell responses to a pathogen-derived peptide.

We argue that any ability to alter dives based upon direct perception of oxygen should have been strongly selected for. We exposed diving seals to inhaled gas mixes that were experimentally altered to affect circulating levels of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Dive duration was positively correlated with circulating oxygen levels but unaffected by carbon dioxide levels and pH.

10.1126/science.adu1756,False,Science,该论文主要研究的是同手性碳纳米管范德华晶体的生长和应用，特别是在集成电路领域。论文关注的是如何在高密度、高对齐度和高纯度半导体性的条件下，在六方氮化硼衬底上直接生长紧密排列的碳纳米管阵列。论文中提到的分子动力学模拟表明，这种自组装生长机制是由于管间范德华引力和碳纳米管在原子级平坦的氮化硼衬底上的超低滑动摩擦力造成的。利用这种碳纳米管阵列构建的场效应晶体管在室温下表现出高性能。因此，该论文的核心内容集中在材料科学和纳米技术领域，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,[],Zhichun Zhang;Yi Chen;Peiyue Shen;Jiajun Chen;Sen Wang;Bo Wang;Saiqun Ma;Bosai Lyu;Xianliang Zhou;Shuo Lou;Zhenghan Wu;Yufeng Xie;Chengjia Zhang;Liguo Wang;Kunqi Xu;Haonan Li;Guohua Wang;Kenji Watanabe;Takashi Taniguchi;Dong Qian;Jinfeng Jia;Qi Liang;Xiaoqun Wang;Wei Yang;Guangyu Zhang;Chuanhong Jin;Wengen Ouyang;Zhiwen Shi,Homochiral carbon nanotube van der Waals crystals,"For applications of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) in integrated circuits, it is crucial to have high–tube density arrays of SWNTs that are well aligned and purely semiconducting. In this work, we report on the direct growth of close-packed SWNT arrays on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) substrates, demonstrating high alignment and uniform chirality within each array. Molecular dynamics simulations suggest that a self-assembly growth mechanism resulted from the intertube van der Waals attraction and the ultralow sliding friction of SWNTs on the atomically flat hBN substrate. Field-effect transistors constructed from the grown SWNT array exhibit high performance at room temperature, with mobilities of up to 2000 square centimeters per volt per second, on/off ratios of ~107, and a maximum current density of ~6 milliamperes per micrometer."

Chase;Forest Isbell;Michel Loreau;Bernhard Schmid;Eric W. Seabloom;David Tilman;Shaopeng Wang,Unifying spatial scaling laws of biodiversity and ecosystem stability,"While both species richness and ecosystem stability increase with area, how these scaling patterns are linked remains unclear. Our theoretical and empirical analyses of plant and fish communities show that the spatial scaling of ecosystem stability is determined primarily by the scaling of species asynchrony, which is in turn driven by the scaling of species richness. In wetter regions, plant species richness and ecosystem stability both exhibit faster accumulation with area, implying potentially greater declines in biodiversity and stability following habitat loss. The decline in ecosystem stability after habitat loss can be delayed, creating a stability debt mirroring the extinction debt of species. By unifying two foundational scaling laws in ecology, our work underscores that ongoing biodiversity loss may destabilize ecosystems across spatial scales."

By applying new theory to data on 84,695 plant, animal, and protist assemblages, we show that the general positive effect of species richness on stocks of biomass, as well as much of the variation in the strength and sign of this effect, is predicted by a fundamental macroecological quantity: the scaling of species abundance with body mass. Standing biomass increases with richness when large-bodied species are numerically rare but is independent of richness when species size and abundance are uncoupled. These results suggest a new fundamental law in the structure of ecological communities and show that the impacts of changes in species richness on biomass are predictable."

However, it remains unclear whether high biodiversity in mountain ranges is an evolutionary response to the rate of relief generation during mountain building. Focusing on small mammals, such as rodents, we used coupled landscape-biological simulations to show that biodiversity increases with the magnitude and rate of tectonic uplift. This relationship, visible in depositional lowlands over millions of years, underscores the considerable role of mountain building in shaping past and present terrestrial biodiversity. Our results provide insights into the influence of topographic changes on evolutionary processes, offering a potential link between mountain formation and paleodiversity records."

The impact generated an ~20-meter tsunami-like impact wave, which breached the moraine and drained ~50 million cubic meters of the lake’s water. The ensuing glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) eroded ~270 million cubic meters of sediment, which overwhelmed infrastructure, including hydropower installations along the Teesta River. The physical scale and human and economic impacts of this event prompt urgent reflection on the role of climate change and human activities in exacerbating such disasters.

We investigated the mechanistic basis of this infantile amnesia by scanning the brains of awake infants with functional magnetic resonance imaging while they performed a subsequent memory task. Greater activity in the hippocampus during the viewing of previously unseen photographs was related to later memory-based looking behavior beginning around 1 year of age, suggesting that the capacity to encode individual memories comes online during infancy. The availability of encoding mechanisms for episodic memory during a period of human life that is later lost from our autobiographical record implies that postencoding mechanisms, whereby memories from infancy become inaccessible for retrieval, may be more responsible for infantile amnesia."

However, its distribution across different pools, live or dead biomass and soil and sedimentary organic carbon, remains uncertain. Analyzing global observational datasets of changes in terrestrial carbon pools, we found that ≈35 ± 14 gigatons of carbon (GtC) have been sequestered on land between 1992 and 2019, whereas live biomass changed by ≈1 ± 7 GtC. Global vegetation models instead imply that sequestration has been mostly in live biomass. We identify key processes not included in most models that can explain this discrepancy. Most terrestrial carbon gains are sequestered as nonliving matter and thus are more persistent than previously appreciated, with a substantial fraction linked to human activities such as river damming, wood harvest, and garbage disposal in landfills."

In this study, we engineered neutrophil membrane–fused mitochondria (nMITO), which combine the injury-targeting and anti-inflammatory properties of neutrophil membrane proteins with the cell repairing function of mitochondria. nMITO effectively blocked inflammatory cascades and restored mitochondrial function, targeting both key mechanisms in acute organ injuries. In addition, nMITO selectively targeted damaged endothelial cells via β-integrins and were delivered to injured tissues through tunneling nanotubes, enhancing their regulatory effects on inflammation and cell damage. In mouse models of acute myocardial injury, liver injury, and pancreatitis, nMITO notably reduced inflammatory responses and repaired tissue damage. These findings suggest that nMITO is a promising therapeutic strategy for managing acute organ injuries."
