10.5194/acp-25-7903-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注氢动力飞机产生的尾迹云的早期演变过程，特别是与传统煤油燃烧产生的尾迹云的对比。论文通过高分辨率模拟，研究了尾迹云中冰晶数量和水汽排放等关键参数对尾迹云演变的影响。虽然尾迹云对气候有影响，但该研究更侧重于微观物理过程的模拟和参数化，而不是直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['contrail cirrus', 'hydrogen-powered aircraft', 'ice crystal loss', 'EULAG-LCM model', 'ice microphysics', 'water vapor emission', 'ambient temperature']",Annemarie Lottermoser;Simon Unterstrasser,High-resolution modeling of early contrail  evolution from hydrogen-powered aircraft,"Contrail cirrus significantly contributes to aviation's overall climate impact. As hydrogen combustion and fuel cell use are emerging technologies for aircraft propulsion, we simulated individual contrails from hydrogen propulsion during the first 6 min after exhaust emission, termed the vortex phase. The ice crystal loss during that stage is crucial, as the number of ice crystals has a large impact on the further evolution of contrails into contrail cirrus and their radiative forcing. 
 In this study, we investigate the properties of young contrails formed behind hydrogen-powered aircraft, particularly compared to contrails from conventional kerosene combustion. High-resolution simulations of individual contrails are performed using the EULAG-LCM model, a large-eddy simulation model with fully coupled particle-based ice microphysics.Previous studies on early contrail evolution during the vortex phase have explored a range of meteorological and aircraft-related parameters, but they have focused on contrails with ice crystal numbers and water vapor emissions typical of kerosene combustion.This study examines the early H2-contrail evolution, starting at a state where ice crystal formation and wake vortex roll-up are complete. Two key parameters are adjusted: the emitted water vapor mass and the number of ice crystals formed during the initial stage. The emitted water vapor varies between 3.7 and 38.6 g per flight meter, depending on the fuel and aircraft type. The initial ice crystal number spans 4 orders of magnitude, from approximately 1010 to 1014 ice crystals per flight meter. Additionally, we extend our atmospheric scenarios to ambient temperatures up to 235 K, as H2 contrails can form under warmer conditions where kerosene plumes typically cannot.Our results show that vortex phase processes reduce the 4-order-of-magnitude difference in ice crystal number to 2 orders of magnitude. Moreover, relative ice crystal loss increases with increasing ambient temperatures and decreasing relative humidity levels.Finally, we extend the parameterization of ice crystal loss from a previous study to include scenarios of contrails from hydrogen propulsion systems."
10.5194/acp-25-7959-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注大气棕碳（BrC）的光学性质及其来源依赖性。通过对不同来源（如臭氧污染、城市交通和生物质燃烧）的棕碳进行分析，研究揭示了它们在光吸收特性上的差异，并识别出含氮有机碳化合物是关键的光吸收物质。研究结果有助于提高气候模型的准确性，并加深对棕碳来源的理解。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究内容与大气成分分析和空气质量监测密切相关，这些都是大气环境遥感技术的重要应用领域。,"['brown carbon', 'optical properties', 'source apportionment', 'light absorption', 'climate modeling', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality']",Jinghao Zhai;Yin Zhang;Pengfei Liu;Yujie Zhang;Antai Zhang;Yaling Zeng;Baohua Cai;Jingyi Zhang;Chunbo Xing;Honglong Yang;Xiaofei Wang;Jianhuai Ye;Chen Wang;Tzung-May Fu;Lei Zhu;Huizhong Shen;Shu Tao;Xin Yang,Source-dependent optical properties and molecular characteristics of atmospheric brown carbon,"Our study shows that the optical properties of brown carbon depend on its source. Brown carbon from ozone pollution had the weakest light absorption but the strongest wavelength dependence, while biomass burning brown carbon showed the strongest absorption and the weakest wavelength dependence. Nitrogen-containing organic carbon compounds were identified as key light absorbers. These results improve understanding of brown carbon sources and help refine climate models. 
 Atmospheric brown carbon (BrC) can significantly affect Earth's radiation budget by its wavelength-dependent absorption in the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) range. BrC consists of a wide variety of organics with different optical properties, making accurate climate modeling essential for understanding its radiative impact. Here, we conducted a field campaign during the summer in Shenzhen, China, to investigate the optical properties and molecular characteristics of BrC from diverse particle sources using both online and offline measurements. BrC mass concentrations were determined based on either thermally desorbed organic carbon or water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and the corresponding mass absorption cross-sections (MACs) were calculated accordingly. Different sources of BrC, including those from secondary production associated with ozone pollution, urban transportation, and biomass burning, were identified through meteorological data and particle chemical compositions. The results show that the MAC of BrC varied across sources, with BrC from biomass combustion exhibiting the highest MAC at 370 nm (3.42 ± 0.41 m2 g−1) and secondary BrC associated with ozone pollution showing the lowest (1.25 ± 0.56 m2 g−1). Nevertheless, secondary BrC exhibited the highest absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), while the BrC from biomass burning had the lowest AAE. Molecular analysis revealed that species in the CHON family from biomass burning demonstrated the strongest light absorption. Our results provide valuable insights for quantifying the source-specific optical properties of BrC, enhancing the accuracy of climate models."

Marushchak;Anna-Maria Virkkala;Martin Heimann;Mathias Göckede,Practical guidelines for reproducible N2O flux chamber measurements in nutrient-poor ecosystems,"This study explores nitrous oxide (N2O) fluxes from a nutrient-poor sub-Arctic peatland. N2O is a potent greenhouse gas; understanding its fluxes is essential for addressing global warming. Using a new instrument and flux chambers, we introduce a system to reliably detect low N2O fluxes and provide recommendations on chamber closure times and flux calculation methods to better quantify N2O fluxes. We encourage researchers to further investigate N2O fluxes in low-nutrient environments. 
 The atmospheric concentration of nitrous oxide (N2O) has increased significantly since 1800, mainly due to agricultural activities. However, due to their large area, nutrient-poor natural soils, including those in the (sub-) Arctic, also play a crucial role in N2O emissions and consumption. Despite their importance, these soils have been understudied, due to methodological limitations in detecting low fluxes. Our study addresses this knowledge gap by testing a fast-responding portable gas analyser (PGA; Aeris MIRA Ultra N2O/CO2) combined with manual chambers (height and diameter: 25 cm) for measuring N2O fluxes from a nutrient-poor, sub-Arctic peatland. Our results show that this setup can detect and quantify low N2O flux rates, with a mean and standard error of -0.61±0.08 µg N2O-N m-2h-1 for a 5 min closure time, as observed in our study. More than 70 % of the measured N2O fluxes exceeded the minimum detectable flux (0.027±0.0002µmolm-2h-1), which varied according to chamber closure time. Our study highlights the importance of using fast-responding analysers to measure low N2O fluxes and improve our understanding of diverse N2O flux dynamics. For nutrient-poor soils, we recommend a chamber closure time of approximately 5 min. We also found that a non-linear flux calculation model yielded better results and was broadly applicable, including cases where data were linearly distributed. Overall, our study demonstrates the potential of fast-responding analysers to improve our understanding of N2O flux dynamics in nutrient-poor soils."

Abnormal sensor behaviour was observed in wet conditions. A dry linear calibration was derived, although this was invalid below 1.2 ppb due to unstable measurements. The instrument was used to measure acetylene as a methane tracer at a landfill site. Fluxes were derived from 14 downwind transects using both raw and calibrated acetylene mole fraction, with raw measurements resulting in 8 % flux underestimation. 
 Facility-scale methane emission fluxes can be derived by comparing tracer and methane mole fraction measurements downwind of a methane emission source, where a co-located tracer gas is released at a known flux rate. Acetylene is a commonly used methane tracer due to its availability, low cost and low atmospheric background. Acetylene mole fraction can be measured using infrared gas analysers such as the cavity ring-down spectroscopy Picarro G2203. However, failure to calibrate tracer gas analysers may influence methane flux estimation, due to inaccurate raw tracer mole fraction measurements. We conducted extensive Picarro G2203 laboratory characterisation testing. Picarro G2203 acetylene measurements were calibrated by diluting a high concentration of acetylene with ambient air. The precise level of acetylene in each dilution blend was determined by diluting a high-concentration methane source in an identical way, with reliable methane mole fraction measurements used to quantify the true level of dilution. A linear calibration fit applied to raw acetylene mole fraction measured by the Picarro G2203 showed that these measurements could be corrected through direct multiplication with a calibration gain factor of 0.94. However, this specific calibration for the Picarro G2203 tested in this study is only valid from an acetylene mole fraction of 1.16 ppb, below which unstable measurements were observed. The same Picarro G2203 was used during a field study to perform 14 successful transects downwind of an active landfill site, where a point-source acetylene release was conducted at a fixed flow rate. Methane fluxes were derived by integrating the methane and acetylene mole fraction plumes, as a function of distance along the sampling road. This resulted in a ±56 % flux variability between different transects which was principally due to errors associated with the tracer release location and downwind sampling positioning. Methane fluxes were also derived using raw uncalibrated Picarro G2203 acetylene mole fraction instead of calibrated measurements, which resulted an average methane emission flux underestimation of approximately 8 % for this specific study, compared to fluxes derived using calibrated measurements. Unlike a random uncertainty, this bias represents a consistent flux underestimation that cannot be reduced by improving the field sampling methodology; the only solution is using calibrated acetylene mole fraction measurements. The magnitude of the bias is principally due to the 0.94 multiplicative gain factor. Therefore, a similar level of methane flux bias can be expected in other studies when using uncalibrated acetylene mole fraction measurements from the Picarro G2203 tested in this work. This study therefore emphasises the equal importance of calibrating target as well as tracer gas measurements, regardless of the instrument being used to obtain these measurements. Otherwise, biases can be induced within target gas flux estimates. For the example of methane, this can influence our understanding of the role of certain facility-scale sources within the global methane budget."

As our climate warms, fjords are hotspots of change and more scientists are collecting data in fjords. These data need to be available, useable, and intuitive across a wide range of users– from scientists to local people interested in their home. We provide an example of gridded data from Sermilik Fjord, Southeast Greenland as a way to achieve this. 
 As global atmosphere and ocean temperatures rise and the Greenland Ice Sheet loses mass, the glacial fjords of Kalallit Nunaat/Greenland play an increasingly critical role in our climate system. Fjords are pathways for freshwater from ice melt to reach the ocean and for deep, warm, nutrient–rich ocean waters to reach marine–terminating glaciers, supporting abundant local ecosystems that Greenlanders rely upon. Research in Greenland fjords has become more interdisciplinary and more observations are being collected in fjords than in previous decades. However, there are few long–term (> 10 years) datasets available for single fjords. Additionally, observations in fjords in general are often spatially and temporally disjointed, utilize multiple observing tools, and are rarely provided in formats that are easily used across disciplines or audiences. We address this issue by providing standardized, gridded summer season hydrographic sections for Sermilik Fjord in Southeast Greenland, from 2009–2023. Gridded data facilitate the analysis of coherent spatial patterns across the fjord domain, and are a more accessible and intuitive data product compared to discrete profiles. We combined ship–based conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) profiles with helicopter–deployed eXpendable CTD (XCTD) profiles from the ice mélange region to create objectively mapped (or optimally interpolated) along–fjord sections of conservative temperature and absolute salinity. From the gridded data, we derived a summer season climatological mean and root mean square deviation, summarizing typical fjord conditions and highlighting regions of variability. This information can be used by model and laboratory studies, fjord intercomparison studies, biological and ecosystem studies in the fjord, and provides context for interpreting previous work. All original profile observations, gridded data, and climatological products are publicly available in netCDF format at Arctic Data Center and GitHub. The code used has also been made available to facilitate continued updates to the Sermilik Fjord gridded data product and applications to other fjord systems."

This study introduces a wavelength-optimized far-UVC KrCl* lamp (UV222)/sulfite as transformative ARPs. Sulfite exhibited 45.6-fold stronger absorption at 222 nm compared with 254 nm, coupled with a higher innate quantum yield (Φinnate) of 0.128 mol·Ein–1 versus 0.115 mol·Ein–1. This wavelength optimization generated 29.2-fold higher steady-state concentration of eaq–, with optimal performance at basic pH (>9) and moderate sulfite dosages (0.4–0.75 mM). HOC degradation and dehalogenation showed clear structure-dependent patterns. The enhancive effect of UV222 over UV254 negatively correlated with HOCs’ susceptibility to UV photolysis due to competitive absorption between sulfite and target compounds. Electron-withdrawing halogens significantly favored reductive degradation over oxidation, enabling UV222/sulfite to outperform UV222/H2O2 by 1.3–37.1 times in degradation and 1.9–48.6 times in dehalogenation efficiency, with prominent enhancement particularly for polyhalogenated HOCs. In real water matrices, nitrate and nitrite inhibited HOCs’ degradation through UV absorption and eaq– scavenging. Compared with UV254/sulfite, UV222/sulfite reduced energy costs by 92.7% and required lower sulfite doses. This study provides insights into the wavelength-matching mechanism for UV/sulfite, offering an economical and efficient solution for the remediation of recalcitrant HOCs."

However, traditional experimental methods are inefficient, necessitating computational model development. We compiled a comprehensive data set including 44 PFAS and 405 soils from 35 literature reports, conducted a meta-analysis, and constructed robust machine learning models. Machine learning models using LightGBM with RDKit or PaDEL descriptors achieved R2 of 0.89, 0.88, and 0.72, RMSE of 0.28, 0.28, and 0.36, and MAE of 0.18, 0.19, and 0.28 for cross-validation, internal test set, and external test set, respectively. SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) analysis identified PFAS properties as the primary influence on sorption, followed by environmental conditions and soil properties. We found that low SOC (<0.56%) minimally affects PFAS sorption. A pH of 6 is the boundary point where anionic PFAS are mainly attracted or repelled by electrostatic interaction, and higher pH may enhance the PFAS soil sorption through cation bridges. Although van der Waals forces and polar interactions enhance the sorption of PFAS with carbon chains ≥8, the introduction of polar structures containing oxygen, nitrogen, and sulfur into PFAS will lower hydrophobicity and sorption affinity. This study provides accurate predictive models, which are helpful for environmental decision-making."

We investigated these associations and examined the mediating role of maternal and neonatal thyroid hormones in a Chinese birth cohort consisting of 501 mother-child pairs. We found that exposure to 2-hydroxy-benzothiazole (2-OH-BTH) in early pregnancy was inversely associated with childhood body mass index (BMI) (β = −0.041, 95% CI: −0.077, −0.005).

Additionally, third-trimester exposure to 1-hydroxy-benzotriazole, xylyl-triazole, TTR, and 2-OH-BTH was positively linked to neonatal thyroid-stimulating hormone levels. These findings suggest that prenatal exposure to BTs, particularly 2-OH-BTH, may impair early childhood growth by disrupting thyroid hormone homeostasis.

Antimony K-edge EXAFS spectroscopy reveals coprecipitation involved Sb(V) incorporation into the lepidocrocite structure via Sb(V)-for-Fe(III) substitution, whereas sorption involved edge and double-corner sharing between SbO6 and FeO6 octahedra at the lepidocrocite surface (with the proportional abundance of these linkages decreasing as Sb(V) sorption increased). Sb(V) sorption to lepidocrocite enabled faster Sb dissolution relative to Fe in 1 M HCl, whereas coprecipitation facilitated congruent dissolution of Sb and Fe. The Wenzel sequential extraction scheme substantially underestimated Sb(V) adsorption to the lepidocrocite surface, yet recovered remaining sorbed Sb(V) and all coprecipitated Sb(V) in extraction steps that target hydrous oxide-bound species. In contrast, very little sorbed or coprecipitated Sb(V) was recovered by the reducible step of the BCR sequential extraction, despite lepidocrocite being a readily reducible Fe(III) oxide. Instead, the BCR scheme incorrectly implied that lepidocrocite-bound Sb(V) was mostly oxidizable or nonreactive (i.e., bound in sulfides, organic matter, or highly stable phases such as tripuhyite). This study provides new insights into Sb(V) retention by lepidocrocite while providing useful guidance on the utility of common Sb extraction schemes."

Field measurements clearly show that concentrations of organic compounds measured in cloudwater can deviate significantly from predictions made with Henry’s law, with high enrichments measured for less water-soluble organic compounds. Several processes are suspected to be the cause of the observed enrichments, but the key process has not yet been elucidated. Here, we use the bulk-interface partitioning approach to predict enrichment coefficients (q) of organic compounds in cloud droplets. A predictive equation is derived as a function of the bulk-interface partition coefficients (Kp) and octanol–water partition coefficients (Kow). The calculated enrichments are compared to measured q values from different field campaigns. The results show that the predicted values follow the same trend and absolute values as the measurements. Highly water-soluble compounds have small enrichments, with values around 1, while less soluble compounds have very high enrichments of up to >103. A sensitivity study is performed for the range of Kow values obtained from different models, and for the range of measurements for different measurement conditions. The results of the sensitivity study show that the q measurements and predictions lie within the same range, thus showing that bulk-interface partitioning can be a good predictor for organic enrichments in cloudwater."

We demonstrate that O3 production in the Houston urban area transitions from a nearly homogeneous early morning VOC-limited regime to a NOX-limited regime by midday. Using the LN/Q indicator, we identify that a range of 0.6 < FNR < 1.8 falls in the transition zone of O3 formation regime. The high-resolution modeling of O3 formation and the FNR range developed in this LES study offers valuable insight for assessing future air quality and improving the understanding of atmospheric chemistry that underpins pollution control in Houston."

The extensive footprints of landslide‐triggering storms and their diverse hydrometeorological forcings highlight the urgent need to incorporate regional‐scale hydrometeorology into landslide research. Here, using a meteorologically‐informed hydrologic model, we simulate the time‐evolving water budget during the nine‐AR event and identify hydrometeorological conditions that contributed to widespread landslide occurrences across California. Our analysis reveals that 89% of observed landslides occurred under excessively wet conditions, driven by precipitation exceeding the capacities of infiltration, storage, evapotranspiration, and soil drainage. Using K‐means clustering, we identify three distinct hydrometeorological pathways that increased landslide potential: intense precipitation‐induced runoff (∼32% of reported landslides), rain on pre‐wetted soils (∼53%), and snowmelt and soil ice thawing (∼15%). Our findings highlight the importance of constraining the compounding factors that influence slope stability over spatial scales consistent with landslide‐triggering weather systems."

To address this, here we present updated projections of TCs for the southwest Pacific from a high‐resolution downscaled ensemble of CMIP6 models. The downscaling implements a variable‐resolution atmospheric model enhancing resolution over the southwest Pacific and New Zealand (∼12–30 km). We assess future changes in TC frequency, changes in large‐scale environmental conditions, and associated extreme precipitation and winds across tropical and ex‐tropical storm phases. Changes in TC track pathways are also investigated through cluster analysis. Across the downscaled simulations, robust changes in TC frequency were not found, including for a high‐emissions scenario at end‐of‐century. Projections of the background environmental conditions are shown to be a significant source of uncertainty, owing to diverging projections of relative SST and tropical convection across the region in the host GCMs. However, very strong TCs (category 4 and above) show greater consensus for an increase in frequency, with 16 of 18 simulations across models and scenarios projecting an increase. Cluster analysis of TC tracks indicates a slight decrease in tracks that often impact northern parts of Australia. Extreme precipitation associated with TCs under a high‐emissions scenario is projected to increase by ∼30%–35% averaged across models, both for storms in the tropics and ex‐TCs impacting New Zealand. This increase exceeds Clausius‐Clapeyron scaling in five of six simulations.

Isotope‐incorporated General Circulation Models (GCMs) are powerful tools that account for the physical processes related to stable water isotopes. In this study, we implemented a global version of the Non‐iteration Dimensional‐split Semi‐Lagrangian (NDSL) advection scheme in the IsoGSM to address a systematic bias in the delta values of surface precipitation over the Antarctic Plateau during austral winter (June–July–August; JJA). Results indicate that the spatial distribution of delta deuterium of surface precipitation during austral summer (December–January–February; DJF) is accurately simulated by both the control experiment (CNTL) and a subsequent NDSL experiment (NDSLQ); however, during austral winter, CNTL and NDSLQ exhibit differences, particularly over East Antarctica. Notably, NDSLQ captures the temperature effect more effectively than CNTL. Analysis of precipitation systems crossing the Korean Peninsula reveals that NDSLQ produces a much more realistic distribution of water vapor than that of CNTL, impacting not only the overall upward motion throughout the troposphere but also the position and intensity of surface precipitation. Overall, we recommend using a global spectral model with the NDSL advection scheme instead of the spectral method to improve the simulation of stable water isotopes over Antarctica and weather systems at mid‐latitudes."

 Coseismic ruptures release stored elastic strain through a combination of shear displacement along localized, principal faults and distributed bulk inelastic failure of the surrounding material. How inelastic strain localizes as fault systems mature and structurally develop is less well understood owing to the difficulty of measuring the complex, near-field and high-strain regions of coseismic surface ruptures. Here we use radar and optical images to measure the near-field surface displacement field and magnitude of off-fault inelastic strain from 16 historic strike-slip earthquakes that occurred on faults with cumulative displacements and fault slip rates that span almost three orders of magnitude. We show that inelastic shear deformation does localize as fault systems mature: the magnitude of off-fault inelastic strain is largest (34–67%) for fault systems with the lowest cumulative displacements (<3 km) and then rapidly decays to values that saturate around 13–19% for the most ‘mature’ fault systems with cumulative displacements exceeding ~20 km. We find that more localized coseismic ruptures host faster ruptures, generate fewer aftershocks and occur along geometrically simpler fault networks. Ruptures on more structurally mature faults are more localized and therefore expected to host faster ruptures with less off-fault deformation, according to remote-sensing and field measurements from historic strike-slip earthquakes."

 O-sulfation is a widespread modification of both endogenous and exogenous biomolecules, where the primary objective is to identify effective sulfuryl donors. In nature, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate (PAPS) and p-nitrophenyl sulfate (PNPS) are efficient sulfuryl donors. However, most chemical sulfuryl donors in O-sulfation, typically require harsh conditions and have not been demonstrated in complex molecules. Here we report a biomimetic O-sulfation method that is compatible with complex natural products and pharmaceutical scaffolds. Key to this approach is the use of tetrabutylammonium (nBu4N+) as a counterion for intrinsically anionic PNPS donor. The role of nBu4N+ goes far beyond simple charge balance; the coordination of nBu4N+ with sulfate in PNPS activates the sulfuryl donor by elongating the S–O bond and enhancing the leaving ability of nitrophenolate group. This unique activation model facilitates the transfer of sulfuryl group to diverse alcohols and phenols under simple and mild reaction conditions, thereby demonstrating its utility for site-selective O-sulfation with multiple hydroxyl groups.

 Schistosomiasis, a neglected tropical disease, is transmitted by freshwater snails. Interruption of transmission will require novel vector-focused interventions. We performed a genome-wide association study of African snails, Biomphalaria sudanica, exposed to Schistosoma mansoni in an endemic area of high transmission in Kenya. Two snail genomic regions, SudRes1 and SudRes2, were significantly associated with snail resistance to schistosomes. SudRes1 includes receptor-like protein tyrosine phosphatases while SudRes2 includes a class of leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein coupled receptors, both comprising diverse extracellular binding domains suggestive of host-pathogen interaction. Resistant and susceptible haplotypes show numerous coding differences including presence/absence of entire genes. No loci previously tied to schistosome resistance in a neotropical snail species showed any association with compatibility suggesting that loci involved in the resistance of African vectors are distinct. Snail ancestry was also strongly correlated with parasite compatibility. These results will inform future efforts to predict and manipulate immunity of a major schistosome vector.

 β-hemoglobinopathies caused by mutations in adult-expressed HBB can be treated by re-activating the adjacent paralogous genes HBG1 and HBG2 (HBG), which are normally silenced perinatally. Although HBG expression is induced by global demethylating drugs, their mechanism is poorly understood, and toxicity limits their use. We identify the DNMT1-associated maintenance methylation protein UHRF1 as a mediator of HBG repression through a CRISPR/Cas9 screen. Loss of UHRF1 in the adult-type erythroid cell line HUDEP2 causes global demethylation and HBG activation that is reversed upon localized promoter re-methylation. Conversely, targeted demethylation of the HBG promoters activates their genes in HUDEP2 or primary CD34+ cell-derived erythroblasts. Mutation of MBD2, a CpG-methylation reading component of the NuRD co-repressor complex, recapitulates the effects of promoter demethylation. Our findings demonstrate that localized CpGmethylation at the HBG promoters facilitates gene silencing and identify a potential therapeutic approach for β-hemoglobinopathies via epigenomic editing.

 Identifying reactive sites and measuring their activities is crucial for enhancing the efficiency of every catalyst. Reactivity maps can guide the development of next-generation photocatalysts like 2D transition metal dichalcogenides, which suffer from low conversion rates. While their electrocatalytic sites are well-studied, their photocatalytic sites remain poorly understood. Using scanning photoelectrochemical microscopy, we spatially resolve the photoreactivity of MoS2 monolayers, a prototypical 2D transition metal dichalcogenide, for redox reactions, including H2 production from water. Aligned-unaligned excitation-detection measurements reveal that photogenerated holes and electrons exhibit distinct behaviors. Oxidation products localize at the excitation spot, indicating stationary holes, while photoreduction occurs up to at least 80 microns away, showing exceptional electron mobility. We also elucidate the photochemical reactivity according to the nature of the electronic excitation, showing that the internal quantum efficiency of strongly-bound A-excitons outperforms weakly-bound (free-carrier like) C-excitons across the flake. These findings offer novel guidance to rationally design 2D photocatalysts via engineering their optical and charge extraction abilities for efficient solar energy conversion.

 Oceanic fronts often support enhanced phytoplankton biomass. Yet, how fronts influence the composition of phytoplankton communities remains poorly understood. Here, we leverage 18 years of high-resolution satellite data of sea-surface temperature and ocean color-derived pigments, converted into concentrations of seven phytoplankton groups, including diatoms, prokaryotes, and five other eukaryotic groups, to examine changes in phytoplankton community composition over fronts across oligotrophic to eutrophic conditions in the Northwest Atlantic. We found a population shift towards more diatoms and less prokaryotes at fronts, while the change in proportion of the other eukaryotic groups varies. This shift accounts for up to a half of the large-scale community dissimilarity, underscoring the substantial influence of fronts on phytoplankton community composition. Our findings suggest that fronts may serve as natural diatom refuges in a warming climate, highlighting the necessity of incorporating fine-scale oceanographic features like fronts into climate models.

 Lakes are critical sentinels of climate change, yet their responses to rapid warming remain poorly understood. Here we present organic geochemical data of lacustrine sediments from eastern China during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum (56 million years ago) to unravel environmental and biotic responses to rapid warming. Organic geochemical proxies indicate ≥7 °C continental warming in East Asia, triggering cascading effects including intensified stratification, bottom-water deoxygenation, eutrophication, and methanogenesis. These processes, evidenced by isotopic, productivity, and redox proxies, parallel modern lake responses to anthropogenic forcing. During the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum, elevated methane emissions from lacustrine systems likely amplified warming through positive carbon-cycle feedbacks. Our findings highlight lakes as one of potential dynamic amplifiers of carbon cycle perturbations, providing critical insights into freshwater ecosystem resilience in a warming world. This deep-time perspective underscores the vulnerability of modern lakes to cascading ecological disruptions, informing models of ecosystem resilience and carbon-climate interactions under sustained warming.

 The Arctic has warmed significantly faster than the rest of the globe, leading to rapid sea ice decline. Anthropogenic aerosols are traditionally viewed as cooling agents that do not contribute to Arctic sea ice loss. Here we investigate how aerosol-induced changes in atmospheric circulation patterns contribute to Arctic sea ice decline using a fully-coupled global earth system model. We compared single forcing experiments to examine individual and combined effects of greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols. Aerosols contribute to intensification of the North Pacific anticyclone, which enhances heat transport into the Arctic through the Bering Strait. When combined with greenhouse gas-induced warming, aerosols have a greater impact on Arctic sea ice decline in the western Chukchi Sea compared to when either forcing acts independently. This compound effect challenges the traditional view of aerosols as solely cooling agents, demonstrating that anthropogenic aerosols can accelerate Arctic sea ice melting.

 This paper shows the first demonstration of spaceborne L-band bistatic InSAR from the Chinese Lutan-1 mission for forest vertical structural information retrieval (in this work, namely, vertical profile, forest height, and underlying topography). With the single-polarization/baseline bistatic InSAR mode of Lutan-1, the measured few-look InSAR phase height histograms compare very well with the GEDI lidar waveforms, both capturing similar characteristics of the forest vertical structural profile. The ground finding approach based on the few-look InSAR phase height histogram is further adapted to incorporate spaceborne lidar measurements from GEDI and ICESat-2/ATLAS for more robust calibration. As for the DTM estimation, two ground finding strategies are developed: one using ample spaceborne lidar samples (with the lidar height as the feature), and the other using limited spaceborne lidar samples (with the few-look InSAR phase height standard deviation as the feature), both of which rely on the statistical model relating the underlying terrain elevation to the statistics of the few-look InSAR histogram. Then, forest height is inverted using the few-look histogram that mimics using lidar waveform to derive height metrics. The large-scale DTM and forest height mosaics of 2.74 million hectares are produced over tropical rainforest of the entire Hainan island of China. Through validation with airborne lidar data, the forest height is estimated to an accuracy of ∼5 m for tropical forest up to 45 m tall (relative error 10–15 %). The InSAR-derived DTM has a negligible bias (mean value of the radar-lidar DTM deviation) as referenced to airborne lidar DTM, with the uncertainties (median absolute deviation or MAD) being dependent on topographic surface slopes: 3 m (<2°), 4 m (2°-6°), 7 m (6°-25°), and 9 m (>25°). This approach sheds light on combining ascending/descending viewing geometries of spaceborne L-band bistatic InSAR data with single polarization/baseline (e.g. Lutan-1 and its follow-on) for large-scale wall-to-wall mapping of forest vertical structural profile, height metrics/biomass, underlying topography, as well as the changes of these forest parameters."

 Accurate river water level estimation is essential for effective flood monitoring and water resources management. However, traditional techniques and single satellite observations have low accuracy and resolution. In this paper, we propose a novel method to enhance river water level estimation by fusing Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) data and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery based on advanced machine learning (ML) techniques. SAR provides high-resolution, all-weather surface imagery, while the GNSS-Reflectometry from the eight-satellite CYGNSS mission offers frequent and wide-coverage observations. Dynamic river water levels are obtained at a daily temporal resolution by extracting changes in Sentinel-1 backscattering coefficients and integrating them with the CYGNSS data's high temporal resolution feature. To guarantee the model's robustness, a ten-fold cross-validation (CV) procedure is used with incorporating 15 uniformly distributed gauge sites. Experimental results show that the data fusion method significantly improved the temporal resolution, and more importantly the precision of water level estimation. As opposed to the model without data fusion, the optimized fusion algorithm achieved a 50.74 % reduction in RMSE from 0.341 to 0.168 m, while the R was improved from 0.876 to 0.936. An improvement of over 35 % in RMSE was observed at 8 out of 15 stations. To further validate the model's generalizability, we tested it using data from 8 spatially and temporally independent hydrological stations. The fusion method reduced the RMSE from 0.479 to 0.202 m and increased the R from 0.848 to 0.927, further confirming its effectiveness in enhancing water level estimation. The findings indicate that integrating SAR imagery and CYGNSS time series data has complementary effects and enables better water level estimation."

 Permafrost degradation has been recognized for decades due to climate warming, wildfire, and infrastructure development. However, a large-scale characterization of permafrost thaw status has not been attempted before due to difficulties in ground data collection, inherent complications and heterogeneity of thaw in ecosystem-protected permafrost, and constraints of remote sensor observations and process-based modeling techniques. Here we made a first effort to map the status of permafrost thaw across a large ice-rich lowland fire-influenced landscape (2500 km2) in interior Alaska by developing a new protocol and combining decades of field measurements, repeat airborne lidar, spaceborne WorldView-2, Sentinel-2, Landsat time series products, and a terrain elevation dataset. The repeat lidar and fine-resolution imagery offered a key to solving the bottleneck issue of thaw reference data collection, which further provided an opportunity to track post-fire thaw caused by six large fires in the past 25 years in four stages over time: old thaw, lateral thaw, vertical shallow thaw and vertical deep thaw. The developed protocol achieved an overall accuracy of 79 % in classifying these thaw stages and generated a reasonable thaw pattern mainly controlled by fires and locally modified by other drivers. Identifying degradation patterns can help understand the permafrost-fire-climate system. The protocol is a valuable alternative to current thermokarst mapping techniques."

 Vegetation leaf area index (LAI) data with continuous spatio-temporal coverage are crucial for monitoring vegetation growth, predicting crop yields, and studying global environmental changes. However, due to limitations of recent satellite observations and retrieval algorithms, the prevailing operational LAI product is of low spatial resolution, which is insufficient to support fine-scale detection of land surface vegetation changes. To overcome these challenges, a novel data assimilation approach, the ENKF-NDVI (Ensemble Kalman Filter-NDVI) model, was developed to estimate LAI data with 10-m spatial and 5-day temporal resolution. Time-series normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) data with 30-m spatial and 5-day temporal resolution were used instead of 500-m resolution LAI data to depict vegetation change trends and solve the patch effects caused by the scale differences.

Validation with ground-based measurements indicates a high accuracy with R2 of 0.85 and RMSE of 0.39.

This study conducted PM2.5 sampling and component analysis at urban and suburban sites in Shenzhen in 2014, 2019, and 2024, using machine learning models to assess the impact of meteorological and source emission changes on PM2.5 trends and receptor model to identify PM2.5 sources. The results show that Shenzhen's PM2.5 levels declined by 47 % from 2014 to 2024, mostly due to long-term emission cuts, with meteorological impacts accounting for a minor 11.9 % of the change. Urban PM2.5 concentrations consistently surpass suburban ones, with both experiencing approximately 30 % declines in Phase I (2014–2019), whereas in Phase II (2019–2024), the urban site shows a greater 29 % drop compared with a 17 % drop at the suburban site, narrowing their gap. The source apportionment results show that in Phase I, the urban site's PM2.5 decline stemmed mainly from reduced vehicle emissions and secondary sulfate, while the suburban site's drop resulted from decreased secondary sulfate, ship emissions, and secondary organic aerosols. In Phase II, fugitive dust reduction is the primary driver of PM2.5 declines at both sites, though other sources also play a contributing role. Emission reductions from sources in Phase II are smaller than those in Phase I, coupled with a narrowed concentration gap between the two sites and a rising relative contribution from secondary sources, highlighting Shenzhen's need for stronger regional coordination and secondary pollutant control to lower PM2.5 levels."

 This study examines the modeling uncertainty of wind resource data stemming from the use of various planetary boundary layer (PBL) parameterizations available in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. WRF-based wind simulations spanning 20 years at 3-km resolution using 11 different PBL schemes are used to objectively investigate the uncertainty in modeling wind speed for land-based wind (LBW) and offshore wind (OSW) locations in Puerto Rico. The uncertainty in the wind modeling for the 20-year dataset is quantified using the spread index (SI) and standard deviation (SD). For virtual LBW and OSW sites, the SI and SD values are analyzed as calculated across various spatial and temporal scales. Because the PBL's atmospheric stability conditions can be characterized into two dominant categories, the study focuses on analyzing the SI and SD for daytime (mainly unstable PBL conditions) and nighttime (mainly stable PBL conditions). For wind shear (10 m–200 m) at the OSW and LBW sites, WRF-based numerical experiments indicate the following SI (or SD) ranges: 39 %–94 % (0.74 m/s–1.44 m/s) during the daytime for OSW, 50 %–75 % (0.68 m/s–1.19 m/s) during the daytime for LBW, 37 %–60 % (0.73 m/s–1.12 m/s) during the nighttime for OSW, and 57 %–143 % (0.65 m/s–1.43 m/s) during the nighttime for LBW.

 The Yangtze River Delta region (YRD) is one of the most important regions with rapid urbanization in China. The research employs the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) to investigate the influences of urbanization on precipitation patterns and intensities of predecessor rain events (PREs) induced by Typhoon Khanun (2017) in the YRD. The results indicate that using land use data during the precipitation event can improve the model simulation performance. Although the total regional precipitation remains relatively unchanged, urbanization significantly alters the spatiotemporal distribution of rainfall, resulting in enhanced precipitation in the coastal urban regions near the heavy precipitation center regions, with a maximum increase up to 52 %. In contrast, rainfall near the inland outer region of the heavy precipitation center is reduced, with a maximum decrease up to 50 %, exhibiting a prominently uneven distribution pattern, which requires adaptive zoning in flood management. Mechanistically, around the coastal urban regions near heavy precipitation centers, urbanization enhances water vapor convergence and atmospheric instability, necessitating revised stormwater infrastructure design standards for these high-risk zones; while it suppresses water vapor transport, enhancing atmospheric stability in the inland outer region. Further analysis of the cloud microphysics reveals that urbanization significantly strengthens the processes of raindrop accretion of cloud water and water vapor condensing into raindrops, thereby promoting increased rainfall in the coastal urban region; in contrast, it may weaken the processes of snow melting and water vapor condensing into raindrops, leading to reduced precipitation in the peripheral inland outer region.

 Polar regions exhibit distinctive irradiance characteristics driven by their high-latitude location, yet these features have been scarcely investigated. In this study, we present and analyze surface irradiance measurements from two sites around Longyearbyen (78.2° N) in Svalbard: Adventdalen valley and Platåberget (456 m above sea level). The Adventdalen measurements span 10 years (2013−2022) of longwave (LW) and shortwave (SW) horizontal irradiance, while SW irradiance measurements, both horizontal and tilted, cover the sunlight seasons of 2021 and 2022 at both sites. Key findings include unique irradiance features, such as downwelling SW irradiance is maximum in late May—earlier than the solstice—due to a relative low cloudiness and the snow involving an irradiance enhancement (terrain reflection and albedo enhancement). Upwelling SW irradiance, influenced by snow cover, peaks in early May but may shift with prolonged snow seasons. Albedo values from May 2012–2017 were lower than 2018–2022, suggesting earlier snowmelt and potential long-term impacts on upwelling SW irradiance. Comparatively, SW irradiance is generally higher on Platåberget, with snow cover differences leading to discrepancies in downwelling and upwelling SW irradiance, in part due to an irradiance enhancement with high albedo. The LW budget is consistently negative, averaging −34 W m−2 annually, while the SW budget drives the surface energy balance, becoming positive from late April to mid-September. These findings underscore the importance of in-situ measurements for understanding Arctic irradiance processes, which are crucial for advancing solar energy applications and climate research in polar regions."

 Extreme precipitation plays a critical role in the development of hydrological extremes with severe socio-economic and environmental impacts. Over the Tibetan Plateau (TP), extreme precipitation events have increased in frequency and intensity and are projected to rise further under climate change. However, simulations of such events in this region remain challenging due to uncertainties in the representation of cloud microphysics. While previous research has exposed the sensitivity of climate models to microphysics schemes, the atmospheric processes driving discrepancies in precipitation simulations are still not fully explored. In this study, we analyse two extreme precipitation events over the TP region using six different microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF). We assess how precipitation and related processes are represented across these schemes and identify key sources of uncertainties in precipitation simulations. Our findings reveal substantial variations in the location, intensity and timing of precipitation, with differences in accumulated amounts reaching up to 40 % depending on the microphysics scheme used. Further analysis shows that the timing and strength of convective activity are closely linked to precipitation patterns, leading to significant discrepancies across experiments. Additionally, the representation of horizontal water vapour transport plays a critical role in determining the location and intensity of precipitation by influencing moisture availability. Lastly, the modelling of cloud composition – particularly of solid-phase hydrometeors – emerges as a crucial factor in precipitation evolution, contributing substantially to the variability in simulated precipitation location and intensity."

 The present study characterizes the pre-monsoon convective clouds (PMCC) observed in the monsoon core zone and a hail-producing storm during the pre-monsoon month observed using C-band dual-polarization (CDPR) radar at the IITM's Atmospheric Research Testbed (ART) facility in Silkheda, 60 km north of Bhopal. The composite analysis of PMCC has shown that the maximum height of 35- and 50-dBZ echo tops (ETHs) is around 13 km and 11 km, respectively, indicating intense and deep convection. The mean value of Convective Available Potential Energy (CAPE) is also high for the pre-monsoon season. The composite contoured-frequency-by-altitude diagrams (CFADs) of PMCC show a high frequency of smaller values of differential reflectivity (ZDR ∼ 0 dB) and specific differential phase (KDP) above the melting layer, indicating that intense convective updrafts dominate the PMCC, causing hail/graupel particles to be rimmed heavily above the melting layer and reach greater heights. The wider distribution or higher values of ZH, ZDR, KDP, and small values of correlation coefficient ρHV (<0.95) near the surface indicate the presence of a rain-hail mixture during the pre-monsoon month.The microphysical characteristic of a hailstorm event that produced hailstones over Bhopal on 30th April 2023 is explored. It is found that the CAPE value was building up before the hailstorm event, and it was high just before the hailstone was observed over Bhopal. Time evolution of storms indicates the dominant presence of graupel/hail at 5-11 km. Graupel/hail will form due to the riming or accretion processes of cloud droplets, supercooled water, or ice particles. It has been observed that the riming process is dominant during the storm's evolution, which produces very low values of ZDR and KDP. The high value of ρHV (>0.99) at these altitudes suggests that the graupel/hail is dry. The updraft associated with a convectively unstable atmosphere exaggerates the growth of ice crystals by a rapid collection of supercooled water droplets. That ultimately led to forming graupel/hailstones through the riming process. The wet hailstones and large raindrops signatures close to the surface are also observed and are characterized by higher values of ZH (> 50 dBZ), enhanced ZDR (∼ 3–4 dB), and a depleted ρHV (< 0.95). Additionally, a KDP exceeding 1.8°/km near the surface indicates the process of hail melting/hail coated with water."
