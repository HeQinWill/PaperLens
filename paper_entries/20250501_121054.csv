10.5194/acp-25-4617-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文利用AERONET地面遥感数据，分析了全球范围内气溶胶光学性质的长期变化趋势。研究发现，全球气溶胶载荷普遍下降，散射性增强。这些变化与气溶胶成分的变化密切相关，例如东亚、欧洲和北美地区人为排放减少，印度北部人为源增加，以及阿拉伯半岛沙尘活动增加。该研究涉及气溶胶光学深度、吸收性气溶胶光学深度、单次散射反照率等关键参数，并探讨了不同气溶胶类型的变化趋势，与大气环境遥感技术，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['aerosol optical depth', 'AOD', 'Ångström exponent', 'AE', 'absorption aerosol optical depth', 'AAOD', 'single scattering albedo', 'SSA', 'Aerosol Robotic Network', 'AERONET', 'ground-based remote sensing', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality monitoring']",Zhenyu Zhang;Jing Li;Huizheng Che;Yueming Dong;Oleg Dubovik;Thomas Eck;Pawan Gupta;Brent Holben;Jhoon Kim;Elena Lind;Trailokya Saud;Sachchida Nand Tripathi;Tong Ying,Long-term trends in aerosol properties derived from AERONET measurements,"We used ground-based remote sensing data from the Aerosol Robotic Network to examine long-term trends in aerosol characteristics. We found aerosol loadings generally decreased globally, and aerosols became more scattering. These changes are closely related to variations in aerosol compositions, such as decreased anthropogenic emissions over East Asia, Europe, and North America; increased anthropogenic sources over northern India; and increased dust activity over the Arabian Peninsula. 
 Over the past 2 decades, remarkable changes in aerosol concentrations and compositions have been observed worldwide, especially over developing countries, potentially resulting in considerable changes in aerosol properties. The Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) offers high-precision measurements of aerosol optical parameters over about 1700 stations globally, many of which have long-term measurements for 1 or more decades. Here we use AERONET Level 2.0 quality-assured measurements to investigate long-term aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångström exponent (AE) trends and quality-controlled Level 1.5 inversion products to analyse trends in absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA) at stations with long-term records. We also classify the aerosol properties in these sites into six types and analyse the trends in each type. Results reveal decreases in AOD over the majority of the stations, except for northern India and the Arabian Peninsula, where AOD increased. AE (computed from the AOD within the range of 440–870 nm) decreased in Europe, eastern North America, and the Middle East but increased over South Asia and western North America. The decreased AE over Europe and eastern North America is likely due to decreased fine-mode anthropogenic aerosols, whereas that over the Arabian Peninsula is attributed to increased dust activity. Conversely, increased AE over northern India is probably attributed to increased anthropogenic emissions and decreased dust loading. Most stations in Europe, North America, East Asia, and South Asia exhibit negative trends in AAOD, whereas Solar_Village in the Arabian Peninsula has positive trends. SSA at most stations increases and exhibits opposite trends to AAOD but with several stations in North America and central Europe showing decreased SSA values. Trend analysis of different aerosol types further reveals the changes in different aerosol components that are related to AOD, AE, AAOD, and SSA trends. The reductions in aerosols in eastern North America mainly result from non-absorbing species. Reductions in both fine-mode absorbing species and non-absorbing aerosols are found over Europe and East Asia, but the reduction in absorbing species is stronger than that of non-absorbing species. Increased aerosols in Kanpur over northern India should be mainly comprised of fine-mode scattering species, whereas those in Solar_Village over the Arabian Peninsula are mainly dust. The majority of stations exhibit consistent monotonic trends across different seasons for these parameters."

Vehicular-related sources remain relevant; however, a high contribution of biomass burning was observed and correlated with sample ecotoxicity. Emerging biomass burning sources, such as forest fires and sugarcane-bagasse-based power plants, highlight the need for additional control measures alongside stricter rules concerning vehicular emissions. 
 The Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP) in Brazil has reduced its vehicular emissions in the last decades. However, it is still affected by air pollution events, mainly in the winter, characterized as a dry season. The chemical composition of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was studied in the MASP during a 100 d dry period in 2019. PM2.5 samples underwent an extensive chemical characterization (including inorganic and organic species), ecotoxicity was assessed using a bioluminescence-based assay, and submicrometer particle number size distributions were simultaneously monitored. PM2.5 concentrations exceeded the new World Health Organization's daily guidelines on 75 % of sampling days, emphasizing the need for strengthening local regulations. Source apportionment (positive matrix factorization, PMF5.0) was performed, and the sources related to vehicular emissions remain relevant (over 40 % of PM2.5). A high contribution of biomass burning was observed, reaching 25 % of PM2.5 mass and correlated with sample ecotoxicity. This input was associated with north and northwest winds, suggesting other emerging sources besides sugarcane burning (forest fires and sugarcane bagasse power plants). A mixed factor of vehicular emissions and road dust resuspension increased throughout the campaign was related to stronger winds, suggesting a significant resuspension. The sulfate secondary formation was related to humid conditions. Additionally, monitoring size particle distribution allowed the observation of particle growth on days impacted by secondary formation. The results pointed out that control measures of high-PM2.5 events should include the control of emerging biomass-burning sources in addition to stricter rules concerning vehicular emissions."

We investigate the cloud characteristics related to precipitation using several cloud cases in the United Arab Emirates with data from aircraft measurements, satellite observations, and weather radar observations. This study provides scientific support for the development of an applicable framework to examine cloud precipitation processes. 
 Water is a precious resource and is important for human health, agriculture, industry, and the environment. When water is in short supply, monitoring and predicting the current and future occurrence of precipitating clouds is essential. In this study, we investigate the cloud microphysical features in several convective cloud systems in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) using multiple data sources, including aircraft measurements, satellite observations, weather radar observations, and reanalysis data. The aircraft observation dataset is from an airborne research campaign conducted in August 2019 in the UAE. The cloud cases were identified through analysis of cloud spectrometers mounted on the aircraft. Then, we investigated the microphysical features of those cloud cases, with a focus on precipitation microphysics. The effective radius of the cloud particles retrieved from geostationary satellite data was compared with the aircraft in situ measurement. Using the effective radius retrieved from satellite data, we developed a framework to identify five microphysical zones: the diffusional droplet growth zone, droplet coalescence growth zone, supercooled-water zone, mixed-phase zone, and glaciated zone. The identified zones were verified using the aircraft observations, and the transferability of the five-zone concept was tested using additional cloud cases. The results show that our five-zone concept successfully detects the microphysical features related to precipitation using satellite data in the UAE. This study provides scientific support for the development of an applicable framework to examine cloud precipitation processes and detect suitable cloud features that could be tracked for further precipitation analysis and nowcasting."

S. Anema;K. Folkert Boersma;Lieuwe G. Tilstra;Olaf N. E. Tuinder;Willem W. Verstraeten,Improved consistency in solar-induced fluorescence retrievals from GOME-2A with the SIFTER v3 algorithm,"Long-term records of plant fluorescence offer vital insights into changing vegetation activity. The GOME-2A sensor provides extensive global observations but suffers from calibration and instrument degradation, which affects data consistency. This study presents the SIFTER v3 algorithm, which effectively resolves these issues and includes other improvements, resulting in robust, accurate, and consistent GOME-2A fluorescence measurements from 2007 to 2017. 
 Space-based observations of solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) provide valuable insights into vegetation activity over time. The GOME-2A instrument, in particular, facilitates SIF retrievals with extensive global coverage and a record extending over 10 years. SIF retrievals, however, are sensitive to calibration issues, and instrument degradation complicates the construction of temporally consistent SIF records. This study introduces the improved Sun-Induced Fluorescence of Terrestrial Ecosystems Retrieval (SIFTER) v3 algorithm, designed to obtain a more accurate and reliable long-term SIF record from GOME-2A for the 2007–2017 period, building upon the previous SIFTER v2. The SIFTER v3 algorithm uses newly reprocessed level-1b Release 3 (R3) data, which provide a more homogenous record of the reflectances by eliminating spurious trends from changes in level-0 to level-1 processing. This improved consistency supports detailed analysis and correction of the reflectance degradation across the SIF retrieval window (734–758 nm). To address the reflectance degradation accurately, SIFTER v3 incorporates an advanced in-flight degradation correction that accounts for time, wavelength, and scan angle dependencies throughout the entire record. Additionally, algorithm revisions have consistently reduced the retrieval residuals by around 10 % and reduced sensitivity to water vapor absorption by better capturing the atmospheric and instrumental effects. A revised latitude bias adjustment resolves unrealistic values of GOME-2A SIF over desert areas. The SIFTER v3 dataset demonstrates improved robustness and consistency, both spatially and temporally, throughout the 2007–2017 record, and aligns closely with NASA GOME-2A SIF data and independent gross primary productivity (GPP) measurements from the global FluxSat and FLUXCOM-X products."

T. E. Türk;Jos Lelieveld;John N. Crowley,Influence of ambient NO and NO2 on the quantification of total peroxy nitrates (ΣPNs) and total alkyl nitrates (ΣANs) by thermal dissociation cavity ring-down spectroscopy (TD-CRDS),"Detection of NO2 via cavity ring-down spectroscopy (CRDS) after thermal dissociation (TD) of alkyl and peroxy nitrates can be used to detect total atmospheric organic nitrates originating from the interaction between biogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxides of anthropogenic origin. Here we present an improved TD-CRDS technique that avoids systematic bias resulting from secondary chemistry in the heated inlets and that can be deployed in regions with strong biogenic emissions. 
 Measurement of total peroxy nitrates (ΣPNs) and alkyl nitrates (ΣANs) by instruments that use thermal dissociation (TD) inlets to convert the organic nitrate to detectable NO2 may suffer from systematic bias (both positive and negative) resulting from unwanted secondary chemistry in the heated inlets. Here we review the sources of the bias and the methods used to reduce it and/or correct for it and report new experiments using (for the first time) atmospherically relevant, unsaturated, biogenic alkyl nitrates as well as two different peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) sources. We show that the commonly used commercial C3 alkyl nitrate (isopropyl nitrate, IPN) for characterising the chemistry of ANs is not appropriate for real-air samples that contain longer-chain nitrates. Mixing ratios of ANs generated in the NO3-induced oxidation of limonene are strongly positively biased in the presence of NO. By detecting NOx rather than NO2, we provide a simple solution to avoid the bias caused by the conversion of NO to NO2 by primary and secondary peroxy radicals resulting from the complex chemistry in the thermal degradation of long-chain, alkyl nitrates in air at TD temperatures. We also show that using a photochemical source of PAN to characterise the TD inlets can result in a much stronger apparent bias from NO to NO2 conversion than for a diffusion source of synthesised (“pure”) PAN at similar mixing ratios, especially if high acetone concentrations (and thus radical concentrations) are involved. This is explained by the presence of thermally labile trace gases such as peracetic acid (CH3C(O)OOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)."

It tracks well seasonal and interannual changes and will contribute to the understanding of processes influenced by upper-ocean salinity, including ice formation/melt. 
 This paper presents newly developed Sea Surface Salinity (SSS) products for the Southern Ocean (SO), derived from SMOS (Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity) measurements by the Barcelona Expert Center (BEC). The primary challenges in retrieving SSS from L-band brightness temperature (TB) measurements in the Southern Ocean include degraded sensitivity in cold waters, radiometric signal contamination near sea ice edges and low variability in SSS across the region. To address these challenges, significant improvements were made to the retrieval algorithms. The BEC SO SSS product v1.0 delivers 9-day SSS maps on a 25 km EASE-SL grid, generated daily.

 The Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF) holds several petabytes of climate data distributed across millions of files held in data centres worldwide. The processes of obtaining and manipulating the scientific information (climate variables) held in these files are non-trivial. The ESGF Virtual Aggregation is one of several solutions to provide an out-of-the-box aggregated and analysis-ready view of those variables. Here, we discuss the ESGF Virtual Aggregation in the context of the existing infrastructure and some of those other solutions providing analysis-ready data. We describe how it is constructed, how it can be used, and its benefits for model evaluation data analysis tasks, and we provide some performance evaluation. It will be seen that the ESGF Virtual Aggregation provides a sustainable solution to some of the problems encountered in producing analysis-ready data without the cost of data replication to different formats, albeit at the cost of more data movement within the analysis compared to some alternatives. If heavily used, it may also require more ESGF data servers than are currently deployed in data node deployments. The need for such data servers should be a component of ongoing discussions about the future of the ESGF and its constituent core services."

We extended an adjoint method to optimize spatiotemporally varying parameters together with the atmosphere forcing and the initial conditions using satellite and in-situ observations. Seasonally, this scheme demonstrates a more prominent advantage in mid-autumn and show great potential for accurately reproducing the Arctic changes. 
 Parameters in sea ice-ocean coupled models greatly affect the simulated ocean and sea ice evolution, and are normally tunned to bring the model state close to the observations. Using an adjoint method, spatiotemporally varying parameters of Arctic sea ice-ocean coupled model are optimized simultaneously with the initial condition and the atmospheric forcing by assimilating satellite and in-situ observations. The assimilation results show that the joint state and parameter estimation (SPE) substantially improves the sea ice concentration simulation. Particularly in October when the ocean surface starts to refreeze, SPE reduces the lead closing parameter Ho, which determines the minimum ice thickness formed in the open water, to increase the lateral sea ice growth and facilitate the seasonal rapid sea ice recovery in the Pacific sector. Comparisons with sea ice thickness observations from the moored upward looking sonars and Ice Mass Balance buoys demonstrate that the inclusion of model parameters in the optimization also leads to better sea ice thickness estimation. Overall, the adjoint-based SPE scheme has the potential to better reproduce the Arctic ocean and sea ice state and will be applied to reproduce a new Arctic sea ice-ocean reanalysis."

Creamean,Airborne Bacteria over Thawing Permafrost Landscapes in the Arctic,"Rapid warming in the Arctic, outpacing global rates, is driving significant changes in cryospheric landscapes, including the release of long-preserved microorganisms. This study focuses on thawing permafrost in Northern Alaska, where microbes previously preserved in frozen soils are introduced into thermokarst lakes, rivers, and coastal waters and may also become airborne as bioaerosols. We present the first microbial composition measurements of bioaerosols in Alaska, identifying their local sources, such as soils, water bodies, and vegetation. Although sea/brackish water is the dominant bioaerosol contributor, we provide the first evidence of permafrost microbial signatures in bioaerosols from permafrost-laden regions. Permafrost is highly enriched with ice nucleating particles (INPs), which play a crucial role in cloud formation, precipitation processes, and radiation budget despite their relatively low atmospheric concentrations. With rising Arctic temperatures, increased permafrost thaw could result in higher levels of airborne permafrost-derived microbes and biological INPs active at warmer subzero temperatures. This, in turn, could enhance precipitation, further accelerating the permafrost thaw. Our findings emphasize the complex interactions between terrestrial changes and atmospheric processes, revealing a potential feedback loop that could intensify permafrost thaw and its broader environmental impacts."

Accurate quantification of the presence of the OLAs in soil is crucial for understanding their occurrence and environmental fate. In this study, we synthesized sequence-defined OLA standards and deuterated OLAs (d-OLAs) and developed a broad-spectrum extraction method with water-saturated ethyl acetate and 0.1% formic acid, achieving sensitive and precise quantification of the OLAs across various soil environments. The simulated experiments showed that PLA-based products released amounts of OLAs, reaching their peak within 24 h, followed by degradation, with the OLAs remaining detectable in the soil for up to 168 h. Meanwhile, the OLA with a degree of polymerization (DP) of 2 exhibited the highest concentration, while higher-DP OLAs demonstrated greater stability in soil compared to others. In the field samples, OLAs were detected in soil over the long term beneath PLA-based biodegradable mulch films with residual concentrations reaching up to 16.10 ± 0.37 ng/g.

Key aspects such as size effects, crystal facet effects, bimetallic effects, heterojunction interface effects, defect effects, and particle aggregation effects will be examined through recent case studies, focusing on their impact on photocatalytic water decontamination efficiency.

Quantifying methane emissions and understanding the attributes driving these emissions are important for evaluating the scale of the environmental risks and informing mitigation strategies. With our national-scale direct measurement database of 494 non-producing wells across Canada, we find total annual methane emissions from non-producing wells in Canada to be 230 kt/year (51–560 kt/year) for 2023, which is 7 (1.5–16) times higher than estimated in Canada’s National Inventory Report (34 kt/year) and accounts for 13% of total fugitive emissions from oil and natural gas systems in Canada. We show that the role of well attributes in methane emissions is best evaluated by considering the emitting component (wellhead/surface casing vent) and the spatial scale (e.g., national, provincial, subprovincial). Large uncertainties in methane emissions from non-producing wells can be reduced not only with additional measurements but also with detailed well attribute analysis using direct measurements. Identifying attributes linked to high emitters can also be used to prioritize mitigation, thereby reducing methane emissions and broader environmental risks."

Here, C57BL/6J male mice were exposed to TPHP or DPHP for 12 weeks at estimated daily intake doses of 0.1 and 7 μg/kg bw/day. TPHP intake affected the levels of short-chain fatty acids and bile acids in the gut, enhancing the production of 29 medium- and long-chain fatty acids in the liver by 3.72-fold and significantly increasing hepatic lipid and cholesterol levels. Metabolomic and molecular analysis confirmed that elevated liver cholesterol levels persisted after an 8 week recovery period. Gut microbiota-dependent cholesterol alterations were the toxic end points observed in TPHP-fed mice, as supported by the results of fecal microbiota transplantation. In DPHP-fed mice, serotonergic and glutamatergic synapses were simultaneously altered in the liver and intestine, corresponding to the reduction of five brain neurotransmitters (15.4–60.8%).

Field investigation revealed consistent supersaturated d-CH4 in surface water (relative to the theoretical value of d-CH4 at atmospheric equilibrium), with significant seasonal variations. Statistical analysis highlighted the direct impact of algal dynamics and the indirect effect of temperature and nutrients on d-CH4. Further lab-scale incubation demonstrated that CH4 production decreased by 55.25 to 93.65% with algae removal, while it increased 4 to 10 times with methylphosphonate (MPn) amendment. These findings argued that CH4 produced from algal metabolism related to MPn had a high potential for supersaturated d-CH4.

Protein-based iron storage compartments, such as ferritins, play a key role in maintaining iron homeostasis when the iron level surpasses microbial requirements. However, the energy-intensive nature of iron storage raises questions about how microbes balance this bioprocess between growth and metabolism. Here, using nitrate-dependent methanotrophic bacteria with the simplified metabolic system as a model, we propose a novel metabolic reprogramming pathway regulated by iron storage that controls the balance between growth and activity. Isotopic labeling and meta-omics analyses revealed a striking contrast between bacterial abundance and methane-dependent denitrification activity in “Ca. M. sinica”. Using microscopy and energy dispersive spectroscopy, we identified iron-rich nanoparticles within cells exposed to 40 μM Fe2+, alongside increased expression of genes involved in iron metabolism and methane oxidation coupled with denitrification. Additionally, we observed a shift from the energy-demanding Calvin cycle to the more energy-efficient serine pathway for carbon fixation, promoting the synthesis of glycine and succinyl-CoA, which serve as key precursors for iron storage proteins. These metabolic adjustments highlight a strategy for coordinating both substance and energy metabolism in nitrate-dependent methanotrophic bacteria, thereby enhancing their capacity for simultaneous nitrogen and carbon removal. Our findings reveal that iron may act as a metabolic “switch” in microorganisms, offering new insights into the targeted manipulation of microbial metabolism to maximize their beneficial functions in both engineered and natural environments."

However, emerging evidence suggests that TCs also transport pollutants over long distances, with their full impact on pollutant dynamics still underexplored. In this study, aerosol transport and chemical transformation during Hurricane Matthew (2016) are analyzed using high-resolution WRF-Chem simulations. The Hurricane-Driven Aerosol Transport Analysis Framework (WHDA-TAF) is developed to assess aerosol behavior under both current and future climate scenarios. Simulations based on Pseudo Global Warming (PGW) projections indicate that aerosols, such as sea salt, particulate matter, and carbonaceous aerosols, are lifted to higher altitudes and dispersed far from the storm’s core. Photochemical reactions within the cyclone generate secondary pollutants such as ozone and nitrates, which can worsen air quality even after the hurricane has dissipated. Copula-based analysis reveals that stronger hurricanes in high-emission scenarios (SSP585) are likely to increase the frequency and severity of extreme compound pollution events, even in regions distant from the storm’s direct impact. These findings challenge the view of TCs as mere atmospheric cleansers, highlighting their significant role as carriers and reactors of pollutants. Enhancing model resolution is crucial to better capture such TC-aerosol interactions and address the risks of cyclone-driven aerosol transport under climate change."

Here, by mixing dry air into an aerosol flow reactor, we examine whether droplet evaporation may affect wildfire BrC by studying the aqueous nitration of catechol by HONO and darkening of the soluble component of wood smoke. Using online aethalometry and offline UV–vis analysis of particle filter extracts, we observe for the catechol/HONO system that droplet evaporation leads to significantly increased mass absorption coefficients and enhanced ratios of visible to UV absorption compared to bulk solutions, consistent with offline mass spectrometric analysis of dried particles that indicates aromatic nitration and oligomer formation. Differences between the aethalometer and UV–vis filter measurements are attributed to reactions on the dry filter that enhance BrC formation. Evaporation of wood smoke extract droplets also leads to darkening reactions but much less significantly than with catechol/HONO, as expected if only a select fraction of the wood smoke molecules react via concentration enhancement. These findings underscore droplet evaporation/drying as important to BrC atmospheric evolution and suggest that dryer usage may affect particle composition in field measurements."

Simulated tropospheric NO2 vertical column densities (VCDs) are generally higher over areas with large NOx sources when compared with retrievals, while an opposite bias is found over low NOx regions. Artificial (i.e., numerical) dilution in the model, where emissions are mathematically dispersed uniformly within the originating CTM grid, can impact modeled NO:NO2 ratios, while lower CTM VCD levels often observed over rural areas can be attributed to missing emission sources of NOx or flawed horizontal/vertical transport. Potential causes of both low and high biases are assessed in this study using CMAQ and Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) NO2 retrievals. It was found that more detailed modeling of NOx plumes to assess the NO:NO2 ratio in two power plant plumes can mitigate the effect of artificial computational dilution, reducing the bias and overall differences in the observed vs modeled plumes (errors reduced by 30%). Adjustments of upper tropospheric NO2 led to overall improvements, with a reduction in CMAQ bias (−43% to −29%) and improved spatial correlation (0.81 to 0.86).

This study addresses this critical gap by investigating the impact of PFCs on endothelial cell function, a key determinant of cardiovascular health. Through a machine learning-based quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) model, we analyzed 16 structural descriptors for 23 environmentally prevalent PFCs with respect to their binding affinities to endothelial cell receptors. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm suggested short-chain PFCs with strong acid groups may as particularly detrimental to endothelial cells, a finding substantiated by subsequent cell culture experiments. We also integrated computational and experimental approaches, providing a detailed understanding of the structure–activity and dose–response relationships of PFCs. Furthermore, the population health risk assessment, linking in vitro adverse effect with in vivo exposure data, indicated differences in risks across countries due to the global shift in the fluoride industry; the entire Chinese population is at high risk, with risk varying by gender and industrialization level.

Traditionally, quantitative climatic measures of storm activity have been mostly based on Eulerian measures, taking into account the mean state of the atmosphere and how those affect Eulerian eddy activity, but they do not consider the Lagrangian growth of the storms themselves. Here, using ERA‐5 reanalysis data and tracking all extratropical storms (cyclones and anticyclones) from 83 years of data, we examine the actual growth of the storms and compare it to the Eulerian characteristics of the background state as the storms develop. In the limit of weak baroclinicity, we find that baroclinicity provides a good measure for storm maximum intensity. However, this monotonic relationship breaks for high baroclinicity levels. We show that although the actual growth rate of individual storms monotonically increases with baroclinicity, the reduction in maximum intensity at high baroclinicity is caused by a decrease in storm growth time. Based on the Lagrangian analysis, we suggest a nonlinear correction to the traditional linear connection between baroclinicity and storms' activity. Then, we show that a simplified model of storm growth, incorporating the baroclinicity effect on the vertical tilt of anomalies, reproduces the observed nonlinear relationship. Expanding the analysis to include the mean flow's barotropic properties highlights their marginal effect on storm growth rate, but the crucial impact on growth time. Our results emphasize the potential of Lagrangianly studying storm dynamics to advance understanding of the midlatitude climate."

Results show that under the weather pattern featured by a low‐level vortex (LLV) over western SCB with water vapor transport by southerly winds, the YGP and TP can increase the precipitation in western SCB by 86% and 46%, respectively.

 Short-duration precipitation extremes pose a risk to human lives and infrastructure and may be strongly affected by climate change. In the past two decades, several studies reported that extreme rainfall intensity can increase with temperature at rates exceeding the thermodynamic Clausius–Clapeyron rate. Two explanations have been proposed for this: (1) convective precipitation—arising from thunderstorms—might be strongly invigorated with temperature; (2) a statistical shift from low-intensity stratiform rainfall to higher-intensity convective rainfall might amplify the scaling rate with temperature. Here we use high spatio-temporal-resolution lightning records in Europe to test these two hypotheses at the storm scale, that is, within 5 km spatially and 10 min temporally. We show that the statistical shift in rain type alone accounts for the observed super-Clausius–Clapeyron scaling rate, and when considered in isolation, both stratiform and convective precipitation extremes increase at the Clausius–Clapeyron rate—thus refuting hypothesis (1). Mesoscale convective systems, which play a dominant role in generating precipitation extremes, do feature a super-Clausius–Clapeyron scaling rate because of a substantial increase in their convective fraction with dew point temperature above 14 °C. Analyses of intensity–duration–frequency curves show that extreme sub-hourly storms are the most strongly intensified with higher dew point temperatures. Warming-induced changes in extreme precipitation intensity that exceed the Clausius–Clapeyron scaling rate can be explained by a statistical shift from stratiform to convective precipitation, according to an analysis of lightning records across Europe."

 Bamboo’s native structure, defined by the vertical growth pattern of its vascular bundles and parenchyma cell tissue, limits its application in advanced engineering materials. Here we show an innovative method that controls localized moisture content to shape natural bamboo into a versatile three-dimensional (3D) structural product. Different temperatures along the transverse direction of bamboo were used to induce directional water transport within the bamboo, so that the distribution of internal stress was shifted from the bamboo surface to the inner layers. The internal stress shifting enabled the control of the transverse deformation. After densification, a 3D-molded bamboo product was obtained that retained the natural heterogeneous structure. The molded bamboo had a high specific strength of 740.58 MPa·kg−1·m3 and impact resistance of 2033.29 J/m, surpassing most renewable and nonrenewable engineering materials. The life cycle assessment revealed that replacing metals and polymers in structural materials with 3D-molded bamboo significantly reduces carbon emissions. Our proposed “localized moisture gradient-driven uneven drying” strategy represents a sustainable path in transforming natural bamboo into high-performance engineering materials.

Here, authors present cryo-EM structures of human riboflavin transporter RFVT2/RFVT3, revealing the structural basis for riboflavin transport and defining the determinant for pH-dependent activity of RFVT3. 
 Riboflavin (vitamin B2) is the precursor of flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), which act as key cofactors of many enzymes, thus has essential roles in cell growth and functions. Animals cannot synthesize riboflavin in situ, the intake, distribution and metabolism of which are mediated by three riboflavin transporters (RFVT1-3). Many mutations in RFVTs cause severe consequences. How RFVTs recognize and transport riboflavin remains largely unknown. Here we describe the cryo-electron microscopy structures of human RFVT2 and RFVT3 in complex with riboflavin in outward-occluded and inward-open states, respectively. Riboflavin is recognized by a conserved binding pocket in the central cavity of RFVTs, whereas two acidic residues in RFVT3 determine its pH-dependent activity. By combining the structural, computational and functional analyses, this study demonstrates the structural basis of riboflavin recognition and provides a structural framework for the mechanistic comprehension of riboflavin recognition, transport, and pathology in human RFVTs.

Through a global-scale analysis of vent viruses and their interactions, this study reveals that endemism is a key driver of viral ecology and evolution in these extreme ecosystems. 
 Viruses are ubiquitous in deep-sea hydrothermal vents, where they influence microbial communities and biogeochemistry. Yet, viral ecology and evolution remain understudied in these environments. Here, we identify 49,962 viruses from 52 globally distributed hydrothermal vent samples (10 plume, 40 deposit, and 2 diffuse flow metagenomes), and reconstruct 5708 viral metagenome-assembled genomes, the majority of which were bacteriophages. Hydrothermal viruses were largely endemic, however, some viruses were shared between geographically separated vents, predominantly between the Lau Basin and Brothers Volcano in the Pacific Ocean. Geographically distant viruses shared proteins related to core functions such as structural proteins, and rarely, proteins of auxiliary functions involved in processes such as fermentation and cobalamin biosynthesis. Common microbial hosts of viruses included members of Campylobacterota, Alpha-, and Gammaproteobacteria in deposits, and Gammaproteobacteria in plumes. Campylobacterota- and Gammaproteobacteria-infecting viruses reflected variations in hydrothermal chemistry and functional redundancy in their predicted microbial hosts, suggesting that hydrothermal geology is a driver of viral ecology and coevolution of viruses and hosts. Our results indicate that viral ecology and evolution in globally distributed hydrothermal vents is shaped by endemism and thus may have increased susceptibility to the negative impacts of deep-sea mining and anthropogenic change in ocean ecosystems.

 The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) during the Early Eocene Climatic Optimum (EECO, 56–48 million years ago) is investigated using a multi-model ensemble of deep-time climate simulations. We reveal that ENSO sea surface temperature variability during the EECO had significantly longer periodicity and stronger amplitude than present-day conditions. These changes are attributed to intensified ocean-atmosphere feedback processes and enhanced in-phase tropical inter-basin interactions within a broader ocean basin compared to the present-day. Sensitivity experiments in coupled ocean-atmosphere models suggest that tectonic changes, particularly the expansion of the tropical ocean basin, play a dominant role in amplifying ENSO variability and extending its periodicity, while stronger inter-basin connections further enhance ENSO amplitude. Elevated atmospheric CO2 levels, though driving substantial mean-state changes, partially offset the tectonic influence on ENSO variability by modifying feedback processes. These findings underscore the role of tropical ocean basin geometry and atmospheric CO2 levels in shaping ENSO variability, offering insights into past climate dynamics and implications for future projections under sustained global warming.

 The terrestrial carbon and water cycles are deeply intertwined, and their coupling is critical to shaping ecosystem processes and land-atmosphere feedback. Understanding how the carbon-water coupling (CWC) changes, which remains rarely explored, is essential for predicting eco-hydrological responses to climate change. Here, using data from eddy covariance towers and remote sensing, we demonstrate a substantial decline in the CWC strength—measured as the correlation between gross primary production and evapotranspiration—across northern ecosystems over the past two decades. This weakening is primarily driven by rising CO₂ levels, with temperature, solar radiation, and precipitation playing secondary roles. Land surface models in the TRENDY project fail to capture this weakening synchronization, primarily due to their inadequate representation of the effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 levels. The weakening of this synchronous variation between water and carbon may signify that the ecosystems are reshaping their eco-hydrological balances across the Northern Hemisphere."

 Forests provide critical ecosystem services, including soil protection, water regulation, biodiversity conservation, and absorbing carbon dioxide emissions. Forest resilience to climate change is crucial to sustaining these ecosystems. Here, we aim to review to what extent current forest legislation in Finland supports the adaptation of forests to climate change. We also reviewed non-binding legal documents such as forest strategies and government guidelines. Finnish forest laws addressed selection of genetic material for forest regeneration as well as the management of forest after abiotic damages. Climate change was not clearly mentioned in the laws.

Overall, the present Finnish forest norms predominantly rely on a perception of low climate risk and business-as-usual management approach can sufficiently address the challenges posed by climate change.

 Microplastics (MPs) contamination in global inland waters has raised concerns recently. However, quantitative research on the abundance of MP in these environments remains limited. Here we compiled a comprehensive dataset of MPs in global inland waters from 5365 observations across 301 publications, revealing a diverse distribution of MP abundance in inland waters, ranging from 0.00 to 4,275,800.70 items m−3 (mean: 25,255.47 ± 132,808.40 items m−3). Human development index, evapotranspiration, cropland, and land surface runoff emerged as the primary factors influencing MPs levels in water. The predicting map showed particularly high MP abundance in China, but also relatively high abundance in Asia, Europe, Africa, and the eastern United States. Urgent action is needed to monitor and manage MPs in inland waters, especially the small-sized MPs (<1 mm). Implementing effective strategies to regulate plastic production and waste management is imperative for protecting freshwater ecosystems, particularly in countries with high MP pollution.

 Wildfire maintains boreal forest health by catalyzing nutrient cycling and forest succession. However, increased annual burned area due to climate warming may facilitate forest loss and soil carbon release, which makes it important to monitor circumboreal burned area. Our goal was to characterize regional changes in circumboreal burned area from 1983 to 2020 using Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) data, and to identify the ecoregions where increases in burned area represent significant trends. We accomplished this by developing and applying a new burned area mapping algorithm that is based on an autoregressive analysis of the AVHRR and MODIS MOD09CMGv061 time series. Our algorithm worked well, and resulting burned area totals were similar to those of the MODIS MCD64A1v61 burned area product for years where both were available (2001−2020); however, the advantage of our AVHRR burned area dataset is that it extends back to 1983. Based on the resulting burned area maps, we evaluated circumboreal burned area changes and tested for significant trends. Net changes were substantial: while only 5.37 % of the circumboreal biome burned in the 1980s, 8.22 % did during the 2010s, an increase of 2.85 % (= 8.22–5.37 %) that corresponds to a proportional increase in area burned of 0.53 (= 2.85/5.37). In one ecoregion, Muskwa Slave Lake Forests, burned area more than quadrupled from the 1980s to the 2010s, and in three it more than tripled (Northern Canadian Shield Taiga, Yukon Interior Dry Forests, and Northeast Siberian Taiga). Furthermore, despite interannual variability in burned area typically being high, we found statistically significant increasing trends in burned area in seven of the twenty-three boreal ecoregions, corresponding to 19.6 % of boreal forests (35 % of North American and 11 % of Eurasian boreal forests), while only one ecoregion (Eastern Canadian Shield Taiga) had a decreasing trend. By analyzing the long-term AVHRR record, we were able to capture much larger increases in burned area than from the shorter MODIS record, allowing us to quantify how widespread and substantial these increases have been. By analyzing ecoregions, we found that north-eastern Siberian, north-western Canadian, and Alaskan boreal forests have experienced the most increases in burned area. These increases in burned area may have implications for future forest persistence and carbon storage within Eurasian and North American boreal forests."

 Permafrost degradation on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has triggered widespread retrogressive thaw slumps (RTSs), affecting hydrology, carbon sequestration and infrastructure stability. To date, there is still a lack of long-term monitoring of RTSs across the TP, the thaw dynamics and comprehensive driving factors remain unclear. Here, using time-series Landsat imagery and change detection algorithm, we identified RTSs on permafrost regions of the TP from 1986 to 2020. Existing RTSs inventories and high-resolution historical imagery were employed to verify the identified results, the temporal validation of RTSs disturbance pixels demonstrated a high accuracy. In the study area, a total of 3537 RTSs were identified, covering a total area of 5997 ha, representing a 26-fold increase since 1986, and 69.2 % of RTSs formed since 2010. Most RTSs are located on gentle slope (4–12°) at elevations between 4500 m and 5300 m, with a tendency to form in alpine grassland and alpine meadow. Annual variations in RTSs area exhibited a significant positive correlation with minimum air temperature, mean land surface temperature, and annual thawing index, while it showing a significant negative correlation with the decrease in downward shortwave radiation. Spatially, RTSs were more common in areas with higher soil water content and shallower active layer. Landsat imagery captured the vast majority of RTSs on the TP and revealed interannual disturbance details, but the 30 m resolution remains inadequate for delineating the refined boundaries of some micro-scale (< 0.18 ha) RTSs. Detected RTSs disturbances on the TP will aid in hazard management and carbon feedback assessments, and our findings provide novel insights into the impacts of climate change and permafrost environments on RTSs formation."

 The analysis of online communication on social networks has become a central research interest to improve disaster management. Especially geo-referenced textual posts have been investigated extensively using techniques from Geospatial Artificial Intelligence (GeoAI), topic modelling and sentiment analysis. However, workflows are traditionally sequential with independent processing steps, limiting their ability to capture interconnections between modalities and risking chains of dependencies. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an integrated GeoAI model called the Joint Spatio-Temporal Topic-Sentiment (JSTTS) model. Our proposed method combines semantic, sentiment, spatial and temporal knowledge into continuous feature vectors and is capable of computing geographically delineated sentiment-associated clusters of topics with meaningful location and temporal information. The properties of the JSTTS model were validated experimentally and the approach was evaluated against a comparable sequential workflow. Overall, our JSTTS model achieved higher topic quality scores with an average of 0.145 compared to 0.034 for the sequential workflow and higher average sentiment uniformity with an average of 0.89 versus 0.73. At the same time, both approaches exhibited similar spatial and temporal variance. As a secondary result, the Geographic Growing Self-Organising Map (Geo-GSOM) was developed to cluster multimodal feature vectors meaningfully in geographic space. It was evaluated on artificial training data where it reproduced up to 90% of the spatial autocorrelation while the non-spatial Growing Self-Organising Map (GSOM) only achieved 55%. The learned neuron grid can also be interpreted geographically. The utility of the JSTTS approach is demonstrated through a case study on the 2021 Ahr Valley flooding in Western Germany, where it identified interpretable multimodal clusters, a subset of which proved relevant for disaster management. The approach can be extended to other use cases and adapted for different modalities, holding potential for numerous follow-up studies."

 The acceleration of the global water cycle has led to a remarkable increase in the frequency of extreme disasters such as droughts and floods under changing environment. Drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA) events, as compound events more destructive than a single flood and drought event, pose severe threats to the sustainable development of ecosystem and society. This study applied the short-cycle drought-flood abrupt transition index (SDFAI) to identify extreme DFAA events in the Wei River Basin (WRB), the largest tributary of the Yellow River Basin of China, extracting their spatiotemporal evolution and non-stationary characteristics. By integrating meteorological factors and teleconnection indices, the drivers and inherent mechanism of DFAA events were ascertained. The results indicate that: (1) Flood-to-drought (FTD) were more severe than drought-to-flood (DTF) during the rainy season. DTF events are projected to dominate after 2016, and prominent mutations in the SDFAI, Min-FTD, and Max-DTF occurring around 1980 and 1995–2001, respectively. (2) Under the main oscillation period, the periods of extreme FTD and DTF events in the WRB were concentrated at 18–30 years and 10–30 years, respectively. (3) Both meteorological factors and teleconnection indices significantly affected the DFAA events. The teleconnection indices mainly associated with the sub-basins were Southern Oscillation Index, Arctic Oscillation, and North Atlantic Oscillation, which exhibited significant resonance periods with extreme FTD and DTF events. The combined contribution of meteorological factors to DFAA events was more susceptible, and the joint effects of teleconnection indices exerted a greater influence on the contribution rate of meteorological factors."

 As a vital part of the water tower of Asia, water cycle changes in the Pamir Plateau have significant impacts on the climate of the arid inland regions of Central Asia. Using the high-precision precipitation dataset known as TPHiPr, a significant wetting trend in spring and a drying trend in summer over the Pamir Plateau from 1979 to 2020 is identified in this study. Further analysis reveals that dynamic factors are more important than thermodynamic factors in driving these precipitation trends throughout both seasons. The dynamic factors are closely linked to the anticyclonic trend in spring and the cyclonic trend in summer, both of which are influenced by long-term trends in atmospheric circulation. Furthermore, the warming trend of sea surface temperature (SST) in the North Atlantic (NA) may impact atmospheric circulation over the Pamir Plateau. In spring, the pronounced meridional gradient of potential vorticity over the NA facilitates the northward propagation of the wave train induced by the warm SST along the great circle path, resulting in an anticyclonic trend over the Pamir Plateau. In summer, the wave train excited by the heat source at 60°N propagates eastward along the jet stream, leading to a cyclonic anomaly over the Pamir Plateau. The results were also verified in the Atlantic-pacemaker simulations. Overall, this study highlights the distinct wave trains induced by the NA SST warming trend in spring and summer.

However, existing methods often disrupt the amplitude integrity of unknown signals and rely on time-consuming frequency sweeping to achieve multifrequency detection, which markedly restricts their instantaneous bandwidth, response speed, and accuracy. Here, we present a groundbreaking approach leveraging digital optical frequency comb–enabled stimulated Brillouin scattering to achieve instantaneous microwave frequency and amplitude detection, attaining a record-breaking 50.8-gigahertz bandwidth, a 1.1-megahertz accuracy, and a 500-nanosecond temporal resolution, which is three orders of magnitude improvement over that obtained with frequency sweeping schemes. In addition to conventional frequency detection, the proposed technique enables simultaneous multifrequency microwave amplitude measurement and achieves a substantial performance enhancement in the figure of merit of more than 10-fold, which paves the way for dynamic microwave signal detection and analysis."

Comparison of the whole-genome sequences of herding and nonherding breeds reveals signatures of positive selection associated with pathways underlying social interaction and cognitive functions. Of the strong selective sweep signals, haplotypes within ephrin type-B receptor 1 (EPHB1), which is linked to locomotor hyperactivity and spatial memory, show evidence of segregation within breed lineages for the conformation versus working lines of border collies and introgression with a genetically and geographically distant herding breed of Entlebucher mountain dogs. We show that a working line–specific haplotype ofEPHB1is associated with elevated levels of chase-bite motor patterns based on a well-validated behavior survey. These findings indicate that functional selection has shaped the genetic architecture of herding breeds, which may relate to their proficiency in addressing diverse tasks and challenges in maintaining control over the herd."

Clock interferometry, where particles with an internal clock are coherently split and recombined along two spatial paths, has sparked interest due to its fundamental implications, especially at the intersection of quantum mechanics and general relativity. Here, we demonstrate that a clock interferometer provides metrological improvement compared to its technical noise–limited counterpart using a single internal quantum state. This enhancement around a critical working point can be interpreted as a geometric phase–induced signal-to-noise ratio gain. In our experimental setup, we infer a sensitivity enhancement of 8.8 decibels when measuring a small difference between external fields. We estimate that tens of decibels of sensitivity enhancement could be attained for measurements with a higher atom flux. This opens the door to developing a superior probe for fundamental physics and a high-performance sensor for various technological applications."

Defects in peroxisome metabolic function restrict expansion of theLegionellavacuole membrane and cause rupture of this compartment, inhibiting bacterial replication and leading to bacterial degradation. Similarly, peroxisome dysfunction causesSalmonellareplication vacuole destabilization and reduced bacterial burden within host cells. Thus, these two intracellular bacterial pathogens exploit host cell peroxisomes to maintain their replication compartments, establishing a critical role for this organelle in disease."

Here, we present a platform to morph closed surfaces with bistability that harnesses a balanced integration of origami and kirigami principles. By harmonizing panel rotation around creases nearly tangent to the closed surface and panel rotation around hinges nearly perpendicular to the closed surface, we show that origami-kirigami assemblages can shape-morph between a cube and a sphere, scale between spheres of dissimilar size, and change topology between a sphere and a torus, with programmed bistability.

Mapping and visualizing the most detrimental TLS in the bath pinpoints the dominant sources of ubiquitous 1/fdielectric noise and energy relaxation. We also deduce the three-dimensional orientation of individual TLS electric dipole moments. Combining these insights with structural information of the underlying materials can help unravel the detailed microscopic nature and chemical origin of TLS, directing targeted strategies for their eventual mitigation."

In early stages of Alzheimer’s disease, impaired metabolism and functional connectivity of the retrosplenial cortex strongly predict future cognitive impairments. Therefore, understanding Alzheimer’s disease–related deficits in the retrosplenial cortex is critical for understanding the origins of cognitive impairment and identifying early treatment targets. Using the 5xFAD mouse model, we discovered early, sex-dependent alterations in parvalbumin-interneuron transcriptomic profiles. This corresponded with impaired parvalbumin-interneuron activity, which was sufficient to induce cognitive impairments and dysregulate retrosplenial functional connectivity. In fMRI scans from patients with mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer’s disease, we observed a similar sex-dependent dysregulation of retrosplenial cortex functional connectivity and, in postmortem tissue from subjects with Alzheimer’s disease, a loss of parvalbumin interneurons. Reversal of cognitive deficits by stimulation of parvalbumin interneurons in the retrosplenial cortex suggests that this may serve as a promising therapeutic strategy."

The amplitude of the observed distribution is smaller than predicted for maximally quantum entangled two-photon states but larger than expected for separable photons. This result can be well explained by assuming that photons from pick-off annihilation are not entangled, while photons from direct and parapositronium annihilations are maximally entangled.

We demonstrate ASE-based circuits can detect messenger RNAs with high specificity in mammalian cells via AND logic computation. The capacity of ASE-based circuits to accept messenger RNAs as inputs enables integration of endogenous cellular information for efficient multi-input information processing, demonstrated by a multi-input molecular classifier monitoring key cell reprogramming events. Reprogramming ASE-based circuit to interface with CRISPR-Cas9 enables programmable control of Cas9-targeting activity for gene editing, highlighting their potential for advancing intracellular biocomputation."

Roberts;Guillaume Dayma;Tobias P. Fischer;Jonas Kuhn,Reactive bromine in volcanic plumes confines the emission temperature and oxidation of magmatic gases at the atmospheric interface,"The redox composition of volcanic gases relays substantial information about magmatic conditions and volcanic activity. Volcanic plume gas measurements are often interpreted assuming that magmatic gases are chemically inert on emission and near-source dilution in air. Conversely, many volcanic plumes contain high levels of bromine monoxide (BrO), which is produced by atmospheric oxidation of magmatic hydrogen bromide (HBr) emissions. We investigate the chemical kinetics of hot magmatic gases mixing with air. Our model reproduces and explains observations of volcanic plume BrO at Mt. Etna, evidencing that reduced gases [HBr, as well as carbon monoxide (CO) and hydrogen (H2)] can oxidize at the hot magma–air interface. The extent of oxidation is controlled by the magmatic gas temperature. Observations of BrO and H2in Mt. Etna plume indicate that magmatic gases enter air at several hundred kelvin below magmatic temperature, consistent with hypothesized decoupling of gas temperatures from magma prior to emission."

Here, the inhalable, myofibroblast-targeted, and pH-responsive liposomes (FL-NI) were developed for effective codelivery of nintedanib, a mainstream antifibrotic drug in clinic, and siIL11, a small interfering RNA that silences the key profibrosis cytokine IL-11. Notably, FL-NI achieved a 117.8% increase in pulmonary drug delivery by noninvasive inhalation and a 71.5% increase in delivery specifically to fibroblast activation protein–positive myofibroblasts while reducing nonspecific immune cell and epithelial uptake by 29.8 and 55.8%, respectively. The accurate inhalation codelivery of nintedanib and siIL11 into myofibroblasts achieved synergistic effects, effectively enhanced myofibroblast deactivation, reduced pathological collagen deposition by 50.8%, and promoted epithelial tissue repair. FL-NI remodeled the aberrant immune microenvironment without inducing systemic toxicities. Therefore, this work demonstrated the notable potential for this pluripotent strategy for improving PF outcomes and its promising clinical translation."

Here, we replaced the conventional flexible double-stranded DNA handle force transducers with solid DNA-origami bundles to conduct single-molecule folding force-spectroscopy studies on calerythrin, a compact multidomain calcium-binding globular protein. The resulting origami-enhanced data revealed a previously “hidden” folding intermediate and the hierarchical nature of the protein’s folding pathway. A systematic comparison of the AlphaFold-predicted conformational ensemble of structures of the native state and folding intermediates across various calcium-binding proteins provides a structural rationalization for the folding behavior of this protein family. The integration of DNA origami–enhanced single-molecule experiments with in silico approaches, and structural analysis presented here, constitutes a comprehensive method to uncover the rules underlying the formation of intermediates within protein folding landscapes."

While XEC reactions between two electrophiles are well established, those involving three distinct electrophiles have remained underdeveloped. Herein, we report an intriguing formal triple XEC enabled by palladium/norbornene cooperative catalysis. Readily available aryl iodides, alkyl/aryl bromides, and propargyl esters are used as the distinct electrophilic coupling partners, leading to the synthesis of a diverse array of tetrasubstituted allenes. In particular, the challenging asymmetric formal triple XEC has also been realized through palladium/chiral norbornene cooperative catalysis, which uses the sterically hindered 2,6-disubstituted aryl bromides as the arylating reagents to prepare tetrasubstituted allenes bearing an axially chiral biaryl unit. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the selection of propargyl esters as electrophilic terminating reagents is key to the success of this reaction because it enables a thermodynamically favored pathway for reaction termination involving alkyne insertion followed by β-O elimination."

This study explores how cold mid-ocean ridge segments, such as the eastern Romanche ridge-transform intersection (ERRTI), provide unique insights into mantle heterogeneity. Here, a thick cold lithosphere faces the warm ridge segment efficiently cooling the ridge tip, thus reducing melting and mixing, and allowing distinct short-scale lithologies to be sampled. Our findings reveal a mosaic of mantle components with diverse geochemical and isotopic signatures, reflecting dynamic mantle processes over time. By examining these cold regimes, this research sheds light on the mantle’s compositional complexity and its evolution, offering a fresh perspective on lithospheric dynamics and melt generation in settings independent of hotspot influences."

Unexpectedly, there is no three-dimensional (3D) stereotaxic atlas of the mouse brain that provides whole brain coverage at macro to single-cell levels. Diffusion tensor images from five perfusion-fixed (in skull) specimens were acquired at 15 micrometers, the highest resolution ever reported. Diffusion tensor imaging yields multiple 3D volumes, each of which highlights unique cytoarchitecture. The averages were mapped into micro–computed tomography of the mouse skull to create external landmarks (bregma and lambda). Light sheet images of the same brains were coregistered, providing cell maps in the same stereotaxic space. The Allen Reference Atlas was registered to the volume to correct the geometric distortion in that atlas and bring it into the stereotaxic space.

However, a scalable and efficient integrated platform for Brillouin photonics has remained elusive. Here, we leverage the well-established thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) platform to address these long-standing limitations.

Furthermore, we develop a programmable, multifunctional integrated Brillouin microwave photonic processor capable of notch filtering, bandpass filtering, or true time delay.

In 2013, a sea star wasting event decimated populations ofPisasteralong the west coast of North America. The collapse of this species in the rocky intertidal revealed an unexpected relationship between two keystone predators. In this study, we show how the loss ofPisasteralong the Monterey Peninsula, CA, USA led to an increase in mussel (Mytilus californianus) size and expansion into lower tidal zones. Before the sea star wasting event, the local sea otter population fluctuated around a near equilibrium. However, in the absence ofPisaster, sea otters increased their dietary intake on mussels, which contributed in part to a local population-level rise. These results demonstrate how the loss of a keystone predator in one ecosystem may impart population-level changes to another."

Emerging evidence supports the involvement of astrocytes in shaping relapse to opioid use through morphological rearrangements in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). However, a comprehensive assessment of astrocyte structural diversity within and between NAc subdivisions is lacking because of limitations in existing methodologies to quantify meaningful alterations in astrocyte structure. We developed a methodological pipeline that integrates supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to rigorously quantify astrocyte morphological features and spatial organization across the brain, leveraging expression of cytoskeletal markers. Application of this pipeline reveals that morphological characteristics of individual astrocytes predict their location within the NAc. Our analysis also indicates that after heroin use, astrocyte structural plasticity is impaired in portions of the NAc associated with the extinction of conditioned responses and is uniquely engaged in the dorsomedial portion of the NAc shell, an undercharacterized subdivision of the structure."

Here, we report an approach of using triboelectric effect to mechanically, reversibly switch ferroelectric polarization across α-In2Se3ferroelectric memristors. Through contact electrification and electrostatic induction effects, triboelectric units are used to sensitively detect mechanical forces and generate electrical voltage pulses to trigger α-In2Se3resistance switching.
