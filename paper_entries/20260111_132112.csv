This study used a life-cycle assessment that accounted for methane leakage to evaluate whether China’s building electrification policies can yield net climate benefits. The study focused on residential electrification across regions, covering cooking, domestic hot water, and space heating. Results show that emissions from heating regions were 4 to 6.43 times higher than those in non-heating regions. Among heating regions, the lowest emissions came from gas-based systems (wall-hung gas boilers, gas water heaters, gas stoves), emitting 37.78% less than coal-based systems. Fully electrified systems (air-source heat pumps, induction cooktops) reduced emissions by 27.25% compared to coal scenarios but emitted 16.93% more than gas-based ones. Under the current coal-dominated power mix, electrification does not necessarily reduce overall building emissions. The study identifies grid emission intensity thresholds for electrification to be climate-positive and compares them to actual regional grid factors. Findings indicate that if electrification is implemented immediately, more than 59% of regions would see an increase in greenhouse gas emissions. Projections based on a cleaner energy mix suggest tailored electrification timelines are essential. This analysis supports strategic, region-specific electrification to help China achieve carbon neutrality."

However, the role of the catalyst’s coordination sphere in regulating the reaction mechanism remains ambiguous. Here, we elucidate this structure–reactivity relationship by deploying three iron porphyrins with strategically varied ligand substitutions to activate H2O2 for bisphenol A (BPA) degradation. We demonstrate that the ligand coordination of the catalyst directs the nature of the generated FeIV-oxo species, the identity of the cogenerated radicals, and the pollutant degradation pathways. Specifically, the β-substituted catalyst exclusively generates the FeIV═O unit with a ligand π-cation radical, transforming BPA to hydroxylation products via an oxygen adduct formation pathway with strong matrix tolerance. Conversely, meso-substituted catalysts generate protonated FeIV–OH species and coexisting oxygen-centered radicals. Meso-carboxyl substitution yields (por)FeIV–OH and HO•, which synergistically induce ring cleavage of BPA through a single-electron-transfer (SET)-initiated attack. Meso-sulfoxyl substitution produces [(por)FeIV–OH]+ and HO2•, which drive quinonization of BPA via a coupled SET and hydrogen-atom-abstraction mechanism. These findings reveal that the coordination environment of the catalyst critically modulates the protonation state and reactivity of the generated high-valent iron-oxo species, thereby steering pollutant degradation toward pathway-selective transformations. This work provides fundamental mechanistic insights into the targeted detoxification of organic compounds."

We established a novel, sensitive immunotoxicity evaluation system using impairment of macrophage anti-infection capacity as a physiologically relevant end point. A comprehensive evaluation of 29 DBPs spanning 10 structural classes revealed significant immunotoxicity differences. Critically, aliphatic DBPs exhibited substantially higher immunotoxicity than cyclic DBPs, contrasting sharply with macrophage cytotoxicity rankings, where cyclic DBPs were more potent. Quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) modeling identified distinct molecular determinants: cytotoxicity depended on the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy (ELUMO), hydrophobicity (log D7.4), and total valence connection index (TVCon), while immunotoxicity correlated with the molecular zero-point energy (ZPE) and molar surface area (SA), suggesting divergent mechanisms. Furthermore, we developed a method combining direct (nonconcentrated) exposure with serum-free cell culture to assess the immunotoxicity of real water samples and found that water samples chlorinated for 12 h exhibited peak immunotoxicity. Notably, total organic halogen (TOX) showed a strong and significant positive correlation (R2 = 0.9705) with immunotoxicity, and could be a potential indicator for immunotoxicity of real disinfected water."

Biochar, a stable carbon-rich material produced through biomass pyrolysis, is an established GGR method. Straw is abundantly available in the UK and presents a viable option for large-scale biochar production. However, uncertainties regarding its feasibility remain, particularly concerning costs, spatial constraints, and facility construction. Here, we use a spatial model integrated with life cycle assessment and technoeconomic analysis to estimate the marginal cost curve for net carbon sequestration through straw-based biochar production in Great Britain (GB). Our findings reveal that straw-based biochar production in GB can achieve 0.6–1.9% of the UK’s 2050 carbon removal target at marginal costs below £75 per tCO2e. If higher-cost options are also included (i.e., without the £75 per tCO2e constraint), the total potential removal increases to 0.8–2.1%. The marginal costs are significantly influenced by the price and availability of feedstock, the value of byproducts, and the biochar yield. Our integrated spatial model helps identify optimal feedstock supply and production strategies, reducing costs and uncertainties in net carbon sequestration for biochar systems. This study elucidates the challenges and limitations of utilizing straw for large-scale biochar production in GB to support the climate change mitigation pathway."

However, its effects on mammalian reproductive systems remain poorly understood. This study investigated ovarian damage in adolescent mice following oral administration of dinotefuran at 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg/day. It also examined damage to female germline stem cells (FGSCs) cultured in vitro and exposed to 170, 1000, and 6000 ng/L dinotefuran. In mice, dinotefuran reduced the number of follicles at all stages. Furthermore, it reduced serum E2 and ovarian anti-Müllerian hormone levels and the expression of estrogen receptors (GPER1 and ERβ). Doses ≥ 0.1 mg/kg/day induced dose-dependent oxidative stress and increased PANoptosis (apoptosis, pyroptosis, and necroptosis) in the ovaries. This was accompanied by significantly elevated gene and protein levels of ZBP1- and RIPK1-PANoptosome components. Moreover, FGSCs in the ovarian cortex were significantly damaged, with decreased expression of their marker genes and proteins. In vitro exposure to dinotefuran at concentrations of 170–6000 ng/L induced similar changes in FGSCs, and procyanidin inhibited dinotefuran-induced formation of both PANoptosomes in FGSCs. These findings suggest that low-level dinotefuran exposure, both in vivo and in vitro, induces ovarian and FGSC damage in adolescent mice through the ZBP1- and RIPK1-PANoptosome."

Although ENRO primarily undergoes dealkylation as its main biotransformation pathway, the effects of this process on plants remain insufficiently understood. In this study, an in vivo solid-phase microextraction (SPME) method was developed to monitor ENRO dealkylation and associated metabolomic changes in living plants at different exposure concentrations. The accumulation trends of ENRO and dealkylated product ciprofloxacin were influenced by exposure levels. Meanwhile, activation of different metabolic pathways helped plants survive acute high ENRO stress, promoting the key processes of enhanced energy production, structural maintenance, detoxification, antioxidant defense, and membrane repair and then regain balance during prolonged exposure. Additionally, there existed a threshold for self-repair and antioxidation in plants, which employed only mild adaptation and detoxification at low ENRO concentrations. These findings offered novel insights into the regulatory mechanisms involved in ENRO dealkylation. Based on these results, we assessed the implications of using reclaimed water and biosolids containing ENRO for agricultural irrigation and fertilization. This study advances in vivo SPME-based metabolomics and provides valuable insight into plant adaptation during ENRO dealkylation, contributing to the risk assessment of wastewater reuse in agriculture."

In recent years, with the development of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS), the higher precision and accuracy have provided mass spectrometry (MS) characteristics with deeper application significance, offering new perspectives for NTS. This review briefly introduces the principles and methodologies of different MS characteristics and summarizes emerging advancements in screening strategies based on these characteristics. We innovatively propose a target–nontarget to nontarget screening workflow, which links different MS characteristics to achieve comprehensive NTS. This workflow prioritizes the currently applied MS characteristics, aiming to integrate various analytical steps to expand the screening coverage while maintaining reliability. The prioritization includes 1) mass defect (MD) analysis, 2) isotope patterns, 3) characteristic fragments, 4) construction of MS characteristics through chemical reactions, and 5) intermolecular connectivity MS characteristics mining. Subsequently, we provided an overview of the mining and prediction of MS characteristics based on machine learning. Finally, we evaluated the challenges of transitioning from target–nontarget to nontarget workflows and proposed future perspectives for NTS."

Rosti,Effect of Submerged Vegetation on Water Surface Geometry and Air–Water Momentum Transfer,"Understanding how submerged vegetation modifies the water surface is crucial for modeling momentum exchange between shallow waters and the atmosphere. In particular, quantifying its impact on the equivalent aerodynamic roughness of the water surface is essential for improved boundary‐layer parameterization in oceanic and atmospheric models. In this Letter, we present fully resolved multiphase simulations of gravity‐driven flow over a fully submerged vegetated bed, capturing the coupled dynamics of air, water, and individual plant stems, under quasi‐realistic conditions (the air/water viscosity ratio is real, while the density ratio is reduced tenfold). Our results show that vegetation submerged for four times its height regularizes the water surface suppressing strong deformations and homogenizing streamwise‐propagating wave fronts along the transversal direction. Despite these alterations, the equivalent roughness perceived by the overlying air flow remains unchanged. These findings clarify vegetation–surface interactions and provide quantitative insights for nature‐based wave mitigation strategies and atmospheric boundary‐layer modeling."

Using dense array data from the North China Plain, we resolve multicomponent multimodal Rayleigh and Love wave dispersion with unprecedented detail. The results reveal several distinct dispersion characteristics, including stronger excitation of higher modes on horizontal components, opposite polarity of the first higher mode on the ZR‐RZ component, and a switching of the dominant Rayleigh mode between vertical and horizontal components at low frequencies. We also identify and confirm mode kissing between fundamental and first higher Rayleigh modes and guided P modes arising from normal mode and leaky mode coupling. These dispersion characteristics are primarily controlled by the shallow low‐velocity sediments, which govern frequency‐dependent mode excitation, polarity, and energy partitioning. Integrating these multicomponent multimodal observations improves the physical interpretability and reliability of subsurface imaging."

Polvani,Increasing Frequency and Persistence of the Summertime Greenland High Regime Not Captured by a Seasonal Prediction Model Very Large Ensemble,"Weather regimes are widely used in weather prediction, but less often to study climate variability and change. Here, we use a year‐round North American regime classification to identify summertime circulation trends from 1981 to 2024. We find large increases in the frequency, persistence and interannual variability of the Greenland High (GH) regime, similar to Greenland blocking. A simple Markov model shows that the observed increased GH frequency and variability can arise from increased persistence. We then show that a 10,000‐member ensemble using SEAS5 seasonal model data fails to capture the observed trend in GH frequency because persistence trends are too weak. This occurs despite SEAS5 producing summers with more GH days and individual regimes more persistent than observed, so the issue is not simply an overall lack of persistence. Hence, the missing trends must arise from fundamental model deficiencies which develop on subseasonal timescales and are not rectified by initialization."

Zhang;Junjun Li;Xiaoqi Xu;Xin He;Cheng Sun,An Approach for Simultaneous Estimation of Entrainment and Detrainment Rates in Deep Convective Clouds,"Estimating entrainment and detrainment rates (ε and δ) for convective clouds from observational data is critical for quantitatively understanding the physical mechanisms of cloud‐environment interactions. Currently, no direct approaches exist to estimate δ from observational data of deep convective clouds (DCCs), hindering the characterization of detrainment processes in DCCs. To fill this gap, this study proposes a new precipitation efficiency‐based (PE‐based) approach for simultaneously estimating ε and δ in DCCs by introducing precipitation efficiency in the conservation equation of total water, thereby addressing the nonconservation of total water in precipitating DCCs. Evaluation using numerical simulations shows that the PE‐based approach yields ε and δ with magnitudes and vertical variations comparable with those estimated using the bulk‐plume approach, confirming its reliability. Sensitivity tests reveal that the variations of presumed entrained air properties have minimal impact on estimated ε and δ. Increasing the fraction of in‐cloud air in the presumed detrained air leads to larger δ values, while ε remains largely unaffected. Higher precipitation efficiency increases both ε and δ estimates, with a more pronounced effect on δ. Further comparisons between the PE‐based and bulk‐plume approaches identify the optimal precipitation efficiency for accurate estimation. Finally, the application of the PE‐based approach to aircraft observations of DCCs reveals that δ is greater than ε. The proposed approach can be applied to DCC observations to derive ε and δ data sets, ultimately contributing to advancements in parameterizations for DCCs."

The Added Value of a High‐Top Model, UA‐ICON","Infrasound monitoring activities that deal with long‐range acoustic propagation, as within the Comprehensive Nuclear‐Test‐Ban Treaty's (CTBT), need accurate and operational modeling of the atmosphere up to the lower thermosphere. Yet, operational meteorological products issued by weather services are topped at around 80 km altitude with a sponge layer starting in the stratosphere. This prevents reliable simulation of atmospheric dynamics where infrasound waveguides form. Hence, investigating higher‐top atmospheric models enabling simulations at typical operational horizontal resolutions (∼10 ${\sim} 10$ km) are of high interest to improve the description of the propagation medium, which is needed to localize and characterizes acoustic sources of interest. The extension of the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model to the upper‐atmosphere, UA‐ICON with a model top of 150 km, is run at the ICON operational horizontal resolution. Simulations are compared with LiDAR observations at three different sites and with operational analyses. We demonstrate the better performance of the UA‐ICON simulations compared to operational models in the mesosphere, especially for the temperature field while it is less clear for the winds. This is achieved by tuning the nonorographic gravity wave (GW) parameterization coefficient that drives the saturation and breaking of the waves. Additionally, infrasound propagation simulations are performed using UA‐ICON atmospheric specifications. For the two case studies, one at high latitudes and one in tropical regions, we demonstrate the added value of the UA‐ICON with a tuned GW parameterization, while also illustrating how infrasound can contribute to model validation and tuning in the upper‐atmosphere."

Operational Analyses,"Operational analysis products issued by weather services are needed for the Comprehensive Nuclear‐Test‐Ban Treaty's (CTBT) infrasound monitoring activities. They provide atmospheric specifications as high as 80 km altitude. They are used to feed propagation simulations designed to characterize sources of interest. Acoustic waveguides for long‐range infrasound propagation form in the lower and middle atmosphere between approximately 10 and 110 km. Analysis products have biases in the stratosphere and above due to the decreasing amount of operational observations available for data assimilation systems. We investigate differences between two state‐of‐the‐art analysis products, namely that of the Integrated Forecasting System, IFS, from the European Center for Medium‐range Weather Forecast and that of the ICOsahedral Non‐hydrostatic model, ICON, from the German Weather Service. We compare their differing predictions of acoustic waveguides across the International Monitoring System (IMS) of the CTBT. We demonstrate significant differences in prediction of waveguide strength in the equatorial region, related to different amplitudes of the westerly phase of the Semi‐Annual Oscillation. Waveguide occurrence predictions can differ by up to 40% $\%$ across the IMS, in the meridional and zonal directions. We quantify biases with respect to LiDAR wind and temperature observations at three sites. We demonstrate biases of up to 40% $\%$ and 60% $\%$ in terms of waveguide occurrence prediction for ICON and IFS, respectively, using the Institute for Atmospheric Physics's LiDAR simultaneous wind and temperature observations.

By 2100, MMM inter‐basin contrasts strengthen, with freshening in the tropical Indian Ocean (TIO) and equatorial‐northern Pacific (ENPO), and saltening in the southern Pacific (SPO) and tropical Atlantic (TAO). Basin‐scale future SSS changes are primarily driven by surface freshwater fluxes, with lateral advection redistributing anomalies within each basin. Precipitation dominates the freshwater flux changes, except in the tropical Atlantic where evaporation plays a key role. Two uncorrelated indices, contrasting SPO versus TIO and TAO versus ENPO, explain 76% of the variance across models. Physically, stronger relative warming of the Northern Hemisphere enhances rainfall over the TIO monsoon region (freshening) while suppressing rainfall along the South Pacific Convergence Zone (saltening). The increasing TAO–ENPO contrast arises from two distinct mechanisms: in the Pacific, an enhanced El Niño–like warming pattern reduces atmospheric stability, intensifying rainfall and freshening ENPO; in the Atlantic, saltening reflects stronger evaporation under warmer conditions, though at a weaker rate than predicted by Clausius–Clapeyron scaling (∼ ${\sim} $4.2 vs. ∼ ${\sim} $7% K−1 ${\mathrm{K}}^{-1}$). Previous studies linked strengthening of inter‐basin salinity gradients to a thermodynamically intensified hydrological cycle. Our analysis highlights a more nuanced picture: Atlantic saltening reflects this thermodynamic control, while SSS changes elsewhere are mainly driven by atmospheric circulation and rainfall changes tied to uneven SST warming. The CMIP6 statistical analyses highlight dynamical mechanisms that motivate further testing through targeted ocean simulations."

Here, authors propose a diffractive magic cube network to address this challenge. 
 Free-space wavefront manipulation devices have emerged as powerful platforms for advanced optical information systems. In response to the challenges posed by the exponential growth of optical information, optical multiplexing and dynamic reconfigurable devices are being actively explored to the enhance system capacity. Among them, coarse-grained mechanically reconfigurable mechanism offers a cost-effective and low-complexity approach for capacity enhancement. However, the channel numbers achieved in current studies are insufficient for practical applications because of inadequate mechanical transformations and suboptimal optimization models. In this article, a diffractive magic cube network (DMCN) is proposed to advance the multiplexing capacity of mechanically reconfigurable system. We utilized the diffractive deep neural network (D2NN) model to jointly optimize the subset of channels generated by the combination of three mechanical operations, permutation, translation, and rotation. The 144-channel holograms, 108-channel single/double focus, 60-channel single/multi-mode OAM beam generation were experimentally demonstrated using diffractive optical elements (DOEs). An equivalent connectivity law was formulated to improve model scalability. Our strategy not only provides a novel paradigm to improve system capacity to super-high level with low crosstalk, but also paves the way for new advancements in optical storage, computing, communication, and photolithography.

The authors demonstrate here the importance of the transcription factor HHEX in maintaining glucocorticoid levels and protecting lipid droplets from androgen-induced lipid depletion. 
 Glucocorticoid-producing cells of the adrenal cortex (i.e. zona fasciculata, zF) constitute the critical effectors of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, mediating the mammalian stress response. With glucocorticoids being essential for life, zF dysfunction perturbs multiple organs that participate in optimizing cardiometabolic fitness. The zF forms a dynamic and heterogenous cell population endowed with the capacity to remodel through the engagement of both proliferative and differentiation programs that enable the adrenal to adapt and respond to diverse stressors. However, the mechanisms that sustain such differential responsiveness remain poorly understood. In this study, we resolve the transcriptome of the steroidogenic lineage by scRNA-seq using Sf1-Crehigh; RosamT/mG reporter mice. We identify HHEX, a homeodomain protein, as the most enriched transcription factor in glucocorticoid-producing cells. We utilize genetic mouse models to demonstrate that Hhex deletion causes glucocorticoid deficiency in male animals. Molecularly, we demonstrate that HHEX is an androgen receptor (AR) target gene, shaping the sexual dimorphism of the adrenal gland by repressing the female transcriptional program at puberty, while also maintaining zF cholesterol ester content by protecting lipid droplets from androgen-induced-lipophagy. Moreover, our study reveals that, in both sexes, HHEX is crucial for maintaining the identity of the innermost adrenocortical cell subpopulation. Specifically, loss of HHEX impairs the expression of Abcb1b (P-glycoprotein/MDR1), an efflux pump regulating steroid export and cellular levels of xenobiotics. Together, these data demonstrate that HHEX serves as a multi-functional regulator of post-natal adrenal maturation that is potentiated by androgens. In the adrenal cortex, cholesterol used for steroid production is stored in lipid droplets. The authors demonstrate here the importance of the transcription factor HHEX in maintaining glucocorticoid levels and protecting lipid droplets from androgen-induced lipid depletion."

This achieved high spin injection efficiency in both graphene and MoS2, enabling future large-scale spintronic devices. 
 Efficient and reliable spin injection at room temperature with scalability is crucial for spintronic applications but remains challenging. Direct ferromagnetic metal deposition on two-dimensional materials often leads to inefficient transparent contacts. Here, we introduce an indium buffer layer between ferromagnetic cobalt (Co) and graphene to establish high-efficiency van der Waals (vdW) tunnel contacts. This buffer layer facilitates a physisorption interface between Co and graphene with a well-defined vdW gap, which functions as an effective spin tunnel barrier. Through buffer layer thickness optimization, we achieved a room-temperature spin injection efficiency of approximately 25% in graphene, comparable to the best single-crystalline oxide-tunnel-barrier-based devices, alongside explicit nonlocal spin valve signals and Hanle spin precession. We further demonstrate the scalability of our approach through uniform performance across multi-channel graphene spin valves and its versatility by achieving efficient spin injection in semiconducting MoS2 with an average efficiency of about 19.7%.

 Instabilities can generate fast and amplified motion in mechanical systems. Here, we present an elasto-magnetic instability that combines magnetic attraction and elastic tension to create bistable dynamics. To demonstrate this, we built a coupled elasto-magnetic vibration system that produces amplified motion and greater displacement and force than a control system across a wide frequency range. We also establish design principles that can be applied to different configurations by studying the balance between magnetic and elastic forces. The system also shows inertial hysteresis, which enables mechanical memory by storing external inputs in volatile and non-volatile modes with adjustable thresholds. This dual function of amplification and memory shows how instabilities can be potentially used for programmable and adaptive soft actuation. Here the authors utilize magnetic attraction and elastic tension to create instabilities that amplify vibrations and induce inertia-driven hysteresis.

The thickness of typical receiver elastomers can be reduced to 6.7 μm for large-scale electronic skins. 
 Electronic skin (E-skin) with multifunctionality and large-scale features is highly desirable for human-machine interactions and wearable health monitoring. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) affords such devices with tailorable physical and chemical properties. However, relatively high Young’s modulus of precursors that derive LIG hinders its application scenarios. Here, we report a universal cryogenic transfer approach for LIG via regulating the glass transition temperature or freezing point of the transfer media. The thermal expansion-induced interlocking, ease of interfacial separation and strong electrostatic interactions within the multiple graphene layers explain the transfer mechanisms. This contributes to the high-quality transfer of LIG onto elastomers, hydrogels and fabrics infused with various fluids. The thickness of typical elastomer can be down to 6.7 μm with its Young’s modulus ranging from 4.5 MPa to 3.9 kPa. Using this transfer technique, we create large-scale and double-layer E-skins integrated on a humanoid robot face, achieving emotional interactions with humans. The proposed strategy for merging LIG with broad categories of media affords on-demand designs of wearable and implantable electronics.

This study identifies JUL1 as a non–cell-autonomous regulator that connects vascular development with the refinement of leaf polarity. 
 The interplay between vascular development and leaf development is central to the evolutionary success of vascular plants, yet the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here, we identify the RNA-binding protein JULGI1 (JUL1) as a key integrator of vascular and leaf development in Arabidopsis. JUL1 is transcribed in leaf veins, while the protein distributes throughout the leaf, where it binds G-rich regions of pri-MIR165a transcripts on the abaxial side. This interaction disrupts hairpin formation and inhibits DICER-LIKE1 (DCL1)-mediated processing, reducing miR165/166 levels. Consequently, transcript levels of their targets, the Class III homeodomain leucine zipper (HD-ZIP III), increase, reinforcing adaxial-abaxial polarity. Our findings reveal a non-cell-autonomous mechanism by which vascular-derived JUL1 modulates miRNA biogenesis to coordinate leaf patterning with vascular development. Leaf and vein development must be precisely coordinated, yet the molecular signals linking these processes have remained unclear.

 Traditional natural disaster response involves significant coordinated teamwork, where speed and efficiency are key. Nonetheless, human limitations can delay critical actions and inadvertently increase human and economic losses. Agentic Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) offer an avenue to address this challenge, with the potential for substantial socio-economic impact, particularly by improving resilience and resource access in underdeveloped regions. We introduce DisasTeller, a multi-LVLM-powered framework designed to automate tasks in post-disaster management, including on-site assessment, emergency alerts, resource allocation, and recovery planning. By coordinating four specialised LVLM agents with GPT-4 as the core, DisasTeller can accelerate disaster response activities, reducing human execution time and structuring information flow. Our evaluation shows both benefits and challenges: while DisasTeller streamlines coordination and report generation, errors in early-stage assessments may propagate downstream, highlighting the need for human validation and improved LVLM accuracy. This framework acts as a complementary support system to expert teams, bridging the gap between traditional response methods and emerging LVLM-driven efficiency, while highlighting the importance of continued refinement and collaboration for safe, trustworthy deployment.

 The Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is the leading mode of North Pacific climate variability, yet its response to climate change remains uncertain. Here, we use Linear Inverse Model (LIM) diagnostics to decompose PDO into three dynamical constituents: the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) mode, the North Pacific–Central Tropical Pacific (NP-CP) mode, and the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) mode. Applying an observationally derived LIM large ensemble, we show that the relative importance of these modes varies substantially over 85-year periods due to internal climate variability—requiring at least 300 years for stationary estimates. LIMs trained on climate model ensembles reveal that, despite comparable variability, models exhibit systematic biases in representing the spatial structures of the KOE and NP-CP modes. Under global warming, models project a more dominant ENSO contribution and a diminished KOE influence, leading to a shortened PDO timescale. This LIM-based dynamical decomposition enables more direct comparisons of PDO mechanisms between models and observations."

 Marker components are critical for accurately identifying fine particle (PM2.5) sources. Current marker identification is subjective, and the widely adopted markers to distinguish sub-types of biomass burning (BB) emissions are impossible. Here, PM2.5 samples from the combustion of ten biomass types were collected, and 102 chemical components were analyzed. Results indicated that the mass fractions of K⁺, K, and levoglucosan (LEV) varied in 0.1%–8.4% (2.4 ± 2.2%), 0.1%–14.1% (3.2 ± 3.1%), and 0.1%–4.9% (2.1 ± 1.4%). Source profiles for the ten sub-types of BB differed notably according to their coefficient of divergence values (0.33–0.72). It implied that there existed species which can separate PM2.5 from the ten types of BB. Ten widely used specific species ratios in literatures cannot effectively distinguish sub-types of BB due to the value overlap. A k-means identified LEV and fatty acid (C16:0) as the common markers for the ten sub-types of BB. C16:0 was firstly proposed and verified as a marker for BB here. With a random forest and the current dataset, the subtype-specific markers for only four sub-type sources were identified and verified. We indicated that there is no necessary relationship between markers and their mass percentages.

 Impact-generated shock waves can modify the remanent magnetization preserved in target rocks, yet their effects remain poorly constrained. Here we examine how shock waves modify rock magnetization by analysing unshocked granitoids and diorites, and shock-affected monomict breccia and impact melt rock of the Paleoproterozoic Dhala impact structure in India. Microscopic, thermomagnetic and hysteresis analyses were used to identify magnetic minerals and their domain states. Remanent magnetization and demagnetization experiments were performed to evaluate shock effects on the palaeomagnetic behaviour of impact-generated and unshocked target rocks. The unshocked rocks contain strong and stable magnetization carried by titanomagnetite. In contrast, the monomict breccia carries titanomagnetite and titanohematite and shows extremely weak and unstable magnetization, consistent with shock-related grain-size reduction and microfracturing. Impact melt rocks display intermediate behaviour, with titanomagnetite, titanohematite and pyrrhotite as magnetic carriers. These results show that shock can substantially reduce crustal magnetization. The results help to explain weak magnetic signatures at terrestrial and planetary impact structures, even in the presence of an ambient magnetic field.

 Changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, climate, and land management influence the abundance and distribution of C3 and C4 plants, yet their impact on the global carbon cycle remains uncertain. Here, we use a parsimonious model of C3 and C4 plant distribution, based on optimality principles, combined with a simplified representation of the global carbon cycle, to assess how shifts in plant abundances driven by carbon dioxide and climate affect global gross primary production, land carbon isotope discrimination, and the isotopic composition of atmospheric carbon dioxide. We estimate that the proportion of C4 plants in total biomass declined from about 16% to 12% between 1982 and 2016, despite an increase in the abundance of C4 crops. This decline reflects the reduced competitive advantage of C4 photosynthesis in a carbon dioxide-enriched atmosphere. As a result, global gross primary production rose by approximately 16.5 ± 1.8 petagrams of carbon, and land carbon isotope discrimination increased by 0.017 ± 0.001‰ per year. Accounting for changes in C3 and C4 abundances reduces the difference between observed and modeled trends in atmospheric carbon isotope composition, but does not fully explain the observed decrease, pointing to additional, unaccounted drivers.

 Storm-induced waves threaten ship traffic and offshore infrastructures, yet observing water surfaces remains challenging because of complex air-water interactions and limited spatial coverage. We used distributed acoustic sensing measurements from a telecom fiber-optic cable in Lake Ontario, one of the world’s largest lakes, to analyze wind-wave evolution at tens-of-meter scales along a 43-km-long array. By combining observations and modeling, we found that chaotic waves induced by local wind forcing and wave-wave interactions generate high-frequency microseisms (1–4 Hz), whereas frequency variations in low-frequency microseisms (0.2–1 Hz) are strongly controlled by wind speed and fetch evolution. We tracked changes in frequency and energy throughout the full life cycle of wind waves, from chaotic conditions to organized gravity waves formed under steady winds, followed by dissipation as fetch decreases. These results are particularly relevant for fetch-limited water bodies and highlight the potential of distributed acoustic sensing for real-time monitoring of wind waves, with implications for coastal hazards, ecosystem dynamics, and wave-energy development.

 Despite the widespread presence of americium in the environment since the 1950s from nuclear activities, the use of americium isotopic composition to trace contamination sources has not been investigated. Here we report the detection of 243Am in environmental samples and demonstrate that the ratio of 243Am to 241Am can serve as a distinctive fingerprint of radioactive emissions, with characteristic values of 0.05 for thermonuclear explosions, 0.023 for global fallout, below 0.0015 for low-yield nuclear tests, and 0.0013 for releases from a nuclear reprocessing facility.

 September 2023 featured an unprecedented temperature jump of nearly 0.6 °C above September 2022. Although climate models hardly reproduce such an event, it remains unclear whether the extreme heat could have been caused by internal variability alone or how large an external contribution would be needed to render it plausible. Here we show, based on observational and climate model data, that the temperature jump was virtually impossible under standard anthropogenic forcing, but its probability increases to 0.1% when probabilistic attribution is combined with a process-based analysis to account for contributions that models may underrepresent. Our findings reveal that the heat was disproportionately concentrated over land, particularly in the extratropics. The event resulted from a complex interplay of feedbacks and forcings, with unusually high shortwave forcing amplified by water vapour feedback. Although extreme temperature jumps in September are projected to intensify gradually under additional warming, an internally driven jump of comparable magnitude remains highly unlikely during the next decades.

 Severe wildfire seasons in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) raise questions regarding long-term fire dynamics and their drivers. However, data on long-term fire history remains scarce across eastern Siberia. Here we present a composite of reconstructed wildfire dynamics in Yakutia throughout the Holocene, based on eight newly contributed records of macroscopic charcoal in lake sediments in combination with published data. Increased biomass burning occurred in the Early Holocene, c. 10,000 years BP, before shifting to lower levels at c. 6000 years BP. Independent simulations of climate-driven burned area in an individual-based forest model reproduce this reconstructed Holocene trend, but the correlation on multi-centennial timescales turns negative in the Late Holocene. This mismatch suggests that climate alone cannot explain Late Holocene wildfire dynamics. We propose that a human dimension needs to be considered. By example of the settlement of the pastoralist Sakha people c. 800 years BP, we show that implementing reduced fuel availability from Indigenous land management in the forest model leads to increased multi-centennial-scale correlations. This study highlights the need for a better understanding of the poorly reported human dimension of past fire dynamics in eastern Siberia.

 Landslide-dammed lakes (LDL) and landslide lake outburst flood (LLOF) can significantly alter the kinematic behavior of upstream and downstream landslides, posing severe threats to human life and infrastructure. However, the long-term impacts of LDL and LLOF on surrounding landslide stability remain poorly understood. In this study, we systematically examine the cascading effects triggered by the 2018 Baige LDL and LLOF on adjacent landslides, based on time series interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) analysis of 1437 satellite radar images. Unlike previous studies that focused on individual landslides or localized areas, we developed an automated method to detect the onset of landslide acceleration, leading to the establishment of an inventory of 65 accelerated landslides (ALs) and a quantitative evaluation of their controlling factors. Our results show that approximately 30 % of the flood-affected active landslides changed their deformation mechanisms, which can be categorized into five distinct types. Among the landslides accelerated by the Baige event, 43 % exhibited persistent acceleration, whereas 57 % showed signs of self-recovery. For the latter, deformation velocity typically decayed by 90 % within an average of 9.3 years after the outburst, returning to near pre-event levels. Furthermore, compared to 378 flood-involved but non-ALs, ALs preferentially occur on gentler slopes and in areas with lower vegetation cover. More notably, those ALs generally experienced greater flood depth, higher flow velocity, and stronger flood power. This study is the first to assess the long-lasting cascading effects of LDL and LLOF on creep landslides. These findings advance our understanding of LDL and LLOF-induced landslide mechanisms and offer valuable insights for the long-term risk assessment and geohazard mitigation of landslide-prone regions affected by similar cascading processes."

 This study maps forest structural diversity, a key component of ecosystem diversity, using NASA's GEDI spaceborne lidar, providing new opportunities to support conservation and restoration efforts. Focusing on biodiversity hotspots in Central Africa and the Western US, we evaluated GEDI's ability to capture spatial variation in forest canopy structure by comparing GEDI-derived metrics with 391 km2 of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. Forest structural traits were assessed at 1 km2 resolution, with GEDI showing robust correlations with ALS, particularly in dense and flat Central African forests (r2 up to 0.85), and moderate agreement in more heterogeneous terrain in the California Sierra Nevada (r2 up to 0.55). We quantified structural diversity as horizontal variation in canopy structure using a probability density-based multivariate diversity framework. GEDI canopy height (rh98), canopy cover, and foliage height diversity jointly captured independent axes of canopy variation and explained structural diversity derived from wall-to-wall ALS (r2 = 0.37 at 1 km2). Resulting maps reveal high structural diversity in mid-elevation and coastal forests of the Western US and in forest-savanna transitions and volcanic ranges of Central Africa, consistent with gradients in disturbance, topography and aridity. Despite limitations related to sampling density, waveform noise and terrain complexity, this study demonstrates that GEDI's footprint-level metrics can be used directly to quantify forest structural diversity. These findings highlight the potential of spaceborne lidar to provide scalable, trait-based structural diversity indicators, while emphasizing that interpretation remains context dependent and benefits from integration with ecological data, environmental drivers and disturbance regimes."

This new model takes advantage of two advanced deep-learning techniques, the Swin Transformer and UPerNet (named STUPmask), demonstrating improved cloud detection accuracy and strong adaptability to diverse imagery types, spanning spectral bands from visible to thermal infrared and spatial resolutions from meters to kilometers, across a wide range of surface types, including bright scenes such as ice and desert, globally. Training and validation of the STUPmask model are conducted using data obtained from the Landsat 8 and Sentinel-2 Manually Cloud Validation Mask datasets on a global scale. STUPmask accurately estimates cloud amount with a marginal difference against reference masks (0.27 % for Landsat 8 and −0.81 % for Sentinel-2). Additionally, the model captures cloud distribution with a high overall classification accuracy (97.51 % for Landsat 8 and 96.27 % for Sentinel-2). Notably, it excels in detecting broken, thin, and semi-transparent clouds across diverse surfaces, including bright surfaces like urban and barren lands, especially with acceptable accuracy over snow and ice. These encompass the majority of challenging scenes encountered by cloud identification methods. It also adapts to cross-sensor satellite data with varying spatial resolutions (4 m–2 km) from both Low-Earth-Orbit (LEO) and Geostationary-Earth-Orbit (GEO) platforms (including GaoFen-2, MODIS, and Himawari-8), with an overall accuracy of 94.21–97.11 %. The demonstrated successes in the automatic identification of clouds with a variety of satellite imagery of different spectral channels and spatial resolutions render the method versatile for a wide range of remote sensing studies."

 As the Arctic warms, surface melt extends into the Greenland Ice Sheet's accumulation zone, where much of the water infiltrates into the snowpack. This makes monitoring the subsurface water depth and spatial extent important for accurate ice sheet runoff estimations. Subsurface water can be detected using remotely sensed microwave brightness temperatures (TB). We use vertically polarized TB at 1.4 GHz from Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity satellite (SMOS) and at 6.9, 10.7, and 18.7 GHz from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometers (AMSR-E/2) to estimate the upper depth of liquid water (UDLW) on the ice sheet accumulation area. We build a catalogue of simulated UDLW and TB: realistic UDLW are modeled by the Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland (GEUS) snow model, forced by the Copernicus Arctic Regional Reanalysis (CARRA), and the corresponding TB are calculated by the Snow Microwave Radiative Transfer (SMRT) model at 19 sites. We train on this catalogue an ensemble of cross-validated Random Forest (RF) models to predict UDLW and its uncertainty from TB at four frequencies. On hold-out modeled data and for water within 5 m of the surface, the RF ensemble achieves a median RMSE of 0.68 m and mean error of −0.09 m. Our retrieval, when applied to observed TB, matches within 2 m UDLW inferred from subsurface temperature profiles down to 4–6 m depth. Performances decrease beyond 5 m depth and for low liquid water amounts. Our retrieval produces daily UDLW maps over the ice sheet's accumulation area during 2010–2023 which reveal the seasonal evolution of UDLW, deliver the first quantitative estimates of subsurface liquid water depth on the ice sheet and offer new insights into meltwater infiltration and storage processes."

 Climate change and population growth intensify the demand for precise agriculture mapping to enhance food security. Such mapping tasks require robust modeling of multi-scale spatiotemporal patterns from fine field textures to landscape context, and from short-term phenology to full growing-season dynamics. Existing methods often process spatial and temporal features separately, limiting their ability to capture essential agricultural dynamics. While transformer-based remote sensing foundation models (RSFMs) offer unified spatiotemporal modeling ability, most of them remain suboptimal: they either use fixed windows that ignore multi-scale crop characteristics or neglect temporal information entirely. To address these gaps, we propose AgriFM, a multi-source, multi-temporal foundation model for agriculture mapping. AgriFM introduces a synchronized spatiotemporal downsampling strategy within a Video Swin Transformer backbone, enabling efficient handling of long and variable-length satellite time series while preserving multi-scale spatial and phenological information. It is pre-trained on a globally representative dataset comprising over 25 million samples from MODIS, Landsat-8/9, and Sentinel-2 with land cover fractions as pre-training supervision. AgriFM further integrates a versatile decoder specifically designed to dynamically fuse multi-source features from different stages of backbone and accommodate varying temporal lengths, thereby supporting consistent and scalable agriculture mapping across diverse satellite sources and task requirements. It supports diverse tasks including agricultural land mapping, field boundary delineation, agricultural land use/land cover mapping, and specific crop mapping (e.g., winter wheat and paddy rice) with different data sources. Comprehensive evaluations show that AgriFM consistently outperforms existing deep learning models and general-purpose RSFMs across multiple agriculture mapping tasks.

 Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human settlements. This study focuses on the Arsin Forest Sub-district Directorate, located in Trabzon, Türkiye, with the aim of developing wildfire susceptibility maps using machine learning techniques. To improve the completeness of the wildfire inventory dataset, official fire records from 2013 to 2022 were integrated with active fire pixel data obtained from the Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) for the period 2001–2012. Five machine learning models Random Forest (RF), Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) were employed to generate susceptibility maps. Model performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curves, and AUC-ROC metrics. Seventeen wildfire conditioning factors, categorized into four groups (topographic, meteorological, stand-related, and anthropogenic), were used to assess fire risk. Unlike previous studies, this research incorporates a region-specific anthropogenic variable: proximity to hazelnut cultivation. Feature importance scores were computed to determine the influence of each factor on fire occurrence. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), accompanied by graphical analysis, were used to interpret the relationships between predictors and fire events. Areas of very high fire susceptibility covering 4.62% and 4.86% of the study area were identified by the RF and GBM models, both achieving an accuracy of 0.98."

 Forest attribute maps are essential for supporting local decision-making regarding forest resource use. Such maps are produced by combining remote sensing and field data through various modeling approaches. When mapping across large areas, spatial gaps in field data used for model training are common. Our study evaluates the performance of three methods—k-Nearest Neighbor (k-NN), Random Forests (RF), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)—for forest resource mapping across Norway, Sweden, and Finland in an experimental setup with respect to availability of field data around the target area. Models were trained with sample plot sizes (N) ranging from 100 to 3000. RF consistently produced the most accurate predictions in terms of relative bias and RMSE. While spatial gaps in the training data (radius: 7–141 km) affected %RMSE of broad-leaved above ground biomass (AGB), they had minimal impact on %RMSE of both local and country-level predictions of total AGB and volume. For RF with N=3000, %RMSE of total AGB ranged between 53%–55% in Finland and Sweden, and 70%–72% in Norway across gap sizes. However, %bias increased for local predictions across the whole study region with larger gaps: RF with N=500 showed bias of −12%–12% (7 km gap) and −17%–28% (78 km gap). Similarly, country-level %bias of total AGB for Norway increased from −1.7% to −3.7% with larger gaps. In conclusion, spatial gaps in training data can significantly affect bias in predictions. Therefore, forest attribute maps should always be accompanied by metadata describing the training data used."

 The impact of emissions from large urban centers on atmospheric chemistry and regional climate is a central issue in atmospheric sciences. This study uses WRF-Chem and GoAmazon2014/5 data to assess how urban and forest emissions interact to influence cloud properties in the Amazon. The region around Manaus, in the central Amazon, provides a unique environment for this study worldwide. During the wet season, clean air masses transported by trade winds interact with urban emissions, altering the atmosphere's chemical composition and impacting clouds microphysical and radiative properties. The interaction between urban emissions from Manaus and emissions from the Amazon rainforest modulates aerosol concentration and size. Polluted clouds exhibit a smaller effective radius (De), while liquid water content (LWC) and cloud droplet number concentration (DNC) are higher. In background areas, the DNC is approximately 50 cm−3 and exceeds 150 cm−3 under highly polluted conditions. The higher LWC observed in polluted clouds is associated with the increased DNC, while the smaller De may delay the onset of rainfall. The amount of water vapor available in the atmosphere and the level of supersaturation determine how urban emissions influence the microphysical processes of cloud formation. Under low LWC conditions, warm precipitation is suppressed, while for high LWC (above 0.75 g m−3), the De increases until reaching levels associated with precipitation. These results highlight that the spatial and temporal variation in CCN concentration, modulated by the interaction between urban emissions and those from the tropical rainforest, plays a significant role in cloud microphysical processes in the central Amazon."

 Differences in black carbon (BC) emissions and diverse climate zones in China result in significant spatial heterogeneity of BC levels. Understanding the roles of emissions, meteorological conditions, and other factors in BC variation is important for mitigating its adverse effects. This study conducted synchronous observations of BC in Changchun (CC), Tianjin (TJ), Wuhan (WH), and Guangzhou (GZ) during winter. Results showed that BC levels were highest in WH compared to the other cities (p < 0.001). Simulations using the Flexible Particle Dispersion (FLEXPART) model and BC emission inventories quantified the contributions from local transport and different sectors. Results indicated that local emissions were the dominant geographical source of observed BC levels at all four sites. BC from residential, commercial, and other sectors was the dominant source in TJ, WH, and GZ. Using the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method, emissions were identified as the predominant factor influencing BC variation at the four sites. While changes in meteorological conditions were the most influential factor contributing to BC concentration increases as air quality worsened from clean to polluted in CC, TJ, and WH. Regarding the impacts of features on model outputs, emissions showed a linear relationship with simulated BC, while the effects of transport and meteorological conditions exhibited spatial heterogeneity. This study highlights the need for continuous reduction of BC emissions to decrease ambient BC levels, and this recommendation can be extended to other parts of the country."
