Byrom;Gunnar Myhre;Øivind Hodnebrog;Dirk Olivié;Michael Schulz,Investigating the role of stratospheric ozone as a driver of inter-model spread in CO2 effective radiative forcing,"Addressing the cause of model spread in CO2 effective radiative forcing (ERF) is important for reducing uncertainty in climate change. We investigate stratospheric O3 as a driver of this spread by altering its concentration by 50 % and analysing the impact on CO2 forcing. Our experiments show a significant effect on stratospheric temperature that impacts instantaneous radiative forcing, primarily due to the influence on longwave emission. However, the impact on ERF is minimal. 
 Addressing the cause of inter-model spread in carbon dioxide (CO2) radiative forcing is essential for reducing uncertainty in estimates of climate sensitivity. Recent studies have demonstrated that a large proportion of this spread arises from variance in model base-state climatology, particularly the specification of stratospheric temperature, which itself plays a dominant role in determining the magnitude of CO2 forcing. Here, we investigate stratospheric ozone (O3) as a cause of inter-model differences in stratospheric temperature, and hence its role as a contributing factor to spread in CO2 radiative forcing. We use the Norwegian Earth System Model 2 (NorESM2) to analyse the impact of systematic increases and decreases in stratospheric O3 on the magnitude of 4xCO2 effective radiative forcing (ERF) and its components. Firstly, we demonstrate that the accurate estimation of instantaneous radiative forcing (IRF) requires the use of host-model radiative transfer calculations. Secondly, we show that a 50 % increase or decrease in the stratospheric O3 concentration leads to significant differences in the base-state stratospheric temperature, ranging from +6 to −9 K, respectively. These experiments impact IRF primarily due to the influence of the base-state stratospheric temperature on the emission of outgoing longwave radiation, with the spectral overlap of CO2 and O3 playing a subsidiary role. However, the impact on IRF does not result in a correspondingly large spread in CO2 ERF. We conclude that inter-model differences in stratospheric O3 concentration are, therefore, not predominantly responsible for inter-model spread in CO2 ERF."

It showed different characteristics of cloud residual and interstitial particles. Stronger particle hygroscopicity reduced liquid water content and smaller cloud droplet diameters. This investigation contributes to understanding aerosol–cloud interactions by assessing the impact of aerosol particles on cloud microphysics. 
 An automatic switched inlet system, incorporating a ground-based counterflow virtual impactor (GCVI) and a PM2.5 impactor, was developed and employed to investigate the particle number size distributions (PNSDs) and chemical composition for cloud-free (CF), cloud interstitial (CI), and cloud residual (CR) particles at Mt. Daming in the Yangtze River Delta, China, throughout a 1-month period in spring 2023. The PNSDs of CF particles were primarily characterized by a significant Aitken mode alongside a secondary accumulation mode. In contrast, CI and CR particles exhibited unimodal distribution with Aitken and accumulation modes, peaking at 56 and 220 nm, respectively. With the fast changes of PNSDs during the onset stage of the observed four typical cloud processes, it can be inferred that the critical diameters activated as cloud droplets ranging from 133–325 nm. Particularly noteworthy was the higher hygroscopicity parameter, κ value observed in CR particles (0.32±0.06), associated with a larger mass fraction of nitrate, compared to the lower κ value in CI particles (0.23±0.08), with higher fraction of black carbon. For a typical cloud process, the hygroscopicity of CI particles was found to influence cloud droplet properties, with higher κ values corresponding to lower droplet number concentration, reduced liquid water content, and smaller effective cloud droplet diameters. This suggests that these CI particles are capable of absorbing ambient water vapour, thereby restricting further droplet growth. This investigation contributes to understanding aerosol–cloud interactions by assessing the impact of aerosol particles on cloud microphysics, thus enhancing overall comprehension of these complex atmospheric dynamics. However, it is noted that long-term observations are necessary to capture more cloud processes and yield statistically significant findings."

Royer;Michael T. Sheridan;Hope E. Elliott;Edmund Blades;Nurun Nahar Lata;Zezhen Cheng;Swarup China;Zihua Zhu;Andrew P. Ault;Cassandra J. Gaston,African dust transported to Barbados in the wintertime lacks indicators of chemical aging,"Saharan dust transported across the Atlantic to the Caribbean, South America, and North America is hypothesized to undergo chemical processing by acids that enhances cloud droplet formation and nutrient availability. In this study, chemical analysis performed on African dust deposited over Barbados shows that acid tracers are found mostly on sea salt and smoke particles, rather than dust, indicating that dust particles undergo minimal chemical processing. 
 The chemical processing (“aging”) of mineral dust is thought to increase dust light-scattering efficiency, cloud droplet activation, and nutrient solubility. However, the extent of African dust aging during long-range transport to the western Atlantic is poorly understood. Here, we explore African dust aging in wintertime samples collected from Barbados when dust is transported at lower altitudes. Ion chromatography (IC) analysis indicates that the mass concentrations of bulk nitrate, sulfate, and oxalate increase, relative to background conditions, when African dust reaches Barbados after transatlantic transport, indicating dust aging. However, aerosol mixing-state analysis from computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (CCSEM/EDX) indicates that approximately 67 % of dust particles are internally mixed with sea salt, while only about 26 % of dust particles contain no internally mixed components. SEM/EDX elemental mapping and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS) reveals that within internally mixed dust and sea salt particles, only sea salt components contain signs of aging as indicated by the loss of chloride and acquisition of nitrate and/or sulfate. Our results suggest that chemical aging may only modestly increase the solubility of nutrients in African dust during long-range transport. Because most dust that we measured was internally mixed with sea salt, chemical aging is not necessarily required to increase the hygroscopicity of dust, at least in the lower boundary layer. Further, our findings have implications for understanding the release of halogens from sea salts, which may be enhanced in internally mixed dust and sea salt particles."

Interfacial BOMD (Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics) simulations illustrated that FSA-mediated SO3 hydrolysis at the gas–liquid interface occurs through a stepwise mechanism and can be completed within a few picoseconds. ACDC (Atmospheric Clusters Dynamics Code) kinetic simulations indicated that FSA significantly enhances cluster formation rates in the H2SO4–NH3 system. 
 Although the nucleation route driven by sulfuric acid (H2SO4) and ammonia (NH3) primarily dominates new particle formation (NPF) in the atmosphere, exploring the role of other trace species in the H2SO4–NH3 system is crucial for a more comprehensive insight into NPF processes. Formic sulfuric anhydride (FSA) has been observed in the atmospheric environment and is found in abundance in atmospheric fine particles. Nevertheless, its effect on SO3 hydrolysis and NPF remains poorly understood. Here, we studied the enhancing effect of FSA on gaseous and interfacial SO3 hydrolysis as well as its impact on H2SO4–NH3-driven NPF occurring through quantum chemical calculations, Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code (ACDC) kinetics combined with Born–Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BOMD). Gaseous-phase findings indicate that FSA-catalyzed SO3 hydrolysis is nearly barrierless. At an [FSA] = 107 molecules cm−3, this reaction competes effectively with SO3 hydrolysis in the presence of HNO3 (109 molecules cm−3), HCOOH (108 molecules cm−3) and H2SO4 (106 molecules cm−3) in the range of 280.0–320.0 K. At the gas–liquid nanodroplet interface, BOMD simulations reveal that FSA-mediated SO3 hydrolysis follows a stepwise mechanism, completing within a few picoseconds. Notably, FSA enhances the formation rate of H2SO4–NH3 clusters by over 105 times in regions with relatively high [FSA] at elevated temperatures. Additionally, the interfacial FSA− ion has the ability to appeal precursor species for particle formation from the gaseous phase to the water nanodroplet interface, thereby facilitating particle growth. These results present new insights into both the pathways of H2SO4 formation and aerosol particle growth in the polluted boundary layer."

However, UV-driven postdepositional processes can alter nitrate in snow, making snow accumulation rates critical for preserving these records. This study examines nitrate isotopes in a southeastern Greenland ice core, where high snow accumulation minimizes these effects, providing a reliable archive of atmospheric nitrogen cycling. 
 Stable isotopes of atmospheric nitrate (NO3-) are valuable tools for tracing nitrogen sources and processes; however, their signals in ice core records are often disrupted by postdepositional processes. The ice core from the southeastern Dome (SE-Dome) in Greenland is a potential record of variations in atmospheric chemistry that has experienced a lower postdepositional effect owing to a high accumulation rate (∼1 m water equivalent per year). Herein, we report 60-year (1959–2014) δ15N(NO3-) and Δ17O(NO3-) records from the SE-Dome ice core. The δ15N(NO3-) decreased from 1960 to 1974 and exhibited clear seasonal changes (high in summer and low in winter). The Δ17O(NO3-) did not exhibit any significant long-term trends, but it did contain seasonal patterns. The mass-weighted annual average of δ15N(NO3-) values in the SE-Dome core were 4.2±2.8 ‰ lower than those in the Greenland Summit ice core between 1959 and 2006. The TRansfer of Atmospheric Nitrate Stable Isotopes To the Snow (TRANSITS) model under the SE-Dome condition estimated changes of only 0.9 ‰ for δ15N(NO3-) and −0.2 ‰ for Δ17O(NO3-) from the initial deposition. Although differences in the source of NO3- cannot be discounted, the lower δ15N(NO3-) values observed at SE-Dome compared to Summit were likely due to reduced postdepositional alteration. Therefore, the SE-Dome ice core NO3- record offers a precise reconstruction of nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from both North America and western Europe, as well as atmospheric oxidation chemistry and transport, thereby providing reliable insight into atmospheric nitrogen cycling."

We present a study of RRI measurements using optical tweezer technology and find that the calculated results of RRI using the traditional method disagree with the measurements. A parameterization of the RRI and relative humidity relationship is proposed, and it will improve the radiation calculation in numerical models. 
 Sea spray aerosols (SSAs) play a pivotal role in influencing radiative effects over oceanic regions, making it essential to accurately quantify their optical properties, particularly the real part of the refractive index (RRI) under varying relative humidity (RH) conditions. This study employs an aerosol optical tweezer (AOT) system coupled with Mie scattering theory to precisely measure the RRI of sea spray aerosols at 650 nm across a range of RH levels. First, standard ammonium sulfate particles were used to validate the AOT measurements against thermodynamic models and previously established parameterizations, confirming the reliability of the optical tweezers' measurements. Measurements of SSA from offshore and open-sea samples show consistent RRI values, independent of seawater salinity, with artificial sea salt particles effectively representing the optical properties of real SSA at RH > 70 %. A least-squares linear regression scheme linking RRI and RH was developed, allowing for accurate RRI estimation under varying RH conditions. Additionally, our scheme's intercept at RH = 0 potentially represents the molten-state RRI for sea spray aerosols, validated against standard particles. Results highlight that traditional volume-weighted mixing rules underestimate RRI and aerosol optical depth (AOD), thus reinforcing the need for direct measurement-based parameterizations. This study underscores the importance of accurately representing sea spray aerosols' radiative properties in climate models. We suggest incorporating the proposed linear regression scheme into aerosol and radiative transfer models to improve model accuracy and enhance the understanding of the effects of sea spray aerosols on radiative processes."

HARP2 uses image data of the Earth to allow scientists to measure natural processes. There exists interest in accurate polarimeter measurements of clouds and aerosols to understand climate change. In 2022, HARP2 underwent lab calibration evaluating its wide field-of-view characteristics. In doing so it was shown that key HARP2 calibration parameters possessed significant field-of-view variability. 
 The Hyper-Angular Rainbow Polarimeter (HARP2) is a wide-field-of-view (FOV) polarimeter built for the NASA Plankton Aerosol Cloud and Ocean Ecosystem (PACE) mission launched in early 2024. HARP2 measures the linear Stokes parameters across a 114° × 100° (along-track by cross-track) FOV. In the fall of 2022, HARP2 underwent calibration at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) Calibration Laboratory (Code 618). HARP2 was characterized for radiometric and polarimetric response across its FOV. We have used telecentric calibration methodology on prior iterations of HARP that involved the normalization of pixels across the FOV such that calibration parameters determined at the center of the charged coupled device (CCD) detector can be used across the entire scene. By using a dual-axis yaw–pitch motorized mount, we devised two scan patterns to evaluate this methodology for HARP2. The results show that pure intensity measurements do indeed vary minimally across the FOV and therefore can utilize the flat-field normalization (telecentric) technique. On the other hand, images of polarized targets change significantly across the FOV, and calibration parameters determined at the center of the detector used in the wide FOV perform significantly worse than calibration parameters determined at or near to the location of the test (up to 5 % mean absolute uncertainty in degree of linear polarization, DoLP). We evaluated the use of a paraboloid fit of the polarized calibration parameters, at discrete FOV locations, to determine those parameters at a pixel-level resolution. According to the wide-FOV results, this process shows a marked improvement for fully polarized (DoLP = 1) calibration data to less than 1 % uncertainty after using the paraboloid fit. These results are important for the development of any wide-FOV polarimeter, especially those like HARP2 which use a front lens which causes significant barrel distortion and a division of amplitude central optical element leveraging multiple reflections. Full characterization of the source of these optical effects remains a part of future work, but the improved methodology over the telecentric method is currently being implemented in the HARP2 L1B calibration pipeline pending internal review of the implementation in the HARP Image Processing Pipeline."

The portable and automatic tank is able to generate particle concentrations as high as 2000 cm-3, covering a wide range of sizes, similar to those found in the ambient marine boundary layer. The sea spray aerosol generated from three natural seawater samples was found to act as ice-nucleating particles (INPs) via immersion freezing. 
 Although several studies have shown that sea spray aerosol (SSA) has the potential to act as ice-nucleating particles (INPs) impacting cloud formation, there is a lack of marine INP studies in tropical latitudes. This is partly due to the unavailability of local oceanographic cruises that perform aerosol–cloud interaction studies in the tropics, as well as the scarcity of appropriate aerosol and cloud microphysics instrumentation. The present study shows the development of the UNAM-MARine Aerosol Tank (UNAM-MARAT; Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México), a device that simulates wave breaking to generate SSA particles with the main purpose of characterizing their physicochemical properties including their ice-nucleating abilities. The UNAM-MARAT was characterized using Instant Ocean Sea Salt, and its potential to study ambient seawater was evaluated with seawater samples collected from the Port of Veracruz (PoV) in the Gulf of Mexico, the Bay of Acapulco (BoA), and the Bay of Santiago-Manzanillo (BoSM) in the Mexican Pacific Ocean. The portable and automatic UNAM-MARAT is able to generate aerosol particle concentrations as high as 2000 cm−3 covering a wide range of sizes, from 30 nm to 10 µm, similar to those found in the ambient marine boundary layer. The SSA generated from the three natural seawater samples was found to act as INPs via immersion freezing, with INP concentrations as high as 130.7 L−1. The particles generated from the BoA seawater samples were the most efficient INPs, reporting the highest ice-active site density (ns) values between −20 and −30 °C. Our results also show the direct relationship between particle size and its composition. Larger particles (> 1 µm) were found to be enriched in sodium chloride. In contrast, the fraction of Ca2+, Mg2+, and NO3- was found to increase with decreasing particle size from 10 µm to 320 nm. This suggests important differences in the presence of dissolved organic material in the submicron particles related to the sampling zone and possibly the behavior of the SSA."

 The Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) general circulation model with an upper-atmospheric extension (UA-ICON) in the configuration with the physics package for numerical weather prediction (NWP) is presented with optimized parameter settings for the non-orographic and orographic gravity wave drag (GWD) parameterizations as UA-ICON(NWP) (version ua-icon-2.1). We implemented optimized parameter settings for the GWD parameterizations to achieve more realistic mesosphere/lower thermosphere (MLT) temperatures and zonal winds. The parameter optimization is based on perpetual January simulations targeting the thermal and dynamic states of the MLT and the Northern Hemisphere stratosphere. The climatology and variability of the Northern Hemisphere stratospheric winter circulation improve widely when applying UA-ICON with the NWP physics package compared to UA-ICON with ECHAM physics. The thermal and dynamic states of the MLT of the re-tuned UA-ICON(NWP) are likewise improved compared with UA-ICON(NWP) using default settings. A statistical evaluation of UA-ICON(NWP) reveals a slight improvement in the stratosphere–mesosphere coupling compared to UA-ICON(ECHAM). The cold summer mesopause, the warm winter stratopause, and the related wind reversals are reasonably simulated. Furthermore, the GWD parameter optimization significantly improves the frequency of major sudden stratospheric warmings (SSWs). However, the seasonal distribution needs improvement, and the relative frequency of split-vortex SSWs is underestimated compared to reanalyses, as is the zonal wavenumber-2 preconditioning of SSWs. This indicates that zonal wavenumber-2 forcing in UA-ICON(NWP) is underrepresented. The analysis of migrating diurnal and semidiurnal tides in temperature shows good agreement of UA-ICON(NWP) with Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER)-derived tides, and the enhancement of the migrating semidiurnal tide during SSWs is represented well in UA-ICON(NWP)."

In this study, we introduce a novel kinetic framework that distinguishes surface reaction kinetics (kc) from conventional solution-phase kinetics (kb), using nitrogen-doped porous carbon (NPC) as a model catalyst with high adsorption capacity and exceptional efficacy in peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation. By directly analyzing the selective oxidation of fully adsorbed para-substituted phenolic compounds (p-PCs), we precisely quantified kc and established robust QSAR models with remarkable linear correlations (R2 = 0.862–0.912) to molecular descriptors such as Hammett constant (σ), highest occupied molecular orbital energy (EHOMO), and ionization potential (IP). In contrast, kb-based models showed weaker correlations (R2 = 0.363–0.551), reflecting interference from adsorption–desorption dynamics. This distinction underscores the limitations of solution-phase kinetics in systems with strong adsorption properties and highlights the enhanced mechanistic understanding and predictive power of surface-specific models. Further analysis revealed surface-selective oxidation via an electron transfer pathway, predominantly governed by the electronic properties of p-PCs rather than their adsorption affinity. These findings provide a valuable approach to accurately capture surface reactivity and predicting pollutant behavior in heterogeneous sorption–oxidation systems."

However, the complexity of the wastewater treatment processes, coupled with numerous control parameters and influencing factors, makes intelligent assessment and monitoring challenging. Traditional data mining and machine learning (ML) approaches often overlook partial multimodal factors such as applied treatment process technologies, leading to suboptimal predictions. To address this, this study proposed a multimodal learning (MML)-based framework for predicting effluent water quality and toxicity in WWTPs. Representation fusion and decision fusion strategies were adopted to optimize the MML models’ performance. Additionally, a novel 3C-Encoding strategy was proposed to tackle the challenges of encoding process information. The results demonstrated that MML models achieved significant improvements over traditional methods (R2 increase ranging from 0.057 to 0.234). The final MML models exhibited remarkable performance with an average R2 of 0.874 for water quality and an R2 of 0.904 for toxicity.

Record;Benjamin Tupper;Kenneth Douyon;Lauren Drakopulos;Lourdes Vera;Johnathan Evanilla,Harmful Algae Forecasting through an Ocean Data Justice Lens,"Forecasting systems for harmful algal blooms (HABs) are becoming more common, as HAB monitoring is increasingly networked and aggregated at national and global scales. Ocean forecasting programs in other fields have had unintended consequences and out-of-scope uses. The field of Data Justice provides a perspective for understanding unintended harm caused by the application of data technologies generally and is now being applied to environmental fields. With the proliferation of artificial intelligence algorithms and widespread environmental surveillance, it is timely to turn the Data Justice lens toward environmental applications such as the prediction of HABs. We surveyed three global data repositories underpinning HAB monitoring and prediction efforts: the Ocean Biodiversity Information System, the Harmful Algae Event Database, and AlgaeBase, as well as a literature corpus and the ocean forecasting literature. The patterns we found reflect and potentially reinforce the existing economic and political relations that underpin global ocean stresses, with monitoring and knowledge concentrated in high-GDP, northern North Atlantic nations, and biases toward the visibility of taxa relevant to those regions. Principles from Data Justice research, such as from Design Justice and Algorithmic Accountability, provide guidance for centering equity and access, while building global data and forecast systems for HABs."

This could overlook the sensitive toxicity end point and key toxicants due to the random experiment selection, or it might incur high expenditures due to toxicity testing of multiple end points. In this context, a key toxicity-mechanism-based new effect-directed analysis strategy was established. The strategy is based on the key toxicity mechanisms from the transcriptome to determine subsequent toxicity tests and chemical analyses to achieve the efficient, rational, and focused identification of key toxicants in mixtures. Then, this strategy was applied to the Yangtze River samples. By transcriptome testing, the nerve growth factor and neurotrophin binding pathways showed the highest detection rate, indicating that the key toxicity mechanism is neurotoxicity. Zebrafish behavior tests were further chosen for neurotoxicity effect evaluation, and they showed significant inhibition in 64% of the samples. On the other hand, 38 and 94 neurotoxicants in samples were identified via targeted and pseudotargeted screening from 3363 potential toxicants. Further combining mechanism-based biological testing and chemical analysis for toxicant verification, this study ultimately identified seven key toxicants, such as atrazine, hexazinone, and niclosamide. The mechanism-directed EDA will open a new horizon for accurate identification and prioritization of key toxicants in the environment."

Using marine medaka as a model, this study investigated and compared the transgenerational and multigenerational neurotoxic effects on fish. The environmentally realistic concentration of TCS can induce hyperlocomotor activities and increase heart rate, while higher concentrations (>500 μg/L) can inhibit hatching and cause cardiovascular malformations and neurotransmitter imbalances. Parental (F0) exposure to TCS resulted in transgenerational effects on locomotor activities manifested in F2, alongside with alterations in phototransduction and cell adhesion pathways. Global DNA methylation analyses indicated that the observed transgenerational effects are mediated through relevant epigenetic changes. Multigenerational exposure to TCS increased locomotor activities from F1 to F3, which is associated with changes in the expression of genes related to eye structure, phototransduction, and lipid and retinol metabolisms, thereby affecting energy metabolism and visual function. Results of this study highlight the difference between transgenerational and multigenerational effects of TCS exposure, and potential biases incurred in current risk assessment based exclusively on data derived from F0, which presents challenges for environmental management and regulatory standards."

In the Eastern Mediterranean, we identify 10 distinct layering conditions characterized by specific vertical layering structures and aerosol mixing states. These configurations range from purely anthropogenic layers to complex multilayered mixtures, where marine aerosols, anthropogenic pollution, and dust occupy different altitudes, sometimes interacting or being further modified by rain. We conducted air mass back-trajectory clustering at 700 and 1700 m above ground level, linking pollution types to their transport origins. Satellite-derived aerosol optical depth biases were also systematically evaluated under various pollution scenarios, showing a strong satellite–ground correlations during dust events but poor accuracy under nondust conditions with marine–anthropogenic mixtures (35% of cases). Random Forest analyses demonstrated the potential to predict pollution layering types. Additionally, anthropogenic pollution content is increasing with altitude across all layering types, with evidence suggesting a growing prominence of anthropogenic pollution. These trends align with projections of a strengthening Persian Trough, the dominant summer synoptic system. This detailed categorization provides valuable insights into the complexity of pollution sources and atmospheric interactions in the region. The integration of vertical layering data holds significant potential, enhancing climate predictions, and pollution mitigation strategies on both local and global scales."

While rhodochrosite, a mineral commonly found in anaerobic environments, forms manganese oxide (MnOx) films upon exposure to oxygen, little is known about its role in the fate and transport of pollutants, including eARGs. This study explored how the incorporation of iron (Fe) into the rhodochrosite crystal lattice influenced its reactivity and subsequent interactions with eARGs. To this end, we systematically tuned the Fe content in rhodochrosite and compared its effect on eARG encapsulation to that of Fe-free rhodochrosite. At a Fe:Mn molar ratio of 20:80 (RCF20), the MnOx film exhibited a growth rate constant of 0.09 h–1, approximately 265 times greater than that of the Fe-free rhodochrosite. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) provided in situ observation of eARGs undergoing anaerobic adsorption and aerobic encapsulation within the MnOx film. Desorption experiments confirmed the stable encapsulation of the eARGs. The incorporation of Fe into rhodochrosite enhanced the eARG encapsulation efficiency, a finding validated with three different environmental water samples. The accelerated growth of MnOx films in Fe-incorporated rhodochrosite was attributed to a reduced bandgap, facilitating faster electron transfer during oxidation. These results introduce a novel mechanism for the stabilization of eARGs in the environment through adsorption and encapsulation within oxidized mineral films. Importantly, Fe incorporation significantly enhanced this process, offering new insights into natural self-purification mechanisms for mitigating antibiotic resistance and providing a potential strategy for controlling eARG dissemination."

Herein, the selective ratio of three kinds of representative cations (alkali metal ions, bivalent cations, and polyatomic cations) and their underlying Eyring’s enthalpy and entropy of activation for transporting through regular confined channels under pressure, concentration gradient, and electric field were quantified. Compared with the diffusion-only process, the increase in the enthalpic barriers under external pressure was attributed to the increase in the degree of ion dehydration and deformation of the ion’s own structure, especially for polyatomic ions (NH4+ and TMA+) with lower hydration energies. Moreover, the splitting of the integrated ion fluxes under pressure by the DSPM-DE model further demonstrated the enhancement of ion dehydration by forced convection, which reduced the ion transport variability under steric sieving effects while increasing the ion fluxes. The ion selectivity was greatest for electromigration, but 60-fold higher voltage (about 20 V) was required for reaching equal ion fluxes as pressure-driven transport. The thermodynamic analysis indicated that compared with the ion migration alone under an electric field, osmotic pressure in concentration diffusion and cotransport of ions and water under pressure increased the transmembrane energy barriers. This study informs the choice of membrane separation modes in different application scenarios, which could help balance selectivity and energy consumption associated with driving forces."

However, the presence, migration, and human health risks of additives in FPP have received limited attention. This study investigated 73 commonly used additives across six categories of FPP samples collected in China. A Weibull model combined with machine learning techniques was used to assess the migration of these additives into fruits and vegetables. A total of 43 additives were identified in the FPP samples, with concentrations ranging from 1.52 × 103 to 2.51 × 106 ng/g. Notably, non-phthalate plasticizers (NPPs) were found to be the most prevalent additive group. The migration ratio of additives varied from 10.5% to complete migration, influenced by factors including the molecular structure of the additives, FPP material composition, and temperature. Additives in foamed packaging exhibited the fastest migration rates and the highest migration ratios. Estimates of daily intake indicated that 2-ethylhexanoic acid (EHA) and triethyl phosphate (TEP) migrating from the FPP can pose significant health risks. These findings highlight a crucial source of health risks to humans and underscore the urgent need for the controlled and scientifically informed incorporation of additives in plastic products in the future."

However, Pt catalysts are particularly attractive, especially in sulfur-containing environments, where commercial Pd catalysts are more susceptible to sulfur poisoning. Therefore, developing highly active Pt sites and gaining a deeper understanding of the intrinsic mechanisms governing methane combustion over Pt catalysts is essential. In this study, we present a highly active stannic oxide supported platinum catalyst (Pt/SnO2) for stable low-temperature methane combustion, achieving a T90 as low as 390 °C at a high gas hourly space velocity (GHSV) of 60,000 mL·gcat–1·h–1. This performance surpasses that of most other Pt catalysts as well as Pd/SnO2 and benchmark Pd/Al2O3. The superior SO2 tolerance of Pt/SnO2 was demonstrated by the stability of methane conversion at 500 °C, with only a minor reduction observed during the long-term online test. Characterization results indicate that the Pt atoms on SnO2 are electron-deficient and predominantly adopt a crowded configuration. In situ studies and density functional theory (DFT) calculations reveal that the electron-deficient, crowded Pt atoms enhance the chemisorption of CH4 molecules by withdrawing the electrons from CH4, resulting in activated CH4 with an elongated C–H bond. This work provides an in-depth understanding of the nature of Pt active sites for high-performance methane combustion, offering valuable insights for the rational design of Pt-based catalysts."

Conventional nanofiltration membranes struggle with micropollutant removal due to inadequate steric hindrance and unfavorable interactions. This study focused on regulating micropollutant interfacial partitioning by constructing an enhanced separation interface for nanofiltration membranes. Three types of amino acids were introduced into interfacial polymerization to fabricate the amino acid-modified nanofiltration membranes. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and density functional theory (DFT) calculations revealed how amino acids regulate monomer diffusion and enable in situ chemical modification. Membrane performance evaluations showed an improved micropollutant removal by the modified membranes. Notably, the rejection of the modified membrane for neutral and positively charged micropollutants can reach up to twice that of the control membrane. The micropollutant interfacial partitioning behavior was elucidated through quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation (QCM-D) measurements and calculation analysis, demonstrating the effectiveness of interface-facilitated micropollutant removal. Additionally, the modified membrane also exhibited enhanced antifouling properties, mitigating the negative impact of the fouling layer on the micropollutant rejection. This study advances our understanding of the regulatory mechanisms governing micropollutant interfacial partitioning on nanofiltration membranes and proposes a simple yet effective strategy for removing organic micropollutants in environmental water treatment."

While doping with inorganic heteroatoms (e.g., O, N, P, S) has been widely explored, the impact of pore size and doping with inert metals/metal oxides on formaldehyde adsorption is still poorly understood. Herein, a series of novel monolithic carbons (monoC-x) featuring uniform micropore and mechanical robustness were prepared by carbonizing the zeolitic imidazolate framework monolith precursor. Among these, monoC-800, with a pore size of 0.7 nm and surface doping of ZnOx and N species, exhibits exceptional formaldehyde adsorption. This is achieved through strong electrostatic and coordination interactions, making it highly efficient in capturing trace formaldehyde molecules. As a physical adsorbent, monoC-800 is regenerable at mild temperatures without producing harmful byproducts, making it ideal for indoor air formaldehyde removal. The adsorption mechanism was explored via experimental verification and Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations, revealing the critical role of pore structure and surface species.

We employed a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer to investigate the real-time emissions of VOCs from two commercially prevalent brake materials: low-metallic copper-free (LMCF) and nonasbestos organic (NAO). Experiments were conducted using a pin-on-a-disc tribometer integrated with a fast-mobility particle sizer spectrometer. The results reveal that NAO brake pads emit higher concentrations of VOCs than LMCF pads. Over 200 different sum formulas were identified for both materials, and siloxanes were observed as characteristic of NAO emissions. The ultrafine particle formation was systematically preceded by an increase in gaseous emissions. This observation supports the thesis that ultrafine particle formation emitted by brake wear occurs through VOCs nucleation, addressing a significant gap in the literature."

However, potential HONO sources from direct or secondary pathways remain unclear, especially in industrial environments where HONO may be formed accompanied by large industrial NOx emissions. Herein, by combining field observations in a densely industrial site during summertime of 2021 and modeling results, we found that besides the currently recommended HONO formation mechanisms, including photolysis of adsorbed nitric acid and particulate nitrate, (photoenhanced) NO2 heterogeneous conversions, and direct emissions, a considerable unidentified HONO source (i.e., Pmissing) emerged in the industrial area with an increasing significance at night, whereas it did not appear in the urban and rural areas although the same parametrization was considered. When the missing gap of HONO was incorporated into a positive matrix factorization model, a significant industrial-related source dominated by the tracers of Fe, Mn, Zn, and Cu with Pmissing (ca. 76%) was first revealed, accounting for ca. 34% of HONO production in this industrial area. In addition, a good correlation (rs = 0.64, p < 0.1) between the industrial NOx emissions and atmospheric HONO abundance during the summertime of 2022–2023 also highlighted the significance of industrial HONO emissions.

Using this measurement to make substantial progress requires the separation of vortical and wavy motions owing to their contrasting ramifications for the energy transfer; however, the separation is extremely challenging due to the long‐repeat period of the SWOT satellite. To achieve a practical separation, here we adopt the linear normal‐mode initialization technique used in numerical weather prediction. This separation method requires velocity data in addition to SSH.

The strains correlate with ocean tide height variations in phase, suggesting a dominant factor of the cable's Poisson's effect.

However, for the associated convective cells, WRF overestimates the 30‐dBZ echo top height, cell area, and maximum radar reflectivity compared to radar observations. This overestimation is potentially due to under‐resolved entrainment processes, an overestimated merging frequency, and the overestimation of updraft intensity. Furthermore, the model exhibits a deficiency in simulating congestus clouds, showing a more rapid transition from shallow to deep convection compared to observed behavior. Moreover, observations indicate stronger, deeper, and wider clouds when merging happens. Conversely, in simulations, the merging process does not necessarily lead to higher or longer‐lived cells, as many cases experience rapid and frequent merging and splitting which may result in more variance in convective updraft velocity during the convection lifetime."

This study attempts to throw detailed light on how spring TP warming influences EPCA, with a particular focus on the role of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) as an intermediary. Warming in central TP since 2000 has altered meridional temperature gradients at the surface and troposphere, shifting the East Asian jet northward and resulting an anomalous anticyclone over the TP and a cyclonic anomaly over western TP. Concurrently, the weakening of the Middle East jet has triggered a cyclonic anomaly over the Arabian Sea and Indian Peninsula (IP), enhancing moisture convergence and increasing precipitation over northeastern IP. The associated diabatic heating has further intensified the cyclonic anomaly over central IP, which persists into June and promotes northward moisture transportation. Combined with the anomalous cyclone over western TP, these changes have contributed to the observed increase in EPCA. In July, the cyclonic anomaly over central IP, located further west, facilitates eastward moisture transport across northern IP. These anomalies, situated west of the monsoon trough, reflect a seasonal westward shift of the ISM and a strengthening of the South Asian High (SAH). This shift drives the development of cyclonic anomalies over eastern Central Asia and anticyclonic anomalies over western Central Asia. Meanwhile, increased low‐latitude moisture transportation to the central‐western TP and Central Asia further enhances precipitation in central TP, promoting an increase in EPCA."

 The generation of self-tolerant repertoires of T cells depends on the expression of peripheral self antigens in the thymic epithelium1 and the presence of small populations of cells that mimic the diverse phenotypes of peripheral tissues2–7. Whereas the molecular underpinnings of self-antigen expression have been extensively studied8, the developmental origins and differentiation pathways of thymic mimetic cells remain to be identified. Moreover, the histological identification of myoid and other peripheral cell types as components of the thymic microenvironment of many vertebrate species9 raises questions regarding the evolutionary origin of this unique tolerance mechanism. Here we show that during mouse development, mimetic cells appear in the microenvironment in two successive waves. Cells that exhibit transcriptional signatures characteristic of muscle, ionocyte, goblet and ciliated cells emerge before birth, whereas others, such as those that mimic enterohepatic cells and skin keratinocytes, appear postnatally. These two groups also respond differently to modulations of thymic epithelial cell progenitor pools caused by deletions of Foxn1 and Ascl1, expression of a hypomorphic variant of the transcription factor FOXN1, and overexpression of the signalling molecules BMP4 and FGF7. Differences in mimetic cell populations were also observed in thymic microenvironments reconstructed by replacement of mouse Foxn1 with evolutionarily ancient Foxn1/4 gene family members, including the Foxn4 gene of the cephalochordate amphioxus and the Foxn4 and Foxn1 genes of a cartilaginous fish. Whereas some cell types, such as ciliated cells, develop in the thymus in the absence of FOXN1, mimetic cells that appear postnatally, such as enterohepatic cells, require the activity of the vertebrate-specific transcription factor FOXN1. The thymus of cartilaginous fishes and the thymoid of lampreys, a representative of jawless vertebrates, which exhibit an alternative adaptive immune system10, also harbour cells that express genes encoding peripheral tissue components such as the liver-specific protein transthyretin. Our findings suggest an evolutionary model of successive changes of thymic epithelial genetic networks enabling the coordinated contribution of peripheral antigen expression and mimetic cell formation to achieve central tolerance for vertebrate-specific innovations of tissues such as the liver11,12.

 Understanding thermal transport mechanisms across material interfaces is crucial for advancing semiconductor technologies, particularly in miniaturized devices operating under extreme power densities1,2. Although the interface phonon-mediated processes are theoretically established3–6 as the dominant mechanism for interfacial thermal transport in semiconductors7, their nanoscale dynamics remain experimentally elusive owing to challenges in measuring the temperature and non-equilibrium phonon distributions across the buried interface8–11. Here we overcome these limitations by using in situ vibrational electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in an electron microscope to nanoscale profile temperature gradients across the AlN–SiC interface during thermal transport and map its non-equilibrium phonon occupations at sub-nanometre resolution. We observe a sharp temperature drop within about 2 nm across the interface, enabling direct extraction of relative interfacial thermal resistance (ITR). During thermal transport, the mismatch of phonon modes’ thermal conductivity at the interface causes substantial non-equilibrium phonons nearby, making the populations of interface modes different under forward and reverse heat flow and also leading to marked changes in the modal temperature of AlN optical phonons within about 3 nm of the interface. These results reveal the phonon transport dynamics at the (sub-)nanoscale and establish the inelastic phonon scattering mechanism involved by interface modes, offering valuable insights into the engineering of thermal interfaces.

 The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed unexpectedly rapid galaxy assembly in the early Universe, in tension with galaxy-formation models1–3. At the low abundances of heavy elements (metals) and dust typical in early galaxies, the formation of molecular hydrogen and its connection to star formation remain poorly understood. Some models predict that stars form in predominantly atomic gas at low metallicity4,5, in contrast to molecular gas at higher metallicities6. Despite repeated searches7, cold molecular gas has not yet been observed in any galaxy below 7% solar metallicity8. Here we report the detection of rotational emission from molecular hydrogen near the only O-type star in the 3% solar metallicity galaxy Leo P (refs. 9,10) with JWST’s Mid-Infrared Instrument/Medium Resolution Spectroscopy (MIRI-MRS) observing mode. These observations place a lower limit on Leo P’s molecular gas content, and modelling of the photodissociation region illuminated by the O star suggests a compact (≤2.6 pc radius), approximately 104 M⊙ cloud. We also report a stringent upper limit on carbon monoxide (CO) emission from a deep search with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA). Our results highlight the power of MIRI-MRS to characterize even small ultraviolet-illuminated molecular clouds in the low-metallicity regime, in which the traditional observational tracer CO is uninformative. This discovery pushes the limiting metallicity at which molecular gas is present in detectable quantities more than a factor of two lower, providing crucial empirical guidance for models of the interstellar medium in early galaxies.

Here we demonstrate a fully traceable random number generation protocol based on device-independent techniques. Our protocol extracts randomness from unpredictable non-local quantum correlations, and uses distributed intertwined hash chains to cryptographically trace and verify the extraction process. This protocol forms the basis for a public traceable and certifiable quantum randomness beacon that we have launched10. Over the first 40 days of operation, we completed the protocol 7,434 out of 7,454 attempts—a success rate of 99.7%. Each time the protocol succeeded, the beacon emitted a pulse of 512 bits of traceable randomness. The bits are certified to be uniform with error multiplied by actual success probability bounded by 2−64. The generation of certifiable and traceable randomness represents a public service that operates with an entanglement-derived advantage over comparable classical approaches. A study demonstrates a public generator of random numbers based on device-independent techniques, with the randomness being fully auditable and traceable."

 Metal halide perovskites are promising materials for light-emitting diodes (LEDs)1–4. Spatially confining charge carriers using nanocrystal/quantum dots5–9, low-dimensional perovskites10–13 and ultrathin perovskite layers14 have all been used to improve the external quantum efficiency of perovskite LEDs (PeLEDs). However, most strongly space-confined perovskites suffer from severe Auger recombination, ion migration and thermal instability, resulting in limited brightness and operational lifetime6,7,10–12,14–17. Here, we report an alternative strategy based on weakly space-confined, large-grained crystals of all-inorganic perovskite. Sacrificial additives, namely, hypophosphorous acid and ammonium chloride, were used to induce nucleation and crystallization of caesium lead bromide, resulting in monocrystal grains with minimized trap density and a high photoluminescence quantum yield. Benefiting from the high carrier mobility and suppressed Auger recombination, we obtained efficient PeLEDs with an external quantum efficiency reaching 22.0%, which remained above 20% at a high current density near 1,000 mA cm−2 and a brightness of over 1,167,000 cd m−2. Furthermore, benefiting from the suppressed ion migration and better thermal stability, the extrapolated half-lifetime of the weakly space-confined PeLEDs increased to 185,600 h under an initial luminance of 100 cd m−2 at room temperature. Our work is a new approach for designing efficient, bright and stable PeLEDs for real applications.

 Trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) are important to marine life and are essential tools for studying ocean processes1. Two different frameworks have arisen regarding marine TEI cycling: reversible scavenging favours water-column control on TEI distributions2–5, and seafloor boundary exchange emphasizes sedimentary imprints on water-column biogeochemistry6,7. These two views lead to disparate interpretations of TEI behaviours8–10. Here we use rare earth elements and neodymium isotopes as exemplar tracers of particle scavenging11 and boundary exchange6,7,12. We integrate these data with models of particle cycling and sediment diagenesis to propose a general framework for marine TEI cycling. We show that, for elements with greater affinity for manganese oxide than biogenic particles, scavenging is a net sink throughout the water column, contrary to a common assumption for reversible scavenging3,13. In this case, a benthic flux supports increasing elemental concentrations with water depth. This sedimentary source consists of two components: one recycled from elements scavenged by water-column particles, and another newly introduced to the water column through marine silicate weathering inside sediment8,14,15. Abyssal oxic diagenesis drives this benthic source, and exerts a strong influence on water-column biogeochemistry through seafloor geometry and bottom-intensified turbulent mixing16,17. Our findings affirm the role of authigenic minerals, often overshadowed by biogenic particles, in water-column cycling18, and suggest that the abyssal seafloor, often regarded as inactive, is a focus of biogeochemical transformation19,20. Rare earth element and neodymium isotope data combined with models of particle cycling and sediment diagenesis suggest that the abyssal seafloor is a key driver of trace-metal biogeochemical cycles."

 Eutyrannosaurians were large predatory dinosaurs that dominated Asian and North American terrestrial faunas in latest Cretaceous times. These apex predators arose from smaller-bodied tyrannosauroids during the ‘middle’ Cretaceous that are poorly known owing to the paucity of fossil material1–3. Here we report on a new tyrannosauroid, Khankhuuluu mongoliensis gen. et sp. nov., from lower Upper Cretaceous deposits of Mongolia that provides a new perspective on eutyrannosaurian origins and evolution. Phylogenetic analyses recover Khankhuuluu immediately outside Eutyrannosauria and recover the massive, deep-snouted Tyrannosaurini and the smaller, gracile, shallow-snouted Alioramini as highly derived eutyrannosaurian sister clades. Khankhuuluu and the late-diverging Alioramini independently share features related to a shallow skull and gracile build with juvenile eutyrannosaurians, reinforcing the key role heterochrony had in eutyrannosaurian evolution. Although eutyrannosaurians were mainly influenced by peramorphosis or accelerated growth4–10, Alioramini is revealed as a derived lineage that retained immature features through paedomorphosis and is not a more basal lineage as widely accepted11–19. Our results reveal that Asian tyrannosauroids (similar to Khankhuuluu) dispersed to North America, giving rise to Eutyrannosauria in the mid-Late Cretaceous. Eutyrannosauria diversified and remained exclusively in North America until a single dispersal to Asia in the latest Cretaceous that established Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini. Stark morphological differences between Alioramini and Tyrannosaurini probably evolved due to divergent heterochronic trends—paedomorphosis versus peramorphosis, respectively—allowing them to coexist in Asia and occupy different ecological niches.

 Vision enables many animals to perform spatial reasoning from remote locations1. By viewing distant landmarks, animals recall spatial memories and plan future trajectories. Although these spatial functions depend on hippocampal place cells2,3, the relationship between place cells and active visual behaviour is unknown. Here we studied a highly visual animal, the chickadee, in a behaviour that required alternating between remote visual search and spatial navigation. We leveraged the head-directed nature of avian vision to track gaze in freely moving animals. We discovered a profound link between place coding and gaze. Place cells activated not only when the chickadee was in a specific location, but also when it simply gazed at that location from a distance. Gaze coding was precisely timed by fast ballistic head movements called ‘head saccades’4,5. On each saccadic cycle, the hippocampus switched between encoding a prediction of what the bird was about to see and a reaction to what it actually saw. The temporal structure of these responses was coordinated by subclasses of interneurons that fired at different phases of the saccade. We suggest that place and gaze coding are components of a unified process by which the hippocampus represents the location that is relevant to the animal in each moment. This process allows the hippocampus to implement both local and remote spatial functions. Place cells in the chickadee hippocampus coherently represent locations in space, whether physically visited or viewed, enabling spatial reasoning at a distance through a unified process coordinated by head saccades."

 Developing bioelectronics capable of stably tracking brain-wide, single-cell, millisecond-resolved neural activity in the developing brain is critical for advancing neuroscience and understanding neurodevelopmental disorders. During development, the three-dimensional structure of the vertebrate brain arises from a two-dimensional neural plate1,2. These large morphological changes have previously posed a challenge for implantable bioelectronics to reliably track neural activity throughout brain development3–9. Here we introduce a tissue-level-soft, submicrometre-thick mesh microelectrode array that integrates into the embryonic neural plate by leveraging the tissue’s natural two-dimensional-to-three-dimensional reconfiguration. As organogenesis progresses, the mesh deforms, stretches and distributes throughout the brain, seamlessly integrating with neural tissue. Immunostaining, gene expression analysis and behavioural testing confirm no adverse effects on brain development or function. This embedded electrode array enables long-term, stable mapping of how single-neuron activity and population dynamics emerge and evolve during brain development.

Recent advancements in digital image reconstruction have helped to envision treatment results, although without any direct means of achieving them5–8. Here I describe the physically applied digital restoration of a painting, a highly damaged oil-on-panel attributed to the Master of the Prado Adoration from the late fifteenth century. In parallel, 5,612 losses spanning 66,205 mm2 and 57,314 colours were infilled with a reversible laminate mask comprising a colour-accurate bilayer of printed pigments on polymeric films. To ensure the effectiveness of the restoration, ethical principles in painting conservation were implemented quantitatively for digital mask construction, a critically important foundation lacking in the current digital restoration literature. The infill process took 3.5 h, an estimated 66 times faster than conventional inpainting, and the result closely matched the simulation. This approach grants greatly increased foresight and flexibility to conservators, enabling the restoration of countless damaged paintings deemed unworthy of high conservation budgets.

 Although cell-fate specification is generally attributed to transcriptional regulation, emerging data also indicate a role for molecules linked with intermediary metabolism. For example, α-ketoglutarate (αKG), which fuels energy production and biosynthetic pathways in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, is also a co-factor for chromatin-modifying enzymes1–3. Nevertheless, whether TCA-cycle metabolites regulate cell fate during tissue homeostasis and regeneration remains unclear. Here we show that TCA-cycle enzymes are expressed in the intestine in a heterogeneous manner, with components of the αKG dehydrogenase complex4–6 upregulated in the absorptive lineage and downregulated in the secretory lineage. Using genetically modified mouse models and organoids, we reveal that 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (OGDH), the enzymatic subunit of the αKG dehydrogenase complex, has a dual, lineage-specific role. In the absorptive lineage, OGDH is upregulated by HNF4 transcription factors to maintain the bioenergetic and biosynthetic needs of enterocytes. In the secretory lineage, OGDH is downregulated through a process that, when modelled, increases the levels of αKG and stimulates the differentiation of secretory cells. Consistent with this, in mouse models of colitis with impaired differentiation and maturation of secretory cells, inhibition of OGDH or supplementation with αKG reversed these impairments and promoted tissue healing. Hence, OGDH dependency is lineage-specific, and its regulation helps to direct cell fate, offering insights for targeted therapies in regenerative medicine.

 Sex inequalities in cancer are well documented, but the current limited understanding is hindering advances in precision medicine and therapies1. Consideration of ethnicity, age and sex is essential for the management of cancer patients because they underlie important differences in both incidence and response to treatment2,3. Age-related hormone production, which is a consistent divergence between the sexes, is underestimated in cancers that are not recognized as being hormone dependent4–6. Here, we show that premenopausal women have increased vulnerability to cancers, and we identify the cell–cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin as a crucial component in the oestrogen response in various cancers, including melanoma. In a mouse model of melanoma, we discovered an oestrogen-sensitizing pathway connecting E-cadherin, β-catenin, oestrogen receptor-α and GRPR that promotes melanoma aggressiveness in women. Inhibiting this pathway by targeting GRPR or oestrogen receptor-α reduces metastasis in mice, indicating its therapeutic potential. Our study introduces a concept linking hormone sensitivity and tumour phenotype in which hormones affect cell phenotype and aggressiveness. We have identified an integrated pro-tumour pathway in women and propose that targeting a G-protein-coupled receptor with drugs not commonly used for cancer treatment could be more effective in treating E-cadherin-dependent cancers in women. This study emphasizes the importance of sex-specific factors in cancer management and offers hope of improving outcomes in various cancers.

 Plants make complex and potent therapeutic molecules1,2, but sourcing these molecules from natural producers or through chemical synthesis is difficult, which limits their use in the clinic. A prominent example is the anti-cancer therapeutic paclitaxel (sold under the brand name Taxol), which is derived from yew trees (Taxus species)3. Identifying the full paclitaxel biosynthetic pathway would enable heterologous production of the drug, but this has yet to be achieved despite half a century of research4. Within Taxus’ large, enzyme-rich genome5, we suspected that the paclitaxel pathway would be difficult to resolve using conventional RNA-sequencing and co-expression analyses. Here, to improve the resolution of transcriptional analysis for pathway identification, we developed a strategy we term multiplexed perturbation × single nuclei (mpXsn) to transcriptionally profile cell states spanning tissues, cell types, developmental stages and elicitation conditions. Our data show that paclitaxel biosynthetic genes segregate into distinct expression modules that suggest consecutive subpathways. These modules resolved seven new genes, allowing a de novo 17-gene biosynthesis and isolation of baccatin III, the industrial precursor to Taxol, in Nicotiana benthamiana leaves, at levels comparable with the natural abundance in Taxus needles. Notably, we found that a nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like protein, FoTO1, is crucial for promoting the formation of the desired product during the first oxidation, resolving a long-standing bottleneck in paclitaxel pathway reconstitution. Together with a new β-phenylalanine-CoA ligase, the eight genes discovered here enable the de novo biosynthesis of 3’-N-debenzoyl-2’-deoxypaclitaxel. More broadly, we establish a generalizable approach to efficiently scale the power of co-expression analysis to match the complexity of large, uncharacterized genomes, facilitating the discovery of high-value gene sets.

 Preventing gender disparities in mathematics is a worldwide preoccupation1,2. In infancy and early childhood, boys and girls exhibit similar core knowledge of number and space3–8. Gender disparities in maths are, therefore, thought to primarily reflect an internalization of the sociocultural stereotype that ‘girls are bad at maths’. However, where, when and how widely this stereotype becomes entrenched remains uncertain. Here, we report the results of a 4-year longitudinal assessment of language and mathematical performance of all French first and second graders (2,653,082 children). Boys and girls exhibited very similar maths scores upon school entry, but a gender gap in favour of boys became highly significant after 4 months of schooling and reached an effect size of about 0.20 after 1 year. These findings were repeated each year and varied only slightly across family, class or school type and socio-economic level. Although schooling correlated with age, exploiting the near-orthogonal variations indicated that the gender gap increased with schooling rather than with age. These findings point to the first year of school as the time and place where a maths gender gap emerges in favour of boys, thus helping focus the search for solutions and interventions.

 Chest radiography frequently serves as baseline imaging for most lung diseases1. Deep learning has great potential for automating the interpretation of chest radiography2. However, existing chest radiographic deep learning models are limited in diagnostic scope, generalizability, adaptability, robustness and extensibility. To overcome these limitations, we have developed Ark+, a foundation model applied to chest radiography and pretrained by cyclically accruing and reusing the knowledge from heterogeneous expert labels in numerous datasets. Ark+ excels in diagnosing thoracic diseases. It expands the diagnostic scope and addresses potential misdiagnosis. It can adapt to evolving diagnostic needs and respond to novel diseases. It can learn rare conditions from a few samples and transfer to new diagnostic settings without training. It tolerates data biases and long-tailed distributions, and it supports federated learning to preserve privacy. All codes and pretrained models have been released, so that Ark+ is open for fine-tuning, local adaptation and improvement. It is extensible to several modalities. Thus, it is a foundation model for medical imaging. The exceptional capabilities of Ark+ stem from our insight: aggregating various datasets diversifies the patient populations and accrues knowledge from many experts to yield unprecedented performance while reducing annotation costs3. The development of Ark+ reveals that open models trained by accruing and reusing knowledge from heterogeneous expert annotations with a multitude of public (big or small) datasets can surpass the performance of proprietary models trained on large data. We hope that our findings will inspire more researchers to share code and datasets or federate privacy-preserving data to create open foundation models with diverse, global expertise and patient populations, thus accelerating open science and democratizing AI for medicine.

 Despite the success of fructose as a low-cost food additive, epidemiological evidence suggests that high fructose consumption during pregnancy or adolescence is associated with disrupted neurodevelopment1–3. An essential step in appropriate mammalian neurodevelopment is the phagocytic elimination of newly formed neurons by microglia, the resident professional phagocyte of the central nervous system4. Whether high fructose consumption in early life affects microglial phagocytosis and whether this directly affects neurodevelopment remains unknown. Here we show that offspring born to female mice fed a high-fructose diet and neonates exposed to high fructose exhibit decreased phagocytic activity in vivo. Notably, deletion of the high-affinity fructose transporter GLUT5 (also known as SLC2A5) in neonatal microglia completely reversed microglia phagocytic dysfunction, suggesting that high fructose directly affects neonatal development by suppressing microglial phagocytosis. Mechanistically, we found that high-fructose treatment of mouse and human microglia suppresses phagocytosis capacity, which is rescued in GLUT5-deficient microglia. Additionally, we found that high fructose drives significant GLUT5-dependent fructose uptake and catabolism to fructose 6-phosphate, rewiring microglial metabolism towards a hypo-phagocytic state in part by enforcing mitochondrial localization of the enzyme hexokinase 2. Mice exposed to high fructose as neonates develop anxiety-like behaviour as adolescents—an effect that is rescued in GLUT5-deficient mice. Our findings provide a mechanistic explanation for the epidemiological observation that high-fructose exposure during early life is associated with increased prevalence of adolescent anxiety disorders. Exposure of mice to high fructose during gestation or early postnatal life causes decreased microglial phagocytosis during brain development and leads to anxiety-like behaviour in adolescence."

 Accurate observations of surface mass balance are pivotal for assessing the Antarctic Ice Sheet mass balance and its link to climate dynamics. Studying regional changes in surface mass balance is challenging due to limited on-site observations and the susceptibility of measurements from snow pits and ice cores to localized disturbances. Satellite data and short-term localized measurements suggest no significant changes or a possible increase in surface mass balance across the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in recent decades, but these findings lack large-scale validation. Here we use observations from mass balance stakes to show a significant negative surface mass balance trend along the inland transect from Zhongshan Station to the Antarctic Ice Sheet summit (Dome A) during the period 2005–2020. The mean surface mass balance trend for the inland section over the 15-year period is −2.01 ± 0.37 kg m−2 yr–2, indicating a 35.5% decrease. This decrease is probably linked to enhanced zonal winds in the upper atmosphere and a deepened low-pressure system in the southern Indian Ocean. The former weakens meridional air transport to Antarctica, while the latter strengthens offshore winds over the study area, reducing onshore water vapour transport. These findings can be used to evaluate and improve regional climate models and refine estimates of contemporary Antarctic mass balance trends. Mass balance measurements from inland East Antarctica suggest a negative trend in surface mass balance from 2005 to 2020, probably associated with enhanced zonal winds."

 The Mw 7.8 Kahramanmaraş/Pazarcik earthquake was larger and more destructive than was expected based on historical seismicity in southeastern Turkey in the past few centuries, raising questions about the nature of rupture initiation and propagation. Here we analyse near-field ground velocity records from seismometers to constrain the rupture propagation speed along the Narli splay fault, which hosted the initial rupture that eventually reached the main East Anatolian Fault. The measured particle velocities provide evidence for an early transition of the rupture from sub-Rayleigh to supershear behaviour, whereby the rupture speed exceeds that of the seismic shear waves. The near-in-situ field observational evidence is consistent with mechanistic understanding of supershear rupture. We estimate the instantaneous supershear rupture propagation speed to have been 1.55 times that of the shear wave speed and the sub-Rayleigh-to-supershear transition length to have been around 19.45 km. This work reveals the value of near-field instrumentation in characterizing the initiation of earthquakes along major faults.

Major inequalities exist within and across countries and by socio-economic backgrounds. 
 Many households worldwide face substantial gaps in decent living standards (DLS), universal and essential material preconditions for achieving well-being and inclusive development. Here, we use subnational Demographic and Health Survey data from 75 low and middle-income countries (1990–2021) to explore the distribution and trends of ten living standards. We estimate that 94.9% of households in our dataset lack the material prerequisites for at least one of the ten standards, and 63.6% for one-third of them. Stark inequalities persist both within and between countries, with regions in sub-Saharan Africa experiencing the most severe deprivations. Despite some improvements, progress remains limited in critical areas such as health care, sanitation, housing, and education. Within countries, rural, agrarian households with low levels of educational attainment are particularly disadvantaged. These granular findings at the subnational level can help direct policy efforts and resources towards those populations most in need.

This study shows that addressing those critiques substantially refines estimates of the places with reforestation potential. 
 Reforestation is a prominent climate change mitigation strategy, but available global maps of reforestation potential are widely criticized and highly variable, which limits their ability to provide robust estimates of both the locations and total area of opportunity. Here we develop global maps that address common critiques, build on a review of 89 reforestation maps created at multiple scales, and present eight reforestation scenarios with varying objectives, including providing ecosystem services, minimizing social conflicts, and delivering government policies. Across scenarios, we find up to 195 Mha (million hectares) are available (2225 TgCO2e (teragrams of carbon dioxide equivalent) per year total net mitigation potential), which is 71–92% smaller than previous estimates because of conservative modeling choices, incorporation of safeguards, and use of recent, high-resolution datasets. This area drops as low as 6 Mha (53 TgCO2e per year total net mitigation potential) if only statutorily protected areas are targeted. Few locations simultaneously achieve multiple objectives, suggesting that a mix of lands and restoration motivations will be needed to capitalize on the many potential benefits of reforestation.

The authors show that signaling selectivity in CB2R can be tuned by reshaping allosteric networks, offering insights for more precise therapies. 
 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) are important therapeutic drug targets for a wide range of diseases. Upon activation, GPCRs can initiate several signaling pathways, each with unique therapeutic implications. Therefore, understanding how drugs selectively engage specific signaling pathways becomes paramount. However, achieving this selectivity remains highly challenging. To unravel the underlying multifaceted mechanisms, we integrate systematic mutagenesis of the CB2R, comprehensive profiling of Gαi2 and β-arrestin1 engagements and computer simulations to track the effects of mutations on receptor dynamics. Our research reveals multiple triggers within a complex allosteric communication network (ACN) that converge to preferential CB2R coupling by modulating evolutionarily conserved motifs. Utilizing network path analysis, we find that potent triggers are typically highly connected nodes and are located near regions of high information transmission within the ACN. Our insights highlight the complexity of GPCR signaling and provide a framework for the rational design of drug candidates tailored to evoke specific functional responses, ultimately enhancing the precision and efficacy of therapeutic interventions. Nonselective engagement of GPCR signaling pathways by GPCR-targeting drugs can reduce treatment efficacy and cause side effects.

We reveal that ventral hippocampus projections to the lateral hypothalamus encode meal-related memories, and that disruption of this circuit promotes excessive eating. 
 The ability to encode and retrieve meal-related information is critical to efficiently guide energy acquisition and consumption, yet the underlying neural processes remain elusive. Here we reveal that ventral hippocampus (HPCv) neuronal activity dynamically elevates between eating bouts during meal consumption and this response is predictive of performance in a foraging-related memory test for the spatial location of a previously consumed meal. Targeted recombination-mediated ablation of HPCv meal-responsive neurons impairs meal location memory without influencing food motivation or spatial memory for escape location. These HPCv meal-responsive neurons project to the lateral hypothalamic area (LHA) and are enriched in serotonin 2a receptors (5HT2aR). Either chemogenetic silencing of HPCv-to-LHA projections or intra-HPCv 5HT2aR antagonist yielded meal location memory deficits, as well as increased caloric intake driven by shorter temporal intervals between meals. Collective results identify a population of HPCv neurons in male rats that dynamically respond during eating to encode meal-related memories.

 Mechanisms of tumorigenesis in sinonasal squamous cell carcinoma (SNSCC) remain poorly understood due to its rarity. A subset of SNSCC is associated with human papillomavirus (HPV), but it is unclear whether HPV drives tumorigenesis or acts as a neutral bystander. Here, we show that HPV-associated SNSCC shares mutational patterns found in HPV-associated cervical and head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, including lack of TP53 mutations, hotspot mutations in PI3K and FGFR3, enrichment of APOBEC mutagenesis, viral integration at known hotspots, and frequent epigenetic regulator alterations. We identify HPV-associated SNSCC-specific recurrent mutations in KMT2C, UBXN11, AP3S1, MT-ND4, and MT-ND5, with KMT2D and FGFR3 mutations correlating with reduced overall survival. We establish an HPV-associated SNSCC cell line, showing that combinatorial small-molecule inhibition of YAP/TAZ and PI3K synergistically suppresses clonogenicity. Combining YAP/TAZ blockade with vertical PI3K inhibition may benefit HPV-associated SNSCC, whereas targeting MYC and horizontal inhibition of RAS/PI3K may suit HPV-independent SNSCC.

Utilising the unusual sex determination system of Sciaridae flies, this study finds a slower evolution of the X chromosomes which appears to be driven by strong purifying selection. 
 Differences in transmission and ploidy between sex chromosomes and autosomes drive divergent evolutionary trajectories, with sex chromosomes generally evolving faster. Because sex-linked genes are transmitted less frequently, they are under less efficient selection. Conversely, exposure of recessive mutations on haploid sex chromosomes creates more efficient selection. In most systems, these effects occur simultaneously and are confounded. The fly families Sciaridae (fungus gnats) and Cecidomyiidae (gall midges) have X0 sex determination, but males transmit only maternally inherited chromosomes. This phenomenon results in equal transmission of the X and autosomes, allowing the effect of haploid selection to be studied in isolation. We discover that, unlike well-studied systems, X chromosomes diverge more slowly than autosomes in these flies. Using population genomic and expression data, we show that despite the X evolving more adaptively, stronger purifying selection explains slower divergence. Our findings demonstrate the utility of non-Mendelian inheritance systems for understanding fundamental evolutionary processes. X chromosomes evolve faster than autosomes, but confounding factors make this a difficult phenomenon to study.

 Green roofs are often considered barriers against polluted precipitation, but their effectiveness in capturing airborne microplastics remains unclear. Here we evaluate modular green roofs under simulated wet deposition to assess their ability to intercept and retain microplastics. We find that green roofs remove over 97.5% of deposited microplastics. In Shanghai, China, this corresponds to an annual interception of approximately 1.70 × 10¹² particles, or 56.2 tonnes. Higher rainfall intensity slightly improves capture efficiency by increasing moisture and reducing infiltration forces. Fragment-shaped microplastics are more easily retained than fiber-shaped ones. Most particles are trapped in the soil layer, while some are retained by vegetation, although air turbulence may remobilize fibers. Surface and chemical analysis reveals that plastic materials within green roofs themselves can degrade, potentially releasing microplastics in the process. These results show that green roofs can play a valuable role in reducing urban microplastic pollution and offer practical insights for designing future stormwater and air-quality management strategies.

 The Doppler shift observed by single-beam synthetic aperture radar (SAR) has been widely used to retrieve the radial velocity of ocean surface currents. However, operational marine forecasting centers require full surface current vector fields for data assimilation and forecast validation. To address this need, we propose a method to reconstruct the two-dimensional surface current vector from SAR Doppler shift measurements, under the assumption that ocean mesoscale currents are quasi-geostrophic. In this approach, the known range-directed current velocity derived from SAR Doppler shift measurements is used to estimate the azimuthal component based on the geostrophic approximation. The feasibility of the proposed method is preliminarily assessed by comparing the reconstructed surface current fields with global ocean analysis and forecast products from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service (CMEMS). The results show a bias of 0.01 m/s and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.1 m/s. Additionally, surface current fields in the Gulf Stream and Agulhas Current regions are reconstructed using Sentinel-1A SAR Doppler shift observations and validated against collocated drifting buoy measurements, yielding a bias of 0.05 m/s and a RMSE of 0.19 m/s.

 The importance of conservation agriculture (CA) is undeniable, both for improving soil health and offering a viable path towards achieving carbon neutrality. However, to date, survey statistics on the extent of conservation agriculture were based on farmer declarations or field inspections. This is a major impediment to the promotion or monitoring of conservation agriculture. Here, we collected the management practices of a total of 247 fields under conservation agriculture in the Walloon region of Belgium in 2020–2021, with the aim of developing a classification model for the prediction of conservation agriculture by combining remotely sensed data with census data. We identified seven variables in the model, linked to each of the three main principles of conservation agriculture (crop diversification, maximum soil cover and minimum mechanical soil disturbance). The number of different annual crops and cereals in the rotation was obtained from the agricultural census. For the extent of soil cover, the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform was used to obtain a time series of optical remote sensing images (2015–2020, Sentinel-2, Landsat-7, Landsat-8) and precipitation data. We then analyzed the variation of spectral indices such as the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Normalized Difference Tillage Index (NDTI) and constructed indicators to distinguish between bare soil and cover crop. For minimum mechanical soil disturbance, in addition to the above data, radar data (Sentinel-1) were also obtained from the GEE platform to establish a tillage practice model. Subsequently, the Random Forest (RF) classification method was used to construct a classification model distinguishing fields under conservation from those under conventional practices. The results of a ten-fold cross-validation showed a good overall accuracy of 92 %. The model was utilized to classify the farming systems in all croplands of the Hesbaye region of Belgium. The results show that 15.5 % (2875 fields) out of 18,516 cropland fields can be classified as conservation agriculture.

 Understanding soil moisture dynamics in crop production is critical for optimising water resource management. The Sentinel satellite missions have significantly contributed to soil moisture monitoring by providing high-resolution, multi-sensor data. This review examines advancements in soil moisture assessment using Sentinel datasets, particularly in crop production. It highlights key challenges, evaluates their impact on monitoring accuracy, and explores potential methodological improvements. Findings indicate that Sentinel-1′s synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data, particularly VV and VH polarizations, and Sentinel-2′s multispectral indices, such as NDVI and NDMI, are widely integrated with machine learning algorithms to enhance soil moisture estimation. However, dense vegetation and complex topography reduce retrieval accuracy, necessitating sensor fusion and calibration for improved reliability. Sentinel-3 provides valuable surface temperature and land condition data for indirect soil moisture estimation, but its application remains limited due to higher uncertainty compared to SAR and multispectral approaches. Emerging trends suggest that machine and deep learning techniques, such as RF, SVR, and CNN, can enhance data fusion across Sentinel missions. Additionally, preprocessing steps such as RTC, speckle filtering, and the integration of multipolar and polarimetric data with physical backscattering models show promise in mitigating radar backscatter interference. Further development of robust retrieval models that incorporate topography, soil roughness, and texture are essential for improving soil moisture accuracy in diverse agricultural landscapes.

 Land degradation poses a significant threat to ecosystems and livelihoods, particularly in disaster-prone regions. In these settings, the promotion of certain agricultural practices with economic incentives, such as sugarcane (Saccharum officinarum) farming, offers a potential solution for enhancing economic stability and mitigating environmental degradation. Despite its promise, the effectiveness of sugarcane as an agricultural intervention remains understudied, especially regarding its environmental benefits. Our study evaluates the impact of sugarcane cultivation in western Nepal, a region highly vulnerable to soil erosion and riverbank degradation due to the presence of flood-prone landscapes. We conducted a geospatial impact evaluation (GIE), which integrated remote sensing data and econometric techniques, including optimal full matching (OFM) and difference-in-differences (DID). We assessed the causal impact of a program promoting sugarcane farming on its adoption and environmental outcomes, measured using multi-temporal satellite imagery, crop phenology, and clustering algorithms, along with machine learning and visual interpretation methods. Our results show that sugarcane adoption increased significantly in both treated and spillover communities, highlighting its potential as a sustainable agricultural practice. However, while uptake was evident, the expected environmental outcomes, such as soil erosion control and riverbank stabilization, did not materialize. This study demonstrates the potential of GIE in evaluating low-cost interventions for sustainable development and provides insights into the role of sugarcane cultivation in promoting climate resilience.

 Obtaining regional fine-scale daily Soil Moisture (SM) data is crucial for better understanding carbon and water cycles. Currently, downscaling from passive microwave SM products has become the most commonly utilized approach for generating regional high-resolution SM data, while retrieving SM based on disaggregated brightness Temperature (TB) data gains litter attention. Besides, the relative potentials of these two downscaling approaches remains largely unknown. Therefore, this study comprehensively compared the relatively performances of the two downscaling schemes namely the “retrieving-then-downscaling” and “downscaling-then-retrieving” over the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP). Evaluation results showed that retrieving SM using disaggregated TB significantly outperformed the popular passive microwave SM downscaling method. The averaged R and ubRMSE metrics for downscale-first based SM were 0.62/0.74 and 0.051/0.038 m3/m3 at station/network scales, and were 0.58/0.70 and 0.056/0.041 m3/m3 for the retrieval-first based SM, respectively. Spatially, the downscale-first based SM had lower uncertainty than the retrieval-first based SM over nearly 70 % areas of the QTP. However, due to the strong vegetation scattering effect, it showed two times larger uncertainty than the retrieval-first based SM over densely vegetated regions in the east and southeast. In addition, satisfactory TB downscaling performance could be achieved by leveraging machine learning algorithms and multiple covariables, but need to further reduce additional errors. The superiority of “downscaling-then-retrieving” scheme was independent of models selected for downscaling. In conclusion, this study demonstrates the great potential of “downscaling-then-retrieving” method and provides a new insight for generating regional SM data at fine scale."

 Individual trajectories offer insights into human mobility, with data either passively recorded, such as GPS, or actively recorded, such as natural language text. While the former provides detailed movement data, it lacks important context such as personal experiences, which can be obtained from the latter. Extracting trajectories from text can enhance travel experience optimization, historical analysis, and pandemic management. However, existing trajectory extraction methods rely on rule-based frameworks that fail to capture contextual semantics, resulting in limited generalizability and loss of trajectory semantics. While general-purpose large language models (LLMs) demonstrate potential for contextual reasoning capabilities, their deficient domain-specific knowledge pertinent to trajectory patterns hinders efficient and precise trajectory extraction. To address these limitations, we propose T2TrajLLM, a novel framework that fuses LLMs with domain knowledge through three components: (1) a lightweight trajectory model for structured guidance, (2) a text-to-trajectory transformation model enabling multi-step reasoning, and (3) labelled text-trajectory samples for learning domain-adaptive constraint rules. Central to T2TrajLLM is a prompt method that dynamically fuses these components with LLMs while avoids rigid rule dependency. Evaluated across three heterogeneous datasets, T2TrajLLM achieves ∼8 % higher accuracy than existing methods, demonstrating strong transferability across datasets and extensibility to diverse application requirements.

 Monitoring wildfires has become increasingly critical due to the sharp rise in wildfire incidents in recent years. Optical satellites like Sentinel-2 and Landsat are extensively utilised for mapping burned areas. However, the effectiveness of optical sensors is compromised by clouds and smoke, which obstruct the detection of burned areas. Thus, satellites equipped with Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), such as dual-polarisation Sentinel-1 and quad-polarisation RADARSAT-1/-2 C-band SAR, which can penetrate clouds and smoke, are investigated for mapping burned areas. However, there is limited research on using compact polarisation (compact-pol) C-band RADARSAT Constellation Mission (RCM) SAR data for this purpose. This study aims to investigate the capacity of compact polarisation RCM data for burned area mapping through deep learning. Compact-pol m-χ decomposition and Compact-pol Radar Vegetation Index (CpRVI) are derived from the RCM Multi-Look Complex product. A deep-learning-based processing pipeline incorporating ConvNet-based and Transformer-based models is applied for burned area mapping, with three different input settings: using only log-ratio dual-polarisation intensity images, using only compact-pol decomposition plus CpRVI, and using all three data sources. The training dataset comprises 46,295 patches, generated from 12 major wildfire events in Canada. The test dataset includes seven wildfire events from the 2023 and 2024 Canadian wildfire seasons in Alberta, British Columbia, Quebec and the Northwest Territories. The results demonstrate that compact-pol m-χ decomposition and CpRVI images significantly complement log-ratio images for burned area mapping. The best-performing Transformer-based model, UNETR, trained with log-ratio, m-χ m-decomposition, and CpRVI data, achieved an F1 Score of 0.718 and an IoU Score of 0.565, showing a notable improvement compared to the same model trained using only log-ratio images (F1 Score: 0.684, IoU Score: 0.557). This is the first study to demonstrate that RCM C-band SAR data and its derived features are effective for burned area mapping."

In this study, we proposed an improved algorithm for SD inversion, instead of relying on a single in-situ snow density value, we incorporated a range of snow densities (0.15 to 0.27 g/cm3), optimizing the axial ratio between 1.13 and 1.17. This density range and optimized axial ratio were used to minimise the error between CPDObs and the average CPDMod. The algorithm yielded high-resolution modelled SD and density at a 2.5 m spatial resolution, which were later used to estimate SWE. Algorithm validation was performed using in-situ data of Gulmarg region of Kashmir, India, with statistical metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE), root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and percentage error (PE). SD estimates showed high correlation, with R2 = 0.85, RMSE = 3.18 cm, PE = 1 %, and MAE = 2.85 cm. Similarly, SWE estimates had an R2 of 0.77, RMSE = 1.032 cm, PE = 5 %, and MAE = 0.814 cm, demonstrating the model’s accuracy and reliability."

 We report an intensive aircraft study of regional air pollution over Northeast China during July and August 2018, unraveling the vertical distributions and regional transport of a variety of trace gases and aerosols. Major air pollutants, including sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitric oxide (NO), ozone (O3), black carbon (BC), aerosol scattering coefficient (Bsc), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), showed distinct vertical profiles influenced by planetary boundary layer (PBL) dynamics and regional transport processes. Near-surface concentrations of primary pollutants (SO2, NO, BC) generally decreased with altitude, whereas O3 levels increased. Notably, residual layers containing aged BC (300 m–1000 m altitude) were observed during early morning, with subsequent downward mixing to the surface following PBL development. A strong negative correlation between BC and O3 concentrations highlighted their antagonistic behavior in vertically stratified air masses. Vertical VOC distributions were dominated by light alkanes (C2-C4) and halocarbons, with profiles governed by their chemical lifetimes and transport mechanisms. A regional air pollution episode was observed in the high altitude atmosphere, characterized by elevated aerosol loading. WRF-Chem simulations revealed that episode was primarily driven by surface-level emissions from the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region. These pollutants were uplifted to the convergence zone and subsequently transported over long distance to Northeast China. Our findings enhance the understanding of vertical pollution profiles and the complex interplay between regional transport and local air quality in Northeast China."

 This study contributes to a better understanding of past climate variability and mesoscale dynamics in the Mediterranean Basin, a region with notable sensitivity to climate change.We investigate the variations of rainfall amount and intensity by analyzing centenary time series in Italy. The study area offers an ideal setting for analyzing these dynamics due to its unique geographical position. The rainfall time series are compared to the climate indices time series to understand the influences of the mesoscale atmospheric teleconnections and of the possible changes in rainfall regimes due to an increase of the sea surface temperatures. The study is conducted by applying statistical methods on more than 100 time series. The results show that most regions of Italy have been affected by a decrease in rainfall amount and an increase in rainfall intensity over the last 200 years. This work also highlights that these patterns are correlated to positive phases of the North Atlantic Oscillation and to an increase in sea surface temperatures. The trends of climate indices thus suggest a decrease in the amount and an increase in the intensity of future rainfall distribution, with severe consequences in terms of water availability and geo-related risks."

 Polar amplification can exert a profound influence on global climate and extreme weather events in distant regions via teleconnections and atmospheric variability. Although previous have revealed linkages and interactions among temperature anomalies of Earth's three poles, what degree propagations of polar amplification can influence other regions is not fully understood. To fulfill this knowledge gap, we adopted a climate network-based approach to quantify the intensity and pathways of propagation, and identify sensitive regions using the Polar Amplification Index (PAI) originated from three different scenarios of the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). Our results indicated that the polar amplification and propagation patterns for the Earth's three poles show distinct regional and seasonal differences under different warming levels. With the warming increasing, the stronger strength of propagations tends to be concentrated on the land, and distribution patterns become more stable. Meanwhile, the length of the propagation pathway for polar amplification would be shorter with faster time and stronger strength. Furthermore, we pointed out several polar amplification-sensitive regions, including the around 30°N and 30°S, Barents Sea region near the Arctic Circle. Based on these findings, polar amplification will accelerate much more and induce drastic influences via propagation in the dynamics of global climate patterns unless warming levels are minimized. Our study highlights the significance of enhancing our understanding of projected changes in the polar regions and offers valuable insights to inform strategies for coping with climate change and extreme events."

However, crustal generation remains enigmatic with both plate tectonic and non-plate tectonic modes proposed. In this study, we show that zircons from the ~2.5–billion years ago TTGs in the Eastern Block (EB) of the North China Craton have low water contents (median of 263 parts per million) and high δ18O values (median of 6.22‰) and a negative correlation between them, which suggest a thick hybridized and hydrated mafic source. By contrast, zircon water contents of the adjoining coeval TTGs in the Trans-North China Orogen, formed in a supra-subduction zone setting, are notably higher. These results support a two-stage mantle plume-sagduction process for TTG formation.

Here, we mapped eosinophils across evolutional hepatic granulomas in a mouse model and in a primary wild reservoir for human schistosomiasis in Brazil (water ratNectomys squamipes).

Beginning our investigation in brown adipose tissue (BAT), we identified a mechanism to explain enhanced glucose utilization in cold-adapted BAT. This was characterized by select remodeling of upper glycolysis and pentose cycling to increase oxygen consumption, likely by increasing uncoupling protein 1 activity through the production of reactive oxygen species. Cold-induced remodeling of the plasma proteome appeared to underpin the ability of BAT to modify its fuel preference, stimulating lipolysis in white adipose tissue and glucose production in the liver.

Here, we report morphologically and molecularly distinct subtypes of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in bladder cancer, including αSMA+IL-6−myofibroblastic CAFs (myCAFs), αSMA−IL-6+inflammatory CAFs (iCAFs), and hybrid i/myCAFs. Caspase-1–dependent tumor pyroptosis releases several inflammatory chemokines, converting αSMA+CAF into iCAFs in a CCR6-dependent manner. This is clinically relevant, as a fibroblast gene signature driven by iCAF markers and collagen type III is enriched in patients with chemoresistant bladder cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Contrary to the current notion, iCAFs, rather than myCAFs, produce collagen III in response to chemotherapy, supporting the expansion of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Thus, tumor cell pyroptosis initiates an iCAF-CSC feedforward loop that drives chemoresistance, indicating that inflammatory cell death is not universally beneficial to anticancer therapy, depending on the target cell type."

Traditional design strategies, based on hydrophobicity and structural propensity, can be biased and could indeed prevent discovery of interesting, diverse, and unconventional peptides with desired nanostructure assembly. Using β sheet formation in pentapeptides as a case study, we used an integrated high-throughput experimental workflow and an artificial intelligence–driven active learning framework to improve prediction accuracy of self-assembly. By focusing on sequences where machine learning (ML) predictions deviate from conventional design strategies, we synthesized and tested 268 pentapeptides, successfully finding 96 forming β sheet assemblies, including unconventional sequences (e.g., ILFSM, LMISI, MITIY, MISIW, and WKIYI) not predicted by traditional methods. Our ML models outperformed conventional β sheet propensity tables, revealing useful chemical design rules. A web interface is provided to facilitate community access to these models.

This uncoating step that is vital for IAV infection remains to be fully understood. The aggresome processing machinery (APM) plays a relevant but not essential role in this. Here, we reveal a mechanism in which light chain 3 proteins (LC3s) and pericentrin (PCNT) form an adaptor complex that is required for vRNPs binding to the dynein 1 and IAV uncoating at endosomes. This function of LC3s and PCNT is independent from their established role in autophagy and centrosome assembly, respectively. LC3s or PCNT depletion severely impairs IAV cytoplasm entry and infection, which can be further inhibited by additional silencing of histone deacetylase 6, an APM component. Collectively, our results show that IAV has adopted two redundant strategies to hijack the dynein biomolecular motors and facilitate VP uncoating."

To gain insight beyond the short historical record, we reconstruct changes in groundwater levels in western North America during the last glacial termination (LGT, ~20 to 11 thousand years ago) using noble gas isotopes. Our reconstructions indicate remarkable stability of water table depth in a Pacific Northwest aquifer throughout the LGT despite increasing precipitation, closely matching independent Earth system model (ESM) simulations. In the American Southwest, ESM simulations and noble gas isotopes both suggest a pronounced LGT decline in water table depth in in response to decreasing precipitation, indicating distinct regional groundwater responses to climate. Despite the hydrologic simplicity of ESMs, their agreement with proxy reconstructions of past water table depth suggests that these models hold value in understanding groundwater dynamics and projecting large-scale aquifer responses to climate forcing."

The fitness seascape model addresses this by extending the fitness landscape model to map genotypes to dose-response functions, enabling the study of evolution under fluctuating drug concentrations. Here, we present an empirical fitness seascape inE. coliharboring all combinations of four drug resistance mutations. Incorporating these data into PK-PD simulations of antibiotic treatment, we find that higher mutation supply increases the probability of resistance, and early adherence to the drug regimen is critical. In vitro studies further support the finding that the second dose in a drug regimen is important for preventing resistance.

We show that AOM coupled with denitrification markedly reduces soil N2O emissions, with the type I methanotrophMethylobacterspecies collaborating with the Methylophilaceae and Gemmatimonadaceae families to perform key roles. The suppression of N2O emissions by AOM primarily stems from its role in supplying electrons and carbon sources, fueling complete denitrification by associated bacteria. In addition, we uncovered distinct microbial interaction strategies for AOM-coupled nitrate and nitrite reduction. While nitrite reduction necessitates both bacterial cooperation and extracellular electron transfer during its initial stages, nitrate reduction predominantly depends on methanotrophic bacteria alone at the outset. These findings advance our understanding of carbon-nitrogen cycle coupling and underscore AOM’s potential to simultaneously mitigate both CH4and N2O emissions."

Onshore orogeny and associated surface processes, long considered key controls on canyon formation, play a subordinate role. Instead, our results suggest slope inclination as the primary control on submarine canyon density. Because continental slope morphology is fundamentally shaped by marine tectonic and thermal processes, these large-scale forces indirectly govern canyon formation and distribution globally.

The selective absorption of laser energy in regions with excited electrons leads to the rapid heating and evaporation of material at an extraordinarily high speed. Furthermore, the machining is achieved using a low-power light source, four orders of magnitude lower than conventional femtosecond lasers.

Dulai;Feixiong Cheng;Zexian Zeng;Yuan Luo,SOAR elucidates biological insights and empowers drug discovery through spatial transcriptomics,"Spatial transcriptomics enables multiplex profiling of gene cellular expression and location within the tissue context. Although large volumes of spatial transcriptomics data have been generated, the lack of systematic curation and analysis limits biological discovery. We present Spatial transcriptOmics Analysis Resource (SOAR), a comprehensive spatial transcriptomics platform with 3461 uniformly processed samples across 13 species, 42 tissue types, and 19 different spatial transcriptomics technologies. Using SOAR, we found thatCXCL16/SPP1macrophage polarity characterizes the coordination of immune cell polarity in the tumor microenvironment. SOAR’s integrative approach toward drug discovery revealed sirolimus and trichostatin A as potential anticancer agents targeting the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin growth and proliferation pathway and identified Janus kinase/signal transducers and activators of transcription inhibitors for ulcerative colitis treatment. SOAR’s results demonstrate its broad application to data generated from diverse spatial technologies and pathological conditions. SOAR will support future benchmarking studies and method development, facilitating discoveries in molecular functions, disease mechanisms, and potential therapeutic targets."
