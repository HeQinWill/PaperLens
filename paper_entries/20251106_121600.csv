10.5194/acp-25-14669-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注使用被动和主动的机载遥感技术（包括成像光谱仪和温室气体激光雷达）来识别和量化西班牙马德里垃圾填埋场排放的甲烷（CH4）。研究结合了卫星观测数据，验证了垃圾填埋场的高甲烷排放率。论文展示了两种遥感技术在量化甲烷排放方面的能力，并通过质量平衡方法估算了排放量，同时讨论了大气边界层条件带来的限制。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析，密切相关。,"['Methane emissions', 'Landfills', 'Airborne imaging spectrometry', 'Greenhouse gas lidar', 'Satellite observations', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Remote sensing', 'MAMAP2DL', 'CHARM-F']",Sven Krautwurst;Christian Fruck;Sebastian Wolff;Jakob Borchardt;Oke Huhs;Konstantin Gerilowski;Michał Gałkowski;Christoph Kiemle;Mathieu Quatrevalet;Martin Wirth;Christian Mallaun;John P. Burrows;Christoph Gerbig;Andreas Fix;Hartmut Bösch;Heinrich Bovensmann,Identification and quantification of CH4 emissions  from Madrid landfills using airborne imaging spectrometry and greenhouse gas lidar,"Anomalously high CH4 emissions from landfills in Madrid, Spain, have been observed by satellite measurements in recent years. Our investigations of these waste facilities, using passive and active airborne remote sensing measurements, confirm these high emission rates with values of up to 13 th−1 during the overflight and show excellent agreement between the two techniques. A large fraction of the emissions is attributed to active landfill sites. 
 Methane (CH4), alongside carbon dioxide (CO2), is a key driver of anthropogenic climate change. Reducing CH4 is crucial for short-term climate mitigation. Waste-related activities, such as landfills, are a major CH4 source, even in developed countries. Atmospheric concentration measurements using remote sensing (RS) offer a powerful way to quantify these emissions. We study waste facilities near Madrid, Spain, where satellite data indicated high CH4 emissions. For the first time, we combine passive imaging (Methane Airborne Mapper 2D – Light, MAMAP2DL) and active lidar (CO2 and CH4 Atmospheric Remote Monitoring – Flugzeug, CHARM-F) remote sensing aboard the German High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO), supported by in situ instruments, to quantify CH4 emissions. Using the CH4 column data and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) reanalysis v5 (ERA5) model wind information validated by airborne measurements, we estimate landfill emissions through a cross-sectional mass balance approach. Strong emission plumes are traced up to 20 km downwind on 4 August 2022, with the highest CH4 column anomalies observed over active landfill areas in the vicinity of Madrid, Spain. Total emissions are estimated to be up to ∼ 13 t h−1. Single co-located plume crossings from both instruments agree well within 1.2 t h−1 (or 13 %). Flux errors range from ∼ 25 % to 40 %, mainly due to boundary layer (BL) and wind speed variability. This case study not only showcases the capabilities of applying a simple but fast cross-sectional mass balance approach, along with its limitations due to challenging atmospheric boundary layer conditions, but also demonstrates, to our knowledge, the first successful use of both active and passive airborne remote sensing to quantify methane emissions from hotspots and independently verify their emissions."

Our results show that the Asian monsoon is mainly controlled by large-scale temperature, whereas the North American monsoon may be more influenced by convective moistening. These differences point to distinct mechanisms shaping moisture transport in the two monsoon systems. 
 Water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere plays a crucial role for climate, affecting radiation, chemistry, and atmospheric dynamics. This study applies a simplified Lagrangian method to reconstruct stratospheric water vapor based on satellite observations from the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment III on the International Space Station (SAGE III/ISS) and the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). The objective is to improve understanding of moisture enhancements in the Asian and North American monsoons and to identify the key factors contributing to reconstruction biases. The performance of Lagrangian reconstructions significantly improves with the size of trajectory ensembles but exhibits a general dry bias. The reconstruction represents the summertime local water vapor maximum well in the Asian monsoon, particularly above the tropopause, but not in the North American monsoon. The main dehydration region diagnosed from trajectories indicates that water vapor in the Asian monsoon is predominantly controlled by local tropopause temperatures. The dry bias in reconstructions below the tropopause over the Asian monsoon shows a positive correlation with convection intensity, particularly in the western part of the monsoon region, suggesting that underestimated moistening from convection may contribute to this bias. Water vapor mixing ratios in the North American monsoon are largely influenced by long-range transport from dehydrated regions over southern Asia and additional local moistening. The limited performance of reconstructions in the North American monsoon is therefore likely linked to underestimation of local convection or uncertainties in long-range transport."

This study aimed to characterize the pollution levels, identify the primary sources, and assess the health risks linked to PFAS in PM2.5. The study indicated that seasonal regulation manufacturing related to perfluorooctanoic acid and joint pollution control with neighboring cities could reduce PFAS levels in PM2.5. 
 Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have become the focus due to their physicochemical stability and potential toxicity. In this study, the investigation aimed to characterize the pollution levels, identify the primary sources, and assess the health risks associated with PFAS in PM2.5. The average concentration range for PFAS were between 46.68 and 181.63 pg m−3, with the main components being perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), and perfluorobutanoic acid. PFAS concentrations in PM2.5 were greatly influenced by the short- and medium-range air masses, and markedly elevated by industrial activities in surrounding urban areas. The results by positive matrix factorization revealed that PFOA-based products (38.2 %) and degradation byproducts of fluorotelomer alcohols (26.7 %) were the predominant sources. The average daily inhalation of 17 PFAS fluctuated greatly (median: 4.35 × 10−3 to 8.78 pg (kg d)−1), showing different seasonal variations with estimated daily intake of PFOA and PFOS reaching peak value in winter (5869.39 pg) and spring (4219.41 pg), respectively. The research indicated that seasonal regulation of PFOA-related manufacturing and joint pollution control with neighboring cities could reduce PFAS levels in PM2.5. The results provided theoretical support for government to make targeted control plans for PFAS and basic data for relevant researchers."

Researchers quantify the heating and cooling effects of this interaction using climate models. However, the use of different historical weather matching methods has produced a large variation in results. Here, we test method variations commonly used today and conclude with new guidelines for achieving the most accurate results. 
 Biomass burning aerosols (BBAs) from African fires may strongly impact Earth’s radiation budget in the southeast Atlantic (SEA), but the sign and magnitude of the overall radiative effect (RE) remain uncertain.  Aerosol–climate models are needed to separately quantify direct, indirect, and semi-direct REs. Here, we evaluate improved simulations with the UK Met Office's Unified Model and explore REs resulting from various methods used to match observed meteorology (nudging or running forecasts reinitialized at different frequencies). REs are calculated as differences in radiative fluxes between simulations with and without smoke emissions and with and without aerosol absorption. All model setups agree on net warming for the SEA dominated by the direct effect. Simulated smoke, clouds, and the direct effect agree better with observations than previous studies using the same model, though biases in aerosol extinction and liquid water path remain. Changes in cloud droplet number concentration due to BBA self-lofting influence how cleanly we can separate cloud effects into semi-direct and indirect effects. Total RE, which remains unaffected, ranges from +3.0 to +7.9 W m−2. The 4.9 W m−2 spread arises mainly from simulated semi-direct effects. Forecasts three days long or less probably do not allow time for plausible differences in boundary layer properties due to semi-direct effects to accumulate. Free running simulations with and without smoke accumulate differences in meteorology that are likely spurious “butterfly effects”. We recommend future research quantifying BBA REs over weeks to months to use meteorological forcing techniques that allow aerosol absorption to affect the boundary layer."

The findings refine the fundamental understanding of stratospheric ozone intrusion and its contribution to surface ozone pollution in China. 
 Understanding stratospheric intrusion (SI) is crucial for elucidating atmospheric complexities and improving strategies to mitigate surface ozone (O3) pollution. This study investigates a deep trough-induced SI event in China from 10 to 13 June 2013, based on ozonesondes from Beijing, Changchun, and Hong Kong, and validated O3 reanalysis products. Ozonesondes from Beijing indicated notable upper-level secondary O3 peaks (> 400 ppbv) since 11 June. Tropospheric sub-high O3 layers were observed in Changchun on 12 June (> 120 ppbv) and Hong Kong on 13 June (> 80 ppbv). Nationwide surface measurements recorded severe O3 pollution (> 100 ppbv) from western plateaus to eastern plains over China. Together, these observations suggest a widespread influence of stratospheric O3 intrusion. Further, the ozonesonde-validated EAC4 reanalysis reproduced the fine-scale SI structure (O3-rich “tongue”), in turn well explaining the secondary O3 peaks and sub-high O3 layers in ozonesonde observations. The O3-rich “tongue” swept through the Tibetan Plateau on 10 June, triggering extreme O3 pollution with a stratospheric contribution up to 30 ppbv (> 30 %). With the trough's eastward movement, the O3-rich “tongue” penetrated into the lower troposphere of eastern China, and then entrained into the surface layer, exacerbating surface O3 pollution occurred in eastern China on 13 June, with a stratospheric O3 contribution of 3–15 ppbv (2 %–10 %). This research underscores the importance of multi-site ozonesondes in understanding stratospheric O3 intrusions and the potential of the publicly available EAC4 reanalysis in multiyear SI analyses."
10.5194/acp-25-14747-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文利用卫星观测数据和空气质量模型，建立了一个针对中国东部地区的高分辨率氨排放清单。研究重点在于优化氨排放，以减少PM2.5污染，并评估其对环境和健康的协同效益。研究使用IASI卫星数据，结合WRF-Chem模型，优化了氨排放量，并量化了不同来源的减排对PM2.5污染的影响。结果表明，减少氨排放可以降低PM2.5浓度，并减少相关的健康风险，尤其强调了控制非农业氨排放的重要性。,"['ammonia emissions', 'PM2.5', 'satellite observations', 'air quality modeling', 'WRF-Chem model', 'IASI', 'emission inventory', 'atmospheric composition']",Keqin Tang;Haoran Zhang;Ge Xu;Fengyi Chang;Yang Xu;Ji Miao;Xian Cui;Jianbin Jin;Baojie Li;Ke Li;Hong Liao;Nan Li,Optimizing ammonia emissions for PM2.5 mitigation: environmental and health co-benefits in Eastern China,"Our research combined satellite observations with air quality modeling to establish a high-resolution ammonia emission inventory for Eastern China. Reducing ammonia emissions could lower particulate pollution levels by 1.5–8.8 micrograms per cubic meter and reduce related health risks. Meanwhile, sensitivity simulations highlight the critical need to non-agricultural emission controls for effective particulate mitigation. 
 Ammonia (NH3) is a key precursor of PM2.5, contributing to the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols and playing a crucial role in haze events. However, current bottom-up emission inventories in China often underestimate NH3 emissions, particularly with significant uncertainties in urban areas. This study developed a “top-down” iterative algorithm that integrates the IASI satellite observations with the WRF-Chem model to optimize bottom-up NH3 emissions, and further quantified the impacts of source-specific emission reductions on PM2.5 pollution. The result reveals that the updated NH3 emissions in Eastern China for 2016 amounted to 4.2 Tg yr−1, 27.3 % higher than prior estimations. The optimized NH3 emissions peak in summer at 463.1 Gg month−1, with agricultural sources accounting for 85 %, while winter emissions drop to 217 Gg month−1 when the contribution from non-agricultural sources (e.g., industry, vehicle) significantly increases. The optimized NH3 emission significantly improved the simulation of both total column and surface NH3 concentrations, with improvements in magnitude (31 %–42 %) and variations (17 %–55 %). Sensitivity simulations show that a 30 %–60 % reduction in NH3 emission led to decreases of 1.5–8.8 µg m−3 in city-level PM2.5 concentrations and the potential effect of reducing non-agricultural emissions is comparable with that from agricultural sources. Furthermore, the NH3 reduction positively impacts public health, resulting in a 6.5 %–10.3 % decrease in premature deaths attributed to PM2.5 exposure. Our study evaluated NH3 emissions from various sources in Eastern China, emphasizing the impact of reducing non-agricultural ammonia emissions on air quality and public health benefits."

Petrakis;Vassilis Amiridis,Atmospheric dust and air quality over large-cities and megacities of the world,"Based on Earth observations of dust the study addresses the questions: To what extent have the fine and coarse modes of atmospheric dust within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) changed over major cities worldwide? Which areas experience fine-mode and coarse-mode dust mass concentrations within the PBL that exceed World Health Organization air quality guidelines, and which areas are projected to exceed these guidelines in the near future? Can we quantify associated impacts on human health? 
 According to the United Nations (UN) more than 55 % of the global population resided in urban areas in 2018, a number projected to increase to an estimated 60 % of the world's population by 2030. As urbanization accelerates, degradation of air quality becomes an increasing environmental pressure to human welfare and health. To date, epidemiological studies reveal a strong connection between airborne dust and adverse health effects. This study investigates the fine-mode and coarse-mode dust particulate matter levels within the planetary boundary layer (PBL) over major cities and megacities of the world (population > 5 million), leveraging on the European Space Agency (ESA) – “LIdar climatology of Vertical Aerosol Structure” (LIVAS) multiyear satellite-based dust climate data record. Results show that current dust levels exceed World Health Organization (WHO) annual-mean air quality guidelines (AQGs) for PM2.5 and PM10 in 49.4 % and 87.7 % of the cities considered, respectively, exposing ∼ 700 million people to hazardous dust concentrations. Moreover, according to the outcomes of the study, this number is expected to increase to ∼ 850 million individuals (∼ 22 % increase) by 2030s, though due to the general declining dust tendencies the health hazard is projected to be diminished in severity. Particularly affected are cities in the regions of Middle East, Indian subcontinent, East Asia, North Africa, and the Sahel. Epidemiological models are employed to estimate associated health risks. The study provides an informative mitigation and adaptation tool to support observational-based policymaking, air quality management, and public health planning to protect human health in the context of accelerating urbanization."

Moritz Menken;Thomas Birner,Adiabatic versus diabatic transport contributions to the ozone budget in the northern hemispheric upper troposphere and lower stratosphere,"We study ozone transport in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere using potential temperature as vertical coordinate, thereby distinguishing adiabatic and diabatic processes. We find that on top of known dominant transport processes (quasi-horizontal mixing, slow diabatic descent) vertical mixing plays an important role near the tropopause. Our findings are relevant for understanding ozone's role in climate including its imprint on tropospheric ozone via stratosphere-troposphere air exchange. 
 Ozone in the extratropical lowermost stratosphere (LMS) is important for the local radiative balance and contributes to the tropospheric and near-surface ozone burden via stratosphere–troposphere exchange. Here, we aim to deepen our understanding of the transport contributions to LMS ozone in the Northern Hemisphere by studying the ozone budget in isentropic coordinates, which allows for a clean distinction of adiabatic and diabatic transport contributions. This is done by analyzing 20 years of ERA5 reanalysis output on model levels and a free-running simulation using the EMAC chemistry–climate model. Our analysis confirms that the ozone tendencies in the extratropical LMS at high latitudes are dominated by diabatic mean flow advection (associated with downwelling within the Brewer–Dobson circulation) and quasi-horizontal adiabatic eddy mixing due to planetary- and medium-scale Rossby waves. These transport contributions are somewhat weaker during summer compared to winter, although seasonality is found to be weaker in the LMS compared to higher altitudes. Horizontal mean flow advection is found to be relevant near the tropopause and just above the subtropical jet core. Notably, vertical (i.e., diabatic) eddy ozone transport is found to be important near the tropopause. While the adiabatic eddy ozone fluxes in the LMS are consistent with diffusive, down-gradient eddy transport, the vertical eddy ozone transport also features up-gradient regions, which by itself would act to reinforce the background ozone gradients near the tropopause. Closer analysis reveals that this is due to long-wave radiative damping of planetary waves, which acts to dampen the down-gradient horizontal eddy transport."

During the storm on 4 November 2021, the mesospheric metal layer depletion was recorded by three lidars for different metal components at mid-latitudes. The storm induced oxygen density enhancement is considered to consume more metal atoms in the metal layer. It implies that the effects of storm have reached mesosphere, and the influence of storm on metal layer is achieved through chemical processes. 
 Metal layer forms as a result of meteoric ablation and exist as a layer of metal elements between approximately 80 and 105 km altitude, and it provides information about the physics and chemistry of the boundary between the atmosphere and space. There are some studies about the wind field disturbances in Mesosphere and Low Thermosphere (MLT) region and the plasma variations in ionospheric E-region during magnetic storms, but no study on the impact of storms on the metal atom layers in mesosphere. During the super substorm on 4 November 2021, the atmospheric metal layers were observed to decrease by observations from three lidars at the mid-latitudes of China. The Na, Ca and Ni densities on the storm day were significantly lower than in other days in October and November. The O/N2 column density ratio observed by the Global Ultraviolet Imager (GUVI) on the storm day was much higher than on quiet days, and the numerical simulation results demonstrate a substantial increase in atomic oxygen density at the heights of the metal layer. The increase in oxygen density may lead to the formation of more metal compounds, thus more metal atoms are consumed. This is an interesting phenomenon that magnetic storm can perturb the atmospheric metal layer through chemical reactions."

This is the first long-term study of how their energies vary with height and season in the middle atmosphere near the Arctic. Waves were stronger and varied more in winter, while in summer slow waves tied to Earth's rotation dominated. We also observed new patterns in how energy is shared between both energy types and height-dependent changes in wave behaviour. These results refine our view of such waves. 
 We present the first multi-year study of gravity-wave (GW) kinetic Ekin and potential Epot energy spectra in the polar middle atmosphere, based on simultaneous temperature and horizontal-wind measurements by the Doppler Rayleigh–Mie–Raman lidar at the ALOMAR observatory (69° N, 16° E). The analysed 7 year dataset (2017–2023) comprises 61 soundings, each longer than 12 h, totalling 2036 h of observations between 35–60 km. Our results reveal a strong winter-summer contrast that depends on both frequency and vertical wavenumber: winter spectra exhibit significantly higher energies and greater variability, particularly at long periods, while summer spectra are marked by a distinct near-inertial peak, most pronounced in Ekin. We further reveal that the ratio of kinetic to potential energy depends systematically on frequency and vertical wavelength, with near-inertial, short-vertical-scale waves channelling a disproportionate share of energy into kinetic form, indicating that the two-dimensional GW spectrum cannot be treated as fully separable. Frequency spectra also show, for the first time, broken power laws at 35–40 km, merging into a single flatter power law with increasing altitude. These findings provide new constraints on the spectral energy budget at high latitudes in the middle atmosphere and deliver essential benchmarks for validating and improving GW parameterisations in climate and numerical weather prediction models."

Kumjian;Mariko Oue;Pavlos Kollias,Detection of multi-modal Doppler spectra – Part 1: Establishing characteristic signals in radar moment data,"Doppler spectral data inform on how particles of varying vertical velocities contribute to total backscattered power observed. Through examining three case studies, consistent features in radar moment data were found to be characteristic of multi-modal spectra. We quantified how spectrum width and mean Doppler velocity can be used to determine whether or not a layer is multi-modal. The identification criteria and methods are described in Part 1 and assessed in Part 2. 
 Vertically pointing millimeter-wavelength radars provide a wealth of information about cloud and precipitation particle properties. Doppler spectral data can inform on how particles of varying vertical velocities contribute to the total backscattered power observed. It is more computationally cost effective to process moment data instead of spectra data, but doing so leaves valuable information on the cutting room floor. To confidently identify a multi-modal spectra event, in which two or more modes are present within a layer, Doppler spectral data are essential. This means long-term identification of layers featuring multi-modal spectra can be cost prohibitive. To address this, we explore three multi-modal spectra cases from winter precipitation events to determine characteristic signatures of these layers in the moment data averaged over short time periods (∼ 145 s) and explore how these layers differ from the rest of the vertical profiles. We find that the mean spectrum width and the standard deviation of mean Doppler velocity can be used to determine whether or not a layer is multi-modal. In particular, multi-modal layers in mixed-phase and ice clouds feature larger mean spectrum width (exceeding 0.17 m s−1) and smaller standard deviation of the mean Doppler velocity (below 0.1 m s−1). In Part 1 of this study, the identification criteria and methods are described. In Part 2 (Wugofski and Kumjian, 2025), we perform a verification of the method for three years of vertically pointing radar data, and explore the meteorological conditions associated with identified multi-modal spectral events."

Lee,Mitigating impacts of low energy laser pulses on CALIOP data products,"The spaceborne atmospheric lidar CALIOP experienced an increasing number of intermittent low energy laser pulses in the final seven years of the 17-year long CALIPSO mission. Low energy pulses degraded the quality of retrievals in affected profiles. This paper describes low energy mitigation (LEM) algorithms that remove affected data and minimize data loss. LEM is demonstrated to correct calibration biases, reduce false feature detections, and restore the integrity of the CALIOP data record. 
 The spaceborne Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) experienced an increasing number of intermittent low energy laser pulses in the final 7 years of the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Observations (CALIPSO) mission due to coronal arcing within the laser canister as internal pressure levels decreased. Degraded data quality was initially observed primarily over the South Atlantic Anomaly (SAA) region, with impacts eventually spreading globally at lower rates. To preserve the integrity of the CALIOP data record, a suite of low energy mitigation (LEM) procedures was developed to reject data that is substantially impacted by low energy pulses on small, targeted scales to minimize data loss. LEM corrects level 1B calibration biases of −3 % to −4 % and reduces calibration uncertainties by 20 %–40 % at SAA-latitudes (0–50° S) for the 532 nm daytime and 1064 nm channels. LEM rejection in level 2 processing substantially reduces the occurrence of false feature detections. Horizontally averaged data segments that are LEM-affected (i.e., some low energy shots are present, but LEM determines the filtered profile is still acceptable) experience a signal-to-noise ratio reduction of 6 %–9 % which increases the probability of false detections, though this is mitigated somewhat by a slight increase in feature detection thresholds. Features identified in LEM-affected data are similar to unaffected features in terms of measured layer-averaged properties that are important for classification and subtyping. Overall, this evidence suggests that LEM has eliminated the major impacts of low energy pulses on data quality. LEM procedures were implemented in the version 4.51 level 1B data release and are implemented in all data levels of the final version 5 CALIOP data release."

These aerosols are of interest to atmospheric science as they have a significant impact on the Earth's climate. ALI has the ability to measure the polarization of atmospheric light over a wide spectral range, which is a novel ability for the measurement ALI uses. We demonstrate and discuss ALI capability and how the polarized information may improve aerosol information for this type of measurement. 
 The Aerosol Limb Imager (ALI) is designed to measure stratospheric aerosol by imaging limb-scattered sunlight. Each image taken by ALI is spectrally filtered at a tunable wavelength and refined to consist of either horizontally or vertically polarized light. Novel to limb imaging, these polarized observations of ALI provide a means to isolate tangent altitudes which have signal contaminated by clouds as identified by the depolarization of the scattered radiance. This avoids the ambiguity caused by clouds to be interpreted as aerosol in a retrieval. We present a polarized aerosol retrieval methodology which retrieves vertically resolved aerosol number density and median radius of a unimodal log-normal distribution, in addition to a scalar (uniform in altitude) width of the log-normal distribution. We explore the cloud discrimination and aerosol retrieval of ALI in simulation as validation of the efficacy and the limits to the technique. We then apply the retrieval to three example sets of observations taken from the most recent high-altitude balloon flight of ALI. One set provides a nominal exemplar, while the other two represent more difficult retrieval conditions of an increasingly polarized atmosphere. We compare the aerosol extinction of ALI in all three exemplar cases to the best coincident extinctions of three space based instruments: the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE III/ISS), the Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP), and the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imaging System (OSIRIS). We provide discussion on the agreement of all three cases against the comparison instruments with respect to the efficacy of our approach. However, we find the retrieved aerosol extinction of ALI in the nominal case (considering the limitations of ballooning) is in good agreement (a median absolute percent difference < 29 %) to the extinction reported by SAGE III/ISS, OMPS-LP, and OSIRIS while also yielding aerosol particle size information. In the case of SAGE III/ISS, the comparison with ALI results is extended into the aerosol size parameters. In a nominal case SAGE III/ISS and ALI aerosol effective radius agree within uncertainty for the majority of altitudes."

By using satellite images from multiple sources, we provide accurate and consistent data that helps detect changes in vegetation due to factors like fires. This tool is crucial for farmers, environmental managers, and policymakers to monitor and protect plant life, ensuring better management of natural resources and agricultural productivity. 
 Systematic monitoring and assessment of vegetation dynamics and changes are essential for informing environmental management and conservation strategies. Addressing this need, our study introduces a pioneering procedure to generate a database of vegetation indices that provides semi-monthly updates from 1981 to the present at a 1.1 km spatial resolution, focusing on the Iberian Peninsula and the Balearic Islands. This database enables near-real-time monitoring and analysis of vegetation anomalies. The methodology developed combines harmonized historical satellite imagery from AVHRR, MODIS, and VIIRS sensors. The database's performance was assessed, demonstrating highly accurate and consistent harmonization of NDVI data over time. Notably, the database is adept at identifying temporal variability and trends in vegetation activity and detecting disturbances caused by fire and other phenomena. This work not only advances our understanding of vegetation dynamics in the region but also serves as a crucial tool for policymakers, environmental managers, and agricultural stakeholders. By providing near-real-time updates and using indices to monitor vegetation anomalies, the data allows for comparisons across seasons and vegetation types.

The data show a relatively large level of variability, but also important trends in greenhouse gases, and signals from fires as well as seasonal biological activity. 
 Long-term and high-precision measurements of the mole fraction of greenhouse gases (GHG), together with their isotopic composition, are of fundamental importance to understand land–atmosphere interactions. Current flask monitoring programs have important information gaps in large regions of the Earth, particularly in the southern hemisphere and in continental tropical regions. Here, we report on the initiation of a monitoring program and the resulting dataset of high-precision GHG measurements at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO), located in the central Amazon region of Brazil. In September 2021, we installed an automated flask sampler designed and built by the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) to collect air samples in 3 L flasks at a height of 324 m above ground level (ma.g.l.).  Samples are collected weekly, during a one-hour integration time between 13:00 and 14:00 h LT (17:00–18:00 UTC). The flasks are shipped to Jena, Germany, for analyses of CO2, CO, CH4, N2O, H2, SF6, δ13C−CO2, Δ14C−CO2, δ18O−CO2, δ13C−CH4, δ2H−CH4, O2/N2, and Ar/N2 at the laboratories of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC).  Measurements from this monitoring program provide reference information for this site and act as an additional independent quality control for other measurements in the region.

 Precise monitoring of key forest soil properties is crucial for addressing global challenges like carbon sequestration and soil acidification. However, existing national soil maps, primarily derived from comprehensive ecosystem samples, inadequately represent the distinct characteristics and high spatial heterogeneity of China's vast and diverse forest ecosystems. To bridge this gap, we present the first high-resolution (90-m), forest-specific maps of soil bulk density (BD) and pH across China. Leveraging 4,356 forest soil profiles collected through extensive field surveys and 41 environmental covariates within an optimized Quantile Regression Forests (QRF) framework incorporating forward recursive feature selection (FRFS), we generated wall-to-wall predictions for five standardized depth intervals (0–5, 5–15, 15–30, 30–60, 60–100 cm).

Existing research has been limited by the absence of such benchmark data. Our dataset includes both computer-generated and real-world examples, allowing models to be tested and compared in a consistent way. By making these resources openly available, we aim to advance research on the shallow and deep Earth. 
 Surface wave dispersion curve inversion plays a critical role in both shallow geophysical exploration and deep geological studies, yet it remains hindered by sensitivity to initial models, susceptibility to local minima, and low computational efficiency. Recently, data-driven deep learning methods, inspired by their success in computer vision and natural language processing, have shown promising potential to overcome these challenges. However, the lack of large-scale and diverse benchmark datasets remains a major obstacle to the development and evaluation of such methods. To address this gap, we introduce OpenSWI, a comprehensive benchmark dataset generated through the Surface Wave Inversion Dataset Preparation (SWIDP) pipeline. OpenSWI comprises two synthetic datasets tailored to different research scales and application scenarios, namely OpenSWI-shallow and OpenSWI-deep, as well as an AI-ready real-world dataset for generalization evaluation, OpenSWI-real. OpenSWI-shallow is derived from the 2-D geological model dataset OpenFWI, containing over 22 million 1-D velocity profiles paired with their fundamental-mode phase and group velocity dispersion curves, spanning a broad spectrum of shallow geological structures (e.g., flat layers, faults, folds, and realistic stratigraphy). OpenSWI-deep is built from 14 global and regional 3-D geological models, comprising approximately 1.26 million high-fidelity 1-D velocity-dispersion data pairs for deep earth studies. OpenSWI-real, compiled from open-source projects, contains two sets of observed dispersion curves and their corresponding 1-D reference models, serving as a benchmark for evaluating the generalization of deep learning models. To demonstrate the utility of OpenSWI, we trained deep learning models on OpenSWI-shallow and OpenSWI-deep, and evaluated them on OpenSWI-real. The results show strong agreement between the predicted and reference velocity models, confirming the diversity and representativeness of the OpenSWI dataset.

We demonstrate the capability and efficiency of pyPDAF under a coupled data assimilation setup. 
 Data assimilation (DA) is an essential component of numerical weather and climate prediction. Efficient implementation of DA algorithms benefits both research and operational prediction. Currently, a variety of DA software programs are available. One of the notable DA libraries is the Parallel Data Assimilation Framework (PDAF) designed for ensemble data assimilation. The DA framework is widely used with complex high-dimensional climate models, and is applied for research on atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and marine ecosystem modelling, as well as operational ocean forecasting. Meanwhile, there are increasing demands for flexible and efficient DA implementations using Python due to the increasing amount of intermediate complexity models as well as machine learning based models coded in Python. To accommodate for such demands, we introduce a Python interface to PDAF, pyPDAF. pyPDAF allows for flexible DA system development while retaining the efficient implementation of the core DA algorithms in the Fortran-based PDAF. The ideal use-case of pyPDAF is a DA system where the model integration is independent from the DA program, which reads the model forecast ensemble, produces an analysis, and updates the restart files of the model, or a DA system where the model can be used in Python. With implementations of both PDAF and pyPDAF, this study demonstrates the use of pyPDAF and PDAF in a coupled data assimilation (CDA) setup in a coupled atmosphere-ocean model, the Modular Arbitrary-Order Ocean-Atmosphere Model (MAOOAM). This study demonstrates that pyPDAF allows for PDAF functionalities from Python where users can utilise Python functions to handle case-specific information from observations and numerical model. The study also shows that pyPDAF can be used with high-dimensional systems with little slow-down per analysis step of only up to 13 % for the localized ensemble Kalman filter LETKF in the example used in this study. The study also shows that, compared to PDAF, the overhead of pyPDAF is comparatively smaller when computationally intensive components dominate the DA system. This can be the case for systems with high-dimensional state vectors."

 Ultraviolet (UV) radiation can damage DNA and kill cells. We use laboratory and observational studies of the harmful effect of UV radiation on marine photosynthesizers to inform the implementation of a UV radiation damage function for phytoplankton photosynthesis in a modified version of the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2-UVphyto). CESM2-UVphyto is capable of simulating UV inhibition of photosynthesis among modeled phytoplankton and ocean column penetration of UV-A, UV-B, and UV-C radiation. We conduct a series of simulations with CESM2-UVphyto using the Marine Biogeochemistry Library (MARBL) ecosystem model to understand the sensitivity of phytoplankton productivity to UV radiation.  Results from the simulations indicate that increased UV radiation shifts the vertical distribution of phytoplankton biomass and productivity deeper into the column, causes a moderate decline in total global productivity, and changes phytoplankton community structure.

Our model is so fast that it is easy to optimize its parameters. Our model is made available to the ice sheet community as an easy to use open-source software coded in python. 
 Numerical age models are useful tools for investigating the age of the ice in an ice sheet. They can be used to date ice cores or to interpret isochronal horizons which are observed by radar instruments. Here, we present a new numerical age model for a flow line of an ice sheet. The assumption here is that the geometry of the flow line and the velocity shape functions are steady (i.e. constant in time). A time-varying factor can only be applied to the surface accumulation rates and basal melting rates. Our model uses an innovative logarithmic flux coordinate system (π, θ), previously published, which is suitable for solving transport equations because it tracks ice trajectories. Using this coordinate system, solving the age equation is simple, fast and accurate, because the trajectories of ice particles pass exactly through the nodes of the grid. Our numerical scheme, called Eulerian-Lagrangian, therefore combines the advantages of Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes. We present an application of this model to the flow line going from Dome C to the Beyond EPICA Little Dome C drill site and show that horizontal flow is a non-negligible factor which should be considered when modelling the age-depth relationship of the Beyond EPICA ice core.

We developed a collection of AI-based models to estimate magnitudes of CO2 and methane exchanged between the land and the atmosphere, for wetlands on a regional scale. This approach helps to inform land-use planning, restoration, and greenhouse gas accounting, while also creating a foundation for future advancements in prediction accuracy. 
 Wetlands play a pivotal role in carbon sequestration but emit methane (CH4), creating uncertainty in their net climate impact. Although process-based models offer mechanistic insights into wetland dynamics, they require extensive site-specific parameterisation (e.g. soil carbon profiles, pore-water chemistry, vegetation-specific model parameters), as well as high-resolution hydrological and meteorological inputs that are often difficult to obtain outside of well-instrumented research sites, which makes regional upscaling challenging. In contrast, data-driven models provide a scalable alternative by leveraging available datasets to identify patterns and relationships, making them more adaptable for large-scale applications. However, their performance can vary significantly depending on the quality and representativeness of the data, as well as the model design, which raises questions about their reliability and generalizability in complex wetland systems. To address these issues, we present a data-driven framework for upscaling wetland CO2 and CH4 emissions, across a range of machine learning models that vary in complexity, validated against an extensive observational dataset from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. We show that artificial intelligence (AI) approaches, including Random Forests, gradient boosting methods (XGBoost, LightGBM), Support Vector Machines (SVM) and Recurrent Neural Networks (GRU, LSTM), outperform linear regression models, with RNNs standing out, achieving an R2 of 0.73 for daily CO2 flux predictions compared to 0.64 for linear regression, and an R2 of 0.53 for CH4 flux predictions compared to 0.47 for linear regression. Interestingly, linear regression performed better than random forest for methane flux, which highlights the necessity for comparison. The, interannual variability is less well captured, with annual mean absolute error of 176 gC m−2 yr−1 for CO2 fluxes and 9 gC-CH4 m−2 yr−1  for CH4 fluxes.

Our algorithms are optimized for modern super computers, enabling efficient large-scale weather simulations. A key innovation is the model's inherent differentiable nature, allowing seamless integration with AI systems to enhance predictive capabilities through machine learning techniques. 
 This study presents the High Order Prediction Environment (HOPE), an automatically differentiable, non-oscillatory finite-volume dynamical core for shallow water equations on the cubed-sphere grid. HOPE integrates five key features: (1) arbitrary high-order accuracy through genuine two-dimensional reconstruction schemes; (2) essential non-oscillation via adaptive polynomial order reduction in discontinuous regions; (3) exact mass conservation inherited from finite-volume discretization; (4) automatically differentiable and (5) GPU-native scalability through PyTorch-based implementation. Another innovation is the development of a two-way coupled ghost cell interpolation method. This approach incorporates information from adjacent panels on both sides of the boundary, thereby overcoming the integration instability inherent in one-sided ghost cell interpolation approaches when using high-order reconstruction. Leveraging the linear operator nature of this interpolation scheme, we optimized its computation: information exchange across the panel boundary is achieved through a single matrix-vector multiplication instead of iterative coupling, without accuracy loss. Numerical experiments demonstrate the capabilities of HOPE: The 11th-order scheme reduces errors to near double-precision round-off levels in steady-state geostrophic flow tests on coarse grids. Maintenance of Rossby–Haurwitz waves over 100 simulation days without crashing. A cylindrical dam-break test case confirms the genuinely two-dimensional WENO scheme exhibits significantly better isotropy compared to dimension-by-dimension approaches. Moreover, normalized conservation errors in total energy, total potential enstrophy, and total zonal angular momentum significantly reduce with increasing order of the reconstruction scheme. Two implementations are developed: a Fortran version for convergence analysis and a PyTorch version leveraging automatic differentiation and GPU acceleration. The PyTorch implementation maps reconstruction and quadrature operation to 2D convolution and Einstein summation respectively, achieving about 2× speedup on single NVIDIA RTX3090 GPU versus Dual Intel E5-2699v4 CPUs execution. This design enables seamless coupling with neural network parameterizations, positioning HOPE as a foundational tool for next-generation differentiable atmosphere models."

This data‐driven approach effectively characterizes the time‐variant and complex multivariate relationships, thereby nonlinearly projecting the innovation onto the ensemble subspace. This significant improvement enables the ML‐based approach to increase the analysis accuracy for extreme phenomena by up to 66% over EnKF, and its ensemble increment distribution is well‐aligned with that of the target increments, showing the potential of data‐driven assimilation approach for advancing the capabilities of capturing and triggering the extreme events."

They are typically forced remotely or locally by variations in equatorial or alongshore winds, respectively. We use an extensive in‐situ data set to show that sea surface salinity (SSS) changes can also act as a local forcing that amplifies these extreme warm and cold events by altering the water column stratification and consequently the impact of subsurface mixing. The mixed layer turbulent heat loss during an extreme warm episode with unusually low SSS in 1995 is nearly 3× lower than during a cold event with high SSS in 1997. We also demonstrate that interannual turbulent heat flux variability in early boreal spring off Angola is strongly impacted by salt advection fluctuations, and that this turbulent mixing is significant for altering mixed layer temperatures and restoring its salinities."

We augment traditional single‐beam bubble detection methods by utilizing all five beams of the ADCP to achieve broader spatial coverage of bubble plume measurements.

The QBWO_SCS modulates marine boundary layer jets (MBLJs) embedded in the southwesterly monsoon flow during June, the late Meiyu season. During the first half cycle from Phase 1 (P1) to Phase 2 (P2), convection is most suppressed over the SCS in P2, while enhanced convective activity is observed within the Meiyu trough over southeastern China. An anomalous low‐level anticyclonic circulation over the SCS leads to increased (decreased) MBLJ frequency over the northern (southern) SCS, and these anomalies reverse in Phase 4 (P4). In P2, QBWO_SCS‐intensified MBLJs near the southeastern coast of China create favorable conditions for heavy inland rainfall. First, strengthened southwesterly MBLJs enhance moisture transport from the SCS to inland southeast China and increase moisture convergence within the Meiyu trough. Second, warm, moist air advected inland meets continental cold air, enhancing baroclinicity and frontogenesis, which strongly correlates with inland rainfall maxima. Third, the topography of southeast China amplifies rainfall through orographic lifting as moisture‐laden MBLJs impinge on elevated terrain. In contrast, during P4, weakened MBLJs reduce moisture transport, convergence, and frontogenesis, leading to diminished inland rainfall. Meanwhile, QBWO_SCS‐induced convection‐coupled circulation in P4 supports monsoon trough development and enhances heavy precipitation over coastal south China, the northern SCS, and southern Taiwan. About 25% of QBWOs over SCS are positively correlated with low‐level cyclonic flow originating from QBWOs over the tropical western Pacific, 10% are weakly modulated by the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation, and 65% are caused by other processes."

However, the coarse spatial resolution of Earth system models, such as the Norwegian Climate Prediction Model (NorCPM), limits their ability to resolve fine‐scale ice features that are critical for safe Arctic navigation. To address the limitation, we implement a dynamical downscaling approach in a case study covering the 2023 autumn freeze‐up season. Specifically, a NorCPM hindcast provides atmospheric forcing for the regional coupled ocean‐sea ice model, the Norwegian High‐resolution pan‐Arctic ocean, and sea ice Prediction System (NorHAPS), which produces high‐resolution (3–5 km) hindcasts of Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC). The downscaled SIC predictions show improved performance throughout the prediction period with particularly notable reductions in the overestimation bias along the Northeast and Northwest Passages prior to mid‐to‐late October especially in marginal ice zones. Furthermore, NorHAPS provides a more accurate representation of local discontinuities and fine‐scale sea ice structures in key regions of the Arctic passages, such as the Laptev Sea, Canadian Arctic Archipelago, and Beaufort Sea. These improvements are associated with a more realistic simulation of sea ice freeze‐up processes, which mitigates the premature freezing found in NorCPM outputs. Overall, our results demonstrate that dynamical downscaling is a viable method for refining the outputs of coarse‐resolution climate models. This approach generates detailed sea ice predictions, which can support safe Arctic maritime operations."

They readily react with nucleophiles, participate in pericyclic reactions, and activate inert σ-bonds. Despite their potential, arynes are currently used by a specialized community for mainly niche applications. The lack of widespread adoption of arynes is due to the undesirable means to generate them. Here, we report the design of an aryne precursor to overcome this prohibitive barrier. Readily available carboxylic acids are derivatized in a single step to a make a precursor which is then activated by blue light or by heat. Dozens of previously unknown aminated arynes, including pyridynes, are generated in this work, opening the door to drug discovery using aryne intermediates.

 The amplification of extremely short laser pulses (under 100 fs) presents a fundamental challenge due to the trade-off between amplification bandwidth, efficiency and gain1. Conventional methods rely on complex optical set-ups with preprocessing and postprocessing steps2. Optical parametric amplification3 offers a high optical gain that scales with the length of the nonlinear medium at the expense of bandwidth, limiting its effectiveness for extremely short and intrinsically broadband ultrashort pulses, whose amplification requires a broad gain–bandwidth, high single-pass gain and simultaneously strong nonlinear interaction. Here we introduce a new multipass4 optical parametric amplification system that leverages dispersion-engineered dielectric mirrors to repeatedly focus the laser into a nonlinear gain crystal. The coatings simultaneously compensate for the group delay5 after each multipass step and suppress the idler wave and, therefore, backconversion. This approach achieves ×1,500 higher gain compared with single-pass amplification, a photon conversion efficiency of up to 81% (52% system conversion efficiency) and near Fourier-limited time–bandwidth products of the amplified pulses, while fully preserving the spatial beam quality. Our concept breaks the gain versus bandwidth barrier and achieves 12 THz at 41 dB gain. As our concept does not require specific gain materials, it is versatile and broadly applicable to ultrafast6 laser systems in quantum technologies7–9, attosecond physics10–12, material processing and ultrabroadband low-cost bio-imaging systems13,14.

 Emerging evidence indicates that cancer cells are susceptible to ferroptosis, a form of cell death that is triggered by uncontrolled lipid peroxidation1–3. Despite broad enthusiasm about harnessing ferroptosis as a novel anti-cancer strategy, whether ferroptosis is a barrier to tumorigenesis and can be leveraged therapeutically remains unknown4,5. Here, using genetically engineered mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma, we performed tumour-specific loss-of-function studies of two key ferroptosis suppressors, GPX46,7 and ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1)8,9, and observed increased lipid peroxidation and robust suppression of tumorigenesis, suggesting that lung tumours are highly sensitive to ferroptosis. Furthermore, across multiple pre-clinical models, we found that FSP1 was required for ferroptosis protection in vivo, but not in vitro, underscoring a heightened need to buffer lipid peroxidation under physiological conditions. Lipidomic analyses revealed that Fsp1-knockout tumours had an accumulation of lipid peroxides, and inhibition of ferroptosis with genetic, dietary or pharmacological approaches effectively restored the growth of Fsp1-knockout tumours in vivo. Unlike GPX4, expression of FSP1 (also known as AIFM2) was prognostic for disease progression and poorer survival in patients with lung adenocarcinoma, highlighting its potential as a viable therapeutic target. To this end, we demonstrated that pharmacologic inhibition of FSP1 had significant therapeutic benefit in pre-clinical lung cancer models. Our studies highlight the importance of ferroptosis suppression in vivo and pave the way for FSP1 inhibition as a therapeutic strategy for patients with lung cancer. The ferroptosis suppressor protein FSP1 has a critical role in ferroptosis protection of tumours across multiple in vivo models and is linked to worse prognosis in human lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic target in lung cancer."

 The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is a highly interconnected membrane network that serves as a central site for protein synthesis and maturation1. A crucial subset of ER-associated transcripts, termed secretome mRNAs, encode secretory, lumenal and integral membrane proteins, representing nearly one-third of human protein-coding genes1. Unlike cytosolic mRNAs, secretome mRNAs undergo co-translational translocation, and thus require precise coordination between translation and protein insertion2,3. Disruption of this process, such as through altered elongation rates4, activates stress response pathways that impede cellular growth, raising the question of whether secretome translation is spatially organized to ensure fidelity. Here, using live-cell single-molecule imaging, we demonstrate that secretome mRNA translation is preferentially localized to ER junctions that are enriched with the structural protein lunapark and in close proximity to lysosomes. Lunapark depletion reduced ribosome density and translation efficiency of secretome mRNAs near lysosomes, an effect that was dependent on eIF2-mediated initiation and was reversed by the integrated stress response inhibitor ISRIB. Lysosome-associated translation was further modulated by nutrient status: amino acid deprivation enhanced lysosome-proximal translation, whereas lysosomal pH neutralization suppressed it. These findings identify a mechanism by which ER junctional proteins and lysosomal activity cooperatively pattern secretome mRNA translation, linking ER architecture and nutrient sensing to the production of secretory and membrane proteins. Live-cell imaging of mRNA encoding secretome proteins and translated nascent peptide markers show that secretome translation occurs at endoplasmic reticulum junctions near lysosomes, requires lunapark protein and is modulated by nutrient status."

 Phylogenetics has a central role in evolutionary biology and genomic epidemiology1. Assessing phylogenetic confidence and reliability is therefore crucial and the methods that do this, such as those derived from Felsenstein’s bootstrap2, are among the most widely used in modern science. However, these methods require enormous computational capacity, and are unsuitable for large datasets. Furthermore, most of these methods emerge from a focus on the membership of clades (groupings of taxa), which makes their results difficult to interpret in the context of genomic epidemiology. Here we propose subtree pruning and regrafting-based tree assessment (SPRTA), an efficient and interpretable approach to assess confidence in phylogenetic trees. SPRTA shifts the paradigm of phylogenetic support measurement from evaluating the confidence in clades to evolution histories and phylogenetic placement—for example, assessing whether a lineage evolved from another considered lineage, which is particularly valuable in genomic epidemiology. We use SPRTA to investigate a global public SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic tree relating more than two million genomes, highlighting plausible alternative evolutionary origins of many SARS-CoV-2 variants, assessing reliability in the Pango outbreak lineage classification system3, and demonstrating the effect of phylogenetic uncertainty on inferred mutation rates. Our results show that SPRTA enables pandemic-scale and detailed probabilistic assessment of transmission and mutational histories. Our method introduces a new approach to assessing phylogenetic confidence, enhancing the interpretability of pandemic-scale phylogenetic analyses and improving our ability to prepare for and respond to future pandemics.

Although considerable progress has been made in creating fibrous materials responsive to scalar stimuli such as voltage8, temperature6, humidity2 and ion concentration9, these technologies often lack directional controllability and functional diversity10–14. Here we report a class of vector-stimuli-responsive magnetorheological fibrous materials, guided by our engineering model integrating the structural mechanics of textiles with the magnetics of soft magnetic materials. We mass-produced soft magnetic polymer composite fibres with optimized mechanical and magnetic properties, which we then assembled into concentric helical yarns. These yarns exhibited pronounced bending and stiffening properties controlled by the direction and magnitude of magnetic fields, allowing for customized fabrics with various actuation and stiffening functionalities. We demonstrated innovative smart textiles derived from those fabrics, including an active ventilation fabric for personal moisture management, an integrated conformable gripper for handling objects of varying shapes and stiffness, and a compact remote-controllable haptic finger glove that replicates the sensation of fabric hardness and smoothness. Our work provides insights into stimuli-responsive fibrous materials, elevating them from scalar to sophisticated vector control, heralding an era of smart textile innovation.

 Neurodevelopmental disorders that cause cognitive, behavioural or motor impairments affect around 15% of children and adolescents worldwide1, with diagnoses of profound autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder increasing in the USA and contributing to a major economic burden2,3. Yet the origins and mechanisms of these conditions remain poorly understood, limiting progress in therapies. Comprehensive cell atlases of the developing human brain, alongside those of model organisms such as mice and non-human primates, are now providing high-resolution measures of gene expression, cell-type abundance and spatial distribution. In this Perspective, we highlight recent studies that have identified novel developmental cell populations, revealed conserved and divergent patterns of cell genesis, migration and maturation across species, and begun testing hypotheses that link them to processes ranging from transcriptional control of cell fate specification to the emergence of complex behaviours. We present remaining conceptual and technical challenges and provide an outlook on how further studies of human and mammalian brain development can empower a deeper understanding of neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders. Future efforts expanding to additional developmental stages, including adolescence, as well as whole-brain, multimodal and cross-species integration, will yield new insights into how development shapes the brain. These atlases promise to serve as essential references for unravelling mechanisms of brain function and disease vulnerability, and for advancing precision medicine.

 Ferroptosis has emerged as an actionable target to eliminate therapy-resistant and metastatic cancers1. However, which ferroptosis surveillance systems may offer a therapeutic window to leverage redox maladaptation in cancer remains unclear. In melanoma, glutathione peroxidase 4 (GPX4) impedes ferroptosis during haematogenous metastasis, but is dispensable during lymphatic metastasis2. Here, using a metastatic mouse melanoma model selected for lymph node metastasis, we show that lymph-node-derived metastatic cells exhibit markedly diminished expression of glutamate–cysteine ligase (GCLC) and reduced glutathione (GSH) levels relative to their parental counterparts. This metabolic shift occurs within the hypoxic lymphatic niche. Under comparable low-oxygen conditions, GPX4 undergoes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. In response, lymph node metastatic cells acquire increased reliance on ferroptosis suppressor protein 1 (FSP1), which is localized with perinuclear lysosomes. These findings reveal that the reduced reliance on the GPX4 axis enables melanoma cells to shift toward FSP1 dependency. Notably, intratumoural monotherapy with selective FSP1 inhibitors (viFSP1 and FSEN1) effectively suppresses melanoma growth in lymph nodes, but not in subcutaneous tumours, emphasizing a microenvironment-specific dependency on FSP1. Thus, targeting FSP1 in the lymph nodes holds strong potential for blocking melanoma progression. Targeting FSP1 in lymph nodes has considerable potential for blocking melanoma progression."

 Computer vision is central to many artificial intelligence (AI) applications, from autonomous vehicles to consumer devices. However, the data behind such technical innovations are often collected with insufficient consideration of ethical concerns1–3. This has led to a reliance on datasets that lack diversity, perpetuate biases and are collected without the consent of data rights holders. These datasets compromise the fairness and accuracy of AI models and disenfranchise stakeholders4–8. Although awareness of the problems of bias in computer vision technologies, particularly facial recognition, has become widespread9, the field lacks publicly available, consensually collected datasets for evaluating bias for most tasks3,10,11. In response, we introduce the Fair Human-Centric Image Benchmark (FHIBE, pronounced ‘Feebee’), a publicly available human image dataset implementing best practices for consent, privacy, compensation, safety, diversity and utility. FHIBE can be used responsibly as a fairness evaluation dataset for many human-centric computer vision tasks, including pose estimation, person segmentation, face detection and verification, and visual question answering. By leveraging comprehensive annotations capturing demographic and physical attributes, environmental factors, instrument and pixel-level annotations, FHIBE can identify a wide variety of biases. The annotations also enable more nuanced and granular bias diagnoses, enabling practitioners to better understand sources of bias and mitigate potential downstream harms. FHIBE therefore represents an important step forward towards trustworthy AI, raising the bar for fairness benchmarks and providing a road map for responsible data curation in AI.

 Methane is a potent but short-lived greenhouse gas and rapid reductions of its anthropogenic emissions could help decrease near-term warming1. Solid waste emits methane through the decay of organic material, which amounts to about 10% of total anthropogenic methane emissions2. Satellite instruments3 enable monitoring of strong methane hotspots4, including many strongly emitting urban areas that include solid waste disposal sites as most prominent sources5. Here we present a survey of methane emissions from 151 individual waste disposal sites across six continents using high-resolution satellite observations that can detect localized methane emissions above 100 kg h–1. Within this dataset, we find that our satellite-based estimates generally show no correlation with reported or modelled emission estimates at facility scale. This reveals major uncertainties in the current understanding of methane emissions from waste disposal sites, warranting further investigations to reconcile bottom-up and top-down approaches. We also observe that managed landfills show lower emission per area than dumping sites, and that detected emission sources often align with the open non-covered parts of the facility where waste is added. Our results highlight the potential of high-resolution satellite observations to detect and monitor methane emissions from the waste sector globally, providing actionable insights to help improve emission estimates and focus mitigation efforts.

 Multiple-system atrophy (MSA) is a rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease of unknown cause, typically affecting individuals aged 50–60 years and leading to death within a decade1–3. It is characterized by glial cytoplasmic inclusions (GCIs) composed of fibrillar α-synuclein (aSyn)4–8, the formation of which shows parallels with prion propagation9,10. While fibrils extracted from brains of individuals with MSA have been structurally characterized11, their ability to replicate in a protein-only manner has been questioned12, and their ability to induce GCIs in vivo remains unexplored. By contrast, the synthetic fibril strain 1B13,14, assembled from recombinant human aSyn, self-replicates in vitro and induces GCIs in mice15—suggesting direct relevance to MSA—but lacks scrutiny at the atomic scale. Here we report high-resolution structural analyses of 1B fibrils and of fibrils extracted from diseased mice injected with 1B that developed GCIs (1BP). We show in vivo that conformational templating enables fibril strain replication, resulting in MSA-like inclusion pathology. Notably, the structures of 1B and 1BP are highly similar and mimic the fold of aSyn observed in one protofilament of fibrils isolated from patients with MSA11. Moreover, reinjection of crude mouse brain homogenates containing 1BP into new mice reproduces the same MSA-like pathology induced by the parent synthetic seed 1B. Our findings identify 1B as a synthetic pathogen capable of self-replication in vivo and reveal structural features of 1B and 1BP that may underlie MSA pathology, offering insights for therapeutic strategies.

 Microglia, the innate immune cells of the brain, play a defining role in the progression of Alzheimer’s disease (AD)1. The microglial response to amyloid plaques in AD can range from neuroprotective to neurotoxic2. Here we show that the protective function of microglia is governed by the transcription factor PU.1, which becomes downregulated following microglial contact with plaques. Lowering PU.1 expression in microglia reduces the severity of amyloid disease pathology in mice and is linked to the expression of immunoregulatory lymphoid receptor proteins, particularly CD28, a surface receptor that is critical for T cell activation3,4. Microglia-specific deficiency in CD28, which is expressed by a small subset of plaque-associated PU.1low microglia, promotes a broad inflammatory microglial state that is associated with increased amyloid plaque load. Our findings indicate that PU.1low CD28-expressing microglia may operate as suppressive microglia that mitigate the progression of AD by reducing the severity of neuroinflammation. This role of CD28 and potentially other lymphoid co-stimulatory and co-inhibitory receptor proteins in governing microglial responses in AD points to possible immunotherapy approaches for treating the disease by promoting protective microglial functions.

 Despite the central role of antibodies in modern medicine, no method currently exists to design novel, epitope-specific antibodies entirely in silico. Instead, antibody discovery currently relies on immunization, random library screening or the isolation of antibodies directly from patients1. Here we demonstrate that combining computational protein design using a fine-tuned RFdiffusion2 network with yeast display screening enables the de novo generation of antibody variable heavy chains (VHHs), single-chain variable fragments (scFvs) and full antibodies that bind to user-specified epitopes with atomic-level precision. We experimentally characterize VHH binders to four disease-relevant epitopes. Cryo-electron microscopy confirms the binding pose of designed VHHs targeting influenza haemagglutinin and Clostridium difficile toxin B (TcdB). A high-resolution structure of the influenza-targeting VHH confirms atomic accuracy of the designed complementarity-determining regions (CDRs). Although initial computational designs exhibit modest affinity (tens to hundreds of nanomolar Kd), affinity maturation using OrthoRep3 enables production of single-digit nanomolar binders that maintain the intended epitope selectivity. We further demonstrate the de novo design of scFvs to TcdB and a PHOX2B peptide–MHC complex by combining designed heavy-chain and light-chain CDRs. Cryo-electron microscopy confirms the binding pose for two distinct TcdB scFvs, with high-resolution data for one design verifying the atomically accurate design of the conformations of all six CDR loops. Our approach establishes a framework for the computational design, screening and characterization of fully de novo antibodies with atomic-level precision in both structure and epitope targeting.

 The human neocortex is composed of diverse cell types1 that are generated during development according to spatially and temporally organized programmes initiated by neural stem cells2–5. Despite the growing number of studies that have captured snapshots of gene expression of single cells along the axis of differentiation and maturation, the underlying map of lineage relationships that link individual progenitor cells to specific subtypes of neurons and glia remains unknown, especially in humans. Here we applied prospective lineage tracing to map the manifold of human neural stem and progenitor cell differentiation across the developmental window encompassing neurogenesis and gliogenesis in human primary tissue. By profiling the clonal output of 6,402 progenitor cells, we created a lineage-resolved map of human cortical development. Here we show that cortical progenitors switch from glutamatergic to GABAergic (involving γ-aminobutyric acid) neurogenesis around midgestation, which coincides with an onset of oligodendrocyte generation. Additionally, we find that truncated radial glia maintain a glutamatergic neurogenic potential for a protracted period during human cortical development. Unexpectedly, we find that late-born glutamatergic neurons derived from truncated radial glia exhibit molecular features of deep cortical layer neurons and may contribute to the expansion of the subplate region during midgestation.

 The mammalian cortex is composed of a highly diverse set of cell types and develops through a series of temporally regulated events1–3. Single-cell transcriptomics enables a systematic study of cell types across the entire timeline of cortical development. Here we present a comprehensive and high-resolution transcriptomic and epigenomic cell-type atlas of the developing mouse visual cortex. The atlas is built from a single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of 568,654 high-quality single-cell transcriptomes and a single-nucleus Multiome dataset of 200,061 high-quality nuclei, which were densely sampled across the embryonic and postnatal developmental stages (from embryonic day 11.5 to postnatal day 56). We computationally reconstructed a transcriptomic developmental trajectory map of all excitatory, inhibitory and non-neuronal cell types in the visual cortex. Branching points that mark the emergence of new cell types at specific developmental ages and molecular signatures of cellular diversification are identified. The trajectory map shows that neurogenesis, gliogenesis and early postmitotic maturation in the embryonic stage give rise to all cell classes and nearly all subclasses in a staggered parallel manner. Increasingly refined cell types emerge throughout the postnatal differentiation process, including the late emergence of many cell types during the eye-opening stage and the onset of critical period, suggesting that there is continuous cell-type diversification at different stages of cortical development. Throughout development, there are cooperative dynamic changes in gene expression and chromatin accessibility in specific cell types. We identify cell-type-specific and temporally resolved gene regulatory networks that link transcription factors and downstream target genes through accessible chromatin motifs. Collectively, our study provides a detailed dynamic molecular map directly associated with individual cell types and specific temporal events that can reveal the molecular logic underlying the complex and multifaceted cortical cell type and circuit development.

 As a member of the G protein-coupled receptor superfamily, the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) activates heterotrimeric G proteins by opening the Gα α-helical domain (AHD) to enable GDP–GTP exchange, with GDP release representing the rate-limiting step1,2. Here, using pharmacological assays, we show that agonist efficacy correlates with decreased GDP affinity, promoting GTP exchange, whereas antagonists increase GDP affinity, dampening activation. Further investigating this phenomenon, we provide 8 unique structural models and 16 cryogenic electron microscopy maps of MOR with naloxone or loperamide, capturing several intermediate conformations along the activation pathway. These include four GDP-bound states with previously undescribed receptor–G protein interfaces, AHD arrangements and transitions in the nucleotide-binding pocket required for GDP release. Naloxone stalls MOR in a ‘latent’ state, whereas loperamide promotes an ‘engaged’ state, which is structurally poised for opening of the AHD domain and subsequent GDP release. These findings, supported by molecular dynamics simulations, identify GDP-bound intermediates and AHD conformations as key determinants of nucleotide exchange rates, providing structural and mechanistic insights into G protein activation and ligand efficacy with broad implications for G protein-coupled receptor pharmacology.

 Mammalian brains vary in size, structure and function, but the extent to which evolutionarily novel cell types contribute to this variation remains unresolved1–4. Previous studies suggest that there is a primate-specific population of striatal inhibitory interneurons—the TAC3 interneurons5. However, broader taxonomic and developmental characterization is required to address novelty in cell-type evolution. Here we examine gene expression in inhibitory neurons across 10 mammalian species, spanning 160 million years of divergence from primates. We find that the initial class of newborn TAC3 interneurons specified during development represents an ancestral, medial ganglionic eminence (MGE)-derived striatal population that is also present in pig and ferret cortex. This discovery prompted a re-examination of Glires, including mice, which are thought to lack the TAC3 type5,6. Targeted enrichment of MGE precursors in mice revealed conservation of the TAC3 initial class, camouflaged by reduced expression of Tac2 (the mouse orthologue of TAC3) and a gain of Th expression. Extending our analysis to the adult striatum further supported the homology of primate TAC3 and mouse Th striatal interneurons, and also uncovered a rare Tac2 subpopulation in the mouse ventromedial striatum. This study suggests that initial classes of telencephalic inhibitory neurons are largely conserved, and that during evolution, neuronal types in the mammalian brain change through redistribution and fate refinement, rather than by derivation of novel precursors early in development. An analysis of cell-type diversity in brain samples from a variety of mammalian species, both during development and in adult animals, reveals that the TAC3 initial class of striatal interneurons is conserved across placental mammals and is homologous to Th striatal interneurons in rodents."

 Receptor signalling determines cellular responses and is crucial for defining specific biological outcomes. In legume root cells, highly similar and structurally conserved chitin and Nod factor receptor kinases activate immune or symbiotic pathways, respectively, when chitinous ligands are perceived1. Here we show that specific amino acid residues in the intracellular part of the Nod factor receptor NFR1 control signalling specificity and enable the distinction of immune and symbiotic responses. Functional investigation of CERK6, NFR1 and receptor variants thereof revealed a conserved motif that we term Symbiosis Determinant 1 in the juxtamembrane region of the kinase domain, which is key for symbiotic signalling. We show that two residues in Symbiosis Determinant 1 are indispensable hallmarks of NFR1-type receptors and are sufficient to convert Lotus CERK6 and barley RLK4 kinase outputs to enable symbiotic signalling in Lotus japonicus. An investigation of plant receptor-like kinases identifies regions of these proteins that control whether immune or symbiotic signalling pathways are activated, with minimal changes to specific residues in one of these regions being sufficient to alter signalling specificity."

 The central Southern Cone of South America was one of the last regions of the globe to become inhabited by people1, and remains under-represented in studies of ancient DNA. Here we report genome-wide data from 238 ancient individuals spanning ten millennia. The oldest, from the Pampas region and dating to 10,000 years before present (bp), had distinct genetic affinity to Middle Holocene Southern Cone individuals, showing that differentiation from the central Andes and central east Brazil had begun by this time. Individuals dating to 4,600–150 bp primarily descended from a previously unsampled deep lineage of which the earliest representative is an individual dating to around 8,500 bp. This central Argentina lineage co-existed with two other lineages during the Mid-Holocene and, within central Argentina, this ancestry persisted for thousands of years with little evidence of inter-regional migration. Central Argentina ancestry was involved in three distinct gene flows: it mixed into the Pampas by 3,300 bp and seemingly became the main component there after 800 bp, with central Andes ancestry in northwest Argentina, and with tropical and subtropical forest ancestry in the Gran Chaco. In northwest Argentina, there was an increased rate of close-kin unions by 1,000 bp, paralleling the pattern in the central Andes. In the Paraná River region, a 400 bp individual with a Guaraní archaeological association clusters with Brazilian groups, consistent with Guaraní presence by this time.

 Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death in women worldwide1. Here, in the Breast Cancer-Anti-Progestin Prevention Study 1 (BC-APPS1; 
              NCT02408770
              
            ), we assessed whether progesterone receptor antagonism with ulipristal acetate for 12 weeks reduces surrogate markers of breast cancer risk in 24 premenopausal women. We used multilayered OMICs and live-cell approaches as readouts for molecular features alongside clinical imaging and tissue micromechanics correlates. Ulipristal acetate reduced epithelial proliferation (Ki67) and the proportion, proliferation and colony formation capacity of luminal progenitor cells, the putative cell of origin of aggressive breast cancers2. MRI scans showed reduction in fibroglandular volume with treatment, whereas single-cell RNA sequencing, proteomics, histology and atomic force microscopy identified extracellular matrix remodelling with reduced collagen organization and tissue stiffness. Collagen VI was the most significantly downregulated protein after ulipristal acetate treatment, and we uncovered an unanticipated spatial association between collagen VI and SOX9high luminal progenitor cell localization, establishing a link between collagen organization and luminal progenitor activity. Culture of primary human breast epithelial cells in a stiff environment increased luminal progenitor activity, which was antagonized by anti-progestin therapy, strengthening this mechanistic link. This study offers a template for biologically informed early-phase therapeutic cancer prevention trials and demonstrates the potential for premenopausal breast cancer prevention with progesterone receptor antagonists through stromal remodelling and luminal progenitor suppression. Results of an early-phase breast cancer prevention trial demonstrate the potential for breast cancer prevention in premenopausal women with anti-progestin therapy by inducing epithelial–stromal remodelling and suppression of luminal progenitors."

 In human neuroimaging, brain atlases are essential for segmenting regions of interest (ROIs) and comparing subjects in a common coordinate frame. State-of-the-art atlases derived from histology1–3 provide exquisite three-dimensional cytoarchitectural maps but lack probabilistic labels throughout the whole brain: that is, the likelihood of each location belonging to a given ROI. Here we present NextBrain, a probabilistic histological atlas of the whole human brain. We developed artificial intelligence-enabled methods to align roughly 10,000 histological sections from five whole brain hemispheres into three-dimensional volumes and to produce delineations for 333 ROIs on these sections. We also created a companion Bayesian tool for automatic segmentation of these ROIs in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans. We showcase two applications of the atlas: segmentation of ultra-high-resolution ex vivo MRI and volumetric analysis of Alzheimer’s disease using in vivo MRI. We publicly release raw and aligned data, an online visualization tool, the atlas, the segmentation tool, and ground truth delineations for a high-resolution ex vivo hemisphere used in validation. By enabling researchers worldwide to automatically analyse brain MRIs at a higher level of granularity, NextBrain holds promise to increase the specificity of findings and accelerate our quest to understand the human brain in health and disease.

 The ability to spatially map multiple layers of omics information across developmental timepoints enables exploration of the mechanisms driving brain development1, differentiation, arealization and disease-related alterations. Here we used spatial tri-omic sequencing, including spatial ATAC–RNA–protein sequencing and spatial CUT&Tag–RNA–protein sequencing, alongside multiplexed immunofluorescence imaging (co-detection by indexinng (CODEX)) to map dynamic spatial remodelling during brain development and neuroinflammation. We generated a spatiotemporal tri-omic atlas of the mouse brain from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P21 and compared corresponding regions with the human developing brain. In the cortex, we identified temporal persistence and spatial spreading of chromatin accessibility for a subset of layer-defining transcription factors. In the corpus callosum, we observed dynamic chromatin priming of myelin genes across subregions and identified a role for layer-specific projection neurons in coordinating axonogenesis and myelination. In a lysolecithin neuroinflammation mouse model, we detected molecular programs shared with developmental processes. Microglia exhibited both conserved and distinct programs for inflammation and resolution, with transient activation observed not only at the lesion core but also at distal locations. Overall, this study reveals common and differential mechanisms underlying brain development and neuroinflammation, providing a rich resource for investigating brain development, function and disease.

 Lithospheric thin zones, such as recently failed rifts, are generally assumed to be weak spots where magmatism and deformation can concentrate during rifting and large igneous province development1–3. Yet, the Turkana Depression in East Africa, the site of the failed 66-million-year-old Anza Rift, did not experience the widespread flood magmatism seen on the adjacent Ethiopian Plateau, despite being a lithospheric thin spot when the region encountered hot plume material around 45 million years ago4. Here we jointly invert surface-wave and receiver function data to constrain crustal and upper-mantle seismic structure below the Depression to evaluate lithospheric thermo-mechanical modification. Evidence for thick lower crustal intrusions, ubiquitous below the uplifted Ethiopian Plateau5,6, is comparatively lacking below the Depression’s failed Anza Rift system, which ongoing East African rifting is circumnavigating, not exploiting. The mantle lithosphere below the Depression has also retained its cool, fast-wavespeed ‘lid’ character, contrasting the Ethiopian Plateau. Volatile depletion during failed Anza rifting probably rendered the thinned lithosphere refractory without later rejuvenation. Subsequent rifting and magmatism thus initiated away from the still-thin Anza Rift, in regions where fertile lithosphere enabled melting and the sufficient lowering of plate yield strength. Areas of thinned lithosphere are thus not necessarily persistent weak zones where significant extension and magmatic provinces will develop. Seismic data from the Turkana Depression in East Africa show that areas of thinned lithosphere are not necessarily persistent weak zones where extension and magmatic provinces will develop."

 Standard genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and rare variant burden tests are essential tools for identifying trait-relevant genes1. Although these methods are conceptually similar, by analysing association studies of 209 quantitative traits in the UK Biobank2–4, we show that they systematically prioritize different genes. This raises the question of how genes should ideally be prioritized. We propose two prioritization criteria: (1) trait importance — how much a gene quantitatively affects a trait; and (2) trait specificity — the importance of a gene for the trait under study relative to its importance across all traits. We find that GWAS prioritize genes near trait-specific variants, whereas burden tests prioritize trait-specific genes. Because non-coding variants can be context specific, GWAS can prioritize highly pleiotropic genes, whereas burden tests generally cannot. Both study designs are also affected by distinct trait-irrelevant factors, complicating their interpretation. Our results illustrate that burden tests and GWAS reveal different aspects of trait biology and suggest ways to improve their interpretation and usage.

 Materials improvement is a powerful approach to reducing loss and decoherence in superconducting qubits, because such improvements can be readily translated to large-scale processors. Recent work improved transmon coherence by using tantalum as a base layer and sapphire as a substrate1. The losses in these devices are dominated by two-level systems with comparable contributions from both the surface and bulk dielectrics2, indicating that both must be tackled to achieve substantial improvements in the state of the art. Here we show that replacing the substrate with high-resistivity silicon markedly decreases the bulk substrate loss, enabling 2D transmons with time-averaged quality factors (Qavg) of 9.7 × 106 across 45 qubits. For our best qubit, we achieve a Qavg of 1.5 × 107, reaching a maximum Q of 2.5 × 107, corresponding to a lifetime (T1) up to 1.68 ms. This low loss also allows us to observe decoherence effects related to the Josephson junction, and we use an improved, low-contamination junction deposition to achieve Hahn echo coherence times (T2E) exceeding T1. We achieve these materials improvements without any modifications to the qubit architecture, allowing us to readily incorporate standard quantum control gates. We demonstrate single-qubit gates with 99.994% fidelity. The tantalum-on-silicon platform comprises a simple material stack that can potentially be fabricated at the wafer scale and therefore can be readily translated to large-scale quantum processors.

 The telencephalon of the mammalian brain contains multiple regions and circuits that have adaptive and integrative roles in a variety of brain functions. GABAergic neurons in the telencephalon are diverse; they have many circuit functions, and dysfunction of these neurons has been implicated in various brain disorders1–3. Here we conducted a systematic and in-depth analysis of the transcriptomic and spatial organization of GABAergic neuronal types in all regions of the mouse telencephalon and their developmental origins. This was accomplished using 611,423 young adult single-cell transcriptomes and 614,569 single-cell transcriptomes collected from multiple prenatal and postnatal developmental timepoints. We present a hierarchically organized adult telencephalic GABAergic neuronal cell-type taxonomy of 7 classes, 52 subclasses, 284 supertypes and 1,051 clusters, as well as a corresponding developmental taxonomy of 1,688 clusters across ages from embryonic day 7 to postnatal day 14. Detailed charting efforts reveal extraordinary complexity whereby relationships among cell types reflect both spatial locations and developmental origins. Transcriptomically and developmentally related cell types are often found in distant and diverse brain regions, indicating that long-distance migration and dispersion is a common characteristic of nearly all classes of telencephalic GABAergic neurons. Moreover, we find various spatial dimensions of both discrete and continuous variation among related cell types that are correlated with gene expression gradients. Lastly, we find that cortical, striatal and some pallidal GABAergic neurons undergo extensive postnatal diversification, whereas septal, preoptic and most pallidal GABAergic neuronal types emerge in a burst during the embryonic stage with limited postnatal diversification. Overall, the telencephalic GABAergic cell-type taxonomy will serve as a foundational reference for molecular, structural and functional studies of cell types and circuits by the entire community. Long-distance migration and dispersion is a common characteristic of nearly all classes of telencephalic GABAergic neurons, which diversify extensively after birth in the cortex and striatum, but show limited postnatal changes in the septum, preoptic area and pallidum."

 Ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) achieve rapid remission in treatment-resistant depression. However, their mechanisms of action—the understanding of which is essential for refining therapeutic precision—remain unclear1–3. Here, using mouse models, we identify adenosine signalling as a central pathway that underlies the antidepressant effects of these interventions. Results from genetically encoded adenosine sensor experiments and real-time optical recordings reveal that both therapies induce strong adenosine surges in key mood-regulatory regions, including the medial prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Genetic or pharmacological disruption of A1 and A2A adenosine receptors abolishes their therapeutic effects, which establishes the essential role of adenosine signalling in antidepressant efficacy. Notably, adenosine signalling specifically in the medial prefrontal cortex drives antidepressant actions. Ketamine increases adenosine by modulating cellular metabolism to increase intracellular adenosine levels without causing neuronal hyperactivity. Leveraging this mechanism, we develop ketamine derivatives that enhance adenosine signalling and exhibit improved antidepressant efficacy with reduced side effects at therapeutic doses. Furthermore, acute intermittent hypoxia, a non-pharmacological intervention involving controlled reductions in oxygen levels, increases brain adenosine levels and produces antidepressant effects, paralleling the actions of ketamine and ECT. Our findings establish adenosine as a pivotal mediator of rapid-acting antidepressants and a tractable target for scalable, noninvasive therapeutics in major depressive disorder. Adenosine signalling is identified as the central mechanism of action of the antidepressant effects of ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy, and newly developed analogues of ketamine exhibit improved antidepressant efficacy with reduced side effects."

 The Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt first appeared in 2011 and quickly became the largest interconnected floating biome on Earth. In recent years, Sargassum stranding events have caused substantial ecological and socio-economic impacts in coastal communities. Sargassum requires both phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N) for growth, yet the primary sources of these nutrients fuelling the extensive Sargassum blooms remain unclear. Here we use coral-bound N isotopes to reconstruct N2 fixation, the ultimate source of the ocean’s bioavailable N, across the Caribbean over the past 120 years. Our data indicate that changes in N2 fixation were primarily controlled by multidecadal and interannual changes in equatorial Atlantic upwelling of ‘excess P’, that is, P in stoichiometric excess relative to fixed N. We show that the supply of excess P from equatorial upwelling and N from the N2 fixation response can account for the majority of Sargassum variability since 2011. Sargassum dynamics are best explained by their symbiosis with N2-fixing epiphytes, which render the macroalgae highly competitive during strong equatorial upwelling of excess P. Thus, the future of Sargassum in the tropical Atlantic will depend on how global warming affects equatorial Atlantic upwelling and the climatic modes that control it. High near-surface nitrogen-fixation rates that promoted the recent growth of the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt were tied to greater upwelling of phosphorus from the equatorial Atlantic, according to coral-bound nitrogen isotope records from the Caribbean."

Stolper,Isotopic evidence for elevated photorespiration during the last glacial period,"Low carbon dioxide levels during the last glacial period enhanced photorespiration in trees across North America, indicating a decline in land plant productivity, according to measurements of clumped isotopes in subfossil wood samples. 
 Low atmospheric carbon dioxide levels are thought to suppress land plant productivity in part by promoting photorespiration, wherein illuminated C3 plants uptake molecular oxygen and release carbon dioxide. This could act as a negative feedback that limits atmospheric carbon dioxide decline during glacial periods. However, colder glacial temperatures would suppress photorespiration, potentially counteracting this feedback. Here we tested the hypothesis that land plants photorespired more during glacial periods by applying a proxy for photorespiration rate based on clumped isotope compositions of wood methoxyl groups, validated in modern and recent trees, to North American subfossil tree specimens from the last glacial period. We find that, across most of ice-free North America, trees from the last glacial period photorespired more than more recent trees from similar locations and more than contemporary trees from higher latitudes. We reconcile these differences using a single model relationship between temperature, atmospheric carbon dioxide levels and photorespiration, which suggests that, during glacial periods, photorespiration increased primarily in warmer growing environments that cooled by about 6 °C or less. This supports the hypothesis of a negative feedback that regulates atmospheric carbon dioxide by increasing photorespiration and restricting land plant productivity during glacial periods.

 Compositional inhomogeneity in a material can result in low thermal conductivity, benefiting applications such as thermoelectric energy conversion, energy gas storage, and thermal barrier coating. However, current understanding remains limited to effective thermal conductivity models, which largely overlook detailed structural features of the material. Here, taking Bi0.4Sb1.6Te3 compound as a proof-of-concept material, we reveal that the true reason for low thermal conductivity determined by compositional inhomogeneity originates from randomly aligned edge dislocations. The random alignment of edge dislocations is consistent with the alignment of composition distribution. This is because these edge dislocations are primarily gathered at composition gradient domains between domains with different compositions, having preferential orientation along the composition gradient direction. This work offers a structural perspective on the mechanism underlying reduced thermal conductivity due to compositional inhomogeneity, providing valuable insights for designing materials with tailored thermal properties.

Here, the authors report the topological differences in 3D and 2D reconstructions of twin networks and reveal the biases embedded in surface views of 3D domain structures. 
 Assessing the fingerprint of a material’s microstructure is key for supporting materials design. With the emergence of a wide range of 3D characterization techniques, it is critical to understand the main differences in fingerprints reconstructed from 2D and 3D datasets. To this end, we introduce a graph-based microstructure reconstruction framework that enables structural comparisons of twin domain networks in high purity Ti using 3D and 2D electron backscatter diffraction. Insights into the structure of the twin networks are facilitated by combining statistical analysis of twin crystallography with visual and graphical analysis of the novel graph abstractions of the twins. We demonstrate that compared to 3D reconstructions, conventional 2D views of twinning miss key aspects of the microstructure including the high interconnectivity of domains into networks that span the full reconstruction volume. The reduced cross-grain and in-grain twin connectivity typically observed in 2D has notable implications on our understanding of how twinning mediates the plastic response of microstructures and how twin networks evolve. It is thus clear that 3D characterization is critical for accurately inferring both twin network morphologies as well as the key unit processes facilitating network formation.

Here the authors present high-resolution simulations that show that mesoscale horizontal stirring increases in the Arctic Ocean and around Antarctica, mainly due to sea ice reduction. 
 Mesoscale horizontal stirring (MHS) is ubiquitous in the oceans, influencing heat and carbon transport, phytoplankton blooms and fish larvae dispersal. The current generation of Earth system models lacks sufficient resolution to properly resolve MHS-relevant small-scale phenomena, such as oceanic mesoscale eddies, leaving it largely unknown how MHS will change in response to greenhouse warming. Here we determine how CO2 doubling and quadrupling will change the surface MHS statistics in Community Earth System Model simulations with 1/10-degree ocean resolution. MHS is analysed using the finite-size Lyapunov exponent, a Lagrangian diagnostic that measures the separation of close trajectories. Projected increases in MHS are expected in the Arctic Ocean and coastal Antarctic regions, driven by enhanced time-mean ocean flow and turbulence which predominantly result from sea ice reduction. The enhanced horizontal stirring in polar oceans implies substantial yet uncertain consequences for tracer transport, nutrient supply and ecosystems under higher CO2 conditions.

 Global inequalities in resource use leave billions below decent living standards (DLS)—a proposal of universal minimum service levels required to meet essential human needs. Although research has examined the energy use and greenhouse gas emission implications of achieving universal DLS, little is known about the necessary expansion of societies’ material stocks in buildings, infrastructure and machinery. Here we estimate that closing global DLS gaps would require an increase of approximately 12% in the existing material stocks of society, if efforts to expand these stocks are devoted exclusively to meet DLS. At current construction rates, this could be accomplished by 2030. However, if historical trends of unequal growth of material stocks driven by demands beyond DLS persist, the material stock requirements for DLS could increase tenfold, risking the achievement of sustainable development and climate change mitigation goals. To achieve DLS for all while limiting environmental pressures, it is essential to prioritize expansion of material stocks for closing DLS gaps and to critically asses stock expansion for demands beyond DLS—especially in affluent regions. Such a strategy could ensure universal DLS at more sustainable resource use levels.

This study reveals the interplay between SNF management strategies and their environmental impacts with a particular focus on iodine-129, a highly mobile, persistent and dominant risk contributor. 
 Nuclear energy has an important role in the low-carbon energy transition, but the safety of spent nuclear fuel (SNF) management remains a public concern. Here we investigate the interplay between waste management strategies and their environmental impacts with a particular focus on a highly mobile and persistent radionuclide, iodine-129 (I-129), which is the dominant risk contributor from SNF disposal and at existing groundwater contamination sites. The results show that the current recycling practice releases more than 90% of I-129 in SNF into the present-day biosphere using an isotropic dilution strategy, whereas the direct disposal of SNF in geological repositories is likely to delay and reduce the release by 8 orders of magnitude. In addition, our data synthesis of surface water concentrations near four nuclear facilities shows that the release-dilution strategy results in lower concentrations than regulatory standards, while insufficient waste isolation in the past has resulted in locally high concentrations within one site. Our analysis suggests that it is essential to consider effluents more explicitly as a part of the waste, that as society moves from dilution to isolation of waste, the potential risks of waste isolation to local regions should be carefully evaluated, and that excessive burdens of proof could hinder or discourage waste isolation. Comprehensive waste management strategies—considering not just volume but also mobility, isolation technologies and ultimate fates—are needed for persistent contaminants. This study offers valuable insights for optimizing the management of SNF and other persistent contaminants.

 The thermal response of permafrost to climate change is quantified by two key metrics: the surface offset (SO), the mean annual temperature difference between near-surface air and the ground surface, and the thermal offset (TO), the equivalent difference between the ground surface and the top of permafrost. However, a comprehensive global synthesis of their magnitude, variability, and controlling drivers remains elusive. Here, synthesizing data from 117 sites across the three poles, we reveal a fundamental, scale-dependent decoupling of their controls. We show that SO is primarily controlled by large-scale climate, with precipitation dictating the similar large magnitude of SO in the Arctic (3.1 ± 0.3 °C, cold-humid permafrost) and the Third Pole (3.2 ± 0.2 °C, warm-dry permafrost), but small in Antarctica (1.0 ± 0.2 °C, ultraxerous permafrost). In contrast, TO is predominantly determined by local-scale substrate properties, being markedly negative in the Arctic (−0.5 ± 0.2 °C), weakly negative in the Third Pole (−0.2 ± 0.1 °C), and negligible in Antarctica (−0.1 ± 0.1 °C). Critically, this substrate control can be overridden by regional climate, such as advective heat transport following rainfall. This synthesis establishes the first global benchmarks for permafrost thermal states and reveals a paradigm of divergent, multi-scale controls essential for improving models that predict the fate of Earth’s thawing cryosphere."

Ramachandran,Enhancing accuracy in identifying absorbing aerosol types and their radiative impacts,"Enhancing accuracy in identifying absorbing aerosol types and their radiative impacts 
 Aerosol radiative forcing is highly uncertain due to an imprecise quantification of absorbing aerosol type which is most critical. Lack of accurate measurements and characterization of aerosol absorption results in this aerosol parameter being poorly constrained and highly underestimated in climate models. In the methods used earlier to classify aerosol absorption a large fraction remained unidentified. A new classification method, that overcomes these limitations, is developed by leveraging the spectral characteristics of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and single scattering albedo (SSA) of different absorbing aerosols, which remarkably reduces the contribution of unidentified aerosol type to almost nil globally, demonstrating the robustness and enhanced accuracy of this new method. On a global scale, black carbon (BC) and the associated absorbing types dominate contributing >70% annually, Dust and Mixed-Dust contributing the rest. The absorbing aerosol types exhibit quite distinct spatial and seasonal variations. This improved and innovative classification of absorbing aerosol types offers significant potential for advancing research in climate modeling, satellite retrieval, and aerosol-monitoring applications, and will be key to reduce the uncertainty in radiative and climate impact of aerosols."

 The El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is characterized by a zonal (longitudinal) displacement of the background Walker circulation across the equatorial Pacific, or spatial shifting. The warm pool edge position (WPEP) commonly measures the intensity of this shifting. Hereby organizing sea surface temperature (SST) maps according to WPEP quantiles, we construct a synthetic, continuous sequence of patterns—termed the pattern continuum—that captures the SST evolution along the movement, namely the gradual transition from broad Central Pacific La Niña cooling to Central then Eastern Pacific El Niño warming. This pattern continuum can also be approximated by a “shifted-mean” framework, wherein a fixed spatial structure shifts zonally. The present diagnosis provides insight into key dynamical features of the ENSO, such as its spatial diversity, asymmetry, and nonlinearity, including the quadratic relationship between SST principal components. It may also be useful for practical model evaluation and intercomparison."

Insights from the 2019 Southern Hemisphere sudden stratospheric warming 
 This study isolates the role of the 2019 Southern Hemisphere (SH) sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) for surface climate in eight Stratospheric Nudging And Predictable Surface Impacts project (SNAPSI) models. The novel nudging experiments allow for a clearer disentanglement of the SSW’s impact on surface climate than the standard free-running forecasts, in which the entire atmospheric system evolves freely and deviates from observed reality. SNAPSI models capture the downward propagation of the negative Southern Annular Mode (SAM) from the stratosphere when the zonally symmetric stratospheric circulation is nudged toward the observations. In addition, zonally asymmetric stratospheric variations amplify warm anomalies and dry conditions over eastern Australia, enhancing the Australian local high-pressure system. The composite analysis reveals that the zonally asymmetric stratospheric variations driven by the westward-shifted vortex influence the eastern Australian precipitation forecast by strengthening the downward coupling of the SAM and enhancing the meridional ridge-trough structure over Australia. Westward-shifted vortex events are identified in over 60% more ensemble members in the nudged run than in the free run, associated with precipitation closer to observed values in the nudged run. The wildfire weather potential risk in Australia is assessed using the Fraction Attributable Risk (FAR) of the Hot Dry Windy (HDW) wildfire weather index. The positive FAR of the HDW wildfire weather index indicates that the nudged stratosphere contributes up to ~30% to the increased wildfire weather risk along eastern and southern Australia, highlighting the contribution of the 2019 SSW event to Australian extreme weather from mid-October to mid-November."

 Submarine landslides reshape seafloor geomorphology, transport sediment and carbon to the deep-sea, and can trigger tsunamis or damage valuable seabed infrastructure. Yet, submarine landslides have never been directly observed in action. Here, we present the most detailed measurements yet of an ongoing submarine landslide using high-frequency (1–10 Hz) ground motions captured by an ocean-bottom seismometer placed in the vicinity of the slide’s source region. We tracked a ~ 0.00423 km³ flank collapse in the Congo Canyon, and reveal its triggers and chronology of movement, thereby testing fundamental landslide models. A powerful turbidity current undercut the canyon wall, and landslide failure initiated at the base-of-slope. The landslide retrogressed 1.3 km upslope for 15 minutes in 1–2 min pulses, interspersed with brief downslope movement. Retrogression speeds ranged from 1.6 to 5.8 m/s, and downslope movement speeds from 0.8 to 3.3 m/s. Once the failure reached its upslope limit, the landslide transitioned into 1.5 hours of pulsed sediment transport, which fed a turbidity current along the canyon-axis. These observations show seismic monitoring can produce major advances in the understanding of submarine landslides. They challenge simple “toe-backward” and “head-forward” collapse models, revealing a hybrid, bottom-up retrogressive process that only released sediment after climbing far upslope.

 Beginning in the 13th century, Polynesian settlers on the island of Rapa Nui engaged in megalithic monument construction, crafting hundreds of ahu platforms and moai statues from volcanic bedrock. The decline of this tradition centuries later, coincident with land-use changes and the emergence of new ritual practices on the island, has intrigued archaeologists for decades. Here, we present evidence for a transition to persistent drought conditions on Rapa Nui beginning in the mid 16th century, based on two independent reconstructions of hydrogen isotopes in rainfall inferred from hydrogen isotopes of leaf waxes preserved in wetland sediments. Consistent with observational data and model simulations, we interpret more negative hydrogen isotopes in precipitation to reflect an increase in the frequency of large storms and total rainfall amount over Rapa Nui. We show that 16th–17th century changes in human geography on Rapa Nui coincided with a sustained, multi-century decrease in annual precipitation of ~600–800 mm, which is of greater magnitude than the drying observed in recent decades.

 Advances in Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology, along with point cloud modeling techniques like Quantitative Structure Models (QSM), have improved the accuracy of non-destructive above-ground tree biomass estimation. However, branch-level tree growth analysis using QSM time series remains underexplored due to challenges in data quality and methodology. This study investigates the boundary conditions in terms of data and species to facilitate robust QSM generation, which could enable branch-level growth analysis using multi-temporal LiDAR data and QSM. A multi-scan terrestrial laser scanning dataset and a dataset from a tower-based system were used to assess the impact of data acquisition setup and data quality on QSM reconstruction for birch (Betula pendula), pines (Pinus sylvestris), and spruces (Picea abies). The results show that reliable QSMs for detecting branch-level growth require a minimum spatial resolution of approximately 500 pts./m3 with a uniform point density, a maximum uniform 3D point distance of 2 cm, and gaps smaller than around 20 cm. Although smaller spherical noise clusters can be removed using denoising techniques, larger and denser noise clusters (e.g., > 9500 points within 1 m radius) are more likely to be misidentified as additional branches. Foliage removal methods risk modeling accuracy by inadvertently removing woody points. Regarding species, birches were more accurately modeled than pines and spruces. While QSMs are reproducible for single time points, comparing branches over time is challenging due to inconsistencies in modeled branching order and scanner positioning. Nonetheless, tree-level QSM metrics remain statistically consistent, revealing diverse growth strategies within and across species."

 Peatland restoration can halt biodiversity loss and organic soil degradation and mitigate climate change. Monitoring of restoration impacts requires novel approaches that can be scaled to large site networks. On a smaller scale, the restoration practitioners would likewise benefit from spatially and temporally comprehensive and objective monitoring data. This narrative review compiles potential remote sensing methods for practical monitoring of the ecohydrological processes in restoration of forestry-drained boreal peatlands to support and complement conventional ground monitoring approaches that are restricted by spatial coverage. Remote sensing provides tools for tracking the changes in soil surface moisture, water flow routes, vegetation cover and structure, topography, peat depth and greenhouse gas emissions. We emphasize that the suitable indicators of restoration success, platforms and sensors should be tailored to specific restoration cases with their own initial site conditions and restoration targets. The choice of spatial and temporal resolutions of data is defined by the scale and change rate of the restoration indicators. Data acquisition campaigns and selection of existing datasets require meticulous planning due to seasonal changes in hydrology and vegetation.

 Sentinel-1 is a unique resource for global flood monitoring, providing systematic, weather-independent Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery with unprecedented coverage. To overcome limitations of on-demand flood mapping services that depend on human operators to collect and interpret satellite images, a fundamentally new approach was adopted by the Global Flood Monitoring (GFM) service. This service, which was launched in 2021 as part of the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS), processes all Sentinel-1 land images acquired in VV polarisation fully automatically in near-real time. This article presents the first comprehensive analysis of GFM’s scientific achievements and challenges during its initial years of operation. To map floods reliably under diverse environmental conditions, GFM combines three complementary flood-mapping algorithms with reference water datasets to differentiate flooded areas from permanent and seasonal water bodies. The service also offers a novel flood-likelihood layer and contextual information to highlight areas where flood mapping is unreliable or not feasible. These data layers were derived from a global 20 m backscatter datacube containing approximately 379 billion land surface pixels. This datacube also made it possible to generate the first global Sentinel-1 flood archive (2015 to present). Our performance analysis shows that GFM typically delivers flood maps within five hours of image acquisition. However, a significant percentage of floods may go undetected due to coverage gaps. Initial evaluation results show that good accuracies are achieved for larger-scale floods and regions in the temperate and tropical zones, while accuracies are lower for smaller-scale floods and arid environments. The GFM service will continue to improve service quality by enhancing flood detection capabilities using improved algorithms and additional data, such as the VH channel from Sentinel-1 or L-band data from the upcoming ROSE-L mission."

 We present a discretized, multi-layer soil moisture model that links soil moisture variability to single-look SAR measurements. Our model reveals distinct closure phase signatures arising from variation of soil moisture, radar frequencies, and soil textures. Specifically, our model predicts that positive asymmetric soil moisture anomalies produce positive closure phase step-changes, and negative asymmetric anomalies yield negative closure phase step-changes, consistent with observed data. Additionally, our analysis reveals that low-frequency radar (e.g., L-band) exhibits heightened sensitivity to the vertical distribution of soil moisture. We identify an approximate transfer function between soil moisture anomalies and closure phase responses and introduce a scalable algorithm for retrieving the InSAR Soil Moisture Index, a relative soil moisture product. We demonstrate the retrieval algorithm in two diverse environments: the Mojave Desert and the Central Valley in California.

 Line Surge Arresters (LSAs) play a vital role in protecting power transmission systems from overvoltage, and obtaining their 3D information is crucial for precise reconstruction of power lines and intelligent planning of inspection routes. Current studies mainly rely on image-based methods for LSAs recognition. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle-mounted Light Detection and Ranging is an effective way to obtain 3D information of transmission corridors. However, accurately extracting LSAs from point clouds remains a significant challenge because of small physical size, sparse point distribution, and structural similarity to other components. In this study, an LSAs extraction method is proposed using the structural features. The method initially separates pylon and power line components using established techniques and further clusters the power line points into Single Power Line (SPL) as analysis unit, representing potential installation locations of the LSAs. For each SPL, this study proposes a structure-based method to identify the presence of LSAs. A width-based filtering criterion is applied to exclude SPLs without LSAs coarsely, retaining only those with potential LSA presence. For the retained SPLs, kernel density estimation is employed to capture the structural characteristics in case of LSA existence, thereby precisely preserving the SPLs containing LSAs. Following the identifying process, a Particle Swarm Optimization based segmentation method is proposed to achieve precise extraction of the LSAs. A structure-consistency-driven objective function is constructed using proposed Transmission Compactness Index and Axial Uniformity Index to model the geometric differences between LSAs and neighboring components. Based on this objective function, the optimal segmentation plane is searched to separate the LSAs from other components. The proposed method was evaluated on a dataset covering 63 transmission lines with a total of 3,571 pylons. Results demonstrate that the method achieves an overall identification accuracy of 98.28 %, with extraction precision of 92.66 %, recall of 87.43 %, and F1-score of 90.11 %. Additionally, our method shows high efficiency with the average processing time per pylon of 3.82 s. Compared to existing general segmentation algorithms, the proposed approach offers significant improvements in extraction accuracy. To foster further research, we release a point cloud dataset for LSAs extraction, which will be publicly available at: https://github.com/c175044/Line-Surge-Arresters-datasets."

 Mangroves are vital ecosystems that thrive in specific ecological niches, making it essential to identify areas of potential region for effective large-scale monitoring. However, existing methods for delineating potential mangrove regions are often either rigid or labor-intensive, frequently overlooking inland mangroves along tidal channels and lacking suitability for long-term analysis. Therefore, this study develops the self-supervised geospatially-aligned prototype learning (SGAPL) to automatically generate the potential mangrove regions based on scene-level labels. SGAPL integrates geo-grouped temporal inputs for deep feature extraction, geo-corrected prototype modeling with superpixel-aligned smoothing to enhance spatial completeness, and an adjacent-scene continuity strategy to improve the consistency of potential mangrove regions. We produced the scene-driven Australia mangrove maps (SAMM_14-23), which achieved an overall accuracy of 94.65 ±0.85%. The analysis based on the mangrove potential region generated by SGAPL revealed that more than 4000 ha of inland mangrove patches had been underestimated by traditional approaches. Analysis of SAMM_14-23 revealed two key patterns: (1) over 70% of mangrove changes occurred within a 50-meter buffer zone along patch boundaries, highlighting significant edge vulnerability; and (2) a clear inverse relationship between patch size and change rate, with patches larger than 4000 ha demonstrating high stability. SGAPL offers a novel framework for large-scale mangrove monitoring, addressing the long-standing gap in inland mangrove detection. The resulting SAMM_14-23 dataset provides comprehensive, up-to-date information to support targeted conservation efforts, particularly in edge protection and habitat connectivity, with direct relevance to multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)."

 Individuals make distinct walking choices based on the surrounding urban environment perceptions. Although a lot of work has been done in quantifying human perception of urban environment, existing research has not explored how the choices driven by perception can support walkability. This research aims to address this gap by proposing a framework that leverages 360-degree Google Street View Images (GSVIs), which serve as inputs to Deep Learning (DL) models. These models then extract informative features that contribute to the prediction of various perceptual attributes viz. beautiful, boring, safe, and lively collected through a primary survey. The attributes were integrated with road network at 100-meter intervals for the city of Mumbai, India. A multi-objective function is proposed to minimize the distance and maximize the perception to provide good routes. The DL models OCRNet and pretrained PPYOLOE + x achieved a high mIoU score of 72.13 %, and 51.4 %, respectively. Additionally, the state-of-art transformer-based model DINOv3 utilized for comparitive analysis and generalizability. The perception models also achieved a high accuracy of over 90%. Significant variations in routes were observed in diverse urban built-ups. The outcomes can support appropriate planning of urban spaces which can encourage walking, leading to reduction of carbon emissions."

 The light scattering properties of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were investigated in a megacity on the North China Plain during periods of substantial PM2.5 variation. The results revealed a non-linear reduction in the scattering efficient (σsp) relative to decreases in PM2.5 concentrations. Ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) was the primary contributor to σsp, accounting for 34.7 %–43.3 % at both high and low PM2.5 levels. However, primary organic aerosol (POA) became the largest contributor to σsp (31.5 %) at medium PM2.5 levels, with secondary organic aerosol (SOA) rising sharply by 13.9 %, collectively sustaining σsp and limiting its reduction. The scattering Ångström exponent (SAE) decreased from 2.1 ± 0.9 (high PM2.5 levels) by 31.1 %–50.5 % at medium and low levels, indicating a shift towards larger particle sizes as pollution levels declined. Strong negative correlations between SAE and the organic carbon/elemental carbon (OC/EC) ratio (r = −0.193, p < 0.01) at medium PM2.5 levels, as well as the mass scattering efficient (MSE) (r = −0.656, p < 0.01), testified the critical role of SOA formation in enhancing particle size and σsp under improved air quality conditions. Regression models based solely on aerosol components underestimated σsp, likely due to the exclusion of particle growth and SOA formation. Incorporating POA, SOA and SAE into σsp calculations significantly improved predictive accuracy by 7 %–21 %. These findings demonstrate that enhanced SOA formation and particle size growth increase MSE and effectively counteract reductions in σsp despite declining PM2.5 levels, thereby further hindering improvements in atmospheric visibility."

In this study, daily atmospheric particulate matter (PM10) sampling was carried out in classrooms of four primary schools in Luanda, Angola. Samples were analysed for elemental composition, organic and elemental carbon (OC and EC) and water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC). OP was measured using two acellular assays: dithiothreitol (DTT) and ascorbic acid (AA).

Notably, it achieves a probability of detection (POD) of 0.3, maintaining predictive skill where other models falter. For the probabilistic forecast, Res-UNet outperforms EC and QM at longer lead times, providing Brier Skill Score (BSS) and Continuous Ranked Probability Skill Score (CRPSS), with lower Brier Scores (BS), especially in Chongqing and Sichuan. During the extreme events of 2022, Res-UNet delivers high-confidence predictions of extreme high temperatures up to 3 weeks in advance.

 The impacts of urbanization, particularly through their complex interactions with synoptic-scale and orographic forcings, pose a great challenge to the accurate prediction of urban convective storms. On 28 July 2020, a convective storm occurs to the south of the Meiyu front, producing a localized and intense precipitation in the coastal megacity of Shanghai. To investigate urbanization impacts, particularly the urban heat island (UHI) effect, on such convective storm linked to Meiyu front and sea breeze circulation, comprehensive observational analysis and cloud-permitting (1 km) numerical simulations are conducted. Besides the favorable convective environments related to synoptic-scale forcings, a strong UHI surging to over 1.1 °C prior to precipitation is detected. It intensifies the “warm bubble” over Shanghai, sharpening its thermal contrasts with the Meiyu front's cold outflows and cool marine air, and increasing atmospheric instability. Subsequently, convergence over the eastern urban periphery is promoted to the west, forming an east-west oriented convergence line. A multicell line storm forms along it. As the convective system traverses the residual arid urban landscape, the UHI effect enhances the thermal contrast between its cold outflows and ambient environment, inducing the thermally driven convergence. This further facilitates the convective cell formation along the outflow boundary, resulting in the prolonged and intensified convective activity around the urban area. However, as the UHI is weakened, urban-induced moisture deficiency dominates, suppressing convection initiation over the urban area. It is implied that the pronounced UHI might promote convective activity in the vicinity of the urban center, even under the influence of synoptic-scale forcings."
