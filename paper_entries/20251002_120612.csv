10.1088/1748-9326/ae06b8,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要研究气候变暖背景下，连续高温事件对农业的影响。它探讨了早期高温对作物后期生长和产量的影响，并分析了在不同气候情景下，连续高温事件发生的可能性及其对作物产量的潜在影响。虽然该研究与气候变化有关，但它主要关注农业领域，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,[],Raed Hamed;Carmen B Steinmann;Qiyun Ma;Daniel Balanzategui;Ellie Broadman;Corey Lesk;Kai Kornhuber,Amplified agricultural impacts from more frequent and intense sequential heat events,"As the climate warms, interacting weather extremes such as sequential heat events pose complex risks to societies. Regarding global agriculture, laboratory experiments suggest that early crop exposure to heat may either confer tolerance or enhance vulnerability to subsequent heat during the critical crop flowering stage. We show that warm early-seasons improve crop yield potential, particularly for soybean and maize, but also increase the impacts of subsequent heat by 5%–55% compared to years with average early-season temperatures. The impacts of this increased yield sensitivity outweigh the benefits of early season heat when mid-season temperature anomalies exceed 0.7 C–5 C (depending on the crop). Analyzing projected temperatures under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 3-7.0, we find a tenfold increase in the likelihood of experiencing sequential heat in early and mid-season crop growth stages, defined as a joint 90th percentile event. Accounting for the interactive effects of early and mid-season warming increases projected temperature-related crop yield losses by 2%–44%, depending on crop and region. These results underline the emerging nonlinear risks from sequential heat extremes to food systems, which can largely be avoided when limiting warming to 1.5 C globally."

Highly time-resolved measurements of the submicron PM found residential heating with wood and oil and hydrocarbon-like organics from traffic, as well as sulfur-containing aerosol, to be the key pollution sources. Remarkable differences existed between complementary instruments, warranting the deployment of multiple tools at sites, with wide-ranging influences. 
 Fairbanks, Alaska, is a sub-Arctic city that frequently suffers from the non-attainment of national air quality standards in the wintertime due to the coincidence of weak atmospheric dispersion and increased local emissions. As part of the Alaskan Layered Pollution and Chemical Analysis (ALPACA) campaign, we deployed a Chemical Analysis of Aerosol Online (CHARON) inlet coupled with a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF MS) and an Aerodyne high-resolution aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) to measure organic aerosol (OA) and non-refractory submicron particulate matter (NR-PM1), respectively. We deployed a positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis for the source identification of NR-PM1. The AMS analysis identified three primary factors: biomass burning, hydrocarbon-like, and cooking factors, which together accounted for 28 %, 38 %, and 11 % of the total OA, respectively. Additionally, a combined organic and inorganic PMF analysis revealed two further factors: one enriched in nitrates and another rich in sulfates of organic and inorganic origin. The PTRCHARON factorization could identify four primary sources from residential heating: one from oil combustion and three from wood combustion, categorized as low temperature, softwood, and hardwood. Collectively, all residential heating factors accounted for 79 % of the total OA. Cooking and road transport were also recognized as primary contributors to the overall emission profile provided by PTRCHARON. All PMF analyses could apportion a single oxygenated secondary organic factor. These results demonstrate the complementarity of the two instruments and their ability to describe the complex chemical composition of PM1 and related sources. This work further demonstrates the capability of PTRCHARON to provide both qualitative and quantitative information, offering a comprehensive understanding of the OA sources. Such insights into the sources of submicron aerosols can ultimately assist environmental regulators and citizens in improving the air quality in Fairbanks and in rapidly urbanizing regional sub-Arctic areas."

Mitra;Miklós Szakáll,"Retention during freezing of raindrops – Part 1: Investigation of single and binary mixtures of nitric, formic, and acetic acids and 2-nitrophenol","We investigated the retention of chemical species and their binary mixtures during freezing of raindrops via acoustic levitation. Our results reveal high retention, with nearly all substances being fully retained during freezing. This could be attributed to a faster freezing time compared to a slower mass expulsion time, along with ice shell formation during freezing. This result helps improve our understanding of the interaction between ice microphysical processes and chemistry in deep convective clouds. 
 The influence of freezing processes and vertical transport of trace gases into the upper atmosphere during deep convection is critical to understanding the distribution of aerosol precursors and their climate effects. We conducted experimental studies inside a walk-in cold room for freely levitating raindrops (drop diameter: 2 mm) using an acoustic levitator apparatus. We investigated the effect of freezing raindrops on the retention of organic species for the first time with silver iodide as the ice-nucleating agent. Quantitative chemical analysis determined the retention coefficient, which is defined as the fraction of a chemical species remaining in the ice phase compared to their initial liquid-phase concentrations. We measured the retention coefficients of nitric acid, formic acid, acetic acid, and 2-nitrophenol as single components. Furthermore, we determined the retention coefficients of these substances as binary mixtures. Our results show the dominance of physical aspects such as drop size and ice shell formation over their chemical counterparts with regard to overall retention for the investigated large drops. Thus, for rain-sized drops, almost everything is fully retained during the freezing process, i.e., retention coefficients close to 1, even for species with low effective Henry's law constants (H*<10-4). An ice shell is formed within 4.8 ms around the drops just after the freezing is initiated. This ice shell formation was found to be the controlling factor for the overall retention of the investigated species, which inhibited any further expulsion of dissolved substances from the drop."
10.5194/acp-25-11829-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注北京城市气溶胶中水溶性有机化合物在冻结过程中的保留情况。通过声悬浮和液滴冻结实验，分析了PM2.5滤膜提取物在-15°C下的冻结过程，并使用超高分辨率质谱仪确定了450多种化合物的保留系数。研究发现，含氮和硫的化合物（特别是与NOx和SO2化学相关的二次有机气溶胶的硝基和硫酸盐成分）具有更高的保留率，这可能与它们的极性增加有关。虽然该研究涉及气溶胶成分分析，但它更侧重于微观层面的化学过程，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测或卫星观测。,"['aerosol composition', 'water-soluble organic compounds', 'freezing retention', 'urban aerosols', 'mass spectrometry']",Jackson Seymore;Martanda Gautam;Miklós Szakáll;Alexander Theis;Thorsten Hoffmann;Jialiang Ma;Lingli Zhou;Alexander L. Vogel,Retention during freezing of raindrops – Part 2: Investigation of ambient organics from Beijing urban aerosol samples,"We investigated the chemical retention of water-soluble organic compounds in Beijing aerosols using an acoustic levitator and drop-freezing experiments. Samples from PM2.5 filter extracts were frozen at -15 °C in an acoustic levitator without artificial nucleators and analyzed using ultra-high resolution mass spectrometry. Our findings reveal a non-normal distribution of retention coefficients that differs from current literature on cloud droplets. 
 The freezing of hydrometeors causes certain water-soluble organic compounds dissolved in the supercooled cloud droplets to be released into the gas phase. This may lead to the vertical redistribution of substances that become available for atmospheric processes in the upper troposphere, such as new particle formation or ozone formation. Drop-freezing experiments were performed on the Mainz acoustic levitator (M-AL) using aqueous extracts of ambient samples of Beijing urban aerosol. The retention coefficients of over 450 compounds were determined. Most nitro-aromatics and organosulfates were fully retained, along with the aliphatic amines (AAs) and higher-order amines and amides, while the observed sulfides, lipids, aromatic hydrocarbons, and long-chain compounds are among the most unretained and, incidentally, are the fewest species present. The findings here also indicate that N- and S-containing compounds, primarily nitro and sulfate components of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) anthropogenically related to NOx and SO2 chemistry, have enhanced retention, likely due to their increased polarity. An insignificant positive correlation between polarity and freezing retention, along with a significant negative correlation with vapor pressure and freezing retention, was observed. No sigmoidal relationship with the effective Henry's law constant was observed. This differs from the parameterizations of riming retention presented in the current literature, which is justified by the lower surface-to-volume ratio of the large drop size investigated. This study greatly expands upon the available experimental measurements of retention by investigating hundreds of compounds in complex chemical conditions that are more similar to the atmosphere than in previous literature studies."
10.5194/acp-25-11847-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究探讨了海盐气溶胶对中国东部光化学臭氧形成的影响。研究发现，海盐气溶胶通过化学反应和辐射效应，对臭氧的形成产生复杂的影响，且这种影响具有季节性和地域性差异。研究使用了WRF-CMAQ模型，模拟了海盐气溶胶在不同季节对中国东部地区臭氧形成的影响，发现海盐气溶胶中的氯颗粒与氮氧化物发生异相反应，影响了臭氧的生成。同时，海盐气溶胶的散射特性降低了光解速率，从而减少了臭氧的生成。这项研究强调了海盐气溶胶在塑造中国东部对流层光化学中的重要作用，这与大气环境遥感技术中的空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['ozone formation', 'sea spray aerosol', 'photochemical reactions', 'WRF-CMAQ model', 'NOx', 'VOC', 'photolysis rates', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'air quality monitoring']",Yingying Hong;Yuqi Zhu;Yuxuan Huang;Yiming Liu;Chuqi Xiong;Qi Fan,The impact of sea spray aerosol on photochemical ozone formation over eastern China: heterogeneous reaction of chlorine particles and radiative effect,"This study investigates the impact of sea spray aerosol on ozone formation across Eastern China, highlighting its complex influence through both chemical reactions and radiative effects, which vary seasonally and geographically. 
 Eastern China has suffered from severe photochemical O3 (ozone) pollution in recent years. In this coastal region, the atmospheric environment can be influenced by sea spray aerosols (SSAs) from marine emissions. However, the extent and mechanisms by which SSA affects O3 formation remain incompletely understood. Here, using the WRF-CMAQ model, this study investigates the comprehensive effect of SSA on radical chemistry and O3 formation in the lower troposphere across four seasons. SSA (over 50 % of which is particulate chlorine) can reach further inland through an atmospheric “bridge” aloft, interacting with the nitrogen-containing gases from continental anthropogenic emissions to reduce NOx levels and release Cl radicals. The NOx reduction increases O3 in volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited regions while decreasing it in NOx-limited zones. Elevated Cl radicals enhance VOC degradation and O3 formation during morning hours. Meanwhile, the scattering properties of SSA reduce daytime O3 formation by diminishing photolysis rates. Due to the contrasting effect of SSA via different mechanisms, the response of O3 varies seasonally and geographically. In winter, SSA increases O3 in eastern China due to the dominant effect of NOx reduction in VOC-limited regions. In spring and autumn, similar effects occur in the North China Plain, whereas southern China sees a decrease due to NOx reduction in the NOx-limited region and reduced photolysis rates. In summer, O3 increases are observed only around Bohai, with reductions elsewhere driven by NOx reductions in NOx-limited regions and decreased  photolysis. This study highlights the important, varying, but previously unreported role of SSAs in shaping tropospheric photochemistry over eastern China."

Sorenson;Jianglong Zhang;Jeffrey S. Reid;Peng Xian,An observational estimate of Arctic UV-absorbing aerosol direct radiative forcing on instantaneous and climatic scales,"Plumes of wildfire smoke in the Arctic affect the Arctic radiative budget. Using a neural network and observations from satellite-based sensors, we analyzed the direct radiative forcing of smoke particles on the Arctic climate and estimated long-term forcing trends. Strong negative trends in aerosol direct radiative forcing were found in northern Russia and Canada, with positive trends found over parts of the Arctic Ocean. Overall, smoke plumes may act to counter future Arctic warming. 
 Using co-located satellite observations from the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, the Aqua Cloud and the Earth Radiant Energy System, the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Sounder, and the Ozone Monitoring Instrument, we investigated changes in absorbing aerosol direct radiative forcing (ADRF) in the spring through fall Arctic from 2005–2020 through an observation-based method, assisted by a neural network for estimating aerosol-free sky top-of-atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes, and an innovative, Monte Carlo-based method for estimating uncertainties in derived ADRF values. This study suggests that Arctic ADRF is a strong function of observing conditions, and changes in Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) and cloud properties introduce a complex scenario for estimating ADRF. For example, the TOA ADRF reverses sign from negative (cooling) to positive (warming) for SIC above 60 % for a region with a relatively cloud-free scene. ADRF trends over Arctic land surfaces are primarily negative. Strong negative ADRF trends of up to −4 W m−2 were found over northern Russia and northern Canada in the summer months. Both positive and negative ADRF trends were found over the Arctic Ocean in the boreal summer, though these trends are much weaker than the over-land trends. Positive ADRF trends in the Arctic Ocean north of northeastern Russia and northern Canada are as high as +1.0 W m−2 per study period. The trend results suggest that increasing amounts of absorbing aerosols in the Arctic have a cooling effect from TOA that could act to counter Arctic warming."
10.5194/acp-25-11703-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注农业施肥对华北平原春季大气二氧化氮浓度脉冲的影响，以及由此带来的空气质量问题。研究表明，农业施肥产生的氮氧化物排放与人为源排放相当，显著影响区域空气质量，包括降低农田地区的夜间和白天臭氧浓度，并通过增强硝酸盐气溶胶的形成来增加PM2.5浓度。研究结果强调了控制农业氮氧化物排放对于改善农业国家和地区空气质量的重要性。虽然论文没有明确提及遥感技术，但其研究依赖于对大气二氧化氮柱浓度数据的分析，这些数据通常可以通过卫星观测等遥感手段获取，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['atmospheric nitrogen dioxide', 'air quality monitoring', 'agricultural fertilization', 'NOx emissions', 'PM2.5', 'O3', 'North China Plain']",Tian Feng;Guohui Li;Shuyu Zhao;Naifang Bei;Xin Long;Yuepeng Pan;Yu Song;Ruonan Wang;Xuexi Tie;Luisa T. Molina,Fertilization-driven pulses of atmospheric nitrogen dioxide complicate air pollution in early spring over the North China Plain,"The impacts of agricultural fertilization on nitrogen oxide and air quality are becoming more pronounced with continuous reductions in fossil fuel sources in China. We report that atmospheric nitrogen dioxide pulses driven by agricultural fertilization largely complicate air pollution in the North China Plain, highlighting the necessity of agricultural emission control. 
 Atmospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) has shown periodic conspicuous pulses in the tropospheric column in March over the North China Plain during the past two decades. However, these repetitive pulses have never been reported, and their underlying causes remain unclear. Here, we present robust evidence to demonstrate that agricultural fertilization drives the early spring NO2 column increase. The fertilization-driven soil NOx (= NO+NO2) emissions, comparable to anthropogenic sources, exert complicated influences on regional air quality. They significantly reduce nocturnal and diurnal O3 concentrations in agricultural areas in early spring, distinct from the scenarios in summer, but increase fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations via strongly enhancing nitrate aerosol formation. The impact also extends to urban areas, approximately half that of agricultural areas. These findings have increasing implications for coordinated control of PM2.5 and O3 under global warming. We thus suggest that reducing NOx emissions in croplands is essential to achieve better air quality in agricultural countries and regions."
10.5194/acp-25-11719-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文分析了16年的全球臭氧数据，评估其对空气质量和气候的影响。研究使用了卫星测量数据，观察到对流层臭氧在全球范围内减少，尤其是在热带和欧洲地区。下降趋势在2020年左右变得更加明显，部分原因是疫情期间排放的减少。该研究强调需要更好的数据处理和集成，以更准确地监测臭氧随时间的变化。论文重点关注使用红外大气探测干涉仪（IASI）获取的臭氧气候数据记录，并将其与来自交叉轨道红外探测器（CrIS）的TROPESS臭氧反演数据进行评估，验证了IASI数据的可靠性。研究结果表明，对流层臭氧在全球范围内呈下降趋势，特别是在热带地区。此外，论文还讨论了不同高度的臭氧变化趋势，以及疫情对臭氧浓度的影响。总而言之，该研究利用卫星遥感技术对对流层臭氧的变化进行了深入分析，为理解空气质量和气候变化提供了重要信息。,"['tropospheric ozone', 'satellite measurements', 'air quality monitoring', 'climate change', 'Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI)', 'ozone trends', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Anne Boynard;Catherine Wespes;Juliette Hadji-Lazaro;Selviga Sinnathamby;Daniel Hurtmans;Pierre-François Coheur;Marie Doutriaux-Boucher;Jacobus Onderwaater;Wolfgang Steinbrecht;Elyse A. Pennington;Kevin Bowman;Cathy Clerbaux,Assessment of 16-year tropospheric ozone trends from the IASI Climate Data Record,"This study analyzes 16 years of global ozone data to assess its impact on air quality and climate. Using satellite measurements, we observed a global decrease in tropospheric ozone, particularly in tropical and European regions. The drop became more noticeable around 2020, partly due to reduced emissions during the pandemic. The study highlights the need for better data processing and integration to more accurately monitor ozone changes over time. 
 Assessing tropospheric ozone (O3) variability is essential for understanding its impact on air quality, health, and climate change. The Infrared (IR) Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) mission onboard the Metop platforms has been providing global measurements of O3 concentrations since 2007. This study presents the first comprehensive analysis of the 16-year O3 Climate Data Record (CDR) from IASI/Metop (2008–2023), a homogeneous dataset offering valuable insights into the variability and long-term trends of tropospheric O3. The IASI-CDR ozone product is evaluated against TROPESS (TRopospheric Ozone and its Precursors from Earth System Sounding) O3 retrievals from the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS). The comparison shows excellent agreement for total ozone (biases <1.2 %, correlations >0.97) and good agreement for tropospheric ozone (biases 10 %–12 %, correlations 0.77–0.91). Comparisons with ozonesonde data indicate that IASI underestimates tropospheric ozone by 2 % in the tropics and by up to 10 % in mid and high latitudes. Drift analysis indicates the long-term temporal stability of IASI tropospheric ozone, with values below 3 % per decade globally and regionally, satisfying the stability criterion requirement. IASI data reveal a global decline in tropospheric O3 (−0.08 ± 0.05 DU yr−1, p=0.01), strongest in the tropics and Europe. The comparison with ozonesonde data, shows high-certainty decreases consistently observed in the tropics across all datasets (IASI, smoothed sonde, and raw sonde), supporting the robustness of the findings in this region. Vertical analysis reveals that negative trends dominate in the lower troposphere, while positive trends in the upper troposphere align with ultraviolet (UV) satellite observations. This vertical contrast highlights the importance of separating lower and upper tropospheric layers when comparing IR and UV datasets. Although discrepancies remain when considering the full tropospheric column, both UV and IR satellite instruments show a significant drop in tropospheric ozone starting in 2020, partly due to pandemic-related emission reductions. This study emphasizes the importance of long-term, consistent datasets for tracking ozone trends and the need for improved data retrieval and integration to address regional and temporal discrepancies."
10.5194/acp-25-11757-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文的标题和摘要主要关注海洋-大气之间的物理化学相互作用，特别是海面微层（SML）对空气质量和气候的影响。论文讨论了SML中的表面活性化合物如何影响气体交换和海盐气溶胶的产生，以及光化学反应如何影响挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）和二次有机气溶胶（SOA）的形成。这些过程直接关系到大气成分的分析和空气质量的监测，因此与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。虽然论文没有直接提及卫星观测或特定的遥感技术，但其研究结果对于理解和改进大气模型，以及利用遥感数据进行大气成分反演具有重要意义。,"['air quality', 'sea spray aerosols', 'volatile organic compounds', 'secondary organic aerosol', 'atmospheric composition', 'ocean-atmosphere interactions', 'gas exchange']",Yiqun Wang;Sasho Gligorovski,Atmospheric implications of ocean–atmosphere physicochemical interactions,"The sea surface microlayer (SML) is the ocean's ""skin"", exposed to solar radiation and atmospheric contact. It impacts air quality and climate through physical processes like gas transfer barriers and modulation of sea spray aerosol production. Chemically, it is a volatile organic compound source, driven by light irradiation and gaseous oxidant deposition. This review highlights advances in understanding the SML's role in ocean–atmosphere interactions and offers insights for future research. 
 The atmosphere is the fast component of the climate which determines the meteorology, i.e., everyday whether. The ocean, on the other hand, is the slow component which regulates the climate in the long term. Detailed knowledge of the interactions between these two components is crucial in order to understand  global climate phenomena.The ocean–atmosphere interface is the largest one on our planet, occupying about 70 % of the Earth's surface. Hence, the physicochemical processes occurring at the interface can largely affect the chemical content of the ocean waters and the composition of the atmosphere.Here, we briefly discuss the chemical composition of the sea surface microlayer (SML), emphasizing the role of surface-active compounds concentrated in the SML that influence gas exchange and modulate the production of the largest natural primary aerosols (i.e., sea spray aerosols, SSAs) across the ocean–atmosphere interface. We summarize recent research focused on multiphase and heterogeneous chemical processes, including photochemical reactions within the SML, and their impact on the formation of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), as well as subsequent effects on secondary organic aerosol (SOA) production.Comprehensive understanding of the ocean–atmosphere physicochemical interactions is of paramount importance in order to properly address air quality and climate issues."

Therefore, this study delves into the world of satellite remote sensing (ASCAT) and numerical models (ERA5), exploring their capabilities and limitations in characterising offshore winds. This investigation evaluates these two datasets against measurements from a floating ship-based lidar, collected during a novel measurement campaign in the Baltic Sea. 
 The accurate characterisation of offshore wind resources is crucial for the efficient planning and design of wind energy projects. However, the scarcity of in situ observations in marine environments requires the exploration of alternative and reliable data sources. In response to this challenge, this study presents a comprehensive comparison between wind profiles derived from the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) satellite observations and the ECMWF Reanalysis fifth-generation (ERA5) dataset against ship-based lidar measurements in the northern Baltic Sea. The aim is to investigate the applicability of ship-based lidar measurements for validating these datasets and to better understand the reliability, accuracy, and limitations of ASCAT- and ERA5-derived wind statistics for offshore wind characterisation at wind turbine operating heights. To extrapolate ASCAT observations from sea level to turbine rotating heights, a mean correction of atmospheric stability effects based on ERA5 and a probabilistic adaptation of the Monin–Obukhov similarity theory were implemented. The comparison between the two gridded datasets, extrapolated ASCAT and ERA5, reveals an overall good agreement in average wind speeds at 100 m height, with ASCAT exhibiting overall mean wind speeds approximately 0.6 m s−1 higher than ERA5 across the entire study region. However, excluding regions within 40 km of the coastline reduces this bias to around 0.4 m s−1, highlighting the negative impact of coastal contamination in ASCAT measurements and the difficulties ERA5 faces in accurately capturing wind conditions in complex coastal areas due to its coarse resolution. The validation against the ship-based lidar measurements shows a comparable performance of both datasets, with bias below ±0.2 m s−1 at heights between 90–170 m, with an overestimation by ASCAT and underestimation by ERA5. Both datasets show deteriorating performance with height, which is particularly notable in ASCAT profiles, with rapidly increasing biases above 170 m, peaking at around 0.5 m s−1 at 270 m."

In this paper, we explore a new way to resolve excess mixing ratios in turbulent plumes, which allows aggregation of unbiased ensemble averages of air pollutant ratios that can be compared with emission models. The approach is tested in an urban environment and used to resolve emission patterns of nitrogen oxides and carbon dioxide. 
 In this study, we introduce the turbulent enhancement ratio (TER) as an experimental approach for characterizing local emission sources in complex urban environments, with a focus on the city of Innsbruck, Austria. The idea behind the approach is to take advantage of highly time-resolved trace gas observations that allow for identifying turbulent air motions, from which a turbulent enhancement ratio can be constructed. Spectral analysis helps in determining the most relevant temporal scales that need to be resolved for the TER at a location. We use a comprehensive measurement setup at the Innsbruck Atmospheric Observatory, utilizing advanced instruments to test the approach. Our dataset, spanning mid-2018 to early 2022, includes periods affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing us to assess the impact of reduced traffic and changes in domestic fuel use on NOx / CO2 emission ratios. We test the method by comparing it with direct eddy covariance flux measurements of these tracers. The results show a statistically significant linear relationship between TER and the flux ratio of NOx over CO2, with regression slopes ranging between 0.96 and 1.1. Weekday TER values are generally higher due to increased traffic, while weekend values are lower, reflecting reduced commuter activity. Seasonal analysis shows that winter TER is influenced significantly by domestic heating, while in summer, traffic is the predominant source of NOx and CO2 emissions within the measurement footprint. The diurnal cycle of TER also highlights the role of valley wind systems in modulating local emissions through changes in the footprint, with up-valley winds bringing higher traffic-related emissions to the site during the day. Our findings demonstrate that by resolving the most relevant turbulent timescales for a location, TER is a robust predictor for emission ratios in urban settings, offering insights into the dynamics of local emissions. The method's ability to capture turbulent fluctuations provides a more nuanced understanding of source contributions, particularly in environments with complex and mixed emission sources."

 As part of the Quality Assurance (QA) plan of the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observation System (IAGOS), IAGOS-CORE and IAGOS-CARIBIC UV-photometer instruments have been compared with the dual-beam UV- Ozone (O3) PhotoMeter (OPM) of the World Calibration Center of Ozone Sondes (WCCOS) at the Forschungszentrum Jülich in an environmental simulation chamber. The WCCOS is established since about 30 years ago as part of the WMO-GAW measurement quality program of the global ozonesonde network, in which the OPM instrument serves as the ozone reference standard. In the simulation chamber, pressure, temperature, and ozone concentration can be controlled at quasi-realistic flight conditions between the Earth surface (∼ 1000 hPa) and ∼ 35 km altitude (5 hPa). During the intercomparison, different ascent/descent and cruise altitude profiles of ozone, pressure and temperature have been simulated between the surface and ∼ 12.5 km altitude (200 hPa).In general, the two O3 instruments P1-O3 (IAGOS-CORE) and CAR-O3 (IAGOS-CARIBIC) showed good agreement with the OPM reference standard within 5 %–6 %. At a pressure of 400–500 hPa the agreement was even within 2 %. The observed differences are small but systematic and reproducible during this experiment. CAR-O3 showed a small, pressure-independent deviation of −2 ± 1.5 % compared to the OPM. P1-O3 revealed O3 deviation to the OPM which changes with pressure of about +2 % at 1000 hPa to −3 % at 400 hPa, which might be an artefact on the experimental set-up and subject for further investigations. This intercomparison is a first step of the long-term goal to make the global ozone sonde data (GAW-NDACC-SHADOZ-GRUAN) and IAGOS-O3 (CORE: P1-O3, CARIBIC: CAR-O3) data traceable to one common reference, the OPM instrument of WCCOS. Recommendations are made for further regular (every two to three years) intercomparison of the operational instruments to ensure external consistency in general and specifically towards the synergy of IAGOS-O3 and ozonesonde data. An important gap in such intercomparison studies is the lack of a reference ozone instrument operated at reduced pressures at any National Metrological Institute in the world. For observation networks measuring vertical ozone profiles, it is essential to close this gap to enable the traceability of ozone measurements from different platforms to one reference standard. This is crucial to harmonize long-term ozone records to detect any changes of ozone in the free atmosphere."

Reid;Peter F. Caffrey;Maria J. Chinita;David H. Richter,Lagrangian aerosol particle trajectories in a cloud-free marine atmospheric boundary layer: implications for sampling,"Sea spray affects air–sea interaction, cloud microphysics, and the radiative budget. However, meteorological processes at the wind-gust level complicate the physical interpretation of measured aerosol particle properties. We used meter-scale models to track the life history of thousands of particles under different conditions to show that investigators must account for key factors to link observations at aircraft level to sea-spray emissions at the ocean's surface. 
 Meteorological processes such as gust fronts, roll structures, internal boundary-layer development and smaller-scale turbulence complicate the physical interpretation of measured aerosol particle properties, fluxes, and transport in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL). To better decipher maritime aerosol measurements by aircraft, ships, and towers we describe an ensemble of particle trajectories using high-resolution large eddy simulations (LES) of surface-emitted aerosol particle within a Lagrangian framework. We identified two clusters of particle trajectory types from which we created probabilistic distributions of particle histories: (a) short-lived particles that do not exit the surface layer and are subsequently deposited back to the ocean; and (b) much older particles that are able to exit the surface layer into the mixed layer and subsequently oscillate up and down through convective roll structures. After emission in a neutral atmosphere, particles slowly disperse through the MABL requiring, on average, up to 100 min to mix to the ∼ 570 m deep mixed-layer inversion. However, for even slightly unstable conditions, particles are rapidly transported to the top of the MABL in roll structure updrafts, where they then more slowly diffuse downwards, with some similarities to a looping plume rise to the stable inversion followed by fumigation. Consequently, particles can exhibit a bimodal lifetime distribution that results in different particle ages by altitude. Further, based on wind speed and stability, the initial looping behavior following an emission event spans 15 to 30 min and may result in sampling “blind spots” up to 15 km downwind. Overall, our findings suggest that there should be a consideration of the representativeness of particle ages, even in what is often assumed to be a well-mixed MABL. This representativeness is related to how long particles have been suspended and whether they were sourced locally, which is critical for situations such as for measuring wind-generated emissions or ship track plumes. Further, the Lagrangian technique for treating the particle transport captures the inherently random motion of the MABL turbulence and does not exhibit artificial numerical diffusion. As such, it produces differences when compared to a traditional, column-based eddy-diffusivity approach used in mesoscale to global scale models. We used the LES to drive a one-dimensional (1D) column model to approximate single grid point physics. The results were starkly different near the surface, with the 1D column model missing the looping behavior and showing a slow upward dispersion. This difference in the 1D and LES frameworks is an excellent example of subgrid problems and may explain some of the differences between observations and global and mesoscale model simulations of marine particle vertical distribution and dry scavenging."

Accurately measuring their chemical composition and physical properties in real time is challenging due to their low mass and interference from larger particles. This study proposes a method for the continuous, automated measurement of their composition, tested in a pilot field study to explore their chemical characteristics, physical properties, and sources. 
 Ultrafine particles (diameter of less than 100 nm) are primary suspects for enhanced negative health effects on humans. Measuring the chemical composition and physical properties of ultrafine particles online, continuously, and accurately is particularly challenging because of their typically low mass concentration (PM0.1) and susceptibility to interference from larger particles. The few past PM0.1 chemical composition measurement studies have used cascade impactors and at least a daily temporal resolution. In this study, we perform, for the first time, high-temporal-resolution measurements of the composition and sources of PM0.1 using an aerodynamic aerosol classifier (AAC) to separate PM0.1 from larger particles, integrated with other instruments. These include a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS, for organics, sulfate, nitrate, ammonium, and chloride), a single-particle soot photometer (SP2-XR, for black carbon), and an Xact625i (for elements).Ambient PM0.1 composition measurements were conducted in a suburban area in Greece to test the system. The hourly PM0.1 levels varied from 0.4 to 1.5 µg m−3, with an average of 0.7 µg m−3. Most of the PM0.1 (45 %) was organic aerosol (OA). On average, sulfates contributed 14 %, ammonium contributed 7 %, nitrate contributed 3 %, and black carbon contributed 4 % to PM0.1. Calcium (Ca) showed a surprising high average contribution to PM0.1 (18 %). The rest of the detected elements were Fe, K, Zn, and Ti, contributing 7 % together. Source apportionment analysis showed that most of the PM0.1 OA during this summertime period was oxygenated OA (90 %), with 70 % being less oxidized and 20 % being more oxidized, while only 10 % was fresh hydrocarbon-like OA."

 Plastic-covered greenhouse (PCG) is widely used in agricultural production due to its temperature control, water conservation, and wind protection characteristics, significantly enhancing crop yields and economic benefits. However, its long-term and extensive use can lead to environmental issues, such as the accumulation of local toxic gases and the degradation of soil physicochemical properties. Therefore, obtaining a comprehensive distribution of PCGs is essential. To monitor PCGs on a large scale, this study developed a novel approach for producing the first global 10 m PCG dataset (Global-PCG-10) with high-quality. Firstly, the globe was divided into multiple 5° grids, and grids for classification were organized based on global cropland layer. Then, multi-temporal Sentinel-2 data and initial labels of PCGs were obtained through Google Earth Engine (GEE) to create a training set for deep learning. Next, initial labels were optimized with the active learning strategy combined with the deep learning model, APC-Net. Finally, the PCG classification results were predicted, spatially analyzed, and compared with publicly released land use and land cover (LULC) datasets.

It covers key pollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. It reveals emissions’ long-term spatiotemporal trends and driving factors, such as population migration and economic growth, offering efficient control strategies. This dataset is crucial for air pollution and health impact studies. 
 Cooking emissions are a significant source of PM2.5, posing considerable public health risks due to their high toxicity and proximity to densely populated areas. Despite their importance, there is currently a lack of an accurate, long-term, high-resolution national cooking emission inventory in China, primarily due to the challenges of obtaining high-quality activity-level data over extended periods at fine spatial scales. Here, we address these limitations by leveraging advanced machine learning techniques to predict activity levels and further estimate emissions.Specifically, we develop an ensemble model of machine learning algorithms – random forest (RF), eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), multilayer perceptron neural network (MLP), and deep neural networks (DNNs) – to accurately predict cooking activity levels across Chinese counties based on statistical indicators related to population, economy, and the catering industry. The ensemble machine learning model demonstrates exceptional generalization and transferability (R2= 0.892–0.989), outperforming traditional statistical models and individual machine learning models. Unlike previous inventories that rely on simplistic proxy data such as population for calculation and downscaling, our inventory precisely calculates county-level cooking emissions, providing more accurate emission estimates and spatial distributions. Furthermore, we incorporate critical but previously missing toxic pollutants, such as ultrafine particles (UFPs) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), into the national cooking emission inventory. Therefore, we develop China's first county-level cooking emission inventory, spanning 1990 to 2021, with high spatial resolution and wide pollutant coverage.According to our inventory, in 2021, China's total cooking emissions of organics in the full volatility range, PM2.5, UFPs, and PAHs are 997, 408 kt, 6.50 × 1025 particles, and 15.8 kt, respectively. From 1990 to 2021, emissions of these pollutants increased by over 65 %, and their spatiotemporal trends were affected to varying degrees by external factors, such as population migration, economic development, pollution control policies, and the pandemic in different periods. We further analyze the contribution patterns of key driving factors, such as urbanization rate, population, and pollution control, to emission changes. Notably, driver analysis reveals that existing control measures are insufficient to curb the rapid growth of emissions, necessitating enhanced controls. Regarding control strategies, our county-level inventory finds that 62.3 % of China's organic emissions are concentrated in 30 % of the counties, which are densely populated and occupy only 14.4 % of the national land area. Therefore, prioritizing control of these areas will be an efficient and targeted strategy. Our research provides crucial data and insights for understanding the impact of cooking emissions on air pollution and health, aiding in policy development.

However, many global ET datasets overlook soil moisture constraints, causing large uncertainties. In this study, we developed an improved model that better captures the influence of soil moisture on vegetation and soil evaporation. Our model significantly improves ET estimation accuracy and provides a new long-term global ET dataset to support water cycle and climate research. 
 Accurately quantifying the impact of soil water availability on evapotranspiration (ET) is crucial for improving ET retrieval accuracy. However, most global satellite-derived ET datasets do not explicitly incorporate soil moisture constraints, leading to significant uncertainties, particularly in water-limited regions. In this study, we propose an enhanced soil moisture constraint scheme that effectively captures soil moisture's influence on vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation using a quantile-based approach. Unlike previous methods, this scheme relies solely on soil moisture data, reducing uncertainties associated with heterogeneous soil hydraulic properties. We integrated this approach into the process-based land surface ET/heat fluxes algorithm (P-LSH, or P-LSHv1), developing an improved version, P-LSHv2. Using observations from 106 global flux towers, we calibrated biome- and climate-specific parameters and quantified moisture constraints across diverse climates and land cover types. P-LSHv2 achieves notable improvements in ET estimation, with a reduced Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.67 mm d−1 and an increased Pearson correlation coefficient (R) of 0.81, indicating strong agreement with flux tower observations. As a result of these improvements, P-LSHv2 outperforming its predecessor, P-LSHv1, particularly in arid regions. Comparative analyses show that P-LSHv2 surpasses the Penman-Monteith-Leuning model and the Global Land Evaporation Amsterdam Model in capturing soil moisture anomalies' effects on ET, enhancing global ET accuracy. Employing the P-LSHv2 algorithm, we have produced a long-term global daily ET dataset spanning 1982–2023, providing a valuable resource for research on terrestrial water and energy cycles and climate change.

It quantifies a relative distance between model output and reality, even though it is impossible to know the absolute distance from model predictions to reality. The relative ranking among models is based on concepts of model selection and multi-model averages previously developed for simple statistical models, but adapted here for ESMs. 
 Inferences in Earth system science rely to a large degree on the numerical output of multiple Earth System Models. It has been shown that for many variables of interest, the multi-model ensemble average often compares better with observations than the output from any one individual model. However, a simple arithmetic average does not reward or penalize models according to their ability to predict available observations, and for this reason, a weighted averaging approach would be preferred for those cases in which there is information on model performance. We propose an approach based on concepts from information theory with the aim to approximate the Kullback-Leibler distance between model output and unknown reality, and to assign weights to different models according to their relative likelihood of being the best-performing model in a given grid cell. This article presents the theory and describes the steps necessary for obtaining model weights in a general form, and presents an example for obtaining multi-model averages of carbon fluxes from models participating in the sixth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project CMIP6. Using this approach, we propose a multi-model ensemble of land-atmosphere carbon exchange that could be used for inferring long-term carbon balances with much reduced uncertainties in comparison to the multi-model arithmetic average."

It captures the overall pore structure in LQ rock images while recovering fine details from HQ Scanning Electron Microscope data. We validate its effectiveness by benchmarking against the watershed‐based segmentation method in terms of porosity, permeability, and pore size distribution.

An important source of uncertainty is due to a restricted averaging duration. Short averages do not sample the full range of variability, leading to errors in the resulting estimates. Here we assess the uncertainty of finite‐time averages by assuming that stochastic models give a reasonable description of fluctuations in the axial dipole. We derive an expression for the variance of the time average as a function of the averaging duration. Averages longer than 1 Myr are required to lower the standard deviation of the average to 10% of the natural variability. We apply our theory to known differences in the axial dipole between the Brunhes and Matuyama chrons.

High Qc−1 ${Q}_{c}^{-1}$ anomalies are observed near productive geothermal wells with high‐temperature gradients and in areas of hydrothermal activity. High scattering attenuation anomalies are spatially associated with faults and fractures that serve as pathways for fluid flow. These variations correlate well with production variations in boreholes across the geothermal field. Furthermore, a prominent high‐scattering (low‐absorption) anomaly is observed at a depth of approximately 0–3 km below sea level (bsl) beneath Aluto, which is interpreted as the signature of an intrusive igneous body.

We measured water level fluctuations at two microtidal marshes in Chesapeake Bay to evaluate how this assumption misrepresents hydrological stress and marsh vulnerability. Tidal attenuation reduced water level fluctuations from 60 cm at tidal creeks to 20–30 cm in deteriorating interior marsh and caused increasing hydrological sensitivity to elevation loss. Poor drainage of interior marsh zones led to consistently higher water levels and slower recession at low tide. Consequently, hydroperiod and soil saturation in interior marshes were underestimated by 10%–62%, while plant performance was overestimated by 10%–25%. These biases suggest that future models must incorporate spatially decreasing tidal range and increasing baseline water levels from marsh edge to interior to improve predictions of marsh resilience under SLR."

They are usually attributed to local production by dayside reconnection, wave‐particle interactions, or radial diffusion by ultra‐low frequency waves. However, under standard magnetospheric conditions, these mechanisms fail to explain the rapid appearance of the electron fluxes and acceleration from magnetosheath energies (tens of eV) to tens of keV. Using data from the THEMIS mission, we report an energetic electron enhancement forming on hour timescales. A test‐particle simulation shows it can result from rapid, non‐diffusive radial transport driven by asymmetric drift‐orbit bifurcation.

However, the impacts of precipitation regimes, that is, total precipitation (Ptotal) and precipitation frequency (Pfreq), on EOS remain unclear. Using satellite‐derived phenology data from 1982 to 2020, we examined the effects of precipitation regimes on EOS across the mid‐ to high‐latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. We found that both increased Ptotal and decreased Pfreq delayed EOS, with the effect of reduced Pfreq likely mediated through increased maximum temperature and elevated soil moisture resulting from higher precipitation intensity. We further developed a process‐based autumn phenology model that incorporated the effect of Pfreq, which significantly improved model performance.

 The art of kirigami allows programming a sheet to deform into a particular manner with a pattern of cuts, endowing it with exotic mechanical properties and behaviours1–17. Here we program discs to deform into stably falling parachutes as they deploy under fluid–structure interaction. Parachutes are expensive and delicate to manufacture, which limits their use for humanitarian airdrops or drone delivery. Laser cutting a closed-loop kirigami pattern18 in a disc induces porosity and flexibility into an easily fabricated parachute. By performing wind tunnel testing and numerical simulations using a custom flow-induced reconfiguration model19, we develop a design tool to realize kirigami-inspired parachutes. Guided by these results, we fabricate parachutes from the centimetre to the metre scale and test them in realistic conditions. We show that at low load-to-area ratios, kirigami-inspired parachutes exhibit a comparable terminal velocity to conventional ones. However, unlike conventional parachutes that require a gliding angle for vertical stability20 and fall at random far from a target, our kirigami-inspired parachutes always fall near the target, regardless of their initial release angle. These kinds of parachutes could limit material losses during airdropping as well as decrease manufacturing costs and complexity.

 The primary driver of type I diabetes is the autoimmune T cells that destroy insulin-producing β-cells within the islets of Langerhans in the pancreas1. Pancreatic islet macrophages have also been variably linked to disease onset and progression. As macrophage-mediated removal of dying cells through efferocytosis regulates tissue homeostasis and immune responses2, here we investigated how efferocytosis by intra-islet macrophages influences the immune environment of pancreatic islets. Using a series of complementary omics-based and functional approaches, we identify a subset of anti-inflammatory intra-islet efferocytic macrophages (e-Mac) within the pancreas of mice and humans. When limited β-cell apoptosis is induced in vivo in wild-type C57BL/6 mice and diabetic-prone NOD mice, islet macrophages adopt this e-Mac phenotype without an apparent increase in the total numbers of intra-islet macrophages. Such limited β-cell apoptosis and increase in e-Mac numbers led to long-term suppression of autoimmune diabetes in NOD mice. This e-Mac phenotype could also be recapitulated ex vivo by co-culturing macrophages with apoptotic β-cells. Mechanistically, the e-Mac-enriched populations imparted an anergic-like state on CD4+ T cells ex vivo and promoted accumulation of such anergic-like CD4+ T cells in vivo within the islets. Analysing macrophage–T cell interactions within pancreatic islets using NicheNet and targeted experimental validation, we identify the IGF-1–IGF1R axis as a contributor to the anergic-like T cell phenotype in the islets.

 A fundamental question in physiology is understanding how tissues adapt and alter their cellular composition in response to dietary cues1–8. The mammalian small intestine is maintained by rapidly renewing LGR5+ intestinal stem cells (ISCs) that respond to macronutrient changes such as fasting regimens and obesogenic diets, yet how specific amino acids control ISC function during homeostasis and injury remains unclear. Here we demonstrate that dietary cysteine, a semi-essential amino acid, enhances ISC-mediated intestinal regeneration following injury. Cysteine contributes to coenzyme A (CoA) biosynthesis in intestinal epithelial cells, which promotes expansion of intraepithelial CD8αβ+ T cells and their production of interleukin-22 (IL-22). This enhanced IL-22 signalling directly augments ISC reparative capacity after injury. The mechanistic involvement of the pathway in driving the effects of cysteine is demonstrated by several findings: CoA supplementation recapitulates cysteine effects, epithelial-specific loss of the cystine transporter SLC7A11 blocks the response, and mice with CD8αβ+ T cells lacking IL-22 or a depletion of CD8αβ+ T cells fail to show enhanced regeneration despite cysteine treatment. These findings highlight how coupled cysteine metabolism between ISCs and CD8+ T cells augments intestinal stemness, providing a dietary approach that exploits ISC and immune cell crosstalk for ameliorating intestinal damage.

 In Gram-negative bacteria, the outer membrane is the first line of defence against antimicrobial agents and immunological attacks1. A key part of outer membrane biogenesis is the insertion of outer membrane proteins by the β-barrel-assembly machinery (BAM)2–4. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structure of a BAM complex isolated from Flavobacterium johnsoniae, a member of the Bacteroidota, a phylum that includes key human commensals and major anaerobic pathogens. This BAM complex is extensively modified from the canonical Escherichia coli system and includes an extracellular canopy that overhangs the substrate folding site and a subunit that inserts into the BAM pore. The novel BamG and BamH subunits that are involved in forming the extracellular canopy are required for BAM function and are conserved across the Bacteroidota, suggesting that they form an essential extension to the canonical BAM core in this phylum. For BamH, isolation of a suppressor mutation enables the separation of its essential and non-essential functions. The need for a highly remodelled and enhanced BAM complex reflects the unusually complex membrane proteins found in the outer membrane of the Bacteroidota.

 Electronic spins of nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamond constitute a promising system for micro- and nanoscale magnetic sensing1–4, because of their operation under ambient conditions5, ease of placement in close proximity to sensing targets6 and biological compatibility7. At high densities, the electronic spins interact through dipolar coupling, which typically limits8 but can also potentially enhance9 sensing performance. Here we report the experimental demonstration of many-body signal amplification in a solid-state, room-temperature quantum sensor. Our approach uses time-reversed two-axis-twisting interactions, engineered through dynamical control of the quantization axis and Floquet engineering10 in a two-dimensional ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy centres. We observe that optimal amplification occurs when the backward evolution time equals twice the forward evolution time, in sharp contrast to the conventional Loschmidt echo11,12. These observations can be understood as resulting from an underlying time-reversed mirror symmetry of the microscopic dynamics, providing key insights into signal amplification and opportunities for practical entanglement-enhanced quantum sensing.

 Metabolism enables life to sustain dynamics and to repeatedly interact with the environment by storing and consuming chemical energy. A major challenge for artificial molecular machines is to find a universal energy source akin to ATP for biological organisms and electricity for electromechanical machines. More than 20 years ago, DNA was first used as fuel to drive nanomechanical devices1,2 and catalytic reactions3. However, each system requires distinct fuel sequences, preventing DNA alone from becoming a universal energy source. Despite extensive efforts4, we still lack an ATP-like or electricity-like power supply to sustain diverse molecular machines. Here we show that heat can restore enzyme-free DNA circuits from equilibrium to out-of-equilibrium states. During heating and cooling, nucleic acids with strong secondary structures reach kinetically trapped states5,6, providing energy for subsequent computation. We demonstrate that complex logic circuits and neural networks, involving more than 200 distinct molecular species, can respond to a temperature ramp and recharge within minutes, allowing at least 16 rounds of computation with varying sequential inputs. Our strategy enables diverse systems to be powered by the same energy source without problematic waste build-up, thereby ensuring consistent performance over time. This scalable approach supports the sustained operation of enzyme-free molecular circuits and opens opportunities for advanced autonomous behaviours, such as iterative computation and unsupervised learning in artificial chemical systems.

 The ‘silent pandemic’ caused by antimicrobial resistance requires innovative therapeutic approaches. Human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), which are among the most transformative and safe drugs in oncology1 and autoimmunity2, are rarely used for infectious diseases and not yet used for antimicrobial resistance3. Here we applied an antigen-agnostic strategy to isolate extremely potent human mAbs against Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 147 (ST147), a hypervirulent and pandrug-resistant lineage that is spreading globally. Isolated mAbs target the KL64 capsule and the O-antigen. However, although mAbs displayed bactericidal activity in the picomolar range in vitro, only the capsule-specific mAbs were protective against fulminant bloodstream infection by ST147 and two geographically and genetically distant carbapenem-resistant KL64-bearing K. pneumoniae. Protection observed in vivo correlated with in vitro bacterial uptake by macrophages and enchained bacterial growth. Our study thus describes a mAb that protects against pandrug-resistant K. pneumoniae and provides a strategy to isolate mAbs and identify mAbs that confer protection against bacteria with antimicrobial resistance.

 Although autism has historically been conceptualized as a condition that emerges in early childhood1,2, many autistic people are diagnosed later in life3–5. It is unknown whether earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Using longitudinal data from four independent birth cohorts, we demonstrate that two different socioemotional and behavioural trajectories are associated with age at diagnosis. In independent cohorts of autistic individuals, common genetic variants account for approximately 11% of the variance in age at autism diagnosis, similar to the contribution of individual sociodemographic and clinical factors, which typically explain less than 15% of this variance. We further demonstrate that the polygenic architecture of autism can be broken down into two modestly genetically correlated (rg = 0.38, s.e. = 0.07) autism polygenic factors. One of these factors is associated with earlier autism diagnosis and lower social and communication abilities in early childhood, but is only moderately genetically correlated with attention deficit–hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and mental-health conditions. Conversely, the second factor is associated with later autism diagnosis and increased socioemotional and behavioural difficulties in adolescence, and has moderate to high positive genetic correlations with ADHD and mental-health conditions. These findings indicate that earlier- and later-diagnosed autism have different developmental trajectories and genetic profiles. Our findings have important implications for how we conceptualize autism and provide a model to explain some of the diversity found in autism. A study of several longitudinal birth cohorts and cross-sectional cohorts finds only moderate overlap in genetic variants between autism that is diagnosed earlier and that diagnosed later, so they may represent aetiologically different conditions."

 Emergence of drug resistance is the main cause of therapeutic failure in patients with high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)1. To study drug resistance in patients, we developed CloneSeq-SV, which combines single-cell whole-genome sequencing2 with targeted deep sequencing of clone-specific genomic structural variants in time-series cell-free DNA. CloneSeq-SV exploits tumour clone-specific structural variants as highly sensitive endogenous cell-free DNA markers, enabling the relative abundance measurements and evolutionary analysis of co-existing clonal populations over the therapeutic time course. Here, using this approach, we studied 18 patients with HGSOC over a multi-year period from diagnosis to recurrence and showed that drug resistance typically arose from selective expansion of a single or small subset of clones present at diagnosis. Drug-resistant clones frequently showed interpretable and distinctive genomic features, including chromothripsis, whole-genome doubling, and high-level amplifications of oncogenes such as CCNE1, RAB25, MYC and NOTCH3. Phenotypic analysis of matched single-cell RNA sequencing data3 indicated pre-existing and clone-specific transcriptional states such as upregulation of epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition and VEGF pathways, linked to drug resistance. In one notable case, clone-specific ERBB2 amplification affected the efficacy of a secondary targeted therapy with a positive patient outcome. Together, our findings indicate that drug-resistant states in HGSOC pre-exist at diagnosis, leading to positive selection and reduced clonal complexity at relapse. We suggest these findings motivate investigation of evolution-informed adaptive treatment regimens to ablate drug resistance in future HGSOC studies.

 The application of biocatalysis in synthesis has the potential to offer streamlined routes towards target molecules1, tunable catalyst-controlled selectivity2, as well as processes with improved sustainability3. Despite these advantages, biocatalysis is often a high-risk strategy to implement, as identifying an enzyme capable of performing chemistry on a specific intermediate required for a synthesis can be a roadblock that requires extensive screening of enzymes and protein engineering to overcome4. Strategies for predicting which enzyme and small molecule are compatible have been hindered by the lack of well-studied biocatalytic reaction datasets5. The underexploration of connections between chemical and protein sequence space constrains navigation between these two landscapes. Here we report a two-phase effort relying on high-throughput experimentation to populate connections between productive substrate and enzyme pairs and the subsequent development of a tool, CATNIP, for predicting compatible α-ketoglutarate (α-KG)/Fe(ii)-dependent enzymes for a given substrate or, conversely, for ranking potential substrates for a given α-KG/Fe(ii)-dependent enzyme sequence. We anticipate that our approach can be readily expanded to further enzyme and transformation classes and will derisk the investigation and application of biocatalytic methods.

 Squamates (lizards and snakes) comprise almost 12,000 living species, with wide ecological diversity and a crown group that originated around 190 million years ago1,2. Conflict between morphology and molecular phylogenies indicates a complex pattern of anatomical transformations during early squamate evolution, which remains poorly understood owing to the scarcity of early fossil taxa1,3. Here we present Breugnathair elgolensis gen. et sp. nov., based on a new skeleton from the Middle Jurassic epoch (167 million years ago) of Scotland, which is among the oldest relatively complete fossil squamates. Breugnathair is placed in a new family, Parviraptoridae, an enigmatic group with potential importance for snake origins, that was previously known from very incomplete remains. It displays a mosaic of anatomical traits that is not present in living groups, with head and body proportions similar to varanids (monitor lizards) and snake-like features of the teeth and jaws, alongside primitive traits shared with early-diverging groups such as gekkotans. Phylogenetic analyses of multiple datasets return conflicting results, with parviraptorids either as early toxicoferans (and potentially stem snakes) or as stem squamates that convergently evolved snake-like dental and mandibular traits related to feeding. These findings indicate high levels of homoplasy and experimentation during the initial radiation of squamates and highlight the potential importance of convergent morphological transformations during deep evolutionary divergences.

 The doughnut-shaped framework of social and planetary boundaries (the ‘Doughnut’) provides a concise visual assessment of progress towards the goal of meeting the needs of all people within the means of the living planet1–3. Here we present a renewed Doughnut framework with a revised set of 35 indicators that monitor trends in social deprivation and ecological overshoot over the 2000–2022 period. Although global gross domestic product (GDP) has more than doubled, our median results show a modest achievement in reducing human deprivation that would have to accelerate fivefold to meet the needs of all people by 2030. Meanwhile, the increase in ecological overshoot would have to stop immediately and accelerate nearly two times faster towards planetary boundaries to safeguard Earth-system stability by 2050. Disaggregating these global findings shows that the richest 20% of nations, with 15% of the global population, contribute more than 40% of annual ecological overshoot, whereas the poorest 40% of countries, with 42% of the global population, experience more than 60% of the social shortfall.

 Stem cell-based human embryo models offer a unique opportunity for functional studies of the human-specific features of development. Here we genetically and epigenetically manipulate human blastoids, a 3D embryo model of the blastocyst1, to investigate the functional effect of HERVK LTR5Hs, a hominoid-specific endogenous retrovirus, on pre-implantation development. We uncover a pervasive cis-regulatory contribution of LTR5Hs elements to the hominoid-specific diversification of the epiblast transcriptome in blastoids. Many of the LTR5Hs genomic insertions in the human genome are unique to our own species. We show that at least one such human-specific LTR5Hs element is essential for the blastoid-forming potential via enhancing expression of the primate-specific ZNF729 gene, encoding a KRAB zinc-finger protein.

Morehouse,The Panoptes system uses decoy cyclic nucleotides to defend against phage,"The Panoptes antiphage system defends bacteria by detecting phage-encoded counter-defences that sequester cyclic nucleotide signals, triggering membrane disruption and highlighting a broader strategy of sensing immune evasion through second-messenger surveillance. 
 Bacteria combat phage infection using antiphage systems and many systems generate nucleotide-derived second messengers upon infection that activate effector proteins to mediate immunity1. Phages respond with counter-defences that deplete these second messengers, leading to an escalating arms race with the host. Here we outline an antiphage system we call Panoptes that indirectly detects phage infection when phage proteins antagonize the nucleotide-derived second-messenger pool. Panoptes is a two-gene operon, optSE, wherein OptS is predicted to synthesize a nucleotide-derived second messenger and OptE is predicted to bind that signal and drive effector-mediated defence. Crystal structures show that OptS is a minimal CRISPR polymerase (mCpol) domain, a version of the polymerase domain found in type III CRISPR systems (Cas10). OptS orthologues from two distinct Panoptes systems generated cyclic dinucleotide products, including 2′,3′-cyclic diadenosine monophosphate (2′,3′-c-di-AMP), which we showed were able to bind the soluble domain of the OptE transmembrane effector. Panoptes potently restricted phage replication, but phages that had loss-of-function mutations in anti-cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling system (CBASS) protein 2 (Acb2) escaped defence. These findings were unexpected because Acb2 is a nucleotide ‘sponge’ that antagonizes second-messenger signalling. Our data support the idea that cyclic nucleotide sequestration by Acb2 releases OptE toxicity, thereby initiating inner membrane disruption, leading to phage defence. These data demonstrate a sophisticated immune strategy that bacteria use to guard their second-messenger pool and turn immune evasion against the virus. The Panoptes antiphage system defends bacteria by detecting phage-encoded counter-defences that sequester cyclic nucleotide signals, triggering membrane disruption and highlighting a broader strategy of sensing immune evasion through second-messenger surveillance."

Doudna,A miniature CRISPR–Cas10 enzyme confers immunity by inhibitory signalling,"Panoptes, an anti-phage defence system against virus-mediated immune suppression, is revealed. 
 Microbial and viral co-evolution has created immunity mechanisms involving oligonucleotide signalling that share mechanistic features with human antiviral systems1. In these pathways, including cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signalling systems (CBASSs) and type III CRISPR systems in bacteria and cyclic GMP–AMP synthase–stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS–STING) in humans, oligonucleotide synthesis occurs upon detection of virus or foreign genetic material in the cell, triggering the antiviral response2–4. Here, in an unexpected inversion of this process, we show that the CRISPR-related enzyme mCpol synthesizes cyclic oligonucleotides constitutively as part of an active mechanism that represses a toxic effector. Cell-based experiments demonstrated that the absence or loss of mCpol-produced cyclic oligonucleotides triggers cell death, preventing the spread of viruses that attempt immune evasion by depleting host cyclic nucleotides. Structural and mechanistic investigation revealed mCpol to be a di-adenylate cyclase whose product, c-di-AMP, prevents toxic oligomerization of the effector protein 2TMβ. Analysis of cells by fluorescence microscopy showed that lack of mCpol allows 2TMβ-mediated cell death due to inner membrane collapse. These findings unveil a powerful defence strategy against virus-mediated immune suppression, expanding our understanding of the role of oligonucleotides in immunity. Panoptes, an anti-phage defence system against virus-mediated immune suppression, is revealed."

 Remote epitaxy, in which an epitaxial relation is established between a film and a substrate through remote interactions, enables the development of high-quality single crystalline epilayers and their transfer to and integration with other technologically crucial substates1,2. It is commonly believed that in remote epitaxy, the distance within which the remote interaction can play a leading part in the epitaxial process is less than 1 nm, as the atomically resolved fluctuating electric potential decays very rapidly to a negligible value after a few atomic distances3. Here we show that it is possible to achieve remote epitaxy when the epilayer–substrate distance is as large as 2–7 nm. We experimentally demonstrate long-distance remote epitaxy of CsPbBr3 film on an NaCl substrate, KCl film on a KCl substrate and ZnO microrods on GaN, and show that a dislocation in the GaN substrate exists immediately below every remotely epitaxial ZnO microrod. These findings indicate that remote epitaxy could be designed and engineered by means of harnessing defect-mediated long-distance remote interactions.

 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons. Neuroinflammation is apparent in affected tissues, including increased T cell infiltration and activation of microglia, particularly in the spinal cord1,2. Autoimmune responses are thought to have a key role in ALS pathology, and it is hypothesized that T cells contribute to the rapid loss of neurons during disease progression3,4. However, until now there has been no reported target for such an autoimmune response. Here we show that ALS is associated with recognition of the C9orf72 antigen, and we map the specific epitopes that are recognized. We show that these responses are mediated by CD4+ T cells that preferentially release IL-5 and IL-10, and that IL-10-mediated T cell responses are significantly greater in donors who have a longer predicted survival time. Our results reinforce the previous hypothesis that neuroinflammation has an important role in ALS disease progression, possibly because of a disrupted balance of inflammatory and counter-inflammatory T cell responses4. These findings highlight the potential of therapeutic strategies aimed at enhancing regulatory T cells5, and identify a key target for antigen-specific T cell responses that could enable precision therapeutics in ALS.

Yao,Spin squeezing in an ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamond,"An ensemble of spins from nitrogen–vacancy centres in diamonds is prepared in a spin-squeezed state. 
 Spin-squeezed states provide a seminal example of how the structure of quantum mechanical correlations can be controlled to produce metrologically useful entanglement1–7. These squeezed states have been demonstrated in a wide variety of quantum systems ranging from atoms in optical cavities to trapped ion crystals8–16. By contrast, despite their numerous advantages as practical sensors, spin ensembles in solid-state materials have yet to be controlled with sufficient precision to generate targeted entanglement such as spin squeezing. Here we report the experimental demonstration of spin squeezing in a solid-state spin system. Our experiments are performed on a strongly interacting ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy colour centres in diamond at room temperature, and squeezing (−0.50 ± 0.13 dB) below the noise of uncorrelated spins is generated by the native magnetic dipole–dipole interaction between nitrogen–vacancy centres. To generate and detect squeezing in a solid-state spin system, we overcome several challenges. First, we develop an approach, using interaction-enabled noise spectroscopy, to characterize the quantum projection noise in our system without directly resolving the spin probability distribution. Second, noting that the random positioning of spin defects severely limits the generation of spin squeezing, we implement a pair of strategies aimed at isolating the dynamics of a relatively ordered sub-ensemble of nitrogen–vacancy centres. Our results open the door to entanglement-enhanced metrology using macroscopic ensembles of optically active spins in solids.

 There is rising concern that several parts of the Earth system may abruptly transition to alternative stable states in response to anthropogenic climate and land-use change. Key candidates of such tipping elements include the Greenland Ice Sheet, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, the South American monsoon system and the Amazon rainforest. Owing to the complex dynamics and feedbacks between them via oceanic and atmospheric coupling, the levels of anthropogenic forcing at which transitions to alternative states can be expected remain uncertain. Here we demonstrate how such interactions can generate spurious signals and potentially mask genuine signs of destabilization. We further review and present observation-based evidence that the stability of these four tipping elements has declined in recent decades, suggesting that they have moved towards their critical thresholds, which may be crossed within the range of unmitigated anthropogenic warming. Our results call for better monitoring of these tipping elements and for increased efforts to stop greenhouse gas emissions and land-use change.

 The stark contrast between the Moon’s nearside and farside in topography, volcanic activity and crustal structure provides critical insights into lunar formation and evolution. However, the absence of farside samples has long limited the investigations into the mechanisms driving this hemispherical asymmetry. The Chinese Chang’e-6 mission recently returned the first rock samples from the lunar farside, offering a unique opportunity to probe its volcanic processes and thermal history. Here we investigate the petrology and geochemistry of the returned lunar basalt fragments. The farside Chang’e-6 basalts dated at 2.8 billion years ago (Ga) reveal that their mantle potential temperature is about 100 °C lower than those recorded by nearside basalts returned by the Apollo and Chang’e-5 missions. Geochemical modelling based on remote sensing data for the 2.8 Ga basalt unit at the Chang’e-6 landing site also yields a ~70 °C lower mantle potential temperature compared with a contemporaneous nearside basalt unit. Collectively, our findings demonstrate that the lunar farside mantle was relatively colder than the nearside mantle, consistent with the hemispherical differences in crustal thickness and heat-producing element distribution, and provide constraints on the thermal evolution of the Moon and the origin of its global asymmetry.

Here the authors show that hydrogen-bond adaptability allows spontaneous formation of twisted bilayer ice at magic angles in 2D confinement, establishing a new class of Moiré materials. 
 Twisted bilayer van der Waals materials have become a transformative framework for the design of quantum and electronic devices, yet their counterparts, the twisted bilayer non-van der Waals materials, remain largely unexplored. Here, we report the first molecular-dynamics simulation evidence of the spontaneous formation of twisted bilayer ice with moiré patterns. Unlike the twisted bilayer van der Waals materials which can be produced by manually twisting one monolayer relative to another, twisted-bilayer-ice formation hinges on the structural adaptability of hydrogen bonds to achieve thermodynamic stability. First-principles molecular-dynamics simulations confirm the thermal stability of the twisted bilayer ice with two different moiré patterns, one with commensurate twist angle of 21.8° and another 27.8°. A phase diagram illustrates the stability region of twisted bilayer ice, providing guidance for future experimental validation. This work not only expands the family of two-dimensional ices but also advances the notion of twisted bilayer hydrogen-bonding materials, thereby offering opportunities to investigate emergent properties and potential applications of twisted bilayer non-van der Waals materials.

Using a mouse model of epididymitis, here, the authors report on the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) under conditions of chronic inflammation, and show that TLSs sustain immune activation, contributing to anti-sperm autoantibody production and epididymal injury. 
 Gaps in knowledge about the epididymal mucosa contribute to the prevalent classification of male idiopathic infertility. Inflammatory triggers, such as infections and autoimmunity, can breach immune privilege, induce anti-sperm antibody (ASA) production, and impair fertility. However, the mechanisms governing ASA production are poorly characterized. Here, using a murine model of epididymitis induced by regulatory T cell (Treg) depletion, we show that the disruption of immunotolerance leads to chronic autoimmunity characterized by the presence of ASA, and distinct testicular and epididymal immune landscapes. These inflammatory features impair sperm function, contribute to epididymal damage, and drive subfertility. Treg depletion induces the formation of tertiary lymphoid structures (TLS) within the epididymis, as indicated by the presence of B and T cell clusters, fibroblasts, and high endothelial venules. Similar autoantibody responses were detected in the seminal plasma of infertile patients, suggesting conserved mechanisms. Thus, we provide an in-depth analysis of immune cell dynamics and TLS during epididymitis, offering insights for the development of precision-targeted therapies for fertility disorders, as well as the identification of new contraceptive strategies.

 Schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) are characterized by atypical brain maturation, including alterations in structural similarity between regions. Using structural MRI data from 195 healthy controls (HC) and 352 individuals with SSD, we construct individual Morphometric INverse Divergence (MIND) networks. Compared to HC, individuals with SSD mainly exhibit reduced structural similarity in the temporal, cingulate, and insular lobes, being more pronounced in individuals exhibiting a ‘poor’ clinical status (more impaired cognitive functioning and more severe symptomatology). These alterations are associated with cortical hierarchy and maturational events, locating MIND reductions in higher-order association areas that mature later. Finally, we map 46 neurobiological features onto MIND networks, revealing a high presence of neurotransmitters and astrocytes, along with decreased metabolism and microstructure, in regions with reduced similarity in SSD. These findings provide evidence on the complex interplay between structural similarity, maturational events, and the underlying neurobiology in determining clinical status of individuals with SSD.

Here, the authors show that disease-linked mutations remote from intramolecular OFF state interfaces can allosterically impair myosin autoinhibition 
 At the molecular level, clinical hypercontractility associated with many hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM)-causing mutations in β-cardiac myosin appears to be driven by their disruptive effect on the energy-conserving, folded-back ‘OFF’-state of myosin, which results in increased number of heads free to interact with actin and produce force. While many characterized mutations likely act by directly perturbing intramolecular interfaces stabilizing the OFF-state, others may function allosterically by altering conformational states of the myosin motor. We investigate two such allosteric HCM mutations, Y115H (Transducer) and E497D (Relay helix), which do not directly contact OFF-state interfaces. Biochemical analyses and high-resolution crystallography reveal that both mutations increase active myosin head availability likely by destabilizing the pre-powerstroke conformation required for OFF-state formation. We propose that destabilization of the folded-back state of myosin, either directly or allosterically, represents a common molecular mechanism underlying hypercontractility in HCM across a broader spectrum of pathogenic mutations than previously recognized.

 Intensive efforts have been made to enhance the weak piezoelectric coefficients of ferroelectric polymers for flexible and wearable devices. However, previous approaches are highly dependent on synthesis of desired composition and complex/hash processing conditions while the scalability remains rarely addressed limiting practical applicability. Here we report large piezoelectric coefficient d33 in scalable solution-processed ferroelectric poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) copolymers modified by C=C and C=O double bonds. We reveal that the introduction of C=C double bonds tune the energetic competition between ordered and disordered crystalline conformations. As a result, greatly enhanced d33 of −90.5 pC N-1 and dielectric constant of 22.7 are achieved, corresponding to about 3 times and 2 times as large as that of benchmark poly(vinylidene fluoride). We fabricate flexible and wearable sensors enabling detection of various signals such as pressure and sound with high sensitivity, which find promise in pressure mapping, health monitoring and acoustic sensing applications.

 Whether today’s heavy metal pollution constitutes an unprecedented threat to biodiversity remains unresolved. Although evidence of metal enrichment exists for several deep-time biotic crises, direct causal links to extinction are lacking. This review synthesizes the current understanding of the relationship between elevated environmental heavy metal concentrations and biological responses, including malformations and extinctions, across marine and terrestrial ecosystems. Drawing on analogies from modern environments, we assess the role of heavy metal toxicity in past mass extinction events. While some studies implicate heavy metals as primary extinction drivers, shown for instance by sporomorphs malformations, others interpret these signals as post-extinction artifacts linked to organic matter decomposition. Our analysis highlights the influence of normalization methods, particularly sulfur-based approaches, and emphasizes the role of metal bioavailability as a key factor influencing biological effects. Further research is needed to clarify the role of heavy metals in Earth’s biotic history and ongoing environmental risks.

 Subsurface structure investigation on Mars is crucial for understanding its geological evolution and past hydrological conditions. Elysium Planitia (EP), located near the hypothesized ancient ocean shorelines, could contain clues for past water activity and paleoclimate. Here we present better-constrained subsurface models beneath InSight extending to ~800 m depth, obtained from joint inversion of seismic and seismoacoustic coupling data, and use the well-resolved subsurface structure to explore the lithological profile through rock physics models. The derived subsurface lithology agrees well with local geological context and exhibits a shallow 60-m-thick low-rigidity layer consistent with hydrated sedimentary materials. Despite possible contributions of aeolian and volcanic deposits, we favor the interpretation that the low-rigidity layer originated from fluvial activity in EP during the Hesperian or Hesperian-to-Amazonian epoch, as supported by adjacent paleo-shoreline morphology observations. These results hint at a period of warmer paleoclimate at low latitudes, possibly during high-obliquity phases of Mars’ rotational axis.

 Ecological and geomorphic theory assume longitudinal connectivity; here, we test whether these concepts apply in naturally disconnected paraglacial stream networks with lakes and coarse glacial sediment. We determined downstream hydraulic geometry relationships (DHG) for channel width; riparian vegetation was inventoried across process domains (rapids, flats, lakes) over 10 km in two northern Swedish catchments—one above and one below the former highest coastline (FHC). Below the FHC, finer sediment from marine/deltaic deposition may allow more stream self-adjustment. DHG relationships were weak overall, with large local width variation, but slightly stronger in the FHC-below catchment, where a lake-effect was found, with wider channels downstream of lakes. Riparian vegetation species density did not substantially increase downstream as in connected stream networks, and vegetation similarity between reaches was weakly related to distance, suggesting disrupted dispersal.

 Earth’s only active carbonatite volcano Oldoinyo Lengai, Tanzania, is a peculiar endmember of volcanism in a young rift segment. Targeted by many petrological studies due to its effusive, cold carbonatite eruptions, its subsurface structure has only been recently explored using geophysical approaches. Here we use data from a short-term seismic deployment, to exploit coherent seismic signals in the frequency domain to detect, characterize and locate volcanic tremor. We show that narrow-band tremor is related to degassing and the ascent of carbonatite melt across the crust close to the Natron border fault, which was previously linked to the ascent of carbonatites. We further show how narrow-band and quasi-harmonic tremor partly alternate and interpret this as the interplay of deeper magmatic injections into a shallow reservoir which causes resonance. Our findings yield important implications on how physical properties, structures and dynamics of volcanic plumbing systems are linked to tremor signals.

 Climate conditions, in complex interrelations with other socioenvironmental, economic, political and cultural factors, significantly play a key role in shaping population density and movement. However, the impacts of climate change on global human migration remain poorly understood. This study assesses the sensitivity of international migration to climate change across 160 countries and regions, focusing on temperature-related climate indices. The results show that migration patterns are strongly influenced by a country’s baseline climate and economic conditions. Under global warming, countries in mid- to high-latitudes with lower baseline temperatures are projected to experience substantial increases in migration inflows, while low-latitude countries are likely to see rising migration outflows. This climate sensitivity is especially pronounced in higher Gross Domestic Product (GDP) countries, whereas lower-GDP countries show little dependence on baseline climate. A simple predictive model based on projected changes in climate and GDP suggests that populations in low-GDP, low-latitude countries will face worsening conditions and increasing migration pressure by the end of the 21st century. The results underscore the growing influence of economic factors on migration and call for urgent integration of climate justice into migration policy to support vulnerable populations in a warming world. Mid- to high-latitude developed countries are projected to experience increased migration inflows, and low-latitude countries with low development status are likely to see increasing migration outflows, based on climate indices, migration and socio-economic data, and a statistical approach."

 Catastrophic flooding has been noted to occur with greater frequency following deforestation, but limited observations have been available to test this connection over large spatial scales. Here we used the data of mega forest fires impacting a region of 25,000 km2 in Australia exhibiting rapid loss in forest canopy, where the runoff generation has been carefully observed with minimum anthropogenic influences for more than half a century. This provides a unique opportunity to assess the impact of the forest canopy loss on large-scale fluvial flooding. A state-controlled hypothesis test, with the climate and watershed states controlled to enhance robustness, shows a statistically significant increase in annual maximum flows resulting from the forest loss treatment. The reasoning for this natural experiment is that the forest loss impact on the interception potential of forest canopy, fallen leaves, and root-zone soils in wide region could have a recognizable impact on the fluvial flood.

 The terrestrial biosphere plays a critical role in mitigating climate change by absorbing anthropogenic CO2. However, accurately quantifying the net ecosystem exchange (NEE), which is a key indicator for monitoring carbon sequestration of terrestrial ecosystems, remains a major challenge. Widely used products from large-scale ecosystem models and atmospheric inversions operate at coarse resolutions (0.25° or greater), which hinders the ability to resolve the carbon dynamics of heterogeneous landscapes and poses a significant challenge to understanding the impact of climate and land-use changes. In this study, a remote sensing data-driven water‑carbon coupling model with the incorporation of terrestrial carbon cycle processes, Penman–Monteith–Leuning Version 2 Carbon (PMLV2C), is developed for estimating daily NEE over China at a 500 m resolution. The parameters of PML-V2C model were well calibrated against observations from 41 eddy covariance (EC) flux tower sites across nine plant functional types (PFTs) over China, demonstrating a strong performance for daily NEE estimates (r = 0.71, RMSE = 1.85 g C m−2 day−1). The model is only slightly degraded when compared with independent global FLUXNET data across 157 sites, demonstrating its robustness and transferability across diverse climates and biomes. Applying the model from 2003 to 2020, our product revealed a significant enhancement of China's terrestrial carbon sink with an increasing trend of 0.041 Tg C yr−2 (p < 0.01). This enhancement was primarily driven by the increasing GPP from forests in Southern China, grasslands in Northern China, and croplands across the East and North China Plain. Our high-resolution, process-based NEE product driven by satellite data provides a new evaluation of the effectiveness of ecosystem restoration and land management policies, offering valuable insights for achieving national carbon neutrality goals."

 High-resolution remote sensing imagery is crucial for advancing earth science research. However, the scarcity of high-resolution data in specific non-visible spectral bands, such as short-wave infrared (SWIR) or thermal infrared (TIR), is challenge for various downstream tasks. To address this limitation, this study introduces a novel cross-band super-resolution (CBSR) method. This method improves the spatial resolution of targeted bands, specifically SWIR, within remote sensing images, and the methodology was tested with multi-band data from advanced spaceborne thermal emission and reflection radiometer (ASTER). The approach involves training a neural network on high-resolution visible and near-infrared single-band data, then the trained model is applied to generate high-resolution SWIR imagery. Validation was conducted over the Duolong Cu–Au porphyry district using ASTER imagery, focusing on mapping hydrothermal alteration. Through Bayesian optimization, the model achieved optimal performance with a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 43.17 dB, which is better than traditional methods. CBSR-reconstructed SWIR imagery, fused with principal component analysis, accurately delineated argillic alteration halos and ring structures. Furthermore, zero-shot transfer of the ASTER-trained model to Sentinel-2 imagery demonstrated the framework’s generalizability across sensor configurations. The proposed CBSR approach thus provides a robust, spectrally consistent mechanism for enhancing multi-resolution satellite data, with direct implications for mineral exploration, lithological mapping, and other domains reliant on high-fidelity SWIR information."

 This study investigates aerosol hygroscopicity by reconciling volume-based (κᵥ) and mass-based (κm) hygroscopicity parameters through a dual-system approach combining a Hygroscopic Tandem Differential Mobility Analyzer (H-TDMA) and a Hygroscopic Differential Mobility Analyzer–Aerosol Particle Mass Analyzer (H-DMA-APM). The integrated system enables simultaneous measurement of size and mass growth factors for pure and internally mixed sub-100 nm NaCl and (NH4)2SO4 particles under varying relative humidities (RH). Results show that κᵥ exhibits strong size dependence, declining by over 25 % as particle diameter decreases from 51.4 nm to 20.2 nm, attributed to curvature effects and morphology-induced artifacts. In contrast, κm shows a more stable trend across sizes, varying by less than 15 %, reflecting its robustness against morphological and curvature influences. However, κm did not consistently outperform κᵥ in predictive accuracy, likely due to the broader classification resolution of the APM system. While κm remains a theoretically superior parameter, κᵥ, when derived from high-resolution HTDMA systems, remains an effective predictor of hygroscopic growth. These findings highlight the importance of particle size, morphology, and instrumentation in characterizing aerosol hygroscopicity and advocate for the complementary use of κᵥ and κm in climate-relevant aerosol studies."

 Different aerosol types influence cloud properties in distinct ways due to their unique physical and chemical characteristics. While many studies have examined aerosol–cloud interactions, comparative analysis of how specific aerosol types affect warm clouds over land and ocean remain limited. Using MODIS cloud products and MERRA-2 aerosol data from 2014, this study reveals that warm clouds over the ocean exhibit greater sensitivity to increases in aerosol optical depth (AOD) compared to those over land. Specifically, with increasing total AOD, cloud fraction (CF) increases at a rate 3 times greater, while cloud top temperature (CTT) and cloud droplet effective radius (CER) decrease 2.5 and 6.5 times faster, respectively. Liquid water path (LWP) shows contrasting trends: over land, it initially increases and then decreases with rising AOD, whereas over the ocean, it shows a consistent negative correlation with AOD. Under fixed LWP, CF over land is more sensitive to AOD under low LWP conditions, while oceanic CF responds more strongly under high LWP. Under the influence of dust aerosols over land, cloud properties initially change significantly and then tend to stabilize. Over the ocean, particularly under high LWP conditions, cloud properties exhibit a stronger response to sea salt aerosols. Fine aerosols show similar effects to total aerosols in both land and ocean environments. These findings highlight the necessity of distinguishing different aerosol types, which contributes to a better understanding of the aerosol-cloud interactions."

 Understanding the variability of global land aerosol optical depth (AOD) and its teleconnection with sea surface temperature (SST) is essential for assessing aerosol–climate interactions. This study developed a high-resolution (0.05°), gap-free daily AOD dataset for 2000–2023 by integrating MAIAC AOD retrievals with meteorological, reanalysis, and geographical predictors using a CatBoost model. Validation against independent AERONET observations shows good agreement (R2 = 0.72, RMSE = 0.09), with significantly improved spatial completeness compared to reanalysis products. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis indicates that the leading mode exhibits predominantly positive loadings over most global land areas, with the strongest signals in Northern Hemisphere mid- and high latitudes. The associated temporal evolution shows a shift from above-average AOD in the early 2000s to below-average levels after the mid-2010s, consistent with widespread AOD declines reported since the early 2000s and most pronounced in high-loading regions. Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis between monthly land AOD and SST reveals that the leading coupled mode (36.28 % covariance) is characterized by persistent SST warming and a marked reduction in AOD over major emission regions since the early 2010s, while subsequent modes capture interannual signals related to El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) as well as decadal-scale patterns. These findings provide new evidence of large-scale SST–AOD covariability and offer a basis for exploring potential physical linkages, contributing to improved representation of aerosol–climate interactions in coupled models."
