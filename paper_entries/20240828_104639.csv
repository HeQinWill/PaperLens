10.1088/1748-9326/ad6a27,"National agroforestry program in Mexico faces trade-offs between reducing poverty, protecting biodiversity and targeting forest loss","National reforestation initiatives with ambitious targets and multiple objectives are becoming the norm across the Global South. The extent to which these large-scale initiatives are actually achieving their multiple and potentially conflicting objectives, however, is largely unknown. Sembrando Vida, a national initiative in Mexico implemented in 2019, pays smallholder farmers to plant agroforests in order to reduce poverty and forest loss, and protect biodiversity. We assessed to what degree program recruitment met its stated objectives via its selection of participating municipalities and households. Because program data are not publicly available, we consolidated and harmonized >14 million policy payments (totaling ∼$4 billion USD) to smallholder farmers, thus creating the first spatiotemporal dataset of program outcomes. We found that ∼450k rural households in ∼1000 municipalities across the country participated in the program consistently from 2019 to 2022. The program was reasonably well targeted to achieve its poverty reduction objectives. Significantly more households (ANOVA, p < 0.001) were enrolled in high-poverty (10.4%) than low-poverty (4.9%) municipalities, despite more money being transferred in absolute terms to low-poverty municipalities. The program did not reach some regions that best fit its three goals. Using a zero-inflated negative binomial model, we showed that the distribution of participating households was more likely to address poverty (coefficient = 0.51, p < 0.001 at household level) and forest cover loss (0.1, p = 0.01) than to restore areas important for biodiversity (−0.08, p = 0.02). Finally, we conducted a spatial analysis showing that there is technically sufficient rural land (4.29 Mha) and households (491k) to maximize the potential of all policy objectives simultaneously, but this would require that the program operate in only 83 municipalities across 10 states. Our results highlight the challenges in reaching high poverty regions while meeting multiple other objectives when scaling up forest landscape restoration.",Pablo Gonzalez-Moctezuma;Jeanine M Rhemtulla,Environmental Research Letters,False,[],这篇论文主要研究了墨西哥的“Sembrando Vida”国家农业林业项目，该项目旨在通过向小农户支付费用以种植农业林来减少贫困、森林砍伐和保护生物多样性。研究分析了该项目在招募参与者时是否达到了其目标，并发现该项目在减少贫困方面做得比较好，但在保护生物多样性和减少森林砍伐方面做得相对较差。该研究没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6d81,Unequal economic consequences of coastal hazards: hurricane impacts on North Carolina,"The eastern North Carolina Coastal Area Management Act region is one of the most hurricane-prone areas of the United States. Hurricanes incur substantial damage and economic losses because structures located near the coast tend to be high value as well as particularly exposed. To bolster disaster mitigation and community resilience, it is crucial to understand how hurricane hazards drive social and economic impacts. We integrate detailed hazard simulations, property data, and labor compensation estimates to comprehensively analyze hurricanes’ economic impacts. This study investigates the spatial distribution of probabilistic hurricane hazards, and concomitant property losses and labor impacts, pinpointing particularly hard hit areas. Relationships between capital and labor losses, social vulnerability, and asset values reveal the latter as the primary determinant of overall economic consequences.",Dahui Liu;Junkan Li;Ian Sue Wing;Brian Blanton;Jamie Kruse;Linda Nozick;Meghan Millea,Environmental Research Letters,False,[],该研究主要关注飓风对北卡罗来纳州沿海地区的经济影响，分析了飓风风险、财产损失和劳动力影响的空间分布，并探讨了资产价值与经济损失之间的关系。研究中没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6ea5,Simulation of wetland distribution in the Yellow River Basin based on an improved Markov-FLUS model,"Wetlands, as a regulator of water cycle and balance, play a key role in preventing flood and drought disasters and protecting biodiversity. The Yellow River Basin is an important ecological barrier and economic zone in our country. By predicting the distribution of wetland landscape and evaluating its evolutionary characteristics, strategies for wetland conservation and utilization in the Yellow River Basin can be formulated. Future land use simulation model can not only simulate the change of multiple land use types, but also reflect the uncertainty of real land use change. In this study, the model was improved and used to predict future wetland changes in the Yellow River Basin. Using the wetland distribution data in 2000 as the initial data, and the wetland distribution data in 2015 as the validation data, setting the parameters according to the land use data of the Yellow River Basin from 1980 to 2000 and the wetland type transfer matrix, after verifying the applicability of the model, the spatial distribution pattern of wetlands in the Yellow River Basin in 2030 was simulated. This research shows that the cost matrix setting method based on the wetland transfer matrix can effectively avoid the errors caused by subjective judgment assignment. By 2030, the wetland distribution in the Yellow River Basin will remain stable, with marshes, paddy fields, and beaches as the main types, similar to 2015. Of all the regions in the Yellow River Basin, Zhengzhou had the highest rate of wetland loss, down 31.94%. On the contrary, Sanmenxia had the highest growth rate of 24.44%.",Hanwen Zhang;Heying Li;Jianchen Zhang;Jiayao Wang;Guangxia Wang;Yamin Shan;Haohua Zheng,Environmental Research Letters,False,[],该研究主要关注黄河流域湿地分布变化的模拟预测，使用改进的Markov-FLUS模型，并结合土地利用数据和湿地类型转移矩阵进行分析。研究重点在于湿地分布变化趋势，以及各区域湿地变化的具体情况，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。
10.1088/1748-9326/ad5e9b,Harnessing the potential: exploring development opportunities and charting strategic pathways for China’s enhanced engagement in international blue carbon cooperation,"In light of the urgent need to combat climate change and attain carbon neutrality, the development of blue carbon has emerged as a pivotal strategy for the global community. This approach offers significant potential for both mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change. As a result, international collaboration on blue carbon initiatives has become a focal point in the worldwide response to the climate crisis. China, blessed with extensive blue carbon resources, recognizes the development of these ecosystems as a critical component in its efforts to make a substantial contribution to the global endeavor to curb climate change and achieve sustainable environmental goals. This article offers a comprehensive analysis of China’s opportunities and challenges in international blue carbon collaboration. Despite its vast potential, China faces significant hurdles, including the degradation of blue carbon ecosystems, a delayed start in implementing blue carbon practices, and inconsistencies in the blue carbon standard system. To enhance its participation in global blue carbon initiatives, China should pursue several key strategies, including preserving and restoring its blue carbon ecosystems, strengthening domestic protection and application mechanisms, promoting the construction of an international blue carbon system, establishing a scientific cooperation platform to facilitate capacity building and technology transfer and advocating for an international blue carbon market trading mechanism. By prioritizing these key areas, China can simultaneously foster domestic blue carbon conservation and development while solidifying its role as a pivotal contributor to global climate change mitigation efforts.",Zhijun Zhang;Zhengkai Mao;Jinpeng Wang,Environmental Research Letters,False,[],本文主要探讨了中国在国际蓝碳合作中的发展机遇和战略路径。蓝碳是指海洋和沿海生态系统（如红树林、海草床和盐沼）储存的碳，是应对气候变化的重要手段。文章分析了中国蓝碳资源的潜力和面临的挑战，并提出了加强蓝碳保护和发展的策略，包括保护和恢复蓝碳生态系统、完善国内保护和应用机制、推动国际蓝碳体系建设等。文章并未涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。
10.1088/1748-9326/ad64ed,The status of algal decarbonization in Southeast Asian region: a review,"Due to their autotrophic nature, algae capture large quantities of CO2 from the atmosphere and convert it to chemical energy in the form of biomolecules and cell mass for various applications. Such bio-based CO2 capture plays an important role in global carbon neutrality, while making innovative and sustainable food and industrial products for human and animal use. This review broadly illustrates the total CO2 emissions of the Southeast Asian region, named as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), while estimating CO2 capture by regional commercial algae. Among all these nations, the top CO2 emitter in the ASEAN region is Indonesia (625 Mt yr−1) followed by Vietnam (311 Mt yr−1), Thailand (289 Mt yr−1), Malaysia (249 Mt yr−1), the Philippines (154 Mt yr−1), Singapore (52 Mt yr−1), Myanmar (49 Mt yr−1), Cambodia (16 Mt yr−1), Laos and Brunei (7 Mt yr−1). Indonesia is also ranked first in commercial algae production (9918 400 tons yr−1), followed by the Philippines (1500 326 tons yr−1) and Malaysia (188 110 tons yr−1). Similarly, the highest estimated algal CO2 capture is made by Indonesia (11 327 817 tons yr−1) followed by the Philippines (1705 871 tons yr−1) and Malaysia (214 279 tons yr−1), with other ASEAN countries having negligible algal CO2 capture due to either low algae production or a lack of data. The ASEAN region may play a pivotal role in the bio-capture of CO2 with the help of the phytoplanktonic aquaculture industry for value-added products. The rapid emergence of the algal industry in the ASEAN region was due to increased global demand for carrageenophyte seaweeds (98.63% of global), such as Eucheuma sp., from Indonesia and Kappaphycus alvarezii from Malaysia and the Philippines. Due to its tropical climate, high aquatic biodiversity, sufficient water and nutrient resources, and long coastlines, the ASEAN regional governments took prompt action and implemented policies for increased seaweed industry in the region. Conclusively, it is desirable to further strengthen the algal industry in these regional countries for useful products and efficient CO2 capture.",Zia Ur Rehman;Kantaphan Punnaanan;Kasidit Nootong;Pichaya In-na,Environmental Research Letters,False,[],这篇论文主要关注东南亚地区藻类生物量对二氧化碳的捕获能力，并分析了该地区藻类产业的发展现状。文章没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6b3a,Models and methods for transport demand and decarbonisation: a review,"Rising global greenhouse gas emissions from the transport sector pose a major challenge to meeting the targets of the Paris Agreement. This raises questions of how technology, infrastructure and societal trends and policies can influence transport demand and thus also emissions, energy demand and service levels. Here, we review the literature on factors relevant to shifting total transport activity and mode shares, categorised into exogenous drivers, socio-behavioural, infrastructural and technological aspects. For each factor, we summarise current approaches to modelling and measuring the impact of each factor on transport systems, resulting in a proposed taxonomy to classify transport demand modelling approaches. We then comment on the suitability and sufficiency of existing modelling approaches for representing scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement targets in models of the entire global energy system. Factors that affect transport demand are currently insufficiently represented in integrated assessment modelling approaches and thus emission reduction pathways. Improving the comprehension and representation of diverse factors that affect transport demand in global energy systems models, by incorporating features of complementary models with high resolution representations of transport, holds promise for generating well informed policy recommendations. Accordingly, policies could influence the development of the factors themselves and their potential role in mitigating climate change.",Hugh Thomas;Luis Gabriel Carmona Aparicio;Felix Creutzig;Takuya Hara;Ayami Hayashi;Camila Ludovique;Luis M Martinez;Paul Natsuo Kishimoto;Leila Niamir;Yamina Saheb;Mallory Trouvé,Environmental Research Letters,True,"['Greenhouse gas emissions', 'Transport sector', 'Satellite observations', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis']",这篇论文主要关注交通运输领域产生的温室气体排放问题，并探讨了如何通过技术、基础设施和社会趋势等因素来影响交通需求，从而减少排放、能源消耗并提升服务水平。论文回顾了相关文献，并对影响交通需求的因素进行了分类，包括外生驱动因素、社会行为因素、基础设施因素和技术因素。论文还提出了一个分类体系，用于对交通需求建模方法进行分类。最后，论文探讨了现有建模方法在模拟巴黎协定目标下全球能源系统模型中的适用性和充分性。因此，论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是与空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等领域相关。
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6cea,The transition to humid extreme cold events in winter during the past six decades over China,"Winter extreme cold events (ECEs) pose significant economic and health risks, particularly when cold is combined with humidity. Although global warming has led to a decline in overall ECE occurrences, the changes in humid ECEs remain uncertain. This study uses dry and wet-bulb temperatures to categorize dry and humid ECEs across China and analyzes the proportion of humid ECEs, and the underlying factors influencing this phenomenon. In contrast to the decreasing trend of winter relative humidity (RH), our findings show an increase in RH during ECEs. This observation suggests a shift toward more humid conditions during these events. Further analysis shows an increasing percentage of humid ECEs, especially in Xinjiang, where the occurrence of dry ECEs is decreasing. Classifying ECEs into temperature- or humidity-dominated types reveals a significant increase in humidity-dominated humid ECEs, which is driven mainly by specific humidity changes, not temperature changes. These findings highlight the urgent need for adaptation strategies for more humid ECEs in a warming climate.",Yongli He;Yangrui Peng;Zhanbo Wang;Shanshan Wang;Xiaodan Guan,Environmental Research Letters,False,[],这篇论文主要关注中国冬季极端寒冷事件（ECE）的演变趋势，特别是湿冷事件的增加。研究使用干球温度和湿球温度来区分干冷和湿冷事件，并分析了湿冷事件的比例及其影响因素。研究发现，尽管冬季相对湿度（RH）总体呈下降趋势，但在ECE期间的RH却有所上升，这表明ECE期间的湿度条件正在发生变化。研究还发现，湿冷事件的比例正在增加，特别是在新疆地区，干冷事件的发生率正在下降。论文将ECE分为温度主导型和湿度主导型，发现湿度主导型湿冷事件显著增加，主要受比湿变化驱动，而非温度变化。这些发现强调了在气候变暖背景下，需要制定适应策略以应对更加湿冷的ECE。
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6ceb,Multi-scale impacts of climate change on hydropower for long-term water-energy planning in the contiguous United States,"Climate change impacts on watersheds can potentially exacerbate water scarcity issues where water serves multiple purposes including hydropower. The long-term management of water and energy resources is still mostly approached in a siloed manner at different basins or watersheds, failing to consider the potential impacts that may concurrently affect many regions at once. There is a need for a large-scale hydropower modeling framework that can examine climate impacts across adjoining river basins and balancing authorities (BAs) and provide a periodic assessment at regional to national scales. Expanding from our prior assessment only for the United States (US) federal hydropower plants, we enhance and extend two regional hydropower models to cover over 85% of the total hydropower nameplate capacity and present the first contiguous US-wide assessment of future hydropower production under Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6’s high-end Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 5-8.5 emission scenario using an uncertainty-aware multi-model ensemble approach. We present regional hydropower projections, using both BA regions and US Hydrologic Subregions (HUC4s), to consistently inform the energy and water communities for two future periods—the near-term (2020–2039) and the mid-term (2040–2059) relative to a historical baseline period (1980–2019). We find that the median projected changes in annual hydropower generation are typically positive—approximately 5% in the near-term, and 10% in the mid-term. However, since the risk of regional droughts is also projected to increase, future planning cannot overly rely on the ensemble median, as the potential of severe hydropower reductions could be overlooked. The assessment offers an ensemble of future hydropower generation projections, providing regional utilities and power system operators with consistent data to develop drought scenarios, design long duration storage and evaluate energy infrastructure reliability under intensified inter-annual and seasonal variability.",Daniel Broman;Nathalie Voisin;Shih-Chieh Kao;Alisha Fernandez;Ganesh R Ghimire,Environmental Research Letters,False,[],这篇论文主要研究气候变化对美国大陆水力发电的影响，并探讨了未来水力发电的区域变化。研究使用了耦合模型比较计划第六阶段的高端共享社会经济路径5-8.5排放情景，并通过多模型集成方法进行评估。论文重点关注水资源和能源资源的长期管理，没有涉及到大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6cec,Socially vulnerable US Pacific Northwest communities are more likely to experience wildfires,"Quantitative wildfire risk assessments increasingly are used to prioritize areas for investments in wildfire risk mitigation actions. However, current assessments of wildfire risk derived from fire models built primarily on biophysical data do not account for socioeconomic contexts that influence community vulnerability to wildfire. Research indicates that despite accounting for only a small proportion of high wildfire hazard areas, communities with fewer socioeconomic resources to devote to wildfire prevention and response may experience outsized exposure and impacts. We examined the distribution of simulated wildfire risk versus observed wildfire experience relative to social vulnerability across communities in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Using three decades of wildfire occurrence data, we investigated whether socially vulnerable communities were more likely to experience ignitions, fires that escaped initial attack (hereafter ‘escaped fires’) (>121 hectares), and large fires (>404 hectares), reasoning that each may reveal key insights into the effectiveness of current wildfire risk mitigation and response efforts. We found that communities located in areas with higher wildfire risk or hazard tended to have lower social vulnerability, but that across landscapes east of the Cascade Range, communities with higher social vulnerability were more likely to be exposed to ignitions, escaped fires, and large fires. Our results draw into question whether the current reliance on biophysical data in wildfire risk assessments, absent consideration of community socioeconomic conditions, may perpetuate social inequities by leading to over-investment in well-resourced communities and under-investment in socially vulnerable communities subject to disproportionate wildfire exposure.",Caitlyn Reilley;Christopher J Dunn;Mindy S Crandall;Jeffrey D Kline,Environmental Research Letters,False,[],这篇论文主要关注的是美国太平洋西北部地区社会脆弱社区的野火风险。它研究了社会脆弱性与实际发生的野火事件之间的关系，发现社会脆弱性较高的社区更容易受到野火的影响，即使这些社区所处的地区并非高风险区。论文认为，目前主要依赖生物物理数据进行野火风险评估的方法可能导致社会不平等，因为富裕社区可能获得过多的投资，而社会脆弱社区则可能因缺乏投资而面临更大的野火风险。论文并未涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6d7f,Conceptualising global cultural transformation—developing deep institutional scenarios for whole of society change,"This paper aims to contribute to current efforts to improve methodologies to find more ambitious and integrated strategies to jointly pursue the Paris climate target and other Sustainable Development Goals. It suggests a means of further expanding the underlying societal perspectives in scenarios modelling through a model of deep institutional innovation for sustainability and human development (DIIS), which aims to reframe the narrative from sociotechnical transition to deep global cultural transformation. The paper posits the need for capturing irreversible transformation change through a fundamental reimagining of the key social institutions that together comprise contemporary societies. To illustrate the application of the DIIS framing to pathway scenarios an indicative scenario is offered to indicate the radical global cultural changes required to move to pathways capable of bringing about greater sustainability and human flourishing.",Ian Hughes;Ariel Macaspac Hernandez;James Glynn;William Hynes;Brian Ó Gallachóir,Environmental Research Letters,False,[],这篇论文主要关注全球文化转型，旨在通过深度制度创新模型（DIIS）来重新构思社会制度，以实现可持续发展和人类繁荣。它没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。
