10.1088/1748-9326/ad8cf1,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文的主题是撒哈拉以南非洲地区由正式和非正式供水部门共同提供的供水服务。它探讨了非正式水供应商（例如水贩）在弥合供水缺口方面的作用，特别是在快速城市化超过供水网络扩张的情况下。该研究回顾了过去20年的文献，以确定不同类型的合作生产模式，并分析这些模式如何影响水资源的可及性。它还研究了正式和非正式部门之间的协调机制，例如质量测试、技术援助和批量转售的优惠价格，以及这些机制如何促进或阻碍增加水资源获取的努力。该研究的重点是社会经济因素和水资源管理，而不是大气环境遥感技术。,[],Gina Grace Gilson;Dustin Garrick,Co-producing water service delivery: a scoping review and typology of informal water vending in Sub-Saharan Africa,"Informal water providers play a critical role in addressing water supply gaps, especially where rapid urbanisation outpaces the expansion of water networks. They are widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where over 80% of workers are informally employed, and approximately 70% of the population lack access to improved drinking water. Amidst lags in progress towards SDG 6.1 of universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, there has been growing interest in the role of these vendors and how co-production between formal and informal water supply actors might improve outcomes for different types of consumers. However, we know little about the coordination mechanisms in place and how they operate in practice. We conduct a scoping review of empirical research over the last 20 years to develop insights regarding the different types of co-production that may increase water access. We reviewed published sources to develop a better understanding of the water sources and delivery methods of informal water vendors, and the mechanisms of coordination between formal and informal sectors. To supplement the findings, we develop illustrative examples of the evolution and dynamics of different coordination mechanisms. The article shows how formal (often public utilities) and informal (often private and small scale) water providers are co-producing service delivery in SSA, with insights regarding the different coordination mechanisms that might help or hinder efforts to increase water access. We find that enforcement capacity is crucial for effective coordination, which creates a dilemma: many regions most dependent on informal water providers are least capable of monitoring, let alone enforcing rules. Consumers can benefit from coordination mechanisms that require less effort, such as quality testing, technical assistance, and preferential rates for bulk resale. By specifying how the formal and informal sectors are linked, further studies on co-produced water systems can contribute to evidence regarding what coordinated service delivery options might offer short- and medium-term solutions."

To better understand the soil moisture (SM) dynamics happening synchronously in the soil column, we aim to estimate the rootzone (0–28 cm and 0–100 cm) CSM thresholds and associated regimes at a global scale, which was not previously attempted. We propose the use of the covariability of soil diurnal temperature amplitude (derived from the GLDAS) and SM (ERA5) to estimate the CSM, which overcomes the data uncertainty and multivariate dependencies of traditional methods. We find that transitional climatic regions, encompassing the western USA, Brazilian savanna, Sahelian grassland, South African savanna, peninsular India, and Mediterranean region, are global hotspots of frequent rootzone regime shifting with significant seasonality—the wet regime prevails in the fall season, while the dry regime takes over at other times of the year. The CSM values of 0–28 cm and 0–100 cm layers are mostly in the 0.2–0.35 and 0.25–0.4 m3m−3 range, respectively. We find that landscape aridity and bioclimatic characteristics primarily determine the spatial distribution of CSM and associated regimes. Furthermore, we investigate the hydrological link between the surface and rootzone layers. We note that the rootzone and surface CSM and regimes are strongly correlated, although the 0–28 cm layer indicates a relatively stronger connection compared to the 0–100 cm layer. The shallower (deeper) rootzone layer shows regimes similar to those on the surface for more than 80% (65%–80%) of the time. We observe that the strength of association between surface and rootzone regimes increases from arid (herbaceous vegetated regions) to humid (woody) regions and during wet to dry seasons. Overall, a strong association in regime dynamics between surface and subsurface layers suggests the potential applicability of remotely sensed surface SM as a surrogate to study rootzone regime responsiveness to soil–plant–atmosphere interactions."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad9759,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是半干旱城市环境中城市地表物候的季节性变化。它使用遥感技术，例如植被指数，来监测城市植被的生长季节长度和时间。研究发现，城市内部不同区域的物候存在差异，这主要受到灌溉、温度和土地覆盖类型的影响。秋季落叶期的时间差异是导致生长季节长度变化的主要原因。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术有一定的关联，因为它使用了遥感数据。然而，它的主要关注点是地表物候，而不是大气成分或空气质量。它与城市热岛效应和城市绿地管理更相关，因为研究结果可以为这些领域提供参考。,"['land surface phenology', 'vegetation indices', 'remote sensing', 'urban heat island', 'semi-arid environment', 'land cover']",Ben Crawford;Kathy Kelsey;Peter Ibsen;Amanda Rees;Amanda Charobee,Intra-urban variations in land surface phenology in a semi-arid environment,"Urban vegetation is growing in importance as cities use ‘green infrastructure’ to mitigate the impacts of climate change, reduce extreme heat, and improve human health and comfort. However, due to the heterogeneity of city landscapes, urban vegetation experiences a diverse range of environmental conditions, potentially leading to differences in growing season timing and length within cities. Here, we investigate physical drivers of urban land surface phenology and timing within a semi-arid city (Denver, CO, USA) using four years (2018–2021) of remotely sensed vegetation indices, modelled air temperature, and land cover datasets. Within the metropolitan region study area, satellite-based vegetation index measurements indicate that growing season length is variable on sub-neighborhood spatial scales. This variability is largely due to differences in the timing of fall senescence, as opposed to early season growth. Areas with substantial fractions of irrigated land cover tend to remain greener for longer, while unirrigated and cooler areas are correlated with an earlier end to the growing season (up to ∼two months shorter). These findings complement those from non-arid cities where surface and air temperature are the dominant environmental control on phenological timing. Results here indicate the importance of soil moisture for phenology in semi-arid regions and suggest unique semi-arid urban growing season dynamics and temperature-vegetation feedbacks. These interactions have implications for water, heat, and vegetation management strategies to maximize ecosystem services in water-limited environments."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad975a,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文探讨了气候因素对全球7138个流域内季节性基流的影响，以及基流变化与水文干旱严重程度之间的关系。研究发现，降水是影响基流的主要因素，但其影响在不同气候区存在显著差异。在温带地区，降水的影响最大；而在热带地区，蒸发需求是主导因素；在积雪和极地地区，积雪比例的影响最为重要。基流的负向趋势通常出现在蒸发需求或积雪比例的影响超过降水影响的地区。此外，研究还发现，基流变化与水文干旱严重程度密切相关，在69%的流域中观察到了基流与干旱同步变化的趋势。该研究强调了管理地下水补给的河流流量以减轻干旱影响的重要性，为可持续水资源规划和气候变化适应提供了关键信息。这项研究的核心在于理解气候变化对水文循环的影响，特别是对基流的影响，以及如何利用这些信息来更好地应对干旱。它与大气环境遥感技术没有直接联系，因为它主要关注的是地表水文过程，而不是大气成分或质量。,"['precipitation', 'evaporative demand', 'snow fraction', 'drought', 'baseflow', 'hydrological drought', 'groundwater']",Masoud Zaerpour;Shadi Hatami;André S Ballarin;Simon Michael Papalexiou;Alain Pietroniro;Jan Franklin Adamowski,"Climate shapes baseflows, influencing drought severity","Baseflow, the sustained flow from groundwater, lakes, and snowmelt, is essential for maintaining surface water flow, particularly during droughts. Amid rising global water demands and climate change impacts, understanding baseflow dynamics is crucial for water resource management. This study offers new insights by assessing baseflow controls at finer temporal scales and examining their relationship with hydrological drought flows. We investigate how climatic factors influence seasonal baseflow in 7138 global catchments across five major climate regions. Our analysis identifies precipitation as the primary driver, affecting 58.3% of catchments, though its impact varies significantly across different climates. In temperate regions, precipitation dominates (61.9% of catchments), while in tropical regions, evaporative demand is the leading factor (47.3%). Snow fraction is particularly crucial in both snow-dominated (20.8%) and polar regions (48.5%). Negative baseflow trends generally emerge where the effects of evaporative demand or snow fraction outweigh those of precipitation. Specifically, in northern regions and the Rocky Mountains, where snow fraction predominantly controls baseflow changes, a negative trend is evident. Similarly, in tropical catchments, where evaporative demand drives baseflow changes, this also leads to a negative trend. Additionally, our findings indicate that baseflow changes are closely linked to hydrologic drought severity, with concurrent trends observed in 69% of catchments. These findings highlight the relationship between baseflow changes, the severity of hydrologic drought and shifts in precipitation, evaporative demand, and snow dynamics. This study provides crucial insights for sustainable water resource planning and climate change adaptation, emphasizing the importance of managing groundwater-fed river flows to mitigate drought impacts."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad97d2,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是欧亚大陆高纬度地区夏季温暖指数（SWI）和归一化植被指数（NDVI）之间的非平稳关系。它发现NDVI和SWI之间的年际关系从1982-2010年的正相关变为2011-2021年的负相关，并且NDVI与夏季土壤湿度的关系也发生了类似的转变。研究指出，大气水汽压亏缺（VPD）的增加和土壤水分的减少是造成这种转变的原因。由于VPD增加，植被通过关闭气孔来减少水分损失，导致光合作用速率下降，NDVI降低。同时，由于土壤水分减少，植被蒸腾作用受到限制，导致NDVI对土壤水分的依赖性增强。虽然研究使用了遥感数据（NDVI），但其核心关注点是植被对气候变化的响应，而不是大气环境本身。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['NDVI', 'Remote Sensing', 'Vegetation']",Liuqing Ji;Ke Fan;Yuqing Tian,Nonstationary linkage between summer warmth index and NDVI at high latitudes in Eurasia,"The global increase in vegetation photosynthetic activity under the warming climate, commonly referred to as ‘greening’, has been a hot topic, especially in the high latitudes. However, in this study, it was found that, within the region of 60°–70°N and 110°–150° E, the interannual relationship between summer normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and summer warmth index (SWI) changes from being statistically positive in P1 (1982–2010) to statistically negative in P2 (2011–2021). Also, the interannual relationship between summer NDVI and summer soil moisture changes from being negative in P1 to positive in P2. The reason and possible mechanisms were investigated. On the one hand, the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) has increased significantly in P2 corresponding to the increasing SWI, and the interannual relationship between the VPD and NDVI transforms into a significantly negative one. This is because, when the atmospheric VPD increases, leaf and canopy photosynthetic rates decline owing to stomatal closure, to protect vegetation from losing too much water. Therefore, the interannual relationship between the NDVI and VPD, and in turn the SWI, transforms into a significantly negative one in P2. On the other hand, it was found that the surface evapotranspiration is energy-limited in P1, but then with the decreasing soil moisture content it becomes soil-moisture-limited in P2. As one of the most important components of surface evapotranspiration, vegetation evapotranspiration is also limited by soil moisture. Therefore, the interannual relationship between soil moisture and NDVI becomes significantly positive in P2."

By leveraging an existing open-access database of real-time congestion information derived from floating car data, we tested three methods to map high-resolution dynamic traffic emissions. To demonstrate the robustness and accuracy of the methods, we showcased results for summer workdays and winter weekends in the Helsinki Metropolitan Area (HMA). The three methods employed include (1) a physics-based relation known as the macroscopic fundamental diagram, (2) a data-driven input-adaptive generalized linear model (GLM), and (3) their ensemble (ENS). These methods estimated traffic density with satisfactory accuracy (R2 = 0.60–0.88, sMAPE = 31%–68%). Utilizing speed-dependent emission factors retrieved from a European database, the results compared favorably against the downscaled national emission inventory, particularly for CO2 (R2 = 0.70–0.77). Among the three methods, GLM exhibited the best overall performance in the HMA, while ENS provided a robust upscaling solution. The modeled emissions exhibited dynamic diurnal and spatial behavior, influenced by different functional road classes, fleet compositions and congestion patterns. Congestion-induced emissions were calculated to account for up to 10% of the total vehicular emissions. Furthermore, to anticipate the forthcoming transportation transformation, we calculated emission changes under scenarios with various penetration rates of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) using this geospatial approach. The introduction of CAVs could result in emission reductions of 3%–14% owing to congestion improvements."

An integrative review of water entitlements and entitlement failures,"An increasing number of studies find that water sharing—the non-market transfer of privately held water between households—is a ubiquitous informal practice around the world and a primary way that households respond to water insecurity. Yet, a key question about household water sharing remains: is water sharing a viable path that can help advance household water security? Or should water sharing be understood as a symptom of water insecurity in wait for more formalized solutions? Here, we address this question by applying Sen’s entitlement framework in an integrative review of empirical scholarship on household water sharing. Our review shows that when interhousehold water sharing is governed by established and well-functioning norms it can serve as a reliable transfer entitlement that bolsters household water security. However, when water sharing occurs outside of established norms (triggered by broader entitlement failures) it is often associated with significant emotional distress that may exacerbate conditions of water insecurity. These findings suggest that stable, norm-based water sharing arrangements may offer a viable, adaptive solution to households facing water insecurity. Nevertheless, more scholarship is needed to better understand when and how norm-based water transfer entitlements fail, the capacity of water sharing practices to evolve into lasting normative entitlements, and the impact of interhousehold water sharing on intrahousehold water security."

However, in the North China Plain (NCP)—a key food hub in China—the disconnect between livestock farms and croplands limits manure recycling, obscuring its potential environmental benefits and economic costs. This study employs a life cycle assessment method to quantify GHG and ammonia emissions, SOC sequestration, economic performance, and the eco-efficiency of wheat–maize production in the NCP across six livestock–cropland coupling scenarios: farmers’ practice (FP), traditional household farming (HF), modern intensive decoupled systems with low (L), medium (M), and high (H) manure returning rates, and an intensive coupled system with optimum manure returning rate (IC). The results show that increasing manure return rates in intensive systems decreases the net global warming potential (NGWP), emphasizing the importance of livestock–cropland re-coupling. Emissions embodied in the field input supply chain was identified as a major NGWP contributor, while SOC accumulation significantly contributed to net GHG mitigation. The IC scenario is both the most economically viable ($322.8 (t grain)−1) and eco-efficient (1.03 kg CO2-eq USD−1) system. With the same compost application rates, intensive farming reduced the NGWP by 26.1% compared to household farming, despite trade-offs between GHG and NH3 emissions. The FP scenario had the highest climate impact (722.8 kg CO2-eq (t grain)−1) and the lowest eco-efficiency (4.91 kg CO2-eq USD−1). These insights advance our understanding of sustainable management practices for pursuing synergistic progress in economic gains, environmental conservation, and sustainable agricultural production."

The extent to which these albedo changes may affect surface energy balances and thus soil temperatures is uncertain, but represents a potentially important component of ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. Here, we apply a well-tested process-rich ecosystem model, ecosys, to examine changes in seasonal surface albedo and soil temperature driven by climate-induced snowpack and vegetation changes across Alaska under a warmer twenty-first century climate. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate change scenario, the modeled changes in surface albedo exhibited large seasonal and spatial variations. We found spring albedo decreases driven by increases in snow-free periods (>20 d) and an extended growing season length that resulted in greater gains in leaf area index (LAI) in most parts of Alaska. In contrast, we modeled increases in summer and winter albedo (despite modeled increases in LAI) across much of the boreal forest due to an increased proportion of aspen, which has a higher leaf albedo than the currently dominant black spruce. Modeled latent heat fluxes generally increase across the twenty-first century, particularly during the spring and summer. Overall, climate warming and changes in surface energy fluxes resulted in a 3.5 ± 0.50 °C increase in spatial- and annual-averaged top 10 cm surface soil temperatures across Alaskan ecosystems by the year 2100, with larger increases in tundra than boreal forest regions. We conclude that under warmer climates, seasonal variations in albedo and surface energy fluxes are particularly pronounced during the spring and summer, driven by changes in snowpack and vegetation dynamics."

We investigate to which extent these assumptions are reflected in quantitative scenarios produced with integrated assessment models. As a case study, we assess a new set of target-seeking sustainable development pathway (SDP) scenarios. We scrutinise the modelling protocols and the scenario results to analyse the extent to which these modelled SDPs represent governance modes and policy instrument types and purposes, and assess the resulting policy mix characteristics. As such, we bridge the scenario modelling and policy mix literatures and provide an initial pathway appraisal. We find that the modelled SDPs use policy mixes to constrain negative side-effects of unmitigated climate measures to achieve several SDGs simultaneously. The policy mixes speak to several policy mix characteristics. However, they are only partially spelled so far and their credibility remains limited. This calls for additional policy-translation efforts."

However, there is often an uneven distribution of ES availability and its value across different regions. Therefore, a better understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of ES is required for efficient and sustainable management of ES. This study thoroughly reviews literary data to examine ES’s spatial distribution and economic values across the Western, Central, and Eastern Himalayas. The literature was searched in the Scopus online database using the Boolean method from specific keywords such as ‘Ecosystem Services’ AND ‘Himalayas’. A systematic review of 76 of the most relevant literature sources yielded 31 unique ES divided into three categories: Provisioning (PES), Regulating (RES), and Cultural (CES). The distribution of reviewed literature is relatively balanced across the Himalayas (Western: 30.26%, Central: 32.89%, Eastern: 36.84%); however, the analysis identified a bias towards PES (43.54%), highlighting a need for increased research focus on RES (36.48%) and CES (19.98%). Notably, water-related services such as PES9 (Surface water used as a material (non-drinking purposes)) and PES8 (Surface water for drinking) have been ranked highest in all regions of the Himalayas yet have not been comprehensively studied in terms of their quantification and valuation. Furthermore, while most literature focused on the identification of ES (73.68%), there is a significant lack of attention to quantification (39.47%) and valuation (23.68%) of ES in the region. The average economic values for PES, RES, and CES were 446.75 USD/ha/year, 1128.81 USD/ha/year, and 457.51 USD/ha/year, respectively, indicating higher valuation for RES. This underlines the need for a more balanced research approach that includes identifying and thoroughly quantifying and valuing all types of ES in the Himalayas."

This pressure on water sources has led to groundwater depletion already and is likely to increase moving forward as producers seek adaptation mechanisms to mitigate climate change impacts. Here we utilize high-resolution data on crop production and groundwater levels to estimate the nonlinear impacts of groundwater levels for corn and wheat production across the High Plains Aquifer in the central United States. Our models extend previous approaches by directly accounting for producer adaptation and feedback effects in the coupled natural and human system. This analysis reveals that continuing the current path of depletion will decrease corn and wheat production in the region by 6.75% and 1.08% in 2050, with the impacts primarily arriving via reductions in irrigated acreage. We provide evidence of substantial spatial heterogeneity of these impacts, which is notable for a region that employs largely homogeneous technology and management practices throughout. The largest production losses are associated with the Central and Southern portion and are as large as 40% for corn production in the Texas portion of the aquifer. Overall, our findings highlight the importance of developing solutions that can conserve the aquifer while avoiding significant losses in current production."

Historical records of demand typically cover 1–2 decades which may be too short to capture the range of possible demand, particularly for a climate with high interannual variability such as that of Australia. Predicting demand using long records of weather data opens the possibility of more robustly estimating true demand variability. We estimate daily energy demand between 2010 and 2019 for Australian states in the National Electricity Market using machine learning with reanalysis weather variables as predictors. We assess the performance of these models and examine their behaviour to identify which weather variables are most important for predicting demand. We then use the models to estimate demand for the period 1959–2022. We use this 64-year record to quantify how the probability of high demand days can change compared to individual 10-year periods and when conditioned by the phase of the El Ni o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Energy demand can be accurately predicted with weather, with median errors of 2%–4% on years omitted from the training. We show that the probability of extreme demand over different 10-year periods can vary from half to twice as likely, depending on the decade. When further conditioned on ENSO phase, the probabilities can be up to 7 times higher than when using the 64-year period, implying a risk of overestimating weather-related energy demand if shorter records are used. We conclude that machine learning methods can accurately predict energy demand using only weather data, enabling us to estimate demand variability over longer time horizons than is possible with demand observations. These longer records are important when attempting to quantify tail risks of demand, and so can help to inform the design of energy systems."

This study investigates the impact of cloud radiation on TC seeds and TCs in an aquaplanet model by tuning ‘threshold diameter to convert cloud ice particles to snow’ (DCS). With increased cloud cover associated with higher DCS, seed frequency decreases, but the greater intensity increase of seeds leads to a higher survival rate from seeds to TCs. The changes in large-scale circulation within the models are responsible for the reduced seed frequency. Higher DCS enhances equatorial cloud liquid and ice amounts, thereby intensifying radiation heating to the tropics. Increased radiation leads to more moisture and higher temperatures at high levels and increases the temperature gradient from the tropics to the subtropics, thereby intensifying the Hadley circulation. The resulting decrease in convective available potential energy and intensification of vertical wind shear act as inhibiting factors for seed genesis. Besides, the presence of more high-level clouds accumulates both longwave and shortwave heating, creating favorable thermal conditions for the circulation to develop at the mesoscale. This process supports the growth of seeds into mature TCs, resulting in higher survival rates from seeds to TCs. The findings on TCs and CRE in aquaplanet models could serve as a foundation and provide evidence for studies conducted in more complex environmental conditions."

However, renewable energy production is heavily dependent on the prevailing weather conditions, which are changing as a result of climate change. It is therefore necessary to build energy systems that are robust to energy shortages caused by weather-dependent changes to energy demand and renewable energy production. To design such systems, we must monitor how changes in the climate are expected to influence future energy production and demand; this is important for policymakers to decide when, where, and by how much renewable energy installed capacities should be increased, for example. In this paper, we study the behaviour of standardised energy indices in future European climate projections, and use this to monitor how characteristics of energy production droughts in Europe are expected to change in the future. We use these results to make suggestions regarding how the energy mix should be adapted in the future to decrease the risk of energy production droughts."

While many studies have focused on heat and cold extremes, which are typically stressful throughout the daytime hours, fewer have examined part-daytime thermal stress conditions, where hours of thermal comfort and discomfort both occur during the daytime. Using a recently developed dataset of the Universal Thermal Climate Index with high spatial (10 km) and temporal (hourly) resolution, we classify daytime outdoor thermal conditions of any day into the following types: full-daytime comfortable, full-daytime stressful (subdivided into ‘full-daytime cold’ and ‘full-daytime hot’), and part-daytime stressful (including ‘part-daytime cold,’ ‘part-daytime cool,’ ‘part-daytime warm,’ ‘part-daytime hot,’ and ‘wide thermal fluctuation’). We then analyze their trends and the balance between changes in heat and cold stress over the past three decades in mid- and low-latitude Asia. Here, we demonstrate that overall daytime outdoor thermal conditions have deteriorated in both low- and mid-latitude Asia. A key feature of the changes in low-latitude regions is the substantial increase in the number of full-daytime hot days and a pronounced escalation in heat stress intensity, which may make outdoor activities during the day increasingly uncomfortable and possibly unsafe. In contrast, notable aspects of the shifts in daytime thermal conditions in mid-latitude regions include a decrease in full-daytime comfortable days (conditions ideal for longer activities such as hiking and camping), and a significant rise in part-daytime hot days, which may lead people to favour shorter activities (e.g., morning walks or neighborhood biking)."

Previous studies have shown a correlation between underprivileged communities and significant impacts due to water related disasters, such as flooding or water related illnesses. As a result, for several decades the international development community has invested in WASH-related infrastructure. Lessons learned through these investments has shown the need for WASH educational outreach to build community awareness and encourage behavioral change, ultimately ensuring the sustainability and impact of the WASH infrastructure. Many WASH infrastructure programs have incorporated WASH education programs, particularly those led by the community. Often this occurs through primary and secondary schools. While WASH STEM education promotes local project ownership, leading to an increased understanding of water management and infrastructure resiliency, these educational programs are not always successful. There is a knowledge gap in understanding what makes WASH STEM education and outreach effective. This research project investigated some of the parameters influencing students’ performance on an assessment of WASH STEM curricula. This was done through deploying two water resource learning modules and assessments to secondary school students in Cambodia, India, Nicaragua, and the United States. The results revealed a correlation between how well the students comprehended the information according to the assessment and how relevant the students found the material to their own lives. The insight gained from this study can create more impactful WASH STEM education and outreach programs for water resource projects, and beyond."
10.5194/acp-24-13975-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了2002年至2019年期间，利用IAGOS（民用飞机全球观测系统）的商用飞机测量数据，分析大气中高浓度一氧化碳（CO）污染事件的季节性、区域性和垂直分布特征，以及与这些事件相关的臭氧（O3）异常现象。研究结合了SOFT-IO模型追踪CO的来源，并分析了污染事件的地理来源、来源类型、季节变化和臭氧水平。研究发现，北半球对流层低层CO浓度在冬春季达到峰值，这可能与人为排放增加和对流活动减少有关；而对流层上层的CO浓度峰值出现在夏季，这与强烈的排放和有效的垂直输送有关。此外，生物质燃烧和人为排放对CO羽流的影响也通过CO和O3的混合比进行了表征。研究还分析了中东和西伯利亚上空对流层中极高的O3值，以及印度和非洲地区CO异常的季节性特征及其与季风和热带辐合带（ITCZ）变化的关系。这项研究利用飞机测量数据和大气模型，有助于深入了解大气污染的时空分布特征、来源和输送过程，对于大气环境监测和空气质量管理具有重要意义。,"['carbon monoxide', 'ozone', 'IAGOS', 'aircraft measurements', 'atmospheric composition', 'air quality', 'pollution', 'transport', 'biomass burning', 'anthropogenic emissions']",Thibaut Lebourgeois;Bastien Sauvage;Pawel Wolff;Béatrice Josse;Virginie Marécal;Yasmine Bennouna;Romain Blot;Damien Boulanger;Hannah Clark;Jean-Marc Cousin;Philippe Nedelec;Valérie Thouret,"Seasonal, regional, and vertical characteristics of high-carbon-monoxide plumes along with their associated ozone anomalies, as seen by IAGOS between 2002 and 2019","Our study examines intense-carbon-monoxide (CO) pollution events measured by commercial aircraft from the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) research infrastructure. We combine these measurements with the SOFT-IO model to trace the origin of the observed CO. A comprehensive analysis of the geographical origin, source type, seasonal variation, and ozone levels of these pollution events is provided. 
 In situ measurements from the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) are used to characterise extreme values of carbon monoxide (CO) in large regions of the globe in the troposphere between 2002 and 2019. The SOFT-IO model, combining the FLEXPART Lagrangian dispersion model with emission inventories over the footprint region, is used to identify the origins of the CO in the sampled plumes. The impact of biomass burning and anthropogenic emissions on such CO plumes is characterised through CO mixing ratios and simultaneously recorded ozone (O3) ones.In the Northern Hemisphere, CO reaches its maximum values in DJF in the lower troposphere, which can be attributed to elevated anthropogenic emissions and reduced convective activity during the season. Due to the low photochemistry and the fresh age of the air masses, the O3 values of these plumes are low. CO plumes in the upper troposphere (UT) result from intense emissions and efficient vertical transport, peaking during JJA. The largest values of CO in the Northern Hemisphere are found in eastern Asia in the lower troposphere (LT) and middle troposphere (MT) and in Siberia in the upper troposphere.Among the anomalies detected in  the upper troposphere in JJA, the ones with higher associated O3 values are the ones associated with biomass-burning emissions. The middle troposphere is a combination of the characteristics of the LT and the UT, with contributions from both local emissions and long-range transport. Among the studied regions, the troposphere above the Middle East and the UT above Siberia presented extremely high O3 values.Indian CO anomalies have different characteristics depending on the season, as the wet and dry phases of the monsoon have a strong impact on the transport of the pollutant in this region.Similarly, the shift in the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) strongly impacts the seasonality of the emissions and the transport patterns above Africa. In that region, convection is no longer the limiting factor, and the transport of the CO plumes is driven by the ITCZ shift, trade winds, and the upper branch of the Hadley cell redistributing the pollution to higher latitudes."

Murray,High ice-nucleating particle concentrations associated with Arctic haze in springtime cold-air outbreaks,"Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) allow ice to form in clouds at temperatures warmer than −35°C. We measured INP concentrations over the Norwegian and Barents seas in weather events where cold air is ejected from the Arctic. These concentrations were among the highest measured in the Arctic. It is likely that the INPs were transported to the Arctic from distant regions. These results show it is important to consider hemispheric-scale INP processes to understand INP concentrations in the Arctic. 
 The global variation in ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations is an important modulator of the cloud-phase feedback, where the albedo of mixed-phase clouds increases in a warming climate. Shallow clouds, such as those observed in cold-air outbreaks (CAOs), are particularly important for cloud-phase feedbacks and highly sensitive to INPs. To investigate the sources and concentrations of INPs in CAOs, we made airborne measurements over the Norwegian and Barents seas as part of the March 2022 Arctic Cold-Air Outbreak (ACAO) field campaign. Aerosol samples were collected on filters at locations above, below and upstream of CAO cloud decks. Throughout the campaign, INP concentrations were comparable to the highest concentrations previously observed in the Arctic. Scanning electron microscopy analysis of samples taken upstream of cloud decks showed that supermicron aerosol was dominated by mineral dusts. Analysis of aerosol particle size measurements to obtain an INP active site density suggested sea spray was unlikely to be the dominant INP type. These site densities were also too great for mineral components alone to be the dominant INP type above −20 °C. Accordingly, it is likely that the dominant INP type was mineral dust mixed with other ice-nucleating materials, possibly of biogenic origin. Back-trajectory analysis and meteorological conditions suggested a lack of local INP sources. We therefore hypothesise that the high INP concentration is most likely to be associated with aged aerosol in Arctic haze that has undergone long-range transport from lower-latitude regions."

Vogel;Thorsten Hoffmann,Retention of α-pinene oxidation products and nitro-aromatic compounds during riming,"Riming, a crucial process in cloud dynamics, influences the vertical distribution of compounds in the atmosphere. Experiments in Mainz's wind tunnel investigated retention coefficients of organic compounds under varying conditions. Findings suggest a correlation between the Henry's law constant and retention, applicable even to complex organic molecules. 
 Riming is an important growth process of graupel and hailstones in the mixed-phase zones of clouds, during which supercooled liquid droplets freeze on the surface of ice particles by contact. Compounds dissolved in the supercooled cloud droplets can remain in the ice or be released to the gas phase during freezing, which might play an important role in the vertical redistribution of these compounds in the atmosphere by convective cloud processes. This is important for estimating the availability of these compounds in the upper troposphere, where organic matter can promote new particle formation and growth. The amount of organic material remaining in the ice phase can be described by the retention coefficient. Experiments were performed in the Mainz vertical wind tunnel under dry and wet growth conditions (temperature from −12 to −3 °C and a liquid water content (LWC) of 0.9±0.2 g m−3 and 2.2±0.2 g m−3) as well as with different pH values (4 and 5.6) to obtain the retention coefficients of α-pinene oxidation products and nitro-aromatic compounds. For cis-pinic acid, cis-pinonic acid, and (−)-pinanediol, mean retention coefficients of 0.96±0.07, 0.92±0.11, and 0.98±0.08 were obtained. 4-Nitrophenol, 4-nitrocatechol, 2-nitrobenzoic acid, and 2-nitrophenol showed mean retention coefficients of 1.01±0.07, 1.01±0.14, 0.99±0.04, and 0.21±0.12. Only the retention coefficient of 2-nitrophenol showed a dependence on temperature, growth regime, and pH. This is in accordance with previous studies, which showed a dependence between the dimensionless effective Henry's law constant H* and the retention coefficient for inorganic and small organic molecules. Our results reveal that this correlation can also be applied to more complex organic molecules and that retention under these conditions is not a significant factor for molecules with H* below 103, while retention close to 1 can be expected for compounds with H* above 108."

Luhar;Anthony C. Jones;Jonathan M. Wilkinson,Quantifying the impact of global nitrate aerosol on tropospheric composition fields and its production from lightning NOx,"Nitrate aerosol is often omitted in global chemistry–climate models, partly due to the chemical complexity of its formation process. Using a global model, we show that including nitrate aerosol significantly impacts tropospheric composition fields, such as ozone, and radiation. Additionally, lightning-generated oxides of nitrogen influence both nitrate aerosol mass concentrations and aerosol size distribution, which has important implications for radiative fluxes and indirect aerosol effects. 
 Several global modelling studies have explored the effects of lightning-generated nitrogen oxides (LNOx) on gas-phase chemistry and atmospheric radiative transfer, but few have quantified LNOx's impact on aerosol, particularly when nitrate aerosol is included. This study addresses two key questions: (1) how does including nitrate aerosol affect properties such as tropospheric composition, and (2) how do these effects depend on lightning parameterisation and LNOx levels? Using the Met Office's Unified Model–United Kingdom Chemistry and Aerosol (UM–UKCA) global chemistry–climate model, which now includes a modal nitrate aerosol scheme, we investigate these effects with two lightning-flash-rate parameterisations. Our findings show that both nitrate aerosol and LNOx significantly impact tropospheric composition and aerosol responses. Including nitrate aerosol reduces global mean tropospheric OH by 5 %, decreases the tropospheric ozone burden by 4 %–5 %, increases methane lifetime by a similar amount, and alters the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) net downward radiative flux by −0.4 W m−2. The inclusion of nitrate also shifts the aerosol size distribution, particularly in the Aitken and accumulation modes. A 5.2 Tg N yr−1 increase in LNOx from a zero baseline results in global aerosol increases of 2.8 % in NH4, 4.7 % in fine NO3, 12 % in coarse NO3, and 5.8 % in SO4 mass burdens. This much LNOx increase causes relatively small positive changes in aerosol optical depth, TOA radiative flux, and cloud droplet number concentration compared to when nitrate is included. The results, based on a fast uptake rate for HNO3 to produce NH4NO3, likely represent an upper limit on nitrate effects."

High-resolution measurements from a remote sensing laser instrument provide NLC height, brightness, and occurrence rate since 2017. Most observations occur in the morning hours, likely caused by strong tidal winds, and NLC ice particles are thus transported from elsewhere to the observing location in the Southern Hemisphere. 
 Noctilucent clouds (NLCs) are sensitive tracers of upper-mesospheric temperature, water vapor, and dynamics and thus open windows to study our atmosphere from very large to very small scales, including topics of climate, circulation, waves, and turbulence. NLCs are weaker in the Southern Hemisphere compared to the Northern Hemisphere where there are numerous observations, but no vertical soundings at Southern Hemisphere mid-latitudes were available until now. We determine the properties of NLCs above a Southern Hemisphere mid-latitude site at 53.8° S in southern Argentina. The Compact Rayleigh Autonomous Lidar has provided high-resolution vertical lidar soundings since 2017. Noctilucent clouds are detected every summer, with the earliest (latest) detection on 29 November (29 January), giving 19 events in total of 33.8 h length at an average height of 83.3 km, a maximum brightness of 24 × 10−10 m-1sr-1, an occurrence rate of 7 %, and a maximum in the morning hours (05:00–07:00 UTC, i.e., 02:00–04:00 LT). The latter coincides with a positive amplitude of the semi-diurnal tide of the meridional wind as measured by the Southern Argentina Agile Meteor Radar. The ambient temperature above the site is on average too high to support local ice formation. We find no correlation with the solar flux; indeed, the latest season of 2023/2024 shows the most NLC detections. This leaves transport from more southerly and colder regions and potentially increasing upper-mesospheric water vapor levels as a result of increasing space traffic as possible explanations for the occurrence and unexpectedly large brightness of NLCs above Río Grande."

The dataset, with details on distribution and characteristics, aids in understanding permafrost distribution, mountain hydrology, and climate impacts in High Mountain Asia, filling a knowledge gap. 
 Rock glaciers – periglacial landforms commonly found in high-mountain systems – are of significant scientific value for inferring the presence of permafrost, understanding mountain hydrology, and assessing climate impacts on high-mountain environments. However, inventories remain patchy in many alpine regions, and as a result they are poorly understood for some areas of High Mountain Asia such as the Tibetan Plateau. To address this gap, we compiled a comprehensive inventory of rock glaciers for the Tibetan Plateau, i.e., TPRoGI (v1.0), developed using an innovative deep learning method. This inventory consists of a total of 44 273 rock glaciers, covering approximately 6000 km2, with a mean area of 0.14 km2. They are predominantly situated at elevations ranging from 4000 to 5500 m a.s.l., with a mean of 4729 m a.s.l. They tend to occur on slopes with gradients between 10 and 25°, with a mean of 17.7°. Across the plateau, rock glaciers are widespread in the northwestern and southeastern areas, with dense concentrations in the Western Pamir and Nyainqêntanglha, while they are sparsely distributed in the inner part. Our inventory serves as a benchmark dataset, which will be further maintained and updated in the future. This dataset constitutes a significant contribution towards understanding, future monitoring, and assessment of permafrost on the Tibetan Plateau in the context of climate change.

Our dataset provides a global continuous and seamless ET, which is beneficial for global research and future water balance studies. 
 Evapotranspiration (ET) serves as a key indicator of the water change between the Earth’s surface and atmosphere, significantly influencing the hydrology cycle, surface energy cycle, and carbon cycle. Existing remote sensing models for estimating ET usually necessitate the parameterization of resistance parameters. In this study, we proposed the Remote Sensed Non-Parametric (RSNP) model, which leverages the nonparametric (NP) and Surface Flux Equilibrium-nonparametric (SFE-NP) approaches, and adapted remote sensing and reanalysis datasets of meteorological and surface parameters as model inputs. We estimate global monthly ET from 2001 to 2019 in the spatial resolution of 0.1° with RSNP model. Validation against FLUXNET sites globally yield RMSE of 23 mm/month (278 mm/yr), while regional-scale validation against water-balance ET results in a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 113 mm/yr. In addition, the produced ET dataset have great accuracy in forest underlying and obtains spatial details of land surface ET. Furthermore, compared with ETMonitor, PEW and PML_V2, our dataset offers a continuous and seamless ET dataset suitable for global research.

Kaplan,"Modelling framework for asynchronous land-atmosphere coupling using NASA GISS ModelE and LPJ-LMfire: Design, Application and Evaluation for the 2.5ka period","This study presents and demonstrates an experimental framework for asynchronous land-atmosphere coupling using the NASA GISS ModelE and LPJ-LMfire models for the 2.5ka period. This framework addresses the limitation of NASA ModelE, which does not have a fully dynamic vegetation model component. It also shows the role of model performance metrics, such as model bias and variability, and the simulated climate is evaluated against the multi-proxy paleoclimate reconstructions for the 2.5ka climate. 
 While paleoclimate simulations have been a priority for Earth system modelers over the past three decades, little attention has been paid to the period between the mid-Holocene and the Last Millennium, although this is an important period for the emergence of complex societies. Here, we consider the climate of 2500 BP (550 BCE), a period when compared to late preindustrial time, greenhouse gas concentrations were slightly lower, and orbital forcing led to a stronger seasonal cycle in high latitude insolation. To capture the influence of land cover on climate, we asynchronously coupled the NASA GISS ModelE Earth system model with the LPJ-LMfire dynamic global vegetation model. We simulated global climate and assessed our results in the context of independent paleoclimate reconstructions. We also explored a set of combinations of model performance parameters (bias and variability) and demonstrated their importance for the asynchronous coupling framework. The coupled model system shows substantial vegetation albedo feedback to climate. In the absence of a bias correction, while driving LPJ-LMfire in the coupling process, ModelE drifts towards colder conditions in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in response to land cover simulated by LPJ-LMfire. A regional precipitation response is also prominent in the various combinations of the coupled model system, with a substantial intensification of the Summer Indian Monsoon and a drying pattern over Europe. Evaluation of the simulated climate against reconstructions of temperature from multiple proxies and the isotopic composition of precipitation (δ18Op) from speleothems demonstrated the skill of ModelE in simulating past climate. A regional analysis of the simulated vegetation-climate response further confirmed the validity of this approach. The coupled model system is sensitive to the representation of shrubs and this land cover type requires particular attention as a potentially important driver of climate in regions where shrubs are abundant. Our results further demonstrate the importance of bias correction in coupled paleoclimate simulations."

Moor,Wavelength Sensitive Plastic Photodissolution: Elucidating Quantum Yield Trends for Solar Activation Spectra,"Plastic photodissolution into dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is a key proposed loss pathway for plastic in aquatic environments. However, the specific solar excitation wavelengths that drive photodissolution remain unknown, limiting our ability to model and predict photodissolution rates in natural aquatic environments. To better understand the impact of solar excitation wavelength on plastic photodissolution rates, we measured the wavelength sensitivity of photodissolution for a variety of transparent and semitransparent commercial and postconsumer plastic films with wide-spanning polymer chemistries. We irradiated plastic films using custom-built light-emitting diode (LED) photoreactors that emit light in the range of 275 to 445 nm and found that plastics exhibit a strong wavelength sensitivity, producing the highest DOC release rates for short wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light. We additionally calculated photodissolution quantum yield trends for transparent plastic films and then calculated photodissolution activation spectra. We found that solar UV light between 300–350 nm is responsible for most of the plastic photodissolution for all plastic compositions and predicted plastic photodissolution rates within water columns.

Heavy-duty diesel vehicles (HDDVs), as major sources of these emissions, exhibit complex emission characteristics because of the combined effects of different driving conditions and aftertreatment technologies. This study first investigated the emission factors (EFs) of Nr species, including NO, NO2, HONO, N2O, and NH3, from HDDVs under different emission standards (China IV/V/VI) and cheating strategies, with a particular focus on the impact of selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems. Vehicles employing water injection cheating present NO, NO2, and HONO EFs that are consistent with the China III standards, significantly undermining the effectiveness of Nr emission control. The evolution of SCR technology in China IV, V, and VI standards has generally led to substantial reductions in NO, NO2, and HONO emissions, yet the integration of ammonia slip catalysts (ASC) systems in China VI vehicles presents new challenges. While ASCs have successfully reduced NH3 slip to an average of 17 ± 12 mg/km, they have also caused a 6–13-fold increase in N2O emissions compared with those of China IV and V vehicles, reaching levels of 205 ± 85 mg/km. Additionally, China VI vehicles exhibit a marked increase in the HONO/NOx ratio, which increases from 0.9% in China V to 4.6%. These increases are attributed to high-temperature oxidation of NH3 within the ASC catalyst, leading to undesirable byproducts. The temporal dynamics of Nr emissions under real-world driving conditions further reveal that the effectiveness of aftertreatment technologies and their selectivity toward byproducts vary depending on the driving mode. This variability underscores the need for further optimization of the SCR and ASC technologies to balance the control of all the reactive nitrogen species effectively."

Tang,A Novel Shear-Detachment Approach for Modeling Dynamics of Membrane Cleaning,"We report a novel shear-detachment (SD) approach to simulate the dynamics of flux recovery in the membrane cleaning process. In this model, the rate of foulant detachment away from the membrane is governed by both the shear intensity and the probability of successful foulant detachment, with the latter modeled by Boltzmann distribution. Our SD predictions exhibit good agreement with experimental results, accurately capturing the dynamics of flux recovery. Modeling outcomes reveal that the time required for fully restoring water flux is largely independent of the initial cake mass but significantly dependent on crossflow-flushing velocity and adhesive energy of foulant to membrane. Higher flushing velocity and/or lower adhesive energy can create a shear-limited condition where almost all shear events bring about successful foulant detachment, facilitating rapid flux recovery. Conversely, a smaller flushing velocity or greater adhesive energy can result in increasingly detachment-limited situations, where the cleaning efficiency is primarily dictated by the probability of foulant detachment. Our study offers profound insights into the importance of shear rate and detachment probability in governing foulant detachment kinetics and self-cleaning behavior, which carry significant implications for membrane preparation and process operation."

Based on nearly 4-year observations of groundwater and river in China’s largest ion-adsorption rare earth mining watershed, we revealed the dynamics of NO3– and its drivers using stoichiometry-based load model, molecular biological, and multi-isotope approaches. Results indicated that the NO3– dynamics were jointly controlled by sources (precipitation, terrestrial inputs, and sediment supply) and processes (hydrological and biological). The monthly NO3– export load from the 444.4 km2 watershed was 3.72 × 105 kg. Groundwater (36 ± 26%) and soil nitrogen (25 ± 17%) were the primary exogenous sources of NO3–. Baseflow was the main hydrological pathway for legacy nitrogen into the river, contributing 66.8% of the NO3– load. Coupled nitrification-denitrification were key biological processes affecting the NO3– transformation, with denitrification contributing 58%. Burkholderia were most associated with NO3– transformation. Dissolved organic carbon and oxygen were major drivers affecting the NO3– production and consumption.

However, limited studies have focused on the molecular composition of atmospheric particulate matter that contributes to Arctic haze. Our study collected atmospheric particles at Alert in the Canadian high Arctic from mid-February to early May 2000. Over 100 organic species were identified in the solvent-extractable fraction by gas chromatography–mass spectrometry, which were grouped by their functional groups. Plasticizer-derived phthalates were the most abundant, followed by polyacids, sugars, sugar alcohols, biogenic SOA tracers, and fossil fuel combustion tracers. During the dark winter, major contributors to Arctic aerosols include plastic emissions, biomass burning, secondary oxidation products, and fossil fuel combustion products. In the light spring, phthalates (58–76% of the identified organics) dominated, followed by microbial and marine sources and secondary oxidation products. By employing a tracer-based method, we discovered that naphthalene and sesquiterpene oxidation products were the major contributors to SOC, and these contributions were much higher in the winter than in the spring. However, monoterpene and isoprene oxidation products peaked in light spring. Our results confirm that organic aerosols in the Arctic atmosphere are dominated by anthropogenic sources, which consist of both long-range-transported particles and combustion-emitted organics, as well as aged anthropogenic secondary organic aerosols. Despite decreasing anthropogenic pollution being replaced by natural emissions, plastic-derived pollution, represented by phthalates, increased significantly in the high Arctic atmosphere after the polar sunrise."

Yet, how internal soil gross N transformation rates respond to fires remains unexplored globally. Here, we investigate the general response of gross soil N transformations to fire and its consequences for N availability and loss. The results showed that fire increased gross N mineralization rate (GNM; +38%) and ammonium concentration (+47%) as a result of decreased soil C/N ratio but decreased microbial nitrate immobilization (INO3; −56%), resulting in increased nitrous oxide (N2O; +50%) and nitric oxide (+121%) emissions and N leaching (+308%). Time since fire affected soil N cycling and loss. Fire increased GNM, ammonium concentration, and N2O emission, and decreased INO3 only when time since fire was less than one year, while increased N leaching in the short (<one year) and long (>one year) terms. Thus, the consequences of fire were a short-lived increase in N availability and N2O emissions (lasting less than one year) but with persistent risks of N loss by leaching over time. Overall, fire increased the potential risks of N loss by stimulating N production and inhibiting nitrate retention."

Nontargeted, transcriptomic analysis revealed potential hepatotoxic effects in exposed larvae, including macrovesicular and microvesicular hepatic steatosis, as well as focal liver necrosis. Morphological, histological, biochemical, and targeted transcript expression profiles further confirmed significant alterations in hepatocellular lesion numbers, liver pathological structures, relative liver size, liver biochemical parameters, and liver function genes. To validate the PPAR-mediated toxicological mechanism identified as an enriched pathway through in silico bioinformatics analysis, we tested the coexposure to an antagonist and PPAR morpholino knockdown. This intervention alleviated PFHxS-induced hepatic effects, including reductions in the levels of aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, total cholesterol, and total triglycerides.

However, mineral-SOM interactions at the molecular scale, particularly synergetic adsorption through organic–organic interaction on the mineral surface known as organic multilayering, remain poorly understood. This study investigates the impact of organic multilayering on mineral-SOM interactions, by integrating macroscale experiments and molecular-scale simulations that assess the individual and sequential adsorption of major SOM compounds–lauric acid (lipid), pentaglycine (amino acid), trehalose (carbohydrate), and lignin onto soil minerals. Ferrihydrite, Al-hydroxide, and calcite are exposed to SOM compounds to determine adsorption affinities and binding energies. Results show that lauric acid has 20–40 times higher Kd than pentaglycine, following the order Kd(ferrihydrite) > Kd(Al-hydroxide) ≫ Kd(calcite). Molecular-scale simulations confirm that lauric acid has a higher binding energy (30.8 kcal/mol) on ferrihydrite than pentaglycine (6.0 kcal/mol), attributed to lipid hydrophobicity. The lower binding energy of pentaglycine results from its hydrophilic amide groups, facilitating partitioning into water. Sequential experiments examine how the first layer of lipid or amino acid affects the adsorption of carbohydrate/lignin, which show little or no individual adsorption affinities. Macroscale results reveal that lipid and amino acid adsorption induce ferrihydrite particle repulsion increasing reactive surface area and enhancing carbohydrate/lignin adsorption independently and synergistically through organic multilayering. Molecular-scale results reveal that amino acid adsorbed on ferrihydrite interacts more readily with lignin macroaggregates (preformed in solution) than with individual lignin units, indicating organic multilayering via H-bonding. These findings reveal the molecular mechanisms of SOM-mineral interactions, crucial for enhancing soil carbon stabilization."

However, few studies have measured the emission factors (EFs) of the toxicity of the OCPs from forest fires. In this study, the EFs of vegetation burning were observed in forests along the altitudinal gradient from 1000 to 4200 m, and the EFs of ∑DDTs (dechlorodiphenylthrichloroethanes), HCB (hexachlorobenzene), ∑HCHs (hexachlorocyclohexanes), and ∑PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) were 2050 ± 1175, 379 ± 409, 48 ± 51, and 65 ± 59 ng/kg, respectively. Re-evaporation was the primary mechanism of the emission of OCP from forest fires. The masses of HCB, β-HCH, o,p′-DDD, p,p′-DDD, and PCB-28 in smoke increased 3–7 times compared with those in unburnt vegetation, suggesting the formation of these pollutants by the pyrolysis of biomass or other pollutants. Based on the observed EFs, previously estimated quantities of fire-emitted OCPs in the Himalayan regions were revisited. The DDT emissions from the Himalayan forest fires increased ∼70% compared with the previous estimation (from 19 to 32 kg/year). This highlighted that the EF observations could decrease the uncertainties of estimating OCP emissions from forest fires, which is helpful in revealing the potential roles of forest fires on global POP cycling."

This process must rely on large energy inputs and resource consumption, which have become a global challenge in the environmental field. Here, we greatly amplify this self-purification effect of natural dissolved oxygen (DO) by nonexpendable H2O2 triggering a DRC catalyst with a micro-potential difference surface. This low-energy strategy is mainly realized by lowering the activation energy barriers of endogenous substances and simultaneously opening the mass transfer channels over the Cu–ZnO surface. In this way, pollutant electrons and energy are efficiently utilized to activate DO. Surprisingly, the rapid degradation of the pollutants is accompanied by H2O2 consumption of only 2.6% at most, sometimes even reaching zero consumption, with the instantaneous absolute amount of H2O2 exceeding 100%. The typical endocrine disruptor BPA has been proven to be harmlessly degraded to small molecule alcohols and acids by self-purification amplification, including cleavage of stable contaminants on the catalyst surface, activation of natural DO, and enhancement of mass transfer between them."

Seeds act as vectors for ARG dissemination in the soil–plant system, but the impact of elevated CO2 on seed resistomes remains poorly understood. Here, a free-air CO2 enrichment system was used to examine the impact of elevated CO2 on seed-associated ARGs and seed endophytic bacteria and fungi. Results indicated that elevated CO2 levels significantly increased the relative abundance of seed ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), especially those related to beta-lactam resistance and MGEs. Increased CO2 levels also influenced the composition of seed bacterial and fungal communities and the complexity of bacteria–fungi interactions. Fungi were more sensitive to changes in the CO2 level  than bacteria, with deterministic processes playing a greater role in fungal community assembly. Co-occurrence network analysis revealed a stronger correlation between fungi and ARGs compared to bacteria. The structure equation model (SEM) showed that elevated CO2 directly influenced seed resistomes by altering bacterial composition and indirectly through bacteria–fungi interactions.

Persistent, bioaccumulative, mobile, and toxic (PBMT) chemicals persist in the environment and have high mobility in aquatic environments, posing risks to human and ecological health. However, lack of experimental data for the vast number of chemicals hinders identification of PBMT chemicals. Through an extensive search of measured chemical mobility data, as well as persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) chemical inventories, this study constructed comprehensive data sets on PBMT chemicals. To address the limited volume of the PBMT chemical data set, a transfer learning (TL) framework based on graph attention network (GAT) architecture was developed to construct models for screening PBMT chemicals, designating the PBT chemical inventories as source domains and the PBMT chemical data set as target domains. A weighted loss (LW) function was proposed and proved to mitigate the negative impact of imbalanced data on the model performance. Results indicate the TL-GAT models outperformed GAT models, along with large coverage of applicability domains and interpretability. The constructed models were employed to identify PBMT chemicals from inventories consisting of about 1 × 106 chemicals.

Metallophores, metabolites secreted by microorganisms and plants, promote mineral dissolution to increase the metal bioavailability. However, interactions between metallophores and Mo-bearing minerals remain unclear. In this study, catecholate protochelin and hydroxamate desferrioxamine B (DFOB) were utilized to examine their effects on dissolution of the common Mo-bearing mineral, molybdenite (MoS2), under both oxic and anoxic conditions. Protochelin promoted molybdenite dissolution under oxic conditions, with the formation of MoO3 on the surface and Mo-siderophore complexes in solution. This was attributed to air-oxidation of both molybdenite and protochelin, as evidenced by lack of dissolution under anoxic conditions but enhanced dissolution by either preoxidized protochelin or preoxidized molybdenite. Liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry analyses revealed degradation of protochelin and adsorptions of its byproducts on molybdenite surface to promote dissolution. Conversely, DFOB inhibited molybdenite dissolution under both oxic and anoxic conditions, likely attributed to surface adsorption of DFOB and its weak complexation with Mo(VI) at the circumneutral pH. This work highlights the need to consider the balance between promoting and inhibitory effects of different metallophores on Mo-mineral dissolution."

Model accuracy compared to real-world measurements of HAPs is crucial for understanding and mitigating exposure and associated health harms. While previous work shows ambient measurements are higher than regulatory model estimates, the implications for health risk assessments are rarely discussed. We provide a comprehensive comparison of the modeled and measured concentrations at 489 US monitoring sites for 79 HAPs. We quantify how model-measurement discrepancies affect the estimation of the exposure and risk of adverse health effects. Measurements were higher than modeled concentrations in 74% of comparisons over all monitors, chemicals, and years assessed, with measurements a median 2 (IQR 1–9) times higher than model estimates. Measurements exceeded noncancer adverse health effect thresholds, while the model did not (model false negatives) for nine pollutants. Adjusting for model bias in two industrial centers, we found the number of people with multipollutant exposure above the US EPA’s acceptable excess lifetime cancer risk increased by a factor of 30 times in Houston, Texas, and 13 times in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.

Actions to address methane emissions have emphasized the importance of the use of measurement-informed emissions inventories given the systematic underestimation in official greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories. Despite significant progress in field measurements of GHG emissions across the natural gas supply chain, no detailed measurements at US liquefaction terminals are publicly available. In this work, we conduct multiscale, periodic measurements of methane and carbon dioxide emissions at two US LNG terminals over a 16-month campaign. We find that methane emission intensity varied from 0.007% to 0.045%, normalized to methane in LNG production. Carbon dioxide emissions accounted for over 95% of total GHG emissions using 100-year global warming potential (GWP) for methane. Thus, contrary to observations across other natural gas supply chain segments, we find that reported GHG emissions intensity closely matches measurement informed GHG emissions intensity of 0.24–0.27 kg CO2e/kg CH4. In the context of developing LNG supply chain emissions intensity, we conclude that the use of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program emissions intensity provides reasonably accurate estimates of total GHG emissions at LNG terminals."

It is thus crucial to identify the sources and transformations of Hg in TP ecosystems. Here we measured Hg isotopes in water samples collected from two adjacent TP rivers, the Upper Mekong River (UMR) and the Upper Salween River (USR), to better constrain Hg geochemistry and its export under climate changes. We found similar δ202Hg and Δ200Hg variations in the two rivers, which reflect a similarly mixed contribution of atmospheric precipitation and catchment input to both rivers. However, in general, USR shows notably higher Δ199Hg than UMR. As the catchment of USR has a larger glacier-covered area than UMR, we propose that the higher Δ199Hg of USR water samples reflects a higher glacier Hg input, which is typically characterized by extremely positive Δ199Hg. Our study indicates that increasing glacier melting, vegetation greening and precipitation induced by climate changes may enhance Hg export from TP, potentially endangering the fragile Tibetan ecosystem and human health."

UFPs generated from occupant activities or infiltrating from the outdoors can be recirculated and accumulate indoors when they are not successfully filtered by an air handling unit. Monitoring UFPs in real occupied environments is vital to understanding these source and mitigation dynamics, but capturing their rapid transience across multiple locations can be challenging due to high-cost instrumentation. This 9-month field measurement campaign pairs four medium-cost diffusion charger sensors with volumetric airflow rates modulated and monitored in a cloud-based building automation system of an open-plan living laboratory office and dedicated air handling unit to evaluate spatiotemporal particle number and surface area concentrations and migration trends. Particle number flux rates reveal that an estimated daily median of 8 × 1013 UFPs enter the air handling unit from the outdoors. Switching from a MERV14 to a HEPA filter reduces the number of UFPs supplied to the room by tens of trillions of UFPs daily, increasing the median filtration efficiency from 40% to 96%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of an optimal air handling unit’s performance to improve indoor air quality, while highlighting UFP dynamics that are not accounted for in current filtration standards nor in occupant-centered HVAC control. Scalable sensor development can popularize UFP monitoring and allow for future UFP integration within building control and automation platforms.

The progressive SST gradient strengthening over the Plio‐Pleistocene contrasted with the stronger Late Pliocene surface productivity gradient relative to modern.

10.1029/2024JD042294,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了城市化对中尺度对流系统（MCSs）的影响，特别是行星边界层（PBL）的作用。研究使用了北京的高密度雷达风廓线仪（RWP）探空网、风云二号静止气象卫星数据、理论分析和大涡模拟等多种手段。研究发现，强降水条件下，MCS在城市及下风向区域趋于减弱；弱降水条件下，MCS在城市及下风向区域则趋于增强。这种差异与城市地区的湍流摩擦和热力效应有关。强降水时，湍流摩擦减弱了MCS活动；弱降水时，热力效应占主导，促进了地表辐合，增强了MCS。论文的结论是通过理论分析和模型模拟证实了观测到的城市化对MCSs的影响，并强调了RWP探空网在研究城市化对MCSs影响中的重要性。,"['Mesoscale Convective Systems', 'Urbanization', 'Radar Wind Profiler', 'Satellite Observations', 'Precipitation', 'Planetary Boundary Layer', 'Turbulence', 'Large-Eddy Simulation', 'Fengyun-2']",Tian Xian;Jianping Guo;Runze Zhao;Xiaoran Guo;Ning Li;Yuping Sun;Zhen Zhang;Tianning Su;Zhanqing Li,"Impact of Urbanization on Mesoscale Convective Systems: Insights From a Radar Wind Profiler Mesonet, Theoretical Analyses, and Model Simulations","The role of planetary boundary layer (PBL) in the urban effect on mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) remains highly uncertain. The high‐density Mesonet of radar wind profilers (RWPs) in Beijing, along with geostationary satellite data from Fengyun‐2, were used to investigate the MCS evolution and potential impact of urbanization. An MCS as observed by satellite tends to weaken over urban and downstream areas under strong precipitating conditions as opposed to an invigorated MCS over urban and downstream areas under weak precipitating conditions. The pattern of low‐level convergence and high‐level divergence from RWP Mesonet dominates the PBL of all MCS events under strong precipitating conditions, as compared with fluctuating vertical structures of convergence under weak precipitating conditions. Under strong precipitating conditions, turbulent friction weakens MCS activity over the Beijing urban area. Under weak precipitating conditions, thermal effect dominated over urban areas, favoring the formation of surface‐level convergence and invigorating MCSs. Using the large‐eddy simulation, we further investigated the influence of turbulent structural characteristics on the development of MCS. For the strong (weak) precipitating case, turbulence dissipation (buoyancy) dominated the turbulent kinetic energy over urban areas, explaining well the characteristics of MCSs propagating over these areas. Overall, the theoretical analysis and model simulation results confirm the observed impact of urbanization on MCSs. Besides the above scientific findings, our study highlights the importance of the RWP Mesonet in studying the urban effect on MCSs."
10.1029/2023JD040055,False,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究的是最大可能降水量（PMP）的估算方法，PMP用于设计大坝溢洪道和其他高风险建筑物。传统上，PMP是通过对历史上的特大暴雨进行比例放大来估算的。近年来，数值天气预报模型被用来模拟大气湿度增加（称为相对湿度最大化，或RHM）所导致的降水。尽管这代表了重大的改进，但基于模型的PMP依赖于一个关键假设，即历史上的特大暴雨达到了最大效率（水分转化为降水），而该论文重新评估了这一假设。研究人员使用CESM2-LE全球气候模型集合，这是一个非常大的人工记录（约1150年），与历史记录相比，以了解风暴效率和降水的上限。他们对CESM2-LE中最严重的10场暴雨（按总降水量）进行了降尺度分析，并确定了控制降水效率的关键风暴属性（垂直运动、对流和辐合）。与历史风暴相比，他们发现CESM-LE风暴的效率可提高30%，降水量可提高32%，但PMP估算值仅提高8%，这表明模型集合和历史风暴在PMP方面存在一定程度的趋同。这项工作对控制风暴效率的因素的理解，利用了过去专注于湿度的研究成果，并支持开发更可靠的PMP风暴放大指南。虽然该研究与大气科学相关，但其重点是降水和洪水预测，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,"['precipitation', 'Probable Maximum Precipitation', 'storms', 'flood', 'numerical weather prediction', 'climate model']",Emilie G.

A Large Model Ensemble Approach,"The flood that would result from the greatest depth of precipitation “meteorologically possible”, or Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) is used in the design of dam spillways and other high‐risk structures. Historically, PMP has been estimated by scaling depth‐area‐duration relationships obtained from severe historical storms. Over the last decade, numerical weather prediction models have been used to instead simulate precipitation resulting from the addition of atmospheric moisture (called relative humidity maximization, or RHM). Despite the major improvement this represents, model‐based PMP relies on a key assumption, which this paper re‐evaluates in Oroville dam's Feather River watershed (California). Model‐based as well as earlier procedures assume that severe historical storms achieved maximum efficiency (moisture conversion to precipitation) and only maximize moisture. We examine the most severe storms found in the CESM2‐LE global climate model ensemble, which constitutes a very large artificial record (∼1,150 years) in comparison with the historical record, to understand the upper bounds of storm efficiency and precipitation. We downscale the 10 most severe CESM2‐LE storms (by precipitation totals), and identify key storm attributes (vertical motion, convection and convergence) that control precipitation efficiency. In comparison with historical storms, we find that CESM‐LE storms can have 30% higher efficiency and 32% higher precipitation, but produce only 8% higher PMP estimates, suggesting some convergence of model ensemble and historical storms in terms of PMP. The understanding of the controls on storm efficiency that our work provides leverages past work focused on moisture and supports the development of more reliable PMP storm amplification guidance."
10.1029/2024JD041382,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了2021年7月塔克拉玛干沙漠一次罕见特大暴雨事件的水汽来源。该研究利用带有水汽示踪剂的在线欧拉天气研究和预报模型（WRF-WVT），分析了不同来源（包括本地蒸散发、上游西风带、东亚干旱区、阿拉伯海、青藏高原和南亚季风）对这次降雨事件的贡献。研究发现，本地蒸散发贡献最大（32.77%），其次是上游西风带（28.95%）和东亚干旱区（28.54%）。外部水汽源的总贡献超过65.98%，表明外部水汽输送对这次极端降水事件的重要性。此外，论文还将此次事件与2016年的一次降水事件进行了比较，发现塔克拉玛干沙漠以西向南延伸的低压槽在2021年的暴雨事件中起了重要作用，它增强了西风带的水汽输送和上升运动，从而导致了极端降水的发生。虽然论文没有直接使用遥感观测数据，但其研究内容与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，例如降水反演、水汽探测、数值天气预报模式的输入和验证等。这项研究有助于更好地理解干旱地区极端降水事件的形成机制，并对气候变化和极端天气预报具有重要意义。,"['Water Vapor', 'Precipitation', 'Atmospheric Modeling', 'Weather Forecasting', 'Remote Sensing', 'Climate Change', 'Extreme Weather', 'Arid Regions', 'Taklamakan Desert']",Yongqi Gong;Haipeng Yu;Huancui Hu;Jianping Huang;Yu Ren;Jie Zhou;Ming Peng;Siyu Chen;Khan Alam;Wen Zhao;Shanling Cheng;Yunsai Zhu,The Water Vapor Origin of a Rainstorm Event in the Taklamakan Desert,"In July 2021, the Taklamakan Desert (TD) experienced an unprecedented rainstorm with daily precipitation exceeding 61.1 mm, triggering mudslides and landslides, highlighting the increasing frequency of extreme precipitation events even in arid regions under global warming. The water vapor sources and transport paths of this rainstorm are still puzzling due to the insufficient representation of physical processes in previous analytical models, leading to possible deviations from reality. Here, using the online Eulerian Weather Research and Forecasting model with water vapor tracer (WRF‐WVT), we aim for an improved understanding of water vapor sources of the rainfall event. Results demonstrate that the most important water source for this event is water vapor from local evapotranspiration, contributing to 32.77% of the rainstorm moisture. Water vapor from Upstream Westerlies (28.95%) and East Asian Drylands (28.54%) are transported over the precipitation area by the westerlies owing to the strong lower‐level low‐pressure system, being the second‐most important precipitation source. These sources contribute significantly more than other regions, including the Arabian Sea (5.56%), the Tibetan Plateau (2.16%), and the South Asian Monsoon (0.77%). External moisture sources collectively provide over 65.98% of the precipitation, underscoring their important role. Notably, local evapotranspiration significantly influences precipitation, exceeding the contributions from other individual sources. By comparing with the 2016 precipitation event, it is found that a low‐pressure trough extending southward to the west of the TD plays a significant role in the 2021 rainstorm event. The presence of the trough significantly enhances the moisture transport of the westerlies and the upward motion, contributing to the occurrence of extreme precipitation events."

In this study, we investigated the contribution of historical climate change to the heavy snowfall event using large ensemble simulation data sets and two pseudo global warming (PGW) methods. We classified the large ensemble simulation data sets by the pressure pattern and identified the extratropical cyclone event. Composite analyses reveal that the development of the extratropical cyclone can be attributed to historical climate change. We ran the PGW method with the classified meteorological data as the input data and found that the development of the extratropical cyclone resulted in enhanced water vapor transport and intensified local convergence in the lower troposphere, causing heavy precipitation. We also found that oceanic warming made a minimal contribution to the precipitation in this event. These findings highlight the importance of considering historical changes in event‐specific synoptic‐scale atmospheric conditions when evaluating the contributions of climate change to extreme events."

For the first time, we characterize coastline retreat consistently along permafrost coastal settlements at the regional scale for the Northern Hemisphere. We provide a new method to automatically derive long‐term coastline change rates for permafrost coasts. In addition, we identify the total number of coastal settlements and associated infrastructure that could be threatened by marine and terrestrial changes using remote sensing techniques. We extended the Arctic Coastal Infrastructure data set (SACHI) to include road types, airstrips, and artificial water reservoirs. The analysis of coastline, Ground Temperature (GT) and Active Layer Thickness (ALT) changes from 2000 to 2020, in addition with SLR projection, allowed to identify exposed settlements and infrastructure for 2030, 2050, and 2100. We validated the SACHI‐v2, GT and ALT data sets through comparisons with in‐situ data. 60% of the detected infrastructure is built on low‐lying coast (< ${< } $10 m a.s.l). The results show that in 2100, 45% of all coastal settlements will be affected by SLR and 21% by coastal erosion. On average, coastal permafrost GT is increasing by 0.8°C per decade, and ALT is increasing by 6 cm per decade. In 2100, GT will become positive at 77% of the built infrastructure area. Our results highlight the circumpolar and international amplitude of the problem and emphasize the need for immediate adaptation measures to current and future environmental changes to counteract a deterioration of living conditions and ensure infrastructure sustainability."

All members of mitochondrial DNA-containing Myzozoa, including Toxoplasma gondii, have commandeered three lineage-specific families of RNA-binding proteins to meticulously piece together over 40 mitochondrial rRNA fragments to build an operational mitoribosome. 
 The phylum Apicomplexa comprises eukaryotic parasites that cause fatal diseases affecting millions of people and animals worldwide. Their mitochondrial genomes have been significantly reduced, leaving only three protein-coding genes and highly fragmented mitoribosomal rRNAs, raising challenging questions about mitoribosome composition, assembly and structure. Our study reveals how Toxoplasma gondii assembles over 40 mt-rRNA fragments using exclusively nuclear-encoded mitoribosomal proteins and three lineage-specific families of RNA-binding proteins. Among these are four proteins from the Apetala2/Ethylene Response Factor (AP2/ERF) family, originally known as transcription factors in plants and Apicomplexa, now repurposed as essential mitoribosome components. Cryo-EM analysis of the mitoribosome structure demonstrates how these AP2 proteins function as RNA binders to maintain mitoribosome integrity. The mitoribosome is also decorated with members of lineage-specific RNA-binding proteins belonging to RAP (RNA-binding domain abundant in Apicomplexa) proteins and HPR (heptatricopeptide repeat) families, highlighting the unique adaptations of these parasites.

 High-velocity stars and peculiar G objects orbit the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Together, the G objects and high-velocity stars constitute the S cluster. In contrast with theoretical predictions, no binary system near Sgr A* has been identified.

Based on periodic changes in the radial velocity, we find an orbital period of 372±3 days for the two components. The binary system is stable against the disruption by Sgr A* due to the semi-major axis of the secondary being 1.59±0.01 AU, which is well below its tidal disruption radius of approximately 42.4 AU.

Here, the authors use yeast cells to show that macronucleophagy can act as a break to limit micronucleophagy, another mode of autophagic degradation of nuclear components, and that this may play a role in protection against starvation. 
 Lysosome/vacuole-mediated intracellular degradation pathways, collectively known as autophagy, play crucial roles in the maintenance and regulation of various cellular functions. However, little is known about the relationship between different modes of autophagy. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nitrogen starvation triggers both macronucleophagy and micronucleophagy, in which nuclear components are degraded via macroautophagy and microautophagy, respectively. We previously revealed that Atg39-mediated macronucleophagy is important for cell survival under nitrogen starvation; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we reveal that defective Atg39-mediated macronucleophagy leads to the hyperactivation of micronucleophagy, resulting in the excessive transport of various nuclear components into the vacuole. Micronucleophagy occurs at the nucleus–vacuole junction (NVJ). We show that nuclear membrane proteins localized to the NVJ, including Nvj1, which is responsible for micronucleophagy, are degraded via macronucleophagy. Therefore, defective Atg39-mediated macronucleophagy results in the accumulation of Nvj1, which contributes to micronucleophagy enhancement. Blocking micronucleophagy almost completely suppresses cell death caused by the absence of Atg39, whereas enhanced micronucleophagy correlates with death in Atg39-mutant cells under nitrogen starvation. These results suggest that macronucleophagy modulates micronucleophagy in order to prevent the excess removal of nuclear components, thereby maintaining nuclear and cellular homeostasis during nitrogen starvation. Macronucleophagy degrades nuclear components. Here, the authors use yeast cells to show that macronucleophagy can act as a break to limit micronucleophagy, another mode of autophagic degradation of nuclear components, and that this may play a role in protection against starvation."

 Therapsids were a dominant component of middle–late Permian terrestrial ecosystems worldwide, eventually giving rise to mammals during the early Mesozoic.

This specimen represents, to our knowledge, the oldest gorgonopsian record worldwide, and possibly the oldest known therapsid. Using emerging relaxed clock models, we provide a quantitative timeline for the origin and early diversification of therapsids, indicating a long ghost lineage leading to the evolutionary radiation of all major therapsid clades within less than 10 Myr, in the aftermath of Olson’s Extinction. Our findings place this unambiguous early therapsid in an ancient summer wet biome of equatorial Pangaea, thus suggesting that the group originated in tropical rather than temperate regions.

 Throughout adulthood and ageing our brains undergo structural loss in an average pattern resembling faster atrophy in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Using a longitudinal adult lifespan sample (aged 30-89; 2–7 timepoints) and four polygenic scores for AD, we show that change in AD-sensitive brain features correlates with genetic AD-risk and memory decline in healthy adults. We first show genetic risk links with more brain loss than expected for age in early Braak regions, and find this extends beyond APOE genotype. Next, we run machine learning on AD-control data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using brain change trajectories conditioned on age, to identify AD-sensitive features and model their change in healthy adults. Genetic AD-risk linked with multivariate change across many AD-sensitive features, and we show most individuals over age ~50 are on an accelerated trajectory of brain loss in AD-sensitive regions. Finally, high genetic risk adults with elevated brain change showed more memory decline through adulthood, compared to high genetic risk adults with less brain change. Our findings suggest quantitative AD risk factors are detectable in healthy individuals, via a shared pattern of ageing- and AD-related neurodegeneration that occurs along a continuum and tracks memory decline through adulthood.

 Unfit cells with defective signalling or gene expression are eliminated through competition with neighbouring cells. However, physiological roles and mechanisms of cell competition in vertebrates remain unclear. In addition, universal mechanisms regulating diverse cell competition are unknown. Using zebrafish imaging, we reveal that cell competition ensures robust patterning of the spinal cord and muscle through elimination of cells with unfit sonic hedgehog activity, driven by cadherin-mediated communication between unfit and neighbouring fit cells and subsequent activation of the Smad-Foxo3-reactive oxygen species axis. We identify Foxo3 as a common marker of loser cells in various types of cell competition in zebrafish and mice. Foxo3-mediated physiological cell competition is required for eliminating various naturally generated unfit cells and for the consequent precise patterning during zebrafish embryogenesis and organogenesis.

 Accurate building height estimation is essential to support urbanization monitoring, environmental impact analysis and sustainable urban planning. However, conducting large-scale building height estimation remains a significant challenge. While deep learning (DL) has proven effective for large-scale mapping tasks, there is a lack of advanced DL models specifically tailored for height estimation, particularly when using open-source Earth observation data. In this study, we propose T-SwinUNet, an advanced DL model for large-scale building height estimation leveraging Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral time series. T-SwinUNet model contains a feature extractor with local/global feature comprehension capabilities, a temporal attention module to learn the correlation between constant and variable features of building objects over time and an efficient multitask decoder to predict building height at 10 m spatial resolution. The model is trained and evaluated on data from the Netherlands, Switzerland, Estonia, and Germany, and its generalizability is evaluated on an out-of-distribution (OOD) test set from ten additional cities from other European countries. Our study incorporates extensive model evaluations, ablation experiments, and comparisons with established models.

Its strong generalization to the OOD test set (RMSE of 3.2 m) underscores its potential for low-cost building height estimation across Europe, with future scalability to other regions. Furthermore, the assessment at 100 m resolution reveals that T-SwinUNet (0.29 m RMSE, 0.75 R2) also outperformed the global building height product GHSL-Built-H R2023A product(0.56 m RMSE and 0.37 R2).

 Rapid, accurate, and nondestructive estimation of grain number per panicle (GNPP) in winter wheat is crucial to accelerate smart breeding, improve precision crop management, and ensure food security. As two (panicle number per unit ground area and GNPP) of three commonly used yield components, GNPP was much less quantified with remotely sensed data than the former through visual counting. The limited research suffered from either low accuracies with ground canopy spectra or low efficiency with proximal panicle imaging systems. No studies have been reported on estimating GNPP with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, underscoring its strong advantages in high-resolution and efficient monitoring. To address these issues, this study proposed a practical approach for estimating GNPP in winter wheat by integrating UAV imagery and meteorological data with meta-learning ensemble regression. The potential contributions of different variables were examined for understanding the improvement in the spectral estimation of GNPP, including spectral indices (SIs), the optimal canopy height (CH) metric, and absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR).The results demonstrated that CHP99 (CH at the 99th percentile in the region of interest) derived from red-green-blue (RGB) imagery exhibited the strongest correlation with measured plant height among all RGB- or multispectral (MS)-derived CH metrics. The incorporation of remotely sensed APAR and RGB-derived CHP99 improved the accuracy of GNPP estimation over using merely color indices or SIs. Among all feature combinations, Comb. #6 (SIs + APARMS + CHP99) yielded the highest overall accuracies in estimating GNPP for individual and multiple stages. Compared with the best anthesis models for Combs. #5–7 (Rval2 = 0.52–0.64, RMSE = 2.85–2.47, RRMSE = 6.01–5.21 %), the multi-stage (heading + anthesis) models exhibited higher accuracies in independent validation (Rval2 = 0.60–0.65, RMSE = 2.60–2.42, RRMSE = 5.48–5.10 %). The findings suggest this study has opened a new avenue for estimating GNPP with UAV remote sensing. The proposed method for the synergistic use of UAV imagery and meteorological data has great potential in the prediction of GNPP and grain yield over various regions with satellite imagery and climate datasets."

 Change detection (CD) aims to compare and analyze images of identical geographic areas but different dates, whereby revealing spatio-temporal change patterns of Earth’s surface. With the implementation of the High-Resolution Earth Observation Project, an integrated sky-to-ground observation system has been continuously developed and improved. The accumulation of massive multi-modal, multi-angle, and multi-resolution remote sensing data have greatly enriched the CD data sources. Among them, high-resolution optical remote sensing images contain abundant spatial detail information, making it possible to interpret fine-grained scenes and greatly expand the application breadth and depth of CD. Generally, traditional optical remote sensing CD methods are cumbersome in steps and have a low level of automation. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) based CD methods possess powerful feature extraction and non-linear modeling capabilities, thereby gaining advantages that traditional methods cannot match. As a result, they have become the mainstream approaches in the field of CD. This review article systematically summarizes the datasets, theories, and methods of CD for optical remote sensing image. It provides a comprehensive analysis of AI-based CD algorithms based on deep learning paradigms from the perspectives of algorithm granularity. In-depth analysis of the performance of typical algorithms are further conducted.

 The tunnel environment is characterized by insufficient ambient light, obstructed view, and complex inner lining construction conditions. These factors frequently result in limited anti-interference capability, reduced recognition accuracy, and suboptimal segmentation results for defect extraction. We propose a deep network model utilizing an encoder–decoder framework that integrates Transformer and convolution for comprehensive defect extraction. The proposed model utilizes an encoder that integrates a hierarchical Transformer backbone with an efficient attention mechanism to fully explore complete information at multi-scale granularities. In the decoder, multi-scale information is initially aggregated using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) module. Additionally, the Stacking Filters with Atrous Convolutions (SFAC) module are implemented to enhance the perception of the complete defect scope. Furthermore, a Boundary-aware Attention Module (BAM) is implemented to enhance edge information to improve the detection of defects.

 In this study, we explored the spatial and temporal distributions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and their role in the formation of ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Both passive and active air sampling techniques were employed at 17 and 3 sites, respectively, during the warm season (May‒August 2020) in Ulsan, the largest industrial city in South Korea. The total (Σ52) VOC levels at industrial sites (214 μg/m3), particularly in petrochemical, automobile, and shipbuilding industrial complexes, were higher than at rural (50.2 μg/m3) and urban (65.0 μg/m3) sites during the passive sampling period, with no significant diurnal variation during the active sampling period. On the other hand, isoprene, a representative biogenic VOC, was observed at higher concentrations at the rural sites, particularly during the daytime under favorable meteorological conditions. Furthermore, potential impacts from industrial emissions of isoprene were identified. Non-traffic sources (industrial activities) were dominant in the study area, while the rural and urban sites were more affected by traffic and aged sources.

 The assessment of the impact of passive remediation approaches to improve indoor air quality requires the real-scale investigation of technologies. Plasters are identified as relevant materials to mitigate indoor pollution. Interestingly, lime-cement plasters can be formulated with activated carbon sorbent to expand their uptake properties. This work provides a full-scale and replicable evaluation methodology to address the passive remediation properties of materials with regard to experimental facilities and the diversity of pollution scenarios. This methodology is applied to lime-cement plaster formulated or otherwise with activated carbon and subsequently set in IRINA experimental room (40 m3). Both materials are successively submitted to CO2, ozone and VOC transient pollution events. Specific attention is paid to the behaviour of formaldehyde. First, both fresh plasters demonstrate high mitigation capacities towards CO2. This behaviour has to be compared to the ageing of materials. Similarly, excellent decomposition capacities are evidenced towards ozone. Both pollution scenarios highlight a higher mitigation of lime-cement compared to activated carbon. Regarding VOC pollution scenarios, the effective removal of formaldehyde is evidenced. However, formaldehyde decay follows second-order kinetics, due to surface reactive processes, preventing the calculation of the clean air delivery rate (CADR). Mitigation of other VOCs is considerably promoted by activated carbon in the plaster. Abatement of different classes of pollutants is discussed taking CADR into consideration. Results evidence the effectiveness of combining carbon-based sorbent with plaster in order to benefit from complementary uptake properties. Finally, the CADR of selected pollutants are compared with classically determined equivalent data for active remediation technologies. This full-scale comparison demonstrates that passive mitigation approaches offer equivalent remediation capacities compared to widespread active and destructive air treatment technologies."

 An increasing evidence has suggested that organic aerosols (OA) may exist in a semisolid or solid state under specific ambient conditions rather than liquid as normally assumed in traditional gas-particle partitioning models, provoking a rethinking of viscosity-related atmospheric physicochemical processes of OA. Several detection methods and prediction models were developed to determine the OA viscosity, and the prediction with aerosol chemical compositions and molecular properties also provides effective means for viscosity quantification. The viscosity variations of OA depend on chemical properties and environmental conditions, e.g., temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH). The strong hydrogen bonding and formation of high molecular weight oligomers can significantly increase the OA viscosity. The higher RH introduces more aerosol liquid water that can serve as a plasticizer, and a higher T can enhance the breaking of intermolecular bonds, thereby decreasing the viscosity of OA. These combined impacts further result in highly spatiotemporal variability of OA viscosity. The lower diffusivity within more viscous OA particles is expected to preclude evaporation, water uptake, and gas uptake, leading to non-equilibrium gas-particle partitioning and shifting the partitioning mechanism from absorptive to adsorptive. The higher viscosity can also decelerate the heterogeneous reaction, thereby inhibiting OA formation and growth, extending atmospheric lifetimes of OA. Besides, a high viscosity allows OA particles to remain glassy, increasing the probability of heterogeneous ice nucleation, which further affects cloud properties and the global climate. The application of existing viscosity measurement techniques to ambient particles and improvement in the accuracy of viscosity prediction models are critical for future studies on OA-relevant atmospheric physicochemical processes. Given the significant impacts of OA viscosity on both atmospheric lifetimes of toxic pollutants and radiative properties of cirrus clouds, it is recommended that variations of OA viscosity should be considered in human-health-related risk assessments and climate models to improve their performance."

 We investigated the performance of mass transfer from cloud water to rainwater, commonly referred to as ‘autoconversion’, in cloud microphysical schemes within high-resolution numerical models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). The proper choice of autoconversion rate in the numerical model is crucial for droplet growth and conversion rates to form precipitation. The liquid water content and cloud properties, varying from shallow to convective clouds, are highly sensitive to autoconversion rates, and their sensitivity is closely linked with model biases. A parcel-bin model guided by observations can provide significant insights for selecting a more suitable suite of autoconversion rates for the forecasting model. The parcel-bin model is important for the explicit representation of hydrometeors population and calculating microphysical process rates. We calculated drop size distribution, relative dispersion, diffusion growth rate coefficient, and autoconversion rates for two environmental conditions using a small-scale model based on in situ airborne measurement data from the Cloud-Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX) over the Indian subcontinent. We evaluated four different (Kessler, KES; Liu-Daum, LD; Khairoutdinov-Kogan, KK; Lee-Baik, LB) autoconversion rates in the WRF model for simulating two thunderstorm events over India. The LD, LB and KK autoconversion rates exhibited closer performance and demonstrated a better probability distribution of raindrop size and precipitation compared to KES.

 In coastal areas like Mumbai, India, where heavy monsoons rain can lead to severe flooding, particularly in low-lying areas, it is essential to have accurate hourly rainfall estimations for meteorological and hydrological purposes. The Satellite Precipitation Products (SPPs), such as IMERG, provide comprehensive coverage, though they have biases. This research uses high-density ground-based rain gauges over Mumbai in real-time. It applies various correction methods to correct satellite precipitation estimates for a whole monsoon region on an hourly basis. The additive and multiplicative corrections in traditional parametric methods were ineffective, particularly during heavy rainfall conditions. Quantile mapping did well with negative biases but struggled with extreme rainfall events. The machine learning method called the Random Forest (RF) algorithm performed best by enhancing the correlation between satellite and ground-based data (overall) from 0.11 to 0.69. The RF model successfully reduced overestimation and underestimation and shifted towards zero bias, capturing the space and time variation of rainfall well across different stations. The study implies that ML can be used to enhance satellite precipitation products as an effective way to improve rainfall estimates in monsoon-prone areas. The application of the RF framework is likely to lead to more precise information for effective water resource management as well as disaster preparedness."

 Seasonal Forecasting of the Arabian Peninsula (AP) Surface Air Temperature (SAT) during boreal summer (June–July-August; JJA) season is essential for socio-economic sectors of the region. In present study, the multi-model boreal summer seasonal mean SAT prediction skill is investigated using Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S) and Saudi-KAU Seasonal Forecasting Systems for the period 1993 to 2016. The models are validated against ERA5 reanalysis dataset. The observed maximum SAT variability over the central and northern AP region is captured well by 80 % of the models. We further defined AP temperature index (APTI) based on SAT anomaly over the central and northern AP. A statistically significant negative correlation of −0.52 (95 % confidence level) is noted in ERA5 between El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and APTI. Most of the models successfully capture the ENSO and SAT teleconnections with varying magnitude, except CMCC and DWD models, where opposite relationship is noted. During La Niña (cold ENSO phase) the positive geopotential anomalies over Eurasia strengthen due to the upper-level divergence over the Western Pacific and Eastern Indian Ocean through Sverdrup balance, which favour sinking motion and leads to above-normal temperature anomalies over AP. The opposite tends to happen during El Niño. The deterministic and probabilistic skill of the models are also assessed. Most of the models show reasonable prediction skill in representing ENSO and atmospheric circulation anomalies over Eurasia that modulate AP summer SAT anomalies, except CMCC and DWD.
