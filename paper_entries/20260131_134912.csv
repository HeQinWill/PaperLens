However, in-situ measurements of key trace gases in the UTLS remain scarce over the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (TP), a core region of the ASM anticyclone. In August 2019, the first AirCore observations over the northern TP were conducted, providing high-resolution vertical profiles of CH4, CO and N2O from the surface up to 22 km. Instrument and campaign details are described. Notably, enhanced concentrations of CH4 and CO were observed at 13–14 km when the observation site was located within the ASM anticyclone, indicating that the primary influence of deep convection occurs at this altitude. Back-trajectory analyses indicate that these enhanced layers originated from northern India, the Bay of Bengal, and southern China. On average, CH4 and CO concentrations inside the anticyclone were 30.2 ppb and 52.5 ppb higher, respectively, than those outside. N2O concentrations remain relatively constant throughout the troposphere but show a sharp decline approximately 2 km above the tropopause, indicating the onset of significant stratospheric influence and a weakening of ASM anticyclone confinement at this altitude. These results demonstrate the capability of the AirCore system to resolve the fine-scale vertical structure of trace gases, offering critical insights into the upward transport of surface pollutants to the UTLS via the TP during the ASM."

Emulators are often calibrated on idealised abrupt CO2 quadrupling experiments from CMIP6, particularly the global surface temperature response over time to an imposed radiative forcing. Such CMIP6 experiments tend to be run for 150 years, which is not sufficient to reveal the full equilibrium response to an imposed climate forcing. Here we show that, when longer experiments are available for emulator calibration, the long-term climate warming projections increase, particularly for 2100, by up to 0.70 (0.42–0.93, 25th to 75th percentile) °C in the median under a high emissions scenario; peak global warming in a high overshoot scenario is higher by 0.24 °C (0.14–0.31 °C). Corresponding long-term thermosteric sea level rise (SLR) is consequently higher, by 0.45 (0.22–0.52, 25th to 75th percentile) m in 2500. This result, consistent across calibrations from 17 ESMs, has implications for climate change mitigation strategies, as it is likely that even more stringent emissions reductions would be required to limit long-term warming and SLR than previously thought."

We geolocate each power project and obtain forecasted physical climate risk exposures at these locations using data from Moody’s ESG Solutions. We measure transition climate risks using the project specific committed CO₂ emissions and find a positive correlation between physical and transition climate risks across these projects—which are driven primarily by fossil fuel investments. Coal power plants exhibit the highest level of both physical and transition climate risks. Although hydropower projects tend to have lower carbon emissions, they face the highest flood risk among all fuel types. We find no evidence that the positive relationship between physical and transition climate risks varies by financier country or financing type. These results highlight the need for integrated climate risk assessments in international energy finance and underscore the potential for climate-related liabilities to compound across multiple risk channels."

However, in recent decades, unusually wet conditions have persisted into autumn, creating unprecedented extremes. Using multidecadal observations, reanalysis datasets, and Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP) simulations, we show that Arctic warming significantly postpones the retreat of the AfroA-SM. This delay shifts the northernmost summer monsoon boundary by 5.6°–12° and accounts for 33%–69% of September precipitation across North Africa, South Asia, the Tibetan Plateau, and East Asia. The mechanism is anchored in a northward displacement of the subtropical jet stream, which is driven by reduced meridional temperature gradients resulting from sea‐ice loss and Arctic amplification. The resulting Eurasian anticyclone weakens the tropospheric dipole of the polar vortex, promoting negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)-like anomalies and a pronounced Eurasian wave train. These reinforce the northward shift of the subtropical high and enhance warm‐moisture advection into northernmost margin summer monsoon belts. PAMIP ensemble experiments further indicate that future Arctic amplification will intensify this autumn monsoon persistence and its associated precipitation. Our findings are critical for understanding the intensification of late-season hydroclimatic extremes, underscoring the urgent need for improved seasonal forecasting, adaptive agricultural strategies, and flood-risk management in a warming climate."

Exploring British Columbia’s energy transition trade-offs using integrated energy systems modelling,"Decarbonizing industrialized economies through electrification requires electricity systems to simultaneously achieve dramatic capacity expansion, sustained reliability, and emissions reductions. We present a novel soft-linkage methodology between the CIMS energy-economy model and the COPPER electricity system planning model to quantify how economy-wide policies translate into specific electricity system requirements and greenhouse gas outcomes for the Canadian province of British Columbia. Our analysis examines two scenarios: one reflecting implemented policies, and another adding proposed climate policies alongside electrified industrial projects, including liquefied natural gas facilities and large-scale mining operations. Results reveal dramatically different infrastructure requirements between scenarios, with the latter requiring substantially higher electricity capacity expansion, dominated by variable renewable energy and higher peak demand growth. Emissions outcomes diverge: while implemented policies deliver meaningful emissions reductions, net-zero aligned proposed policies achieve smaller overall reductions when accounting for prospective emissions from fossil fuel projects, which offset decarbonization elsewhere in the economy. Proactive energy system planning and accelerated infrastructure permitting and construction will be required to meet decarbonization and economic development goals. British Columbia’s experience may offer insights for other jurisdictions pursuing both natural resource development and climate goals. Our approach can be adapted by other jurisdictions using similar models to assess their own energy transition pathways."

Typhoon Hinnamnor (2022), which originated in the northwestern Pacific and weakened over the East Sea, demonstrates this interaction. While previous studies have explored typhoon intensification due to underlying MHWs, the formation of MHWs following a typhoon’s passage remains less understood. Post-typhoon MHWs can form due to local ocean heat uptake by anomalously cold sea surface temperatures overlying an anomalously warmer subsurface. This study provides the first detailed analysis of MHW formation on the west side of a typhoon path, off Korea’s east coast, approximately one week after the typhoon, using data from a fixed surface mooring. The results indicate that near-inertial internal gravity waves, influenced by sub-inertial background conditions, prevented the onset of the MHW during the week following the typhoon’s passage, despite favorable conditions such as coastal downwelling, increased surface net heat flux, and higher upper-ocean heat content."

Sunshine Duration observations reveal the paradox of dimming event under strictest lockdown policies in February 2020 over Beijing. Modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis shows Rs decreased abruptly by 12.89 W·m−2 in February 2020 compared to 2015–2019 (pre-pandemic), which is confirmed by Himiwari-8 satellite retrieved Rs. Through multi-parameter attribution analysis, Shapley additive explanations indicated that an anomalous increase in aerosol optical depth contributed 31.700% to Rs attenuation, primarily driven by chemical formation of secondary organic aerosols that offset benefits from reduced primary emissions. Simultaneously, modified cloud physical properties collectively accounted for 38.02% to Rs attenuation. Specifically, doubled low cloud cover accounted for 23.89% while increased low cloud optical thickness contributed 13.52%. Further compounding these effects, weakened boundary layer dynamics exerted synergistic impacts: boundary layer height (BLH) compression (168.93 m) contributed 14.92% and reduced wind speed (0.63 m·s−1) contributed 9.51%, jointly promoting near-surface aerosol accumulation through suppressed pollutant diffusion. Additionally, elevated surface temperature (+1.36 °C) exacerbated Rs attenuation by facilitating aerosol nucleation and cloud condensation nucleus formation. Collectively, these findings challenge the assumption that emission reduction invariably improves Rs, ultimately confirming nonlinear climatic effects from coupled aerosol-cloud-Rs interactions under abrupt anthropogenic disturbances."

Vegetation water content (VWC) has been proposed as a holistic indicator of entire plant water status and ecosystem functioning. However, few studies have explored its relationships with ecological and environmental factors, especially in data-scarce regions like Patagonia. In this study, we used the SMAP dataset to analyzed VWC patterns across vegetation types, landscapes, and climate anomalies over the 2015–2016 to 2024–2025 growing seasons in Southern Patagonia, covering Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego provinces. The results show that VWC varies significantly among vegetation types. Forests and shrublands generally had higher VWC than grasslands. Among them, Nothofagus betuloides and evergreen mixed forests (NB) exhibited the highest VWC, with grasslands and dry shrublands being at the lowest level. Distinct seasonal VWC dynamics emerged along landscape gradients: a bell-shaped pattern in humid areas and an inverted bell-shaped pattern in arid ecosystems, primarily driven by winter snowmelt recharge and subsequent summer water stress. VWC responded differentially to El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode phases, with El Niño and La Niña exerting contrasting effects by province. To bridge science and application, we propose incorporating these metrics into adaptive management, specifically for: (i) defining conservation-priority zones for harvesting in water-limited forests, (ii) implementing dynamic fire risk thresholds based on seasonal depletion patterns, and (iii) adjusting silvopastoral stocking rates according to inter-annual VWC trends. These findings demonstrate that VWC is a robust indicator for guiding sustainable ecosystem management and conservation planning in Southern Patagonia."

Conversely, projected decreases in the amplitude may act to suppress flood hazards in some regions, partially offsetting the impact of sea level rise. Simulations of the sea level seasonal cycle by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models suggest changes up to ±30% are projected under a high emission scenario. We demonstrate that a currently unaccounted increase of 5–10 cm in the sea level seasonal cycle will increase the frequency of extremes from once in 20 years to once in 10 years. However, the sea level seasonal cycle amplitudes in CMIP6 models are underestimated compared to seasonal variability observed by satellite altimetry for almost all coastlines, suggesting that future changes might be underestimated, leading to a large impact on extreme sea levels in coastal areas. Including the changes in the future sea level seasonal cycle will advance future projections of sea level extremes and contribute to the crucial decisions about adaptation in coastal areas."

This poses a major challenge for Cyprus to comply with the stricter PM10 limits set by the new EU air quality directive. 
 Long-term daily PM2.5 and PM10 chemical speciation data was collected continuously from 2015 to 2023 at an urban traffic and regional background site in Cyprus, offering a unique opportunity to quantify the influence and trends of (i) local emissions on urban PM concentration levels and sources, and (ii) regional PM emissions over the Eastern Mediterranean basin.Despite a statistically significant drop in PM2.5 and PM10 at both sites over the last 19 years (2005–2023), concentration levels remain high with no further significant improvements observed over the last 9 years; making PM concentration levels well above the new EU annual limits. To refine this analysis, long-term trends (2015–2023) were explored for individual PM chemical species and sources derived by PMF source apportionment. A decreasing trend in traffic-related PM10 of 35 % was observed at the traffic site, suggesting the effectiveness of the gradual shift of the vehicle fleet towards the latest EURO-standard vehicles. On the other hand, this reduction in tailpipe traffic emissions was completely offset by an increase of uncontrolled urban emissions, such as road dust re-suspension and biomass burning from domestic heating, calling for the rapid implementation of abatement measures.Based on cluster analysis of air mass origins, the Middle East region was identified as a major hotspot of PM10 over the Eastern Mediterranean; with both high concentration levels of dust from the Arabian desert and substantial anthropogenic pollution with continuously increasing trends in biomass burning and sulfate-rich emissions from fossil fuel combustion over the past decade."

This study analyses the influence of instrument types on the SD detection using the single scattering albedo spectral dependence.

 Saharan dust (SD) can be transported over long distances by large-scale atmospheric circulation. SD events (SDE) occur 30 to 150 times each year at the high-altitude station of the Jungfraujoch (JFJ) in the Swiss Alps. The SD detection method, applied since 2001, is based on the inversion of the single scattering albedo wavelength dependence caused by the higher coarse-mode fraction and the chemical composition of dust. Here, the reproducibility of the SD detection by different types of nephelometers and absorption photometers is first investigated and is then compared to detections based on the observed concentration of coarse-mode aerosol, source sensitivities simulated with FLEXPART as well as to the dust index provided by the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service. The difference in SD detection is stronger for various nephelometer types than for various absorption photometers. Each detection method has advantages and weakness and no one can be considered as reference. The climatology of the 23-year time series of dust hours and dust mass at the JFJ shows that the temporal influence of dust is strongest from February to June, and in October and November, whereas the dust mass is higher in spring than in fall. The SDEs detected by a high coarse-mode particle concentration have different sources and pathways to Europe than the ones detected by the optical method. The inhomogeneity in the SD time series and the high inter-annual variability restrain the evaluation of long-term trends."

We established a localized plant species-specific BVOC emission rate library using a developed statistical approach, based on local measurements. The usage of library can improve the emission model performance by better catching the spatial variations of emissions. 
 Precise quantification of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions is essential for effective control of ozone and secondary organic aerosol pollution. However, the lack of a localized and detailed plant species–specific emission rate library poses significant challenges to accurate emission estimates in China. Additionally, large uncertainty exists in the representative emission rates used in inventory compilation. Here, a statistical approach for classifying emission intensity and assigning representative emission rates with higher accuracy was developed from our measurements and local field observations. Furthermore, a localized plant species–specific BVOC emission rate library for China covering 599 plant species was established. Critically, different reliability levels were assigned to each emission rate according to the measurement technique.  Emission simulations were conducted to evaluate the implications of the developed library. Comparison with formaldehyde vertical column density observations showed that our localized library improved the model performance in capturing the spatial variations of isoprene emissions. The newly estimated BVOC emissions were 27.70 Tg, 18 % higher than estimates based on the global library. Updating the localized emission rates reduced underestimation in southern and overestimation in northeast and western China."

Using satellite data and a new tracking method, it maps fractions of sea ice from first- to sixth-year and includes uncertainty estimates. The dataset shows a decline in older ice and more first-year ice, it agrees well with buoy data, and supports Arctic monitoring, climate research, navigation, and model evaluation. 
 We present LM-SIAge, a new Climate Data Record (CDR) of Arctic sea ice age spanning the period from 1991 through 2024. The dataset is based on a novel Lagrangian advection scheme applied to a triangular mesh, which conserves sea ice age fractions and reduces numerical diffusion compared to the previous Eulerian approach. LM-SIAge is derived from satellite observations of sea ice concentration and drift, and represents fractional age classes per grid cell. The record captures the spatial and temporal evolution of first- to sixth-year ice, including uncertainty estimates that account for both sea ice concentration and drift uncertainties.We compare LM-SIAge with existing products from NSIDC and C3S, finding consistent large-scale trends – such as the decline of older ice – but also identifying systematic differences. Trend analysis confirms a significant reduction in sea ice age and a general increase in the area of first-year ice. Validation with ice drifting buoys indicates good consistency (LM-SIAge does not underestimate max age of the buoys in 98.3 % of cases), with most discrepancies occurring near the ice edge. The NSIDC product does not underestimate the age in 96.4 % of cases.The LM-SIAge dataset improves the observational basis for Arctic monitoring and contributes to the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Essential Climate Variables.

A climatology is derived separately for each station and each month of the year. Along with the dataset, SEEPS4ALL also resembles a set of verification tools. In a nutshell, SEEPS4ALL helps promote the benchmark of daily precipitation forecasts against in-situ observations over Europe. 
 Forecast verification is an essential task when developing a forecasting model.  How well does a model perform? How does the forecast performance compare with previous versions or other models? Which aspects of the forecast could be improved?  In weather forecasting, these questions apply in particular to precipitation, a key weather parameter with vital societal applications.  Scores specifically designed to assess the performance of precipitation forecasts have been developed over the years. One example is the Stable and Equitable Error in Probability Space (SEEPS, Rodwell et al., 2010). The computation of this score is however not straightforward because it requires information about the precipitation climatology at the verification locations. More generally, climate statistics are key to assessing forecasts for extreme precipitation and high-impact events. Here, we introduce SEEPS4ALL, a set of data and tools that democratize the use of climate statistics for verification purposes. In particular, verification results for daily precipitation are showcased with both deterministic and probabilistic forecasts.

Murray,GloPINE dataset: model-ready measurements of INP concentrations using PINE instruments,"Ice formation in sub-zero clouds is influenced by airborne particles called ice-nucleating particles (INPs), whose concentrations vary substantially over short time and spatial scales. To assess the role of INPs in our climate, a comprehensive and consistent global dataset is essential. Our GloPINE model-ready dataset is a major step in this direction, comprising 36,000 measurements made using a single instrument design (PINE) over 70,000 hours of operation at 20 northern hemisphere sites. 
 Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are a subset of aerosol particles that facilitate the freezing of supercooled cloud droplets heterogeneously and influence the radiative properties of supercooled clouds. The role of INPs in the Earth system remains unquantified in part due to poorly constrained representations of their spatial distributions and properties in global and regional models. In this study, we present a quality-controlled dataset, called GloPINE, comprising 70,000 hours of INP concentrations measured using Portable Ice Nucleation Experiment (PINE) instruments that use an expansion chamber to make automated long-term (months to years) and high temporal resolution (< 10 mins). We collate measurements from 20 recent ground-based PINE field campaigns in the Northern Hemisphere conducted between January 2018 and December 2023, totalling more than 400,000 expansions performed under conditions relevant for mixed-phase clouds. In the GloPINE dataset, we subset and average the PINE measurements across synoptically relevant time intervals of 6 h and 2 K temperature bins, providing 36,000 INP measurements. Combining PINE expansions over these intervals enhances counting statistics at higher freezing temperatures, decreases the lower limit of measurable INP concentrations, and provides an INP dataset readily applicable to model simulation data and meteorological reanalysis products. The frequency and duration of measurements combined with the lack of instrument or methodological variability provides a means to robustly evaluate and constrain global models on a scale that has not previously been possible."

We compiled and georeferenced 654 peat cores and documented the application of 26 palaeoecological proxies, including chronological, physical, chemical, and biological indicators, resulting in the creation of the Western Siberian Peat Core Database (WSPC). The database synthesizes information from 156 publications spanning 1953–2025 and captures both the temporal and methodological evolution of peatland studies in the region, highlighting a clear shift from early single-proxy, low resolution investigations to modern multi-proxy high-resolution studies. Spatial analysis reveals high peat core density along major rivers and in the Great Vasyugan Mire, while remote northern continuous permafrost regions remain underrepresented. Temporal coverage indicates that most cores capture Holocene peatland dynamics, with the longest records in non-permafrost and isolated permafrost zones, extending into the Late Glacial (~15,600 cal. yr BP). The database underscores the dominant role of fundamental physical and chemical proxies, while highlighting the selective application of biological proxies and the limited use of specialized chemical analyses. In addition, the study identifies key research challenges in Western Siberia, including narrow seasonal windows for fieldwork, permafrost, limited transport infrastructure, permit requirements, and geopolitical barriers, which collectively constrain peatland sampling. The WSPC database represents the most extensive compilation of peat-core-based palaeoecological data for this region, offering critical guidance for targeted sampling and future research to address spatial, temporal, and proxy-specific gaps in the study of Western Siberian peatlands."

The resulting 30-meter resolution map is rigorously validated and expands usable coastal data by nearly 150 %. This product provides an essential foundation for planning against sea-level rise and coastal erosion, offering a scalable blueprint for other countries worldwide. 
 Beaches provide essential ecological functions and support socio-economic resilience, yet accurate mapping is hindered by systematic limitations in global Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). A critical challenge remains in the intertidal zone, where frequent tidal inundation creates extensive data voids, disrupting the continuity of coastal topography. To bridge this fundamental data gap, we present NZ-BeachTopo30 which is a national-scale and full-coverage 30 m beach topography dataset for New Zealand constructed by fusing ICESat-2 photon-counting altimetry with Sentinel-2 multispectral time series. Using DeltaDTM as a high-precision baseline for the stable backshore, we trained an XGBoost model on ICESat-2 control points and Sentinel-2 spectral-geometric features to reconstruct the missing intertidal topography specifically. SHAP analysis was further employed to interpret the physical driving mechanisms of these predictors. Validation against airborne Lidar confirmed that the dataset accurately recovers elevations in previously void zones with an RMSE of 0.94 m. By integrating these predictions with the DeltaDTM baseline, the final national-scale product achieves robust accuracy with an R² of 0.75 and an RMSE of 1.17 m. This targeted integration significantly expanded valid topographic coverage by 145.8 % from 79.9 km² to 196.5 km². It delivers the first spatially continuous and full-coverage beach topography dataset for New Zealand. This product distinguishes itself by seamlessly bridging the critical intertidal gap that disconnects land and sea in existing global datasets. Given the global availability of ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2, NZ-BeachTopo30 offers a scalable solution for worldwide applications and provides a robust foundation for inundation modeling and coastal management."

We developed an automated method converting rock descriptions into stratigraphic interpretations by testing plausible sequences using regional maps. The approach quantifies uncertainty and correlates multiple drillholes. Testing on fifty-two South Australian drillholes successfully predicted correct sequences, unlocking legacy data value for geological surveys. 
 Australian commonwealth, state and territory geological surveys possess information on over 3 million drillhole logs. In addition to mineral exploration drilling, extensive drillhole datasets exist from oil and gas exploration and hydrogeological studies. Other countries no doubt have similar data holdings. Together these legacy drillhole datasets have the potential to significantly enhance constraints on regional 3D geological models and improve our understanding of subsurface architecture, but have limited use in their current form as many if not most drill logs lack stratigraphic information, containing only lithological descriptions.This study develops open-source codes and methodologies for stratigraphy recovery (determining the ordered sequence of stratigraphic units) from drillhole lithological data by introducing a search algorithm that systematically explores all  geologically plausible stratigraphic orderings for individual drillholes, combined with a solution correlation algorithm that compares the topological relationships of stratigraphic units across multiple drillholes to identify geologically consistent solutions and reduce uncertainty. The algorithms combine constraints from lithological descriptions with stratigraphic relationships automatically derived from regional maps. In addition, the method quantifies uncertainty by generating multiple plausible stratigraphic interpretations, providing critical insights for resource estimation, scenario analysis, and data acquisition strategies.The application of our method to a dataset of 52 drillholes from South Australia demonstrated its ability to make useful predictions of stratigraphic solutions and quantifying associated uncertainties. These results not only validate our approach but also highlight opportunities to refine current stratigraphic descriptions and provide a valuable new source for regional 3D geological modelling."

This allows us to capture the inherent uncertainty of wildfire dynamics. Our model produces ensembles of forecasts that reflect physically meaningful distributions of where fire might go next. 
 We propose a stochastic framework for wildfire spread prediction using deep generative diffusion models with ensemble sampling. In contrast to traditional deterministic approaches that struggle to capture the inherent uncertainty and variability of wildfire dynamics, our method generates probabilistic forecasts by sampling multiple plausible future scenarios conditioned on the same initial state. As a proof-of-concept, the model is trained on synthetic wildfire data generated by a probabilistic cellular automata simulator conditioned on canopy cover, vegetation density, and terrain slope for two real fires, namely the Chimney Fire in 2016 and the Ferguson Fire in 2018, both in California. To assess predictive performance and uncertainty representation under an identical neural network architecture, we compare a conventional supervised regression training paradigm against a conditional diffusion framework that employs ensemble sampling, and evaluate both approaches on independent ensemble test datasets. Across independent ensemble test sets, the diffusion surrogate consistently outperforms the deterministic baseline. It delivers lower errors in standard accuracy metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), exhibits higher spatial coherence as reflected by improved structural similarity index measure (SSIM) values, and generates samples of superior distributional quality according to the Fréchet inception distance (FID). Moreover, the diffusion-based model shows stronger probabilistic capability, as evidenced by higher scores in the hit rate (HR) metric, which we introduce as an uncertainty-aware verification measure. These results demonstrate that diffusion-based ensemble modelling provides a more flexible and effective approach for wildfire forecasting and, by capturing the distributional characteristics of future fire states, supports the generation of fire susceptibility maps that convey probabilistic risk information useful for assessment and operational planning in fire-prone environments."

Jones,Coastal-Cosmo-Model (CCMv1): a cosmogenic  nuclide model for rocky coastlines,"This paper presents a new modelling framework that reconstructs the history of rocky shores using cosmogenic nuclide data. The model can be applied to both eroding and stable coasts, and allows users to test how factors like cliff retreat, down-wearing and sea-level change have shaped coastal landscapes. It provides a flexible tool for exploring long-term coastal evolution across diverse environments. 
 Understanding the long-term evolution of rocky coasts requires models that can account for complex interactions between exposure, erosion and sea level, constrained by empirical observations. This paper introduces Coastal-Cosmo-Model version 1 (CCMv1), a modular forward modelling framework designed to reconstruct coastal histories from in situ cosmogenic nuclide concentrations. CCMv1 integrates community-standard production rate calculations and allows flexible inversion of platform histories using discrete erosion and exposure parameters. The model includes four sub-models – inheritance, zero erosion, down-wearing only, and cliff retreat with down-wearing – enabling users to test hypotheses of increasing complexity. Crucially, CCMv1 can be applied to both eroding and non-eroding coastlines, offering a means to investigate the dominant controls on rocky shore histories for different settings. A demonstration using a published dataset from shore platform shows that CCMv1 effectively reproduces measured nuclide concentrations and supports a history of Holocene cliff retreat. CCMv1 provides an adaptable and hypothesis-driven framework for exploring rocky shore histories, with potential for future development to incorporate probabilistic optimisation and additional nuclide systems, and implementation for testing complex (multi-stage) erosion histories or relative sea-level histories."

We developed an Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) network-based framework to interpret concentration-dependent transcriptomics in zebrafish embryos in relation to behavioral outcomes. An annotation of key events (KEs) to zebrafish molecular pathways was curated to enable mapping of zebrafish transcriptomics to the AOP network. Concentration-dependent transcriptomics of 24 environmental chemicals identified concentration-responsive KEs (CRKEs) that differentiated neurotoxic from non-neurotoxic compounds. Transcriptomic points of departure (tPOD) were significantly correlated with behavioral apical POD (aPOD) (R2 = 0.539, P < 0.01), indicating the potential for predicting tPOD from transcriptomics. Time- and concentration-dependent transcriptomics of five model chemicals identified 12 time-responsive KEs (TRKEs) across four developmental stages. Partial least-squares regression integrating neurotoxicity-relevant CRKEs and TRKEs showed the best performance to estimate aPOD (slope = 0.70, R2 = 0.64, RMSE = 0.9, P = 1.30 × 10–5). External validation using published fish transcriptomics data showed that estimated aPOD values from 8 of 14 chemicals were within 1 order of magnitude of measured aPOD. The findings support AOP network-guided omics analysis as a promising approach for quantitative neurotoxicity assessment, contributing to the use of omics into new approach methodologies (NAMs)."

Yet, remediation strategies are designed often subjectively, without the guidance of formal optimization methods. Here, we propose a nonsubjective, pragmatic framework that integrates a reactive transport model (RTM) with a multiobjective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) algorithm to address this issue. An antimony (Sb)-polluted site was chosen as an illustrative example, and physicochemical treatment and bioremediation techniques were considered. The RTM simulation simulated the fate of Sb, which was validated against site observations. Then, RTM and MOPSO were combined for optimization of four interrelated objectives, including minimizing (1) [Sb]aq within the site, (2) off-site migration, (3) treatment cost, and (4) time. [Sb]aq mitigation was shown to require strategic coordination between efficient but capital-intensive physicochemical intervention on high-risk hotspots and economical but slow bioremediation on low-risk zones, whereas outflux could be curbed by targeting hotspots without overusing resources. Compared with a traditional scalarization approach, our true multiobjective optimization prevented crowded solution distributions and produced a more diverse Pareto front that could best achieve all or selective objectives. This RTM-MOPSO framework is broadly applicable to identifying solutions for heavy metal pollution and navigating the interplay between technical and practical factors."

To address this gap, we developed a mechanistically informed hierarchical framework that quantitatively predicts estrogenic, androgenic, and thyroid (EAT)-disruption activities. The framework consists of three key components: data refinement, fragment-based mechanistic clustering, and cluster-specific quantitative modeling. First, we eliminated 20.12% of false positives and 41.54% of false negatives through a five-step curation, resulting in a high-confidence data set for model development. Next, the predictive model couples a classifier that assigns EAT activity modes with an ensemble regressor for potency estimation. Compared to conventional models, Modeling based on high-confidence data sets and mechanism classification demonstrates improved performance (R2 = 0.72–0.78, RMSE = 0.22–0.48 log10(μM)). Mechanistic insights from molecular simulations across EAT receptors revealed that potent agonists feature aromatic cores with polar substituents, stabilizing hydrogen-bond networks and promoting helix 12 (H12) activation. In contrast, potent antagonists exhibit flexible chains or rigid polycyclic scaffolds that disrupt H12 orientation. Altogether, we offer a next-generation strategy for interpretable and accurate endocrine potency prediction."

However, traditional SDIE systems face a trade-off between evaporation performance and salt resistance. Herein, we demonstrate that a novel functional group-mediated and nanoconfinement-engineered hydrogel composed of MXene and ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) effectively regulates both evaporation performance and salt resistance. The iCOFs with a high density of hydrophilic functional groups and nanoconfinement effect are found to simultaneously induce the disruption of hydrogen bonding networks and enhance cluster evaporation, achieving reduced evaporation enthalpy. The increased functional groups also facilitate both ion reverse diffusion and the Donnan effect, which effectively alleviates salt crystallization during long-term seawater desalination. This strategy leads to a 56% enhancement in evaporation rate (2.91 kg m–2 h–1 under 1 sun) of the optimized hydrogel. The evaporation performance remains stable in highly concentrated (20 wt %) saline and also during a 60 h continuous operation in seawater. In addition, functional group-mediated MXene/iCOFs hydrogels with a nanoconfinement effect exhibit a 99.99% removal rate for various water pollutants, including heavy metal ions, antibiotics, and dyes, while maintaining stable performance under extreme temperature conditions. This study offers a new strategy for designing programmable SDIE for  future sustainable water treatment technology."

In this study, we developed a rapid, in situ, and noninvasive membrane imaging platform based on the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) technique to probe the evolution of fouling in the reverse osmosis (RO) process. This technique can be used to monitor the formation of the concentration polarization (CP) and the fouling layer without labeling. Our data demonstrate that CP reaches equilibrium within minutes of filtration initiation, whereas fouling is the primary cause of the continuous flux decline during filtration. We further show that the salt concentration is a critical factor influencing the extent of CP and scaling processes, while the presence of organic matter accelerates membrane fouling. This study also clarifies the correlation between the membrane surface impedance variation and flux decline during filtration. Leveraging impedance time-series data, a machine learning-based random forest model was developed for flux change prediction."

While HCO is often proposed as a promising approach for treating real wastewaters, our results reveal that its benefits over ozonation are very case-specific. Wastewaters rich in fulvic/humic-like, surface-active organic compounds, such as membrane concentrate, respond favorably to HCO, showing improved ozone utilization compared to the pure ozonation process. In contrast, coking wastewater shows minimal improvement with HCO compared to pure ozonation, indicating a limited catalytic benefit in such matrices. Similarly, alkaline electroplating wastewaters rich in ozone reactive compounds showed no improvement in organic removal by HCO compared to that of pure ozonation. In contrast, acidic Fenton-treated chemical wastewaters showed significant improvement in organic removal by HCO compared to pure ozonation due to limited hydroxyl radical (HO•) generation via ozone self-decay under these conditions. Overall, our findings suggest that the inherent reactivity of ozone and sustained HO• generation on ozone decay, particularly under alkaline conditions that are typical of many wastewaters, diminish the added value of the catalyst."

Although bulk measurements routinely show sharp PM2.5 spikes during Diwali, direct microscopic evidence linking specific aerosol types to these concurrent sources remains limited. Here, we combined transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with bulk chemical analysis to identify particle types and track their physicochemical evolution throughout the Diwali period. Before Diwali, aerosols were dominated by potassium (K)-rich particles (25%), carbonaceous particles (primary organic aerosol (POA) and soot, 29%), and their internal mixtures (K–POA/soot, 37%), with frequent spherical POA (i.e., tar balls), indicating a strong biomass-burning influence. During Diwali, particle populations shifted abruptly to a pyrotechnic signature of fireworks, characterized by abundant Al2O3 monomers (30–300 nm) and their agglomerates, either as bare (36–40%) or uniformly coated by K2SO4 (Al2O3–K, 46–47%). After Diwali, ultrafine Al2O3 particles (<100 nm) persisted and underwent coagulation with aged biomass-burning particles, forming distinctive Al2O3–K–POA/soot internal mixtures. Therefore, Al2O3 nanoparticles can serve as a tracer of fireworks and were further internally mixed with carbonaceous particles derived from biomass burning during severe haze events of Diwali. These metal-containing particles warrant particular attention because of their potential toxicity and adverse respiratory health effects in the densely populated megacity."

However, existing research has paid limited attention to the toxic effects of DXM and its metabolite, DXO, on fish. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to DXM and DXO at concentrations ranging from 100 to 10,000 ng/L for 72 hours post-fertilization (hpf) to evaluate their impacts on cardiac function and elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms using network toxicology and molecular dynamics approaches. Bradycardia was observed at 48 hpf. By 72 hpf, key cardiac morphometric and functional indices, as well as blood flow, exhibited concentration-dependent suppression after exposure to DXM and DXO. Network toxicology analysis revealed that the beta2-adrenergic receptor (adrb2a) was the key common target in cardiomyocyte adrenergic signaling for both compounds. Further observations included significant downregulation of adrb2a, decreased levels of beta2-adrenergic receptor and protein kinase A proteins, and phenotypic rescue after coexposure to adrenaline. The binding energies of DXM and DXO to the beta2-adrenergic receptor were −23.45 and −25.76 kcal/mol, respectively. These findings confirmed that DXM and DXO impaired cardiomyocyte function via suppression of beta2-adrenergic receptor expression, leading to bradycardia. It is worth noting that DXO exhibited stronger cardiac toxicity than its parent compound DXM, and its ecological toxicity warrants special attention and further evaluation."

However, mechanisms governing the dynamic MP–biofilm interactions remain underexplored. A 60-day in situ sediment incubation, coupled with continuous monitoring of MP physicochemical properties and microbial community characteristics, was conducted to elucidate the interactions between biofilms and MPs with different polymer types (poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polypropylene (PP), and poly(vinyl chloride) (PVC)) and preaging experiences. In the early stage, biofilm development was promoted by oxygen-containing functional groups (OFGs) of MPs, whereas the additive release from PVC suppressed microbial enrichment. Eventually, both the biofilm biomass and extracellular polymeric substances depended strongly on polymer types. Over time, biofilms progressively modified MP surface chemistry, increasing the O/C ratios of PVC, PET, and PP by 0.41, 0.26, and 0.11, respectively, by producing extracellular proteins, especially plastic-degrading enzymes. Therefore, a temporal feedback loop formed in which MP-derived OFGs acted as nutrient sources, reshaping the microbial community structure and selectively enriching plastic-degrading taxa and enzymes, which in turn accelerated MP degradation. This study provides novel insights into the dynamic reciprocal interactions between MP surface chemistry and biofilm communities and advances our understanding of the mechanisms controlling the ecotoxicity and fate of MPs in river sediments."

However, predicting the impact of emission reductions on tropospheric chemistry remains challenging, as NOx influences oxidant concentrations and aerosol formation. Stable oxygen isotopes (Δ17O and δ18O) of atmospheric nitrate (pNO3) serve as powerful observational constraints for the understanding of oxidation processes. Here, we quantified Δ17O and δ18O in pNO3 from a unique 10-year aerosol record in the northeastern US to constrain chemistry changes over a time of large reductions in NOx (2005–2015). We observed a significant decreasing trend in δ18O(pNO3) (−0.32‰yr–1), which reflects a shift in oxidation chemistry driven by emission reductions. Air quality modeling indicated that the decrease in δ18O(pNO3) between 2005 and 2015 was primarily driven by enhanced nighttime NO oxidation by ozone, with a relative reduction in N2O5 hydrolysis and increased NO2 + OH, leading to more efficient nitrate formation in the recent past. This explains the continued elevated wintertime nitrate that plagues air quality in the eastern US despite significant NOx decreases. The isotopic constraint on oxidizing chemistry greatly enhances our ability to test and predict the effectiveness of emissions reductions on oxidation chemistry."

However, the long-term global patterns of soil HONO emissions and their contributions to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its key components remain poorly understood.

Our model demonstrated robust performance in estimating global soil HONO emissions (R2 = 0.91). The results revealed that global warming and increased fertilizer use have driven a substantial rise in soil HONO emissions, escalating from 2.2 Tg of N in 1901 to 4.7 Tg of N in 2015. Then, the GEOS-Chem model simulations suggested that the contribution of soil HONO emission to the global average concentrations of PM2.5, sulfate (SO42–), nitrate (NO3–), ammonium (NH4+), black carbon (BC), and organic aerosol (OA) reached 0.015 (0.3% (range: 0–6%) accounting for all-source concentration), 0.003 (0.6% (0–7%)), 0.008 (3.4% (0–52%)), 0.002 (1% (0–26%)), ∼0, and 0.002 (0.6% (0–4%)) μg/m3 in 2015, respectively.

First, we propose a temperature-saturation dependent capillary pressure (TSPC) model to quantify the impact of temperature variations on caprock capillary sealing capacity. Subsequently, the TSPC model is integrated into our in-house numerical reservoir simulator to quantitatively assess CO2 leakage for a field-scale CPG operation. Simulation results show that temperature reduction during CPG operation decreases capillary pressure by 45%–87%, which substantially undermines the ability of the caprock to prevent CO2 upward breakthrough. The decline in capillary pressure weakens the sealing capacity and leads to nearly 50,000 tons of CO2 leakage in a representative CPG reservoir simulation. The above results demonstrate a previously unrecognized CO2 leakage mechanism in CPG systems caused by cooling-induced wettability alteration. In addition, we propose practical mitigation strategies to address this leakage risk and enhance the long-term security of CO2 sequestration after CPG operations."

A prevailing assumption is that these reagents selectively target radicals without interacting with triplet excited-state contaminants generated under UV irradiation. Here, we challenge this assumption by demonstrating that triplet-state contaminants can directly interact with commonly used probes and scavengers, revealing an overlooked transformation pathway that biases radical identification and mechanistic interpretation. Using naproxen as a model compound, we show that seven representative reagents (isopropanol, p-benzoquinone, furfuryl alcohol, tert-butanol, methanol, ethanol, and HCO3–) efficiently quench triplet-state naproxen, with bimolecular rate constants ranging from 1.0 × 106 to 7.1 × 108 M–1 s–1. The quenching process followed saturation kinetics and can be well described by the Hanes–Woolf model. Transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations reveal feasible electron transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer pathways. Further, in a UV/H2O2 system, we found that isopropanol promotes naproxen degradation with triplet-state interactions, leading to significant underestimation of •OH contribution. These results highlight a critical interference pathway in AOPs  and underscore the need for caution when using probes and scavengers for kinetic and mechanistic evaluations."

Simpson,Three Decades of Litter Manipulation Distinctly Shifts Soil Organic Matter Composition and Constrains Soil Carbon Sequestration in Temperate Forest Soils,"The capacity of forest soils to sequester carbon (C) is susceptible to shifts in the litter quantity and chemistry. Using measurements from the third decade of a long-term Detrital Input and Removal Treatment (DIRT) experiment at Harvard Forest (MA, USA), extending previously published work from 20 years, we examined how litter inputs shape soil organic matter (SOM) chemistry. Elemental analysis, targeted compound analysis, solid-state 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, and microbial biomass and community composition measurements were used. Despite doubled litter inputs over 30 years, no net soil C accumulation occurred, and the SOM decomposition stage was similar to the control, suggesting continuous microbial processing of added inputs. The exclusion of litter, roots, or both led to lower soil C and more advanced SOM decomposition in mineral soils. Shifts in microbial community composition, particularly an increase in Gram (+) to Gram (−) bacteria under exclusion treatments, point to microbial reorganization in response to altered substrate availability. This long-term study underscores the limited potential for long-term soil C sequestration due to sustained microbial decomposition and the role of continuous plant inputs in shaping SOM chemisty  under changing detrital regimes in a temperate forest."

Targeted approaches with LC-HRMS/MS often cover less than 30% of PFAS across various matrices and hence  nontargeted strategies are necessary to enhance identification coverage. We expanded FluoroMatch Suite, a nontargeted PFAS data-processing software, to leverage full-scan (MS1) data for highly accurate formula prediction and Kaufmann analysis. Software features include Kaufmann analysis with isoline cutoffs determined using kernel density based on an EPA PFAS data set and an 11-step formula prediction algorithm. Application of the FluoroMatch Suite with the MS1 extension to AFFF contaminated soil revealed 179 PFAS-confirmed features. Kauffman 95% isoline cutoffs captured 94% of the confirmed PFAS and removed 96% of features assigned as likely non-PFAS. The PFAS-formula prediction introduced in this manuscript had a false positive rate of 26% and a false negative rate (no predicted formula) of 30%. Using a novel homologous series voting algorithm, where the predominant subclass from formula prediction were used to predict all formulas for the homologous series, we achieved a 0% false positive rate and 6% false negative rate in formula prediction. The novel nontargeted algorithms developed in this study proved to be highly accurate and by leveraging MS1 data enhances the capacity to identify unknown PFAS in complex environmental matrices."

In this study, six urinary OP metabolites and four oxidative stress biomarkers (OSBs) were quantified in a cohort of urban Chinese adults. Dimethylthiophosphate (DMTP), diethyl phosphate (DEP), and dimethyl phosphate were detected in nearly all individuals, with DMTP exhibiting the highest mean concentration (6.18 ng/mL). Multivariate analysis identified pork and poultry as primary dietary contributors, collectively explaining over 36% of variability in urinary OP metabolites, while processed food intake was positively associated with dimethyldithiophosphate (DMDTP) and diethyldithiophosphate, consistent with OP residues, preformed dialkyl phosphates (DAPs), and organophosphate esters in packaged products. Reverse dosimetry of urinary DAPs indicated that phorate and dimethoate were major contributors to estimated daily intake, with hazard quotients exceeding 1 in certain individuals. Multiple mixture models revealed significant inverse and nonlinear associations between OP mixtures and OSBs, particularly 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine and o,o′-dityrosine, suggesting a potential low-dose hormetic response and adaptive oxidative stress mechanisms. DMDTP and DEP emerged as key drivers across the models. Collectively, these findings provide integrative evidence linking specific dietary OP sources to systemic oxidative stress in nonoccupational populations, highlighting complex exposure–response dynamics and the need for targeted dietary risk management and biomonitoring."

To fill this gap, we compiled 2769 records of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) spanning two decades and conducted a meta-analysis. The analysis systematically evaluated BAF–BCF disparities and their patterns, identified key drivers, and explored integrating them into species sensitivity distribution (SSD) models to refine WQC. Results showed that BCF were consistently lower than BAF for most PFAS, with disparities increasing with carbon chain length and octanol–water partition coefficient. Further analysis indicated that exposure concentration and trophic level were primary drivers, with concentration effects dominated by endowment effects and trophic effects by coefficient effects. Endowment effects were fixed within a mixed-effects model, and a trophic level–specific BAF/BCF ratio driven by coefficient effects was constructed. This ratio was then incorporated into the SSD framework to refine WQC, resulting in 2.5-fold and 3.2–4.4-fold reductions for PFOA and PFOS, respectively. This study provides the first systematic assessment of PFAS BAF–BCF disparities and integrates them into SSD-based WQC derivation, offering a practical pathway toward more accurate and ecologically relevant WQC for bioaccumulative contaminants."

An Assessment of Dynamic Climate Change Impacts,"Chinese waste incinerators have substantial excess capacity, and it has been suggested that waste from landfills be excavated to increase the energy recovery by using vacant incineration capacity. By means of life cycle assessment (LCA), we assess this suggestion in terms of its climate change impacts. Given the temporal properties of the issue, we used a dynamic LCA approach by specifying emissions and energy recovery for each year over a 100-year period. We then quantified climate change in terms of radiative forcing (W/m2) for each year, in contrast to a traditional LCA approach summarizing emissions and energy recovery over a 100-year period in terms of kg CO2-equivalents. We considered several waste compositions and a range of ages of  landfilled waste. The results of dynamic LCA revealed that for a time horizon of 10–50 years, excavation and incineration of landfilled waste is beneficial only  for reducing the cumulative radiative forcing if the waste is only 2–3 years old. Waste older than 4 years old should, in all cases, remain in the landfill from a climate change point of view. The traditional LCA approach revealed its shortcomings compared with the dynamic LCA approach. Considering technologies with time-distributed emissions and energy recoveries, we warn against indiscriminate use of the traditional approach when decisions are supposed to contribute to reducing climate change impacts to meet political targets set for the next few decades."

This study investigated the effects of NO (0, 50, 100 ppm) in simulated flue gas (15% CO2) on Chlorella sp., examining intracellular/extracellular NO dynamics, antioxidant response, key enzyme activity (nitrate reductase), and growth-photosynthesis coupling. Under optimized aeration (25 mL min–1, 3 h), 50 ppm of NO optimally elevated intracellular (0.62–1.30 nmol L–1) and extracellular (2.56–3.90 nmol L–1) NO levels, mitigating oxidative stress while stimulating nitrate reductase activity. This concentration maximally promoted cell proliferation (152.7% increase in algal density) and photosynthetic quantum yield (9.7% higher Fv/Fm). Consequently, the CO2 removal rate increased by approximately 43%, coupled with a NO removal efficiency of 33.1%. These findings suggest that, under controlled experimental conditions that exclude SO2 and other components of real flue gas, moderate supplementation of NO can enhance microalgal carbon fixation and reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by improving photosynthetic efficiency and biomass accumulation. This presents a promising strategy for integrated flue gas bioremediation."

Although groundwater flow has been shown to influence bacterial chemotaxis, its quantitative influence on intrinsic motility parameters governing chemotactic strategies remains unresolved. Using a T-shaped microfluidic device, mimicking a NAPL droplet trapped within a pore throat, we show that chemotactic bacteria exhibited greater retention near the NAPL interface at low fluid velocities (0.5 m/d and 1 m/d; corresponding wall shear rates of 0.58 and 1.16 s–1, respectively), while both population density and accumulating area declined at higher velocities. Continuum-level simulations of bacterial transport indicated a reduction in the chemotactic sensitivity coefficient χo by an order of magnitude at flow velocities above 5 m/d (5.78 s–1). Trajectory analysis of bacteria from videomicroscopy revealed increasing alignment of bacterial motion with the flow direction as the fluid velocity increased. We conducted agent-based model simulations to further demonstrate that flow-induced suppression of reversal frequency reduced chemotactic efficiency in Pseudomonas putida. This work demonstrated a framework that integrates experimental and modeling approaches at both population and individual scales to investigate mechanisms underlying bacterial transport phenomena."

Cardiotoxicity caused by DLCs has been well-characterized within the framework of an adverse outcome pathway, demonstrating consistent aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) activation as the molecular initiating event. However, the downstream key events (KEs) contributing to PHCZ-induced cardiotoxicity have been less characterized. Herein, PHCZ-induced cardiotoxicity was evaluated by in vivo (Sprague–Dawley rats) and in vitro (rat cardiomyocytes) models, and the underlying mechanisms were confirmed using rat cardiomyocytes (H9c2 cells). As a model PHCZ, 2,7-dibromocarbazole (2,7-DBCZ) induced significant rat cardiac tissue apoptosis following exposure to 100 μg/kg/d via intragastric infusion. In addition, 2,7-DBCZ also induced apoptosis and suppressed the mitochondrial membrane potential in H9c2 cells (at 10–5 M). CD40LG promotes apoptosis and inhibits cell growth through the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/protein kinase B (Akt) signaling pathway, and ANXA5 plays a vital role in apoptosis by possessing Ca2+ channel activity. Apoptosis-focused PCR array and Ingenuity Pathway Analysis further indicated CD40LG and ANXA5 as upstream regulators for 2,7-DBCZ-induced apoptosis. 2,7-DBCZ increased Akt phosphorylation and intercellular Ca2+ levels, which were reversed by pretreatment with an Akt agonist and a Ca2+ inhibitor. Silencing of Ppp2ca further confirmed Ca2+ as a key intercellular messenger in regulating induced apoptosis. Finally, rat cardiac tissue and H9c2 cell gene profiles and AhR antagonist cotreatment demonstrated that CD40LG and ANXA5 are potential downstream KEs in regulating 2,7-DBCZ-induced cardiotoxicity, as they exhibited the same transcription patterns with the AhR activation indicators CYP1A1 and CYP1B1. These findings offer crucial new insight into the mechanisms underlying PHCZ-induced cardiotoxicity, providing valuable mode of action data that can be used in the Weight of Evidence components of risk assessments and regulation decisions regarding these emerging contaminants."

This study directly addresses the resulting uncertainties in UAV flight measurements by employing the fire dynamics simulation (FDS) in large eddy simulation (LES) mode, leveraging mean wind data derived from LiDAR data sets. The FDS model was validated with in situ CH4 concentration data collected by uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) during controlled release experiments. Our analysis of 10 extensively sampled plumes shows that FDS accurately reproduces the magnitude and spatiotemporal variations of the observed plumes for sufficiently large pipes (diameter >0.6 cm). We found that factors such as gas exit velocity, obstacles, and terrain topography significantly affect the near-field dynamics of the plumes. To a lesser extent, the temperature of the gas influences plume behavior at higher mass flow rates. We highlight the added value of high-resolution LES modeling to understand CH4 plume dynamics captured by various sensors, aiming to improve current emission quantification methods."

By integrating a two-year continuous field open-top chamber (OTC) and greenhouse experiments with stable isotope analysis, we elucidated the biogeochemistry of dry and wet atmospheric Cd deposition in agroecosystems. Newly deposited Cd undergoes rapid aging in soils, with its bioavailability being dependent on deposition type. The isotopic signature of soil bioavailable Cd is primarily governed by dry deposition, a pattern mirrored in crop edible parts regardless of deposition type for both root and foliar exposure pathways, indicating that the isotopic characteristics of bioavailable Cd in wet and dry deposition are congruent with its mitigation in the environment. Applying an isotope mixing model optimized with greenhouse-derived fractionation factors, we quantified that atmospheric deposition contributed 29–65% to the soil bioavailable Cd pool. Foliar uptake of atmospheric Cd contributed over 50% to rice grains and pak choi shoots, exceeding the root uptake of soil legacy Cd.

However, their effects on particle scattering have not been reported yet. This study pioneers the investigation of electron, proton, and oxygen atomic ion scattering induced by local MS waves through quasi‐linear diffusion theory. The kinetic dispersion relations of local MS waves have been applied to compute diffusion coefficients. The results demonstrate that local MS waves can efficiently scatter suprathermal electrons via Landau resonance, especially for thermal electrons propagating at large pitch angles. For ion scattering, hot protons with small pitch angles undergo effective scattering through cyclotron resonance, while oxygen atomic ions at tens of eVs are scattered through high‐order cyclotron resonance. These findings reveal the potential role played by local MS waves in the evolution of Martian ionosphere."

Here, we conduct RCE simulations coupled to 2‐ and 20‐m slab ocean models in a 3D channel domain to assess the influence of interactive sea surface temperatures (SST) on self‐aggregation. Our results support previous findings that simulations coupled to shallower slab oceans experience delayed self‐aggregation onset compared to simulations coupled to deeper slab oceans. More notably, we find distinct aggregated states in the simulations. The 20‐m simulation reaches a relatively unchanging state after day 60, whereas the 2‐m simulation continuously evolves. Low cloud‐SST feedbacks drive initial increased variability in the 2‐m simulation by spurring the expansion of a dominant dry region. Later, SST gradients arising from differential shortwave heating within the dry region promote low‐level moistening and convective initiation. These findings are useful for understanding ocean feedbacks to real‐world convection under weak large‐scale forcing."

Seismic attenuation imaging is a tool that can shed light on this question. Here we present the first map of teleseismic P‐wave attenuation across Northeast China. Three hundred eighty‐two teleseismic direct‐P phases are analyzed using a time‐domain waveform matching method and a 2‐D relative attenuation map is inverted by applying a Hierarchical Bayesian method. Strong attenuation is observed beneath Jingpohu volcano. The estimated asthenospheric Qp is abnormally low (Qp < 70), indicating a high‐temperature (∼1500°C) asthenosphere containing plausible partial melting (>4%) underneath Jingpohu volcano, presumably induced by hot mantle upwelling. Meanwhile, the hot asthenosphere could induce the melting of the bottom of the lithospheric mantle, and we infer that this lithospheric melting combined with the ascending asthenospheric melt may feed the Jingpohu volcanism, explaining the mixed‐source geochemical signature."

Brodsky,The Role of Normal Stress and Shear Stress Heterogeneity in the Inferred Depth‐Independence of Stress Drop,"Earthquake stress drops are inferred to be independent of source depth, contradicting linear scaling predictions for earthquakes as frictional stick‐slip instabilities that assume increasing fault normal stress due to overburden. Here, we examine the scaling between averaged stress drops and increasing normal stress for simulated earthquake sequences in continuum rate‐and‐state fault models. The models produce a weaker dependence of stress drop on normal stress than the linearity of simple friction, which can be well‐fit by a sublinear power‐law. This result is more prominent when the fault dimension is much larger than nucleation scales. In such cases, the averaged behavior of ruptures is dominated by rupture propagation conditions, reflecting more heterogeneous shear stress conditions. As natural faults can be considerably larger than the smallest earthquakes they host, such a weaker scaling between averaged rupture conditions and normal stress may partially explain the lack of an inferred depth‐dependence of earthquake stress drops."

However, previous studies assumed a flat aquifer base, and it is unclear how a sloping aquifer base would affect the subsurface flow and salinity distributions. In reality, the bases of many coastal aquifers are inclined toward either the sea or the inland. This study presents numerical simulations that examine the subsurface hydrodynamics in sloping unconfined coastal aquifers. The results show that, when the aquifer base is seaward sloping, the salt‐freshwater mixing zone is wider and the seawater intrusion distance is longer. Also, a seaward base slope reduces/increases the percentagewise contribution of tide‐/density‐driven recirculation to the total submarine groundwater discharge (SGD), extends the transport pathway and transit times of particles. While a landward aquifer base reverses these trends. These findings may assist more accurate estimation of total SGD and strategies for mitigating marine contamination."

Set by inherent α‐recoil processes, uranium comminution ages do not rely on environmental conditions (e.g., lithology and soil thickness) that present challenges to conventional tools such as 10Be.

This is partially due to their inability to resolve convection, a consequence of their relatively coarse spatial resolution. Via analysis of output from an offline dust emission scheme forced with output from a global storm‐resolving model, we show that resolving convection doubles the contribution of the Sahel, an important dust source region sensitive to environmental change, to global dust emissions from 6.1% to 12.3% during its late monsoon season. Resolving convection induces an increase in friction velocity and a decrease in soil moisture, and thus enhances Sahelian dust emissions. These changes are due to improved representation of mesoscale convective systems associated with African Easterly Waves. These results demonstrate that high‐resolution modeling with resolved convection can improve understanding of the global dust cycle and how dust emissions are affected by a changing climate."

As microseismic energy propagates inland, crustal heterogeneities—such as Moho topography, surface relief, and variations in crustal velocities—facilitate the construction of SmS signals by altering the incident angles of the wavefields.

Two key processes control the heat transport: baroclinic instability driven by surface buoyancy contrasts and convective instability driven by heating from the core. However, global ocean simulations cannot accurately resolve convection under realistic icy moon conditions and instead often use Earth‐based convective parameterizations, which capture only vertical convective mixing and cannot represent rotation‐aligned slantwise convection on icy moons. We use high‐resolution convection‐resolving simulations to investigate ocean heat transport by slantwise convection in a parameter regime relevant to icy moons, isolated from baroclinic instability. Total heat transport follows the Coriolis–Inertial–Archimedean scaling with an added latitude dependence. The vertical transport increases with latitude, and the meridional transport is poleward. These results indicate that slantwise convection redistributes heat toward the poles, favoring a poleward‐thinning ice shell, qualitatively consistent with Enceladus's observed ice thickness distribution."

Terrestrial time‐lapse gravimetry (TLG) is a geophysical and geodetic technique whose measured variable (g $g$) varies directly with groundwater storage changes (GWSC). TLG is thus well suited to applications in alpine environments, which often lack subsurface monitoring infrastructure. Here, we use TLG to measure GWSC in an alpine headwater catchment over snow‐free and snow accumulation/melt periods. We compare absolute‐referenced Δg ${\Delta }g$ measurements with locally referenced (relative) ones and investigate the advantages of mobile surveys using the most recent generation of relative gravimeters.

We find that forced precipitation trends are generally consistent across models, while atmospheric internal variability significantly influences regional patterns. Additionally, a few model members can reasonably well reproduce the observed pattern of precipitation trends. We highlight some regional wetting and drying are likely driven by forcings rather than the atmospheric internal variability. Zonal‐mean trends over land reveal a “wet gets wetter, dry gets drier” paradigm in the Northern Hemisphere, while the Southern Hemisphere shows drying near 45°S associated with jet stream shifts.

However, existing understanding of this process remains limited. For example, most current deposition models assume complete deposition or describe the collection process through empirical models, making it difficult to accurately predict the concentration distribution of dust particles within the near‐surface collection layer. In this study, the effects of turbulence around obstacles are considered to improve an existing numerical model for simulating aerosol particle deposition in rough surface environments. The modified numerical model is validated through wind tunnel experiments. Subsequently, the particle collection process on an isolated cylindrical obstacle placed on the ground is investigated using numerical simulations. The effects of different wind conditions, particle properties, and obstacle sizes on the collection process are analyzed. Finally, a fitted relationship between the Stokes number and collection efficiency is proposed. The results show that inertial impaction and interception jointly dominate particle deposition on the windward side of the isolated obstacle, while turbulence‐induced impaction governs deposition on the leeward side. Therefore, parameters that affect particle inertia and the turbulent flow around the obstacle have a more significant impact on the particle deposition process. The simulation results agree well with existing experimental data and exhibit lower data dispersion, demonstrating that the numerical model developed in this study can effectively describe the collection of particles by near‐surface obstacles. This provides a solid basis for improving atmospheric particle deposition models."

Previous studies have revealed systematic discrepancies between two widely used global transport models, GEOS‐Chem and TM5, in simulated CO2 distributions at mid‐latitudes. However, the causes of these discrepancies and potential transport biases in the models remain unclear without constraints of intensive measurements. Here, we drive GEOS‐Chem and TM5 with identical surface CO2 fluxes and perform simulations with and without parameterized convection. By comparing the simulated spatial‐temporal distributions of [CO2] to intensive aircraft and tower measurements collected by the Atmospheric Carbon Transport (ACT)‐America project and NOAA's airborne profiling and tower networks across four seasons, we identify potential transport biases in both models over North America. Model discrepancies in vertical transport produce seasonal‐mean planetary boundary layer (PBL)–free‐troposphere [CO2] differences of up to ∼4 ppm and PBL height differences of ∼100–400 m. In summer, GEOS‐Chem underestimates transport through moist convection but overestimates PBL mixing depth, whereas TM5 exhibits more realistic total vertical mixing (moist convection and PBL depth). In spring and winter, TM5 underestimates PBL mixing while potentially overestimating mixing through moist convection, whereas GEOS‐Chem more accurately represents vertical mixing. These transport biases are likely to contribute to discrepancies in the meridional gradient of zonal‐mean [CO2] and propagate into differences in posterior flux estimates from the OCO‐2 Model Intercomparison Project inversions using the two transport models over North America. Expanded vertically resolved [CO2] measurements beyond North America can further advance the current understanding of transport uncertainties at larger spatial scales."

The Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) and El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) govern regional droughts, floods, and heat waves. While IOD and ENSO typically synchronize (e.g., positive IOD with El Niño), several positive IODs (pIODs) occur independently or even cooccur with La Niña—events that defy conventional modes and trigger mismatches in forecasts. Current theories predominantly attribute this phase mismatch phenomenon to internal forcing within the Indian Ocean, lacking robust identification of external forcing mechanisms—a critical gap that undermines the reliability of predictive frameworks. Here, we show that active western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclones (TCs) induce maritime continent subsidence, triggering anomalous easterly winds and sea surface cooling in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean, thus generating independent pIODs. Our findings identify a critical external forcing mechanism for the ENSO‐IOD phase discrepancy, filling a pivotal knowledge gap in current theoretical frameworks.

Reflectance transects through clouds are compared between Inner Mongolia and Tropical Ocean. The reflectance shows varying degrees of shadowing–illumination effects, depending on transect direction. Perpendicular to the solar azimuth (cross‐sun direction), where shadowing–illumination effects are minimal, the reflectance follows a symmetric, bell‐shaped decrease from the cloud center to the cloud edge and into the transition zone or radiative halo. The peak reflectance is located slightly off‐center for larger clouds, which can be explained by the competition between radiative smoothing and sharpening. Reflectance steadily increases with cloud size in both regions; however, Inner Mongolia clouds are significantly brighter and have larger cloud top height variations for the same chord length (cloud diameter). The size and height of continental clouds also systematically increase with surface temperature, indicating more vigorous convection over warm, dry land characterized by high Bowen ratio. In the halo region, reflectance increases by 20%–25% above its clear‐sky value within one chord length of the cloud edge, the brightness enhancement showing little variation with cloud size. The chord‐length normalized size of the halo steadily decreases with cloud size, as the absolute halo size does not scale linearly with cloud size. This observation, consistent with large‐eddy simulations of the moist buffer around shallow cumulus, suggests that the processes responsible for halo formation have size‐independent length scales."

Part II: Assessment of PBL Height Data,"This sequel study continues to develop a strategic framework for the global Planetary Boundary Layer Height (PBLH) analysis and monitoring using the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Goddard Earth Observing System (GEOS) data assimilation (DA) system. The framework supports the assessment of PBLH from multiple observing systems, including radiosonde, Global Navigation Satellite System‐Radio Occultation (GNSS‐RO), spaceborne lidars: Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) and Cloud‐Aerosol Transport System (CATS), ground‐based lidar: NASA Micro‐Pulse Lidar Network (MPLNET), and ground‐based radar: networks of radar wind profilers (GRWP), using either consistent or inconsistent PBLH definitions from the GEOS model. A comprehensive evaluation over a 27‐day period (23 August –18 September 2015) is performed to quantify the PBLH Observation minus Forecast bias and Root Mean Square Deviation across data types. Although radiosonde, GNSS‐RO, and GRWP PBLH are assessed using consistent model definitions, lidar‐based PBLH is compared using inconsistent ones due to current model limitations. The results underscore the importance of using physically and instrumentally consistent model PBLH with corresponding PBLH observations. They further demonstrate that robust quality control and thinning procedures tailored to each observation type are critical, particularly when model definition and PBLH observations are inconsistent. The results also highlight notable discrepancies among two space‐based lidar PBLH data sets, especially over the ocean, which the implementation of corresponding lidar‐based model PBLH and advanced PBLH retrieval algorithms are expected to reduce. The developed framework enables a robust evaluation of current and future PBLH data sets and serves as a foundation for an effective assimilation strategy."

We aimed to produce a skillful, nationwide WNND forecast built upon regionally varying relationships between climate factors and WNND. After examining the relationships between climate conditions and annual WNND caseload for 11 regions in the U.S., we incorporated the most salient climate factors—most commonly drought and temperature—into a regionally determined nationwide WNND statistical forecast model using a Bayesian regression framework. We retrospectively generated forecasts from 2005 to 2022 and compared forecast skill against various benchmarks, including a simple, historical case‐driven model. Our regional, climate‐informed WNND retrospective forecasts outperformed a benchmark model only informed by historical WNND case data across all regions, as well as in a nationally aggregated score (univariable: 18.8% [4.7%–27.7%], bivariable: 21.8% [7.0%–30.7%] improvement). The regional forecasts also outperformed an ensemble model generated from a recent WNV forecasting competition and a parallel, county‐level, regional climate‐informed forecast outperformed forecasts from the same competition. Importantly, our approach to WNND forecast development aggregated county‐level data to broader regions to boost statistical signal and capture the regionally varying influences of climate conditions on annual WNND caseload. The advances here represent a potential path toward actionable broad‐scale WNV forecasts."

Ectopic cambia arise from cortical cells and repurpose conserved cambium regulators, including KNOX genes. 
 Secondary vascular growth is a conserved mechanism that gives rise to vascular tissues produced via a single vascular cambium. Molecular mechanisms underlying this process are characterized mainly in model species with typical vascular architectures, while the genetics underlying ecologically-important atypical vascular architectures remain unexplored. We use developmental anatomy, comparative transcriptomics, molecular evolutionary analyses, and heterologous gene expression to address this knowledge gap, investigating how multiple ectopic cambia (EC) form in the woody vine Japanese wisteria. Anatomical studies show EC in Japanese wisteria arise from cortical parenchyma, and cambium-specific transcriptome comparisons reveal that genes acting as regulators of typical cambium development in model species are likewise associated with EC development. Gene trees of KNOX genes suggest that duplication events may contribute to EC formation, including a Fabaceae-specific duplication of KNAT2/6, which is detected as being under positive selection. We also demonstrate that KNOX genes from Japanese wisteria show canonical KNOX-like activity in heterologous functional assays, although no vascular aberrations were observed. Overall, these findings provide the first insights into the genetics of EC formation in “natural variants”, advancing our understanding of the molecular mechanisms regulating vascular variants in seed plants.

Here, the authors report a chemical vapour deposition method to grow cm-scale rhombohedral-stacked WS2/MoS2 crystals with ferroelectric properties. 
 Vertical van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs), formed through layer-by-layer stacking of two-dimensional materials, offer appealing opportunities for exploring novel physics and potential applications. However, the conventional approach of mechanical exfoliation followed by manual stacking faces significant challenges in achieving atomically clean interfaces and large size, severely limiting practical applications. Here, we proposed a comprehensive mechanism governing nucleation, orientation and stack control of vertical vdWHs during chemical vapour deposition (CVD) and demonstrated the layer-by-layer epitaxial growth of 1 cm × 1 cm sized single-crystal, rhombohedral-stacked WS2/MoS2 films. First-principles calculations reveal that sulphur (S) vacancies in the underlying MoS2 layer preferentially form at step edges. These S vacancies serve as nucleation sites for the upper WS2 layer and enhance symmetry breaking between rhombohedral- and hexagonal-stacked WS2/MoS2. Leveraging this mechanism, we achieved unidirectionally aligned WS2 islands on MoS2 substrate that seamlessly coalesce into continuous single-crystal WS2/MoS2 films. Systematic characterizations confirmed the single-crystal nature and rhombohedral-stacked configuration, while revealing the ferroelectric properties and self-driven photoelectric response in the resulting heterostructures. Our work establishes a fundamental mechanism for controlled growth of single-crystal vertical heterostructures, providing a robust foundation for scalable manufacturing and future industrial applications.

Here, the authors introduce a supercharging-enhanced nDIA-MS workflow to map drug-induced solubility changes across the proteome, enabling high-throughput analysis of protein state transitions. 
 Mass spectrometry (MS) is indispensable for high-throughput quantitation of protein expression. But protein function is regulated by factors beyond abundance alone. Here, we evaluate two supercharging reagents, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and m-nitrobenzyl alcohol (mNBA), in narrow-window data-independent acquisition (nDIA)-MS. DMSO markedly enhances MS signal and protein identification, whereas mNBA primarily increases peptide identifications. Optimizating nDIA-MS with 3% DMSO boosts signal intensity by up to 56%, enabling identification of ~9,600 proteins from 1 µg HeLa digest in 15 min. Using this methodology, we quantify solubility and abundance changes in 8,694 proteins across three cell lines following short-term treatment with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 and the SUMO-activating enzyme inhibitor ML-792. MG132 affects the solubility of 1,723 proteins and the abundance of 374, and ML-792 affects 1,294 and 288, respectively. The drugs elicit distinct and sometimes opposing solubility shifts; for instance, MG132 insolubilizes HSF1, ML-792 solubilizes SP100 and insolubilizes PLOR3G, and SMAD2 shows opposite responses to those two treatments. These results reveal widespread, drug-induced remodeling of the protein solubility landscape and establish solubility profiling by nDIA-MS as a broadly applicable platform for uncovering protein state transitions and cellular responses to perturbation.

 OSCA/TMEM63 mechanosensitive ion channels play critical physiological roles in plants and animals. These channels bear structural homology to the dual functional TMEM16 family, and OSCA1.2 was recently shown to form a lipid-lined ion conduction pathway in the open state. This raised the question of whether members of the OSCA/TMEM63 family may also function as mechanically activated lipid scramblases. Using a combination of in vitro and cellular assays with computational techniques, we show that phospholipids can be translocated through the open pores of OSCA1.1/1.2/2.2 and TMEM63A/B proteins, suggesting a dual ion channel and lipid scramblase function for members of this protein family. We characterize the effects of mutating key groove lining residues demonstrating that different residues form bottlenecks for lipids and ions respectively and show that cholesterol inhibits lipid scrambling by stabilizing the closed state and slowing translocation through the open pore. We show that lipid scrambling in TMEM63 proteins can be activated by mechanical forces in the membrane, making these mechanically activated lipid scramblases. Finally, we demonstrate that this activity is important for the mechanically induced morphological remodeling of biological membranes and the resilience of cells to high mechanical forces.

Multimodel analysis reveals conflicts between biodiversity and CDR that are distributed unevenly, and shows that synergies are crucial to meet climate and conservation goals. 
 Pathways consistent with global climate objectives typically deploy billions of tonnes of carbon dioxide removal (CDR) from land-intensive methods such as forestation and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage. Such large-scale deployment of land-intensive CDR may have negative consequences for biodiversity. Here we assess scenarios across five integrated assessment models and show that scenarios consistent with limiting warming to 1.5 °C allocate up to 13% of global areas of high biodiversity importance for land-intensive CDR. These overlaps are distributed unevenly, with higher shares in low- and middle-income countries. Understanding the potential conflicts between climate action and biodiversity conservation is crucial. An illustrative analysis shows that if current biodiversity hotspots were protected from land-use change, over half the land allocated for forestation and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage in the assessed scenarios would be unavailable unless synergies between climate and conservation goals are leveraged. Our analysis also indicates CDR-related biodiversity benefits due to avoided warming.

 Elevated methane concentrations are observed in the shallow water column above subsea permafrost on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, including the inner Laptev Sea. The subsea source of this methane is poorly understood, yet crucial for predicting future methane emissions. Here, we combine analyses of dissolved methane concentrations, triple-isotopic fingerprinting, and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo statistics to constrain the source of high-concentration methane sampled during four expeditions, 2016-2020. In contrast to earlier findings of predominantly thermogenic methane release in the outer Laptev Sea, our results for the major methane release region of the inner Laptev Sea suggest that old microbial methane (radiocarbon age >48000 y BP) is being released from preformed methane pools stored within the subsea permafrost system. This observation reveals that several sources contribute to the elevated methane on the shelf and thus the necessity to consider a diversity of sources when estimating future methane release trajectories.

 Earth system models, or simulators, are foundational for projecting climate change impacts, but their computational expense limits the number and diversity of simulations available. Machine learning-based emulators, statistical surrogates trained on simulator outputs, can replicate components of climate models at orders-of-magnitude lower cost, enabling ensembles and interpolation across scenarios. We argue that the next phase of climate modeling hinges on closer collaboration between simulator and emulator communities. We outline three priorities: (1) co-design of simulators and emulators so that experimental design, diagnostics, and data products support training, evaluation, and targeted simulation; (2) shared, machine learning-ready benchmarks with data partitions and metrics that emphasize physical fidelity; and (3) treating emulators as reliable software components with interfaces, documentation, and deployment pathways for sensitivity analyses, scenario exploration, and uncertainty decomposition.

 The propagation speed of internal waves is a fundamental parameter for understanding their physical mechanisms, dynamic behavior, and environmental impact. However, traditional estimation methods are typically based on numerical simulations or sparse in-situ observations, which limit their accuracy and scalability, and results in a significant scarcity of available phase speed datasets. To overcome these challenges, we propose a physics-informed and data-driven model for estimating internal wave phase speed from satellite imagery. The proposed model incorporates three key innovations: (1) the integration of theoretical equations (KdV, BO, and eKdV equations) as physical constraints to ensure consistency with real-world ocean dynamics; (2) the adoption of an adaptive ensemble learning framework that fuses data-driven and physical-informed features to improve model robustness and prediction accuracy; and (3) the introduction of a transfer learning strategy to mitigate discrepancies between theoretical predictions and observational real-world internal wave results. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves superior performance across varying water depths, with an average RMSE of 0.04 m/s, MRE of 2.5%, and R2 of 98.8% on the testing set. Additionally, the model was applied to the South China Sea, revealing a distinct propagation pattern: average phase speed initially increased (from 2.427 m/s to 2.53 m/s), then decreased (to 1.464 m/s), and subsequently increased again (to 1.703 m/s) as internal waves propagated westward across the Dongsha Islands and Hainan Island. The model was further validated on a global scale, achieving an average percentage error of 4.95%, confirming its scalability and generalization capability. This study presents an efficient and automated approach for accurately retrieving internal wave phase speed."

 Quad-polarimetric (quad-pol) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data provides crucial polarimetric information for post-disaster building damage assessment. However, most current spaceborne SAR platforms prioritize dual-polarization (dual-pol) mode, which ensures high temporal and spatial data availability but limits damage analysis accuracy due to the absence of some polarimetric information. Existing methods for reconstructing dual-pol to quad-pol SAR data often fail to ensure that the reconstructed data meets fundamental physical properties, while traditional building damage detection methods still struggle to accurately capture complex depolarization effects. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a diffusion model-based method for reconstructing dual-pol data to quad-pol data, applied to post-earthquake building damage analysis. The method introduces a Positive Semi-definite Constraint Module and a Plug-and-Play SVD Parameter Fine-tuning Module to ensure the physical validity and accuracy of the reconstructed data. Additionally, a Stokes vector-based Degree of Polarization frequency analysis method is proposed to enhance the description of depolarization information. A multi-dimensional polarimetric feature combination is constructed for grid-level building damage assessment. Experiments on Gaofen-3, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, and Sentinel-1 data show that the proposed method performs optimally in complex scenarios, with all pixels meeting the positive semi-definite constraint. Compared to the original dual-pol SAR data, building damage assessment using the reconstructed quad-pol SAR data resulted in an F1 score improvement of 16.3% and 8.4% for detecting moderately and severely damaged buildings, respectively. This research provides crucial technical support for fully harnessing the potential of dual-pol SAR data in building damage assessment."

 The Earth is experiencing continuous anthropogenic and natural changes. Very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery-based change detection provides an effective means to monitor these dynamics at fine spatial scales. Although deep learning has significantly advanced supervised change detection (CD), it heavily relies on large amounts of human-labeled samples. In real-world CD application scenarios, acquiring sufficient change samples is challenging due to the labor-intensive nature of pixel-level labeling. This challenge has motivated the development of unsupervised change detection (UCD). However, existing UCD methods still struggle in complex scenes with bi-temporal domain shifts caused by different imaging conditions. This is largely due to the absence of high-quality samples needed to guide CD-oriented optimization. To address this challenge, we propose DreamCD, a change-label-free framework that synthesizes change samples for UCD. DreamCD consists of: (1) a weakly conditional semantic diffusion model trained with pseudo-semantic masks, (2) a Content-Semantic-Style synthesis strategy that synthesizes realistic pre- and post-event image pairs of the application domain, and (3) an arbitrary contemporal deep change detector trained solely on synthetic samples. We further introduce LsSCD-Ex, a large-scale semantic change detection (SCD) dataset consistent with OpenEarthMap semantics, enabling evaluation of synthetic-sample-based SCD. Experiments on the SECOND and LsSCD-Ex datasets demonstrate that DreamCD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) UCD performance, improving the average F1 score by 14.01% over existing methods for binary CD and outperforming the SOTA unsupervised SCD model, Changen2, by 2.15% in F1 and 3.63% in separated kappa coefficient (SCD metric). These results suggest that DreamCD provides a promising and extensible solution for CD in real-world remote sensing applications.

 The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are important sources of interannual predictability in the tropical oceans. While the IOD and ENSO can exert significant impacts on global temperature and precipitation, their influence on near-surface wind speed (NSWS) in the Asian monsoon region remains unclear. This study explores how IOD and ENSO synergistically affect the NSWS variability over South and East Asia in autumn, a season characterized by peak IOD intensity and rapidly developing ENSO. The results indicate that IOD predominantly influences the NSWS variations in the tropical Indian Ocean and northern China, while ENSO has a stronger effect over southern China. Concurrent positive IOD and El Niño events generate high-pressure anomalies over the Bay of Bengal and the western Pacific, which induce easterly anomalies over the equatorial Indian Ocean and southwesterly anomalies over southern China, leading to significant NSWS reductions in both areas. In contrast, negative IOD and La Niña events produce low-pressure anomalies over the tropical oceans, resulting in an enhanced NSWS over the equatorial Indian Ocean and southern China. Furthermore, positive IOD events are suggested to weaken the NSWS in northern China by triggering northeastward-propagating Rossby waves, which induce barotropic anticyclonic circulation anomalies over northeastern China and southeasterly wind anomalies over northern China, causing declined NSWS in this area. These findings advance our understanding of the interannual variability in the NSWS across Asian monsoon region, providing valuable insights for interannual predictions of the regional wind climate and the renewable wind energy."

 Droughts are among society's most damaging climatic disasters, representing a complex phenomenon in which precipitation plays a central role. In poorly gauged regions, precipitation estimates from remote sensing have been widely employed. However, these data often exhibit bias and may not accurately depict the spatiotemporal variability of the rainfall processes. To address these problems, this study aims to propose a novel prediction model to enhance the reliability of rainfall estimates in poorly gauged regions by utilizing a Bayesian approach to blend multiple Satellite Precipitation Estimates (SPEs). CHIRPSv2, IMERG V06, and CMORPH were the selected SPEs for building the blending model, which was applied to estimate monthly rainfall data in the Doce River catchment and the mid-lower portion of the São Francisco River catchment, both in Brazil. Comparative analyses between rainfall gauging data and the SPEs, as well as the blending model, unveiled the enhanced performance of the new precipitation estimates, demonstrating consistently lower values for RMSE, NRMSE, and PBIAS in both study areas. We also assessed the ability of the SPEs and the blending model to capture drought conditions across different aggregation scales of the Standardized Precipitation Index (1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Regarding the number of drought months and magnitudes accurately identified, the blending model consistently achieved better performance from SPI-1 to SPI-9, but was outperformed at SPI-12 by different SPEs. Overall, despite its increased complexity, this approach can be effective for drought characterization in regions with sparse monitoring and further hydrological applications on a monthly scale."

This includes fruit flies and larvae, usually not known as “social insects.” Using aDrosophilalarva assay with reduced stimulation, we found that groups show enhanced dispersal and distance from each other in the absence of food. This social context–dependent modulation overrides responses to many external sensory cues and is shaped by developmental social experience. Leveraging the genetic toolbox available inDrosophila, we find that different sensory modalities are required for social context modulation. Our results show that even less social animals such as fly larvae are affected by conspecifics and recognize each other through multimodal sensory cues. This study provides a tractable system for future dissection of the neural circuit mechanisms underlying social interactions."

While benign, these tumors can cause substantial morbidity, and effective pharmacological treatments remain limited. Here, we demonstrate that genetic ablation of focal adhesion kinase (Fak/Ptk2) impairs tumor formation and preserves hearing in a murine model of NF2.

Pharmacological inhibition of FAK with single agent VS-4718 did not significantly reduce macroscopic tumor volume; however, its use in combination with the mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK) inhibitor selumetinib resulted in both a significant reduction in tumor volume and the preservation of dorsal root ganglion architecture.

While external stimuli, such as food and drugs of abuse, are activators of DA-neuron activity, growing evidence indicates that interoceptive signals also play a critical role. Among these, the gut-brain vagal axis has emerged as a key regulator, although its precise contribution to mesolimbic DA signaling and behavior remains unclear. Here, we combine complementary ex vivo and in vivo approaches across multiple scales to show that gut-brain vagal tone is essential for gating mesolimbic DA system activity and functions, modulating DA-dependent molecular and cellular processes, and scaling both food- and drug-induced reinforcement. These findings challenge the traditional brain-centric view of reward processing, supporting a more integrated model in which vagus-mediated interoceptive signals intrinsically shape motivation and reinforcement.

Dorrell;Antoine Danon,"Induction of collective behavior by β-1,3-glucans in microalgae","β-1,3-glucans are multifaceted molecules, playing a key role in aquatic ecosystems where they store atmospheric CO2, as well as in human health, where they help fight pathogens and have anticancer properties. Until now, no role other than sugar storage had been attributed to β-1,3-glucans in algae. We show here that inChlamydomonas reinhardtii, β-1,3-glucans control aggregation, a collective behavior in response to stress. We have identified the enzymes specifically involved in β-1,3-glucan synthesis and degradation during aggregation. The transcriptome of β-1,3-glucan–induced aggregation revealed an early effect of this elicitor. A comparative genomic analysis allowed us to envisage a potential role for β-1,3-glucans in the transition to multicellularity in Volvocales. The finding of the function of β-1,3-glucans in the stress response of the unicellular model organismChlamydomonassheds light into their mode of action. This is particularly relevant given their potential roles combatting pathogenic fungi in plants and animals."

Its structure and the molecular basis of its transport properties remained unknown. We analyzed the human AQP11 structure under cryo–electron microscopy at 2.3 Å resolution, revealing a trimeric architecture compared with other known tetrameric AQPs and a topology comprising seven transmembrane helices (Hs), including an additional N-terminal helix (H0). The channel pore is broader and more hydrophobic than that of canonical AQPs, and features a unique structure surrounding an Asn-Pro-Cys (NPC) sequence instead of the typical Asn-Pro-Ala (NPA) motif. These features provide a structural framework through which water and other small solutes can permeate AQP11. Our findings provide a blueprint for designing specific inhibitors to investigate the physiologic functions of AQP11."

In the context of carbon-hydrogen oxidation, a key challenge in synthetic chemistry, unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) directly oxidize unactivated carbon-hydrogen bonds using hydrogen peroxide, yet their utility is limited by low activity and imperfect selectivity. By computational rational design, this study systematically navigated vast sequence spaces to identify mutations that enhance catalytic performance of UPOs, lastly yielded UPO variants with 13-fold enhanced activity and >99% enantioselectivity, and revealed the dominant role of residue Lys165in activity and enantioselectivity.

Here, using a pharmacological activator and targeted deletion of PKM2 in T cells, we delineated distinct functions of PKM1 and PKM2 in regulating CD4 T cell survival during homeostasis and expansion. Expanding PKM2-deficient CD4 T cells increased PKM1 expression with associated mitochondrial reactive oxygen species–mediated cell death. Examination of T cell compartments revealed that PKM2-deficient CD4 T cells were unaltered in the thymus but were significantly reduced in peripheral tissues as mice aged. The inability of PKM1 to protect CD4 T cells in the absence of PKM2 led to less severe T cell–mediated colitis as PKM2-deficient pathogenic cells were significantly reduced compared with control cells. This study shows that PKM2 is critical for CD4 T cell survival during expansion and homeostasis."

Notably, the library includes five tetrasaccharides and four octasaccharides, exhibiting all possible frameshift patterns ofA. cinnamomeagalactomannan, offering valuable materials for structure-activity relationship studies to explore the role of linking modes and domain effect. The synthesis of this library was achieved through a highly effective stereoselective α-galactosylation approach. Immunological evaluations revealed that octasaccharide4and its two subunit tetrasaccharides7and10exhibited potent immunoregulatory activities, demonstrating a notable domain effect. Preliminary mechanistic studies unveiled that these oligosaccharides exert their effects by suppressing mitogen-activated protein kinase signaling pathway.

However, the mechanisms underlying this synchronized relationship remain unclear. Here, we present a high-resolution reconstruction of Miocene benthic foraminiferal boron-to-calcium ratios, revealing that eccentricity-paced fluctuations in deep-sea carbonate ion saturation covaried with oxygen and carbon isotopes, as well as with pelagic carbonate deposition. Integrating model results, we propose that orbital configurations and elevated temperatures during eccentricity maxima intensified monsoon rainfall and chemical weathering, enhancing the transport of dissolved inorganic carbon and alkalinity from land to sea. These processes further redistributed massive carbonate burial from deep-ocean basins to continental shelves, lowering carbonate ion concentration and the carbon isotopic composition of seawater. Our findings underscore the crucial role of the low-latitude hydrological cycle in regulating carbon-cycle dynamics under warm climatic conditions."

The intracranial location limits serial biopsies and only provides an intermittent view of the tumor molecular profile from the initial resection. Liquid biopsy techniques, specifically small extracellular vesicle (sEV) analysis, have the potential to overcome these limitations by providing a window into the brain using peripheral blood. To address the need for monitoring tumor evolution and therapeutic resistance, we developed a GBM biomarker panel (ATPase subunit beta-2, excitatory amino acid transporter 2, CD24, CD44, CD133, and epidermal growth factor receptor) for multiplexed profiling of sEVs using an advanced GBM Extracellular Vesicle Monitoring Phenotypic Analyzer Chip. We successfully tracked patient response to treatment by monitoring changes in glioma stem cell markers on circulating sEVs. We propose that these results provide a strong rationale for using GBM sEVs as a serial monitoring tool in the future clinical management of patients with GBM."

However, these states are known to be fragile because of their sensitivity to losses, their inability to be amplified, and their susceptibility to decoherence. This makes them far more vulnerable to noise than classical signals, limiting their out-of-lab deployment. We demonstrate quantum coherent energy redistribution, which not only recovers entangled states buried in noise but also improves their properties, moving toward noise-robust architectures with better deployability. Using standard telecommunications infrastructure, we show an order of magnitude increase in the coincidence-to-accidental ratio for time-bin entangled photon pairs. Furthermore, we demonstrate the revival of lost entanglement by recovering quantum interference visibility and fidelity from quantum state tomography measurements of qubits corrupted by noise."

While neuroinflammatory changes are suspected in these patients, measurements of both central and systemic inflammation in the brain remain unexplored. We investigate whether the translocator protein standardized uptake value ratio (TSPO SUVr), a quantifiable marker of neuroinflammation using positron emission tomography (PET), is elevated in the brains of patients with post–COVID-19 active TLE. In addition, we examine correlations between TSPO SUVr and inflammatory factors to identify potential peripheral blood inflammatory predictors of post–COVID-19 active epilepsy. Our study highlights the presence of widespread neuroinflammation in the brain and increased levels of inflammatory cytokines in the plasma of individuals with post–COVID-19 active TLE. Furthermore, strong correlations between plasma levels of interleukin-1β (IL-1β), IL-10, and interferon-γ (IFN-γ) and neuroimmune activation suggest the potential for integrating plasma inflammatory factors with TSPO PET as a dependable approach for clinical diagnosis, dynamic monitoring, and assessment of immune-based therapeutic efficacy in TLE-associated neuroinflammation."
