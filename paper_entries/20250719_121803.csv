Despite their extensive implementation, long-term evaluations of these practices are limited, especially in data-scarce regions. In our study, we assess the long-term impact of large-scale SLMPs in Ethiopia using remotely sensed data from the past 24 years on 122 watersheds. Using a synthetic control method that does not require an explicit control group, we find statistically significant positive effects of SLMPs in both wet and dry seasons. These benefits persist at least eight years beyond the intervention period. Our findings highlight the need for multi-season impact assessments. Focusing only on the wet season may overlook key outcomes in dryland regions, underestimating the effectiveness of large-scale, multi-year projects. We further find that effects were most positive in drought-prone agricultural highlands, and that some administrative zones appear more effective than others at implementation. Efficient and affordable monitoring of sustainable agricultural water and land management and watershed conservation is crucial for understanding which interventions are effective and can provide opportunities for alternative financing mechanisms."
10.1088/1748-9326/adec05,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注养殖三文鱼在英国市场上的崛起，探讨了行业和零售商如何通过市场营销策略（如标签和促销）来塑造消费者需求，将三文鱼定位为一种易获取、营养丰富且可持续的产品。论文分析了这些市场营销活动如何影响消费者对三文鱼的健康和可持续性认知，并讨论了如何借鉴这些经验来推广其他水产品。该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,[],James PW Robinson;Josiane Fernandes,The hidden role of market-making in the rise of farmed salmon,"Aquaculture is expected to play an important role in the transition towards healthy and sustainable diets, requiring dietary changes towards products with lower environmental footprints in ways that address dietary needs. Farmed Atlantic salmon accounts for 2% of global aquaculture, with productivity growth factors, such as research investment, credited with creating a high-value, globalized food commodity. However, its contribution to sustainability and nutrition goals remains unclear, and factors underlying consumer demand, such as marketing work, have been overlooked. We inspect the rise of farmed salmon in the UK, using key stakeholder interviews to understand the role of various actors (e.g. industry, retailers) in ‘making’ farmed salmon markets. Interviewees identified retailer strategies, such as labelling, and consumer-facing promotion efforts, such as health benefits, as key demand-growth factors underlying farmed salmon sales. Using data on UK seafood markets, we assess the views of interviewees, finding that farmed salmon is the most consumed aquatic food; however, it is less popular than other animal-source foods and is primarily consumed by affluent households. Our analyses discuss how market-making efforts by industry and retail actors have shaped consumer demand by promoting salmon as an accessible, nutritious and sustainable product. Accreditation and labelling have helped to develop perceptions of health and sustainability, despite farmed salmon being comparable in nutrient profile to other aquatic foods and having long-standing environmental impacts. Market-making insights could be used to enhance demand for other aquatic foods in ways that target dietary gaps by supplying affordable and sustainable products, such as mussels."

We developed a novel transportation network analysis framework to assess access fragility (in terms of losing access), criticality (in terms of the importance of CES facilities), and equity of CES access across five Louisiana communities. We used drive time to the closest facility, marginal drive time to the second closest facility, and the number of alternatives within critical time thresholds as three measures for fragility analysis. Our findings show that fragility is not limited to rural areas—urban communities experiencing in-migration also face risks due to limited alternatives. Removing one facility at a time revealed that it can cause up to a 500% increase in drive times to dialysis centers and hospitals for residents of Morgan City and Stephensville, while, on average, removing one random high school results in a 6%–30% increase in drive time across communities. We also introduced a criticality ranking method using total population, percentage of the population without an alternative, and marginal drive time for populations without alternatives, and calculated rank stability across different weightings of these three measures to identify facilities that are consistently most critical. Cameron Parish had the highest concentration of critical facilities, though facilities in Slidell and Mandeville also ranked highly, highlighting potential capacity concerns for two communities with growing populations. Finally, our equity analysis, performed using Monte Carlo simulations, shows that Native populations are disproportionately affected by limited access to services (∼29% are identified as outliers for dialysis and hospital access), while White populations experience the lowest average drive times to most CES facilities."
10.5194/acp-25-7619-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注中国南京市PM2.5中棕色碳（BrC）的化学和光学特性。研究通过机器学习方法识别了关键的BrC分子，并分析了水溶性有机气溶胶（WSOA）在不同季节的氧化过程和光吸收特性。研究结果对于评估BrC对空气质量和辐射强迫的影响具有重要意义，虽然没有直接涉及卫星观测或遥感技术，但其对大气成分的分析和空气质量的评估与大气环境遥感技术间接相关，因为地面观测数据可以用于验证和校准遥感数据。,"['brown carbon', 'PM2.5', 'air quality', 'radiative forcing', 'light absorption', 'chemical composition', 'machine learning', 'polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons']",Yu Huang;Xingru Li;Dan Dan Huang;Ruoyuan Lei;Binhuang Zhou;Yunjiang Zhang;Xinlei Ge,"Machine-learning-assisted chemical characterization and optical properties of atmospheric brown carbon in Nanjing, China","This work comprises a comprehensive investigation into the chemical and optical properties of brown carbon (BrC) in PM2.5 samples collected in Nanjing, China. In particular, we used a machine learning approach to identify a list of key BrC species, which can be a good reference for future studies. Our findings extend understanding of BrC properties and are valuable to the assessment of BrC's impact on air quality and radiative forcing. 
 The light-absorbing organics, namely brown carbon (BrC), can significantly affect atmospheric visibility and radiative forcing, yet current knowledge of the chemical composition of BrC is largely limited to a number of certain classes of compounds; the chemical and optical properties, and particularly linkage between the two, remain poorly understood. To address this, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on the particulate matter (PM2.5) samples collected in Nanjing, China, during 2022–2023, with a focus on the identification of key BrC molecules. Several important clues related to BrC were found. First, the water-soluble organic aerosol (WSOA) was more oxygenated during the cold season (CS) due to a highly oxidized secondary OA (SOA) factor that was strongly associated with aqueous and heterogenous reactions, especially during the nighttime, while the WSOA during the summer season (SS) was less oxygenated and the SOA was mainly from photochemical reactions. Fossil fuel combustion hydrocarbon-like OA was the largest and dominant contributor to the light absorption during CS (55.6 %–63.7 %). Secondly, our observations reveal that aqueous oxidation can lead to notable photo-enhancement during CS, while photochemical oxidation on the contrary caused photo-bleaching during SS. Both water-soluble and methanol-soluble organics had four key fluorophores, including three factors related to humic-like substances (HULIS) and one protein-like component. Thirdly, molecular characterization shows that CHON compounds were the most abundant species overall, followed by CHO and CHN compounds, and the significant presence of organosulfates in CS samples reaffirmed the importance of aqueous-phase formation. Finally, building upon the molecular characterization and light absorption measurement results, a machine learning approach was applied to identify the key BrC molecules and 31 compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxyheterocyclic PAHs, quinones, and nitrogen-containing species, which can be a good reference for future studies."

Bernal Ayala;Angela K. Rowe;Lucia E. Arena;William O. Nachlas,Physical–chemical properties of particles  in hailstones from central Argentina,"This study analyzed particles in hailstones from Argentina to better understand hail formation and growth. A unique method was used that revealed the particles’ size, composition, and location within the hail, including a variety of particle sizes and compositions linked to local land uses, such as mountainous, agricultural, and urban areas. The findings highlight the potential impacts of natural and human-related factors on hail formation and provide a new method for studying hail globally. 
 This study presents a novel analysis of two hailstones collected in central Argentina to provide insights into the size distribution, composition, and potential sources of non-soluble particles within hailstones. Using this new method, non-soluble particles are trapped beneath a thin layer of polyvinyl resin and analyzed with confocal laser and scanning electron microscopy combined with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, preserving their in situ location and physical characteristics. The study characterized these particles' distribution, shape, and size and identified their elemental composition, which is used to interpret possible source regions. Particles ranged in diameter from our detection limit from 1 to 256 µm, with the largest particles consistently found in the hailstone embryos. Agglomerated mineral and organic particles dominated the elemental composition in both the embryo and outer layers, with the largest agglomerated particle (256 µm) being an organic-rich particle in the embryo of the larger hailstone. The composition and size distribution varied between the two hailstones: one contained agglomerated salt particles (up to 150 µm) in its embryo, traced to a nearby salt lake, while the other contained copper chloride and zinc chloride particles (up to 78 µm) primarily in its outer layers, potentially associated with agrochemicals commonly used for pest control and fertilizer in Argentina. Various local and regional land-use types, including shrublands, mixed vegetation, croplands, and urban areas, were linked to specific types of particles. Therefore, this study highlights the regional influence of various land-use types on hail formation and growth, pointing to the potential impacts of natural and anthropogenic factors on hailstone composition and revealing how particle characteristics vary between the embryo and outer layers of hailstones."

The PartMC model can provide detailed particle information and help these studies. This model is integrated with the ideal meteorological Cloud Model 1 (CM1) to simulate the aerosols at cloud-forming locations. Significant changes are revealed in the hygroscopicity distribution of aerosols within ascending air parcels. Additionally, different ascent times also affect aerosol aging processes. 
 Aerosols significantly impact the global climate by affecting the Earth's radiative balance and cloud formation. However, conducting cloud-altitude aerosol observations is currently costly and challenging, leading to gaps in accurately assessing aerosol activation properties during cloud formation. In this study, Cloud Model 1 (CM1) is employed to investigate the movement of air parcels under shallow-convection conditions in a coastal area. Subsequently, the evolution of various aerosol populations in the ideal scenarios is simulated by the Particle Monte Carlo (PartMC)–Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) model to investigate their activation properties. It is found that leaving the boundary layer and entering the free atmosphere causes environmental changes in the parcels, which in turn alter the aerosol evolution and the cloud-forming potential. The impact of ascent timing is notably manifested in the concentration of ammonium nitrate rather than other chemical constituents. The rapid formation of ammonium nitrate accelerates the aerosol aging process, thereby modifying the hygroscopicity of the population. The differences between the aerosol populations in the boundary layer and at cloud altitudes highlight the necessity of vertical observations and numerical modeling. In addition, as supersaturation rises from 0.1 % to 1 %, the discrepancy in the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation ratio between the particle-resolved results and the internal mixing assumption increases from 7 % to 30 %. This emphasizes the potential of appropriate mixing-state parameterization in assessing aerosol activation properties. This study advances the understanding of aerosol hygroscopic changes under real weather conditions and offers insights into future modeling of aerosol–cloud microphysics."

H. Prevot;Xuexi Tie;Guohui Li,"Source-explicit estimation of brown carbon in the polluted atmosphere over the North China Plain: implications for distribution, absorption, and the direct radiative effect","Brown carbon (BrC) is a type of airborne particle produced from various combustion sources which is light absorption. Historically, climate models have categorizing organic particles as either non-absorbing or purely reflective. Our study shows that BrC can reduce the usual cooling effect of organic particles. While BrC is often linked to biomass burning, however, BrC from fossil fuels contributes significantly to atmospheric heating. 
 Brown carbon (BrC) plays a significant role in altering atmospheric radiation. Beyond biomass and biofuel combustion, recent studies identify fossil fuel sources – especially residential coal burning and vehicle exhaust – as major contributors to BrC. This underscores a gap in climate models, which often assume fossil fuel organic aerosols (OAs) are non-absorbing or treat all OA as light-scattering. In this study, we simulate BrC over the North China Plain (NCP) during a winter pollution event using the WRF-Chem model, incorporating explicit BrC absorption properties. The model aligns well with observed pollutant and aerosol levels, revealing an average near-surface BrC concentration of 5.2 µg m−3, contributing 16.4 % to aerosol absorption at 365 nm. Using a diagnostic adjoint approach, we estimate that BrC exerts a direct radiative effect (DRE) averaging −0.09 W m−2 at the top of the atmosphere, reducing the cooling effect of organic carbon by 28.0 % and producing a local warming effect of up to +0.40 W m−2. Coal combustion is the largest BrC source in the NCP in 2014, though secondary BrC also significantly impacts the regional radiation balance."

Jensen;Thaopaul Bui;Jonathan Dean-Day;Leonhard Pfister,Aircraft observations of biomass burning pollutants in the equatorial lower stratosphere over the tropical western Pacific during boreal winter,"Biomass fires emit aerosols and precursors that can provide a novel environment for initiating stratospheric ozone loss. The Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment campaign sampled the western Pacific, the dominant longitudes for surface air lofted by convection to enter the global stratosphere. Aircraft measurements over multiple flights revealed persistent layers of biomass burning pollutants entering the lower stratosphere and originating from fires as far away as Africa and Indonesia. 
 Recent studies hypothesize that emissions from fires reaching the stratosphere can provide aerosols and aerosol precursors that initiate stratospheric ozone loss and lead to radiative heating of the stratosphere and cooling of the surface. Air from the troposphere enters the stratosphere primarily over the tropical western Pacific (TWP) during boreal winter. We report observations in the TWP of persistent, ubiquitous pollution in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and lower stratosphere (LS) during the Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX) campaign in February–March 2014. We found carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations increased by up to 65 % above background levels in the deep tropics (5° S–15° N; 16–17 km). Correlations of CO with hydrocarbon and halocarbon species indicated a biomass burning source, with the largest CO increases in cloud-free air. Satellite observations did not detect the thin layers of CO observed by the aircraft and revealed Africa, Indonesia, and the western and central Pacific as geographical hot spots for CO in the TTL. Backward trajectories also identified convective encounters in these areas, highlighting delivery of biomass burning pollutants to the TWP by both nearby and remote convection. Contributions from Africa and Indonesia were nearly 60 %, with transport timescales of 10 d to several weeks. Our study confirms that air in the TTL over the TWP is affected by emissions from distant fires that can rapidly reach the tropical LS, the principal source region for air entering the global stratosphere, supporting the view that fires in tropical regions can impact stratospheric composition and temperature."

Since turbulence is an important factor to maintain clouds in a mixed phase, it is hypothesized that turbulence may have an impact on the seeding effect. This hypothesis is evident in the present study, which shows that turbulence can accelerate the impact of airborne glaciogenic seeding of stratiform clouds. 
 Several recent studies have reported complete cloud glaciation induced by airborne-based glaciogenic cloud seeding over plains. Since turbulence is an important factor controlling mixed-phase clouds, including ice initiation, snow growth, and cloud longevity, it is hypothesized that turbulence may have an impact on the seeding effect. To understand the role of turbulence in seeded clouds, idealized Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) large eddy simulations over flat terrain were conducted for a shallow stratiform cloud in which complete glaciation was observed. The results show that the model can reasonably capture the magnitude and spatial distributions of radar echoes in seeded areas. Sensitivity tests suggest that, for this case, stronger turbulence enhanced the particle dispersion, the nucleation of silver iodide (AgI) particles, and the growth of ice crystals, which accelerated cloud glaciation, even though the condensation of droplets was also enhanced. The faster cloud glaciation intensified precipitation within a short time after seeding, while the liquid water was quickly consumed, leading to a decrease in precipitation rate in the further downwind areas. Such a transition from positive to negative seeding effect is more pronounced for seeding with a higher AgI release rate. This study provides strong evidence that turbulence plays a vital role in the physical chain of events associated with cloud seeding."

Alongside national inventories, independent databases provide yearly globally consistent emission inventories. Comparing independent inventories with countries submissions provides clear and consistent track of the real progress. Improvement of emissions inventories, reporting timelines, and statistical systems are essential to ensure reliable and comparable data. 
 Tracking greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is essential for understanding the drivers of climate change and guiding global mitigation strategies. The Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR) and submissions by Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) are two key sources of GHG emissions data. While EDGAR provides comprehensive and globally consistent estimates, UNFCCC submissions are based on nationally reported inventories, which adhere to specific guidelines and reflect country-specific circumstances and practices. This study presents a detailed comparison between EDGAR and UNFCCC GHG emissions inventories, focusing on G20 countries, which account for nearly 80 % of global emissions, as well as Annex I countries, including the EU27. By examining sectoral discrepancies, methodological variations, and the impact of reporting timelines, the paper identifies key areas of alignment and divergence in emissions estimates. While CO2 emissions show strong agreement between the datasets, CH4 and N2O estimates exhibit substantial discrepancies due to differences in methodologies, emission factors, uncertainties, and reporting practices. Our findings emphasise the need for enhanced methodological harmonization and more frequent reporting, particularly in non-Annex I countries, where limited capacity and irregular updates reduce comparability. Addressing these inconsistencies is crucial for improving transparency, aligning national and independent datasets, and strengthening climate policy decisions under the Paris Agreement."

It uses data from weather and climate models, whose resolution is steadily increasing. Processing the latest data had become a challenge, and the updates presented here ensure that WAM2layers runs smoothly again. We also made it easier to use the program and to understand its source code. This makes it more transparent, reliable, and easier to maintain. 
 This paper documents the atmospheric-moisture-tracking model WAM2layers v3 (Water Accounting Model – 2 layers, version 3). WAM2layers may be used to gain an understanding of atmospheric dynamics and to study rainfall patterns and extremes by mapping their sources or sinks, often in the context of climate and land-use changes. To this end, WAM2layers solves a prognostic equation for tagged moisture in gridded atmospheric datasets such as reanalysis data or climate model output. WAM2layers can be used in forward mode, to determine where evaporated water eventually precipitates, or in backward mode, to determine where precipitation originally evaporated.WAM2layers v3 represents a complete rewrite of the WAM2layers model originally introduced in 2010 and subsequently used in more than 60 academic studies. This latest version incorporates performance optimizations to cope with the increased resolution of input data and introduces various best practices aimed at improved user-friendliness and software sustainability. As an increasing number of researchers are using the code, this paper is intended as an updated description and reference in the academic literature. After describing the history, model formulation, and numerical implementation, we present and evaluate two example cases to illustrate the use and skill of WAM2layers v3. We then discuss best practices, some important assumptions, and directions for future development."

These models mimic the outputs of a complex vegetation model but run 95 % faster, enabling global analyses and supporting climate solutions in large modeling frameworks such as LandSyMM. 
 The assessment of forest-based climate change mitigation strategies relies on computationally intensive scenario analyses, particularly when dynamic vegetation models are coupled with socioeconomic models in multi-model frameworks. In this study, we developed surrogate models for the LPJ-GUESS dynamic global vegetation model to accelerate the prediction of carbon stocks and fluxes, enabling quicker scenario optimization within a multi-model coupling framework. We trained two machine learning methods: random forest and neural network. We assessed and compared the emulators using performance metrics and Shapley-based explanations. Our emulation approach accurately captured global and biome-specific forest carbon dynamics, closely replicating the outputs of LPJ-GUESS for both historical (1850–2014) and future (2015–2100) periods under various climate scenarios. Among the two trained emulators, the neural network extrapolated better at the end of the century for carbon stocks and fluxes and provided more physically consistent predictions, as verified by Shapley values. Overall, the emulators reduced the simulation execution time by 95 %, bridging the gap between complex process-based models and the need for scalable and fast simulations. This offers a valuable tool for scenario analysis in the context of climate change mitigation, forest management, and policy development."

Although the effects of MPs on soil EEAs have garnered increasing attention, the generalizable patterns and mechanisms underlying these effects remain unclear. To bridge this knowledge gap, we conducted a meta-analysis of 453 paired observations from 72 peer-reviewed publications evaluating MP-induced changes in soil EEAs with a focus on the roles of MP biodegradability, experimental additions, and the presence or absence of plants in mediating these effects. Our findings demonstrated that MPs increased soil N-acquiring (4%), P-acquiring (14%), and oxidative (8%) enzyme activities and decreased soil C-acquiring enzyme activities (2%). Notably, biodegradable MPs exhibited a more pronounced promotion of soil EEAs than did nonbiodegradable MPs. Experimental additions substantially mediated the effects of MPs on soil EEAs, where toxic substances promoted positive effects. However, the presence of plants attenuated these effects compared with plant-free conditions.

Herein, Ru supported on sulfated tin oxide (STO) was designed to demonstrate excellent activity, stability, and water resistance in the catalytic combustion of 1,2-dichloroethane (EDC). The presence of various sulfate species (–OSO3, –H2SO4, –HSO4), which can undergo reversible transformations, enhanced both the acidity and the mobility of H species, thereby facilitating the cleavage of C–H and C–Cl bonds to form the intermediates of vinyl chloride. Moreover, the dispersion of Ru species was significantly enhanced on the STO support, which effectively promoted the deep oxidation of the intermediates. In situ diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy (DRIFTS) analysis demonstrated distinct mechanistic pathways for the two catalysts. On the Ru/SnO2 catalyst, the interaction between surface oxygen species and H species generated through C–H bond dissociation led to hydroxyl group formation, which consequently suppressed deep oxidation. In contrast, on the Ru/STO catalyst, the coordination of –OSO3 groups with these H species to form –HSO4 effectively protected the surface oxygen species, thereby maintaining the oxidative capacity and ultimately facilitating complete EDC combustion."

This study investigates the physicochemical characteristics of aerosols collected during the DOE’s TRacking Aerosol Convection interactions Experiment (TRACER) campaign, conducted from June to September 2022 in the Greater Houston area. Aerosols were sampled at coastal (Galveston) and inland (Hempstead and Jersey Village) sites during sea-breeze initiated convection and outflow events and analyzed using Raman microspectroscopy. Galveston’s aerosols primarily consisted of organic compounds, while Hempstead featured mainly inorganic salts (e.g., ammonium sulfate) and secondary organic aerosols. Organic aerosols were more abundant in Galveston (73%) than in Hempstead (65%). Particles exhibited diverse morphologies including homogeneous, core–shell, and complex structures. Homogeneous particles dominated at both sites, though Hempstead showed a higher fraction of core–shell particles. Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations were 5 times higher at the inland sites than at the coast at a supersaturation of 0.2%, and this difference increased to 13 times higher at a 1.2% supersaturation. During sampling of the outflow of convective storm systems, distinct changes in aerosol size, morphology, and mixing state led to a significant increase in CCN activity at the inland (Jersey Village) site.

Extensive experimental data were compiled, incorporating feedstock characteristics, operational conditions, and biochar properties, alongside stability indicators such as pH, volatile fatty acid concentrations, alkalinity, and total ammonia nitrogen levels. The proposed model integrates different configurations of convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks within a stacking ensemble framework, effectively capturing complex interdependencies within the AD process and improving methane yield predictions. Optimized through advanced hyperparameter tuning, the model achieved high internal predictive accuracy (mean R2 of 0.91–0.94 and root-mean-square error of 60.85 mL CH4/g volatile solids) and demonstrated strong generalization with an R2 of 0.68 on external independent lab-scale datasets, outperforming all individual models.

Our approach utilizes a portable and cost-efficient sensor array with advanced data handling, employing commercially available sensors to measure CO2, CO, NO2, SO2, PMs, VOC, NOx, cookstove and ambient temperature, relative humidity, and pressure. We developed hardware and software to gather and process sensor data and control the temperature cycle using the BME688 sensors. The field deployments reveal that CO2 emission from a cooking event is ∼2.3 ± 1.5 kg CO2 per family. Extrapolating this data, the total emissions from biomass (e.g., fuelwood, crop residues, animal dung, and charcoal) for household cooking in rural areas of India are estimated to be around 0.6 ± 0.4 teragrams (Tg) of CO2 per day. The integration of dual BME688 sensors, leveraging the standard Bosch Software Environmental Cluster library and temperature cycling, achieves an impressive 95% accuracy in fingerprinting emissions from different fuel types. This capability enables the creation of a comprehensive database, where each CO2 emission data point is meticulously linked to the original biomass source.

The survival of bees is threatened by multiple factors, such as pesticides, climatic conditions, and pathogens, of which pesticides are the main factor of concern. In recent years, significant advancements have been made in understanding the toxic effects of structurally diverse pesticides on bees. However, a systematic examination of the correlation mechanism of pesticide structures and their toxicity to bees remains inadequately addressed. Here, we investigated how structural diversity in pesticides leads to varying toxicities to bees and explored the potential mechanisms of the differences in toxicity. First, we categorized the pesticides reported in the literature as toxic to bees into seven distinct classes based on their structural characteristics. Then, we examined the correlation between the diversity of pesticide structures and their toxicity to bees. Finally, we investigated the potential mechanisms underlying differences in pesticide toxicity to bees, including target protein binding affinity, metabolic detoxification efficiency, and cuticle penetration dynamics.

Atmospheric emissions of this gas have increased since industrialization, and their levels are highly elevated in many urban and natural environments; however, it is unresolved whether elevated levels of CO at environmentally relevant concentrations are primarily stimulatory or inhibitory to soil microbial communities. Here, we showed that CO exposure minimally affects microbial abundance, richness, and composition in diverse ecosystem soils, suggesting that most microbes are tolerant of this gas. Genome-resolved metagenomic profiling showed that these soils harbored diverse bacteria capable of using CO as an electron donor for aerobic respiration and carbon fixation. CO stimulated the growth of several of these putative CO-oxidizing bacteria in a dose-dependent manner, especially widespread proteobacterial and actinobacterial lineages. Additionally, we found a strong relationship between CO oxidation and carbon fixation and observed an enrichment of several carboxydotrophic MAGs capable of carbon fixation in most soil types. These findings highlight that environmentally relevant CO levels do not inhibit soil microbes but instead foster the growth of distinct carboxydotrophic bacteria, suggesting a robust soil CO sink that could help mitigate anthropogenic CO emissions and identify new players contributing to carbon cycling in terrestrial ecosystems."

Herein, a Cu-substitution strategy was employed to construct the Cu–O–Mn electron bridge in Mn3O4, enabling tailored electronic redistribution and enhanced molecular oxygen activation. A series of characterizations and DFT calculations revealed that the substitution of Cu decreased the electron density around the Mn atoms, generated abundant oxygen vacancies, and elevated the Mn4+ concentration, improving oxidative capacity. The optimized CuMn2O4 catalyst achieved 90% conversion of m-xylene at 246 °C, which was 12 °C lower than that of Mn3O4. The investigation of the mechanism demonstrated that the synergistic effect of Cu+ species and oxygen vacancies accelerated molecular oxygen activation and dynamically replenished the consumed lattice oxygen. Furthermore, the Cu–O–Mn bridge facilitated interfacial electron transfer, weakening Mn–O bonds and lowering oxygen vacancy formation energy, which promoted surface lattice oxygen mobility.

However, current formulation and practices are increasingly being scrutinized due to the low efficiency of applied nutrients with negative economic and environmental consequences. Enhance nutrient use efficiency requires a comprehensive understanding of soil–fertilizer interactions. Here, we contend that this knowledge has been generated by ‘bulk’ soil approaches that, while providing useful information, oversimplify these interactions by neglecting the strong chemical gradients occurring in the soils around fertilizers (i.e., in the fertosphere). Progress in non-destructive, in situ, and spatially resolved analytical techniques now allow a paradigm shift in the investigation of fertilizer chemistry in soil. For instance, mapping of diffusive gradients in thin films (DGT) allows for nutrient availability to be quantified in 2D. Complementing DGT information with imaging X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES-imaging) provides an avenue to understand how chemical speciation along chemical gradients in the fertosphere controls nutrient availability. This information is essential to improve agronomic practices and for the development of novel fertilizers.

In this study, we systematically elucidate its critical influence on the selective layer, separation performance, and kinetics of water molecule transport of TFC membranes by employing a combination of experimental investigations and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The experimental results revealed the formation of a thinner and less cross-linked polyamide layer on the substrate with larger pore size, leading to a high water permeance of 35.4 L m–2 h–1 bar–1. In contrast, the smaller-pore-size substrate promoted the formation of a polyamide layer with more uniformly distributed pore size, resulting in better solute/solute selectivity (erythromycin/NaCl selectivity = 426). MD simulations confirmed the significant influence of substrate pore size on mass transfer in the TFC membrane.

Hierarchical cluster analysis exposed clusters of compounds significantly upregulated at the effluent/stream mixing zone, revealing evidence of a novel phenomenon wherein transformation product and/or metabolite formation appears to occur rapidly in situ. Additionally, an exposure-driven NTA retrospective analysis uncovered upregulation of 7endocrine-disrupting compounds that may explain prior bioassay results. These findings have urgent implications for ecosystems and downstream communities experiencing de facto wastewater reuse conditions. NTA offers enhanced characterization of complex mixtures in effluent-dominated streams and can reveal novel mixture dynamics otherwise masked when employing target analysis alone."

However, researchers mainly focus on the chemicals directly emitted from masks, with no consideration given to their possible transformation chemistry and the associated potential health impacts during the use of masks. Here, via mask wearing experiments (by volunteers), ambient air-mask interaction experiments, and ozone-mask reaction experiments, we find that the chemical exposure will be substantially changed during mask wearing due to gas-mask multiphase reactions with ambient ozone. In particular, this ozone oxidation chemistry leads to the formation of gaseous carbonyl compounds and a surface-bound organophosphate ester tris(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) phosphate (TDtBPP, an emerging contaminant), with concentrations up to five times higher than those present in unused masks. While exposure assessments indicate that the health risks posed by gaseous carbonyl compounds and surface-bound organophosphate esters are likely to be minor, the present work emphasizes the importance of considering the dynamic evolution of mask-related chemicals when evaluating the overall chemical exposure related to face mask usage."

However, our study reveals that the Equatorial Undercurrent (EUC) exhibits an unexpected seasonality with prominent annual variability. Constructive (destructive) interference between annual and semiannual components strengthens (weakens) the EUC during early boreal spring (fall). We identify two key mechanisms underlying this behavior: (a) resonant second‐baroclinic‐mode waves enhance equatorial semiannual variability, but their first zero‐crossing near the depth of the EUC limits their contribution to the EUC seasonality; and (b) fourth‐baroclinic‐mode waves profoundly contribute to the annual variability, with equatorial Kelvin and Rossby waves resonating under annual forcing, enhancing the annual response of the EUC. Sensitivity experiments using a linear continuously stratified ocean model indicate that wind forcing in the western EIO (40°−55°E) plays a dominant role in generating the three‐dimensional structure of annual variability of the EUC."

This process is visually evident in low‐lying regions as conversion of forests and agricultural fields to saltmarsh. Marsh migration is largely attributed to ocean forcings such as sea‐level rise and storm surges. Here we show that terrestrial hydrology may also be a major driver of coastal ecosystem change. Data from the Delmarva Peninsula, USA show that declining upland groundwater head weakens the hydraulic gradient, causing shallow saline groundwater to push inland from coastal marshes. This drives SWI into coastal freshwater forests and farms at magnitudes that can exceed SWI from storms. We show that storm events often contribute to groundwater freshening through rainfall that restores the hydraulic gradient and flushes saline groundwater. Our findings highlight terrestrial groundwater as a primary control on root‐zone saltwater intrusion and suggest that changes in upland head may be a dominant, yet overlooked, driver of marsh migration."

Nickerson;Gregory P. King;Jun A. Zhang,Turbulence of Tropical Cyclones: From Peristrophic to Zonostrophic,"Cyclostrophic rotation in the core region of tropical cyclones (TCs) imprints a distinct signature upon their turbulence structure. Its intensity is characterized by the radius of maximum wind, Rmw ${R}_{mw}$, and the azimuthal wind velocity at that radius, Umax ${U}_{max}$. The corresponding cyclostrophic Coriolis parameter, fˆ=2Umax $\widehat{f}=2{U}_{max}$/Rmw ${R}_{mw}$, far exceeds its planetary counterpart, f $f$, for all storms; its impact increases with storm intensity. The vortex can be thought of as a system undergoing a superposition of planetary and cyclostrophic rotations represented by the effective Coriolis parameter, f∼=fˆ+f $\tilde{f}=\widehat{f}+f$. On the vortex periphery, f∼ $\tilde{f}$ merges with f $f$. In the classical Rankine vortex model, the inner region undergoes solid‐body rotation rendering fˆ $\widehat{f}$ constant. In a more realistic representation, fˆ $\widehat{f}$ is not constant, and the ensuing cyclostrophic β $\beta $‐effect sustains vortex Rossby waves. Horizontal turbulence in such a system can be quantified by a two‐dimensional anisotropic spectrum. An alternative description is provided by one‐dimensional, longitudinal, and transverse spectra computed along the radial direction. For rotating turbulence with vortex Rossby waves, the spectra divulge a coexistence of three ranges: Kolmogorov, peristrophic (spectral amplitudes are proportional to f∼2 ${\tilde{f}}^{2}$), and zonostrophic (transverse spectrum amplitude is proportional to βˆ2 ${\widehat{\beta }}^{2}$). A comprehensive database of TC winds collected by reconnaissance airplanes reveals that with increasing storm intensity, their cyclostrophic turbulence evolves from purely peristrophic to mixed peristrophic‐zonostrophic to predominantly zonostrophic. The latter is akin to the flow regime harboring zonal jets on fast rotating giant planets. The eyewall of TCs is an equivalent of an eastward zonal jet."

Alternatively, waterbelt states with a narrow equatorial strip of ice‐free ocean provide a compelling explanation for the survival of life during these extreme glaciations. In this study, we establish a framework to quantify three atmospheric factors that influence waterbelt states: the spatial extent of bare dark sea ice set by the pattern of surface precipitation and evaporation, cloud masking of the ice‐albedo feedback, and cloud shortwave feedback. We first explore these factors in the Budyko‐Sellers energy balance model, and then investigate them in simulations with three versions of the ICON global climate model. This allows us to relate differences in the waterbelt states between ICON versions to the three factors. A broader Hadley circulation shifts the boundary between snow‐covered and bare sea ice poleward, leading to waterbelt states whose ice lines are at higher latitudes. Cloud masking always works in favor of stable waterbelt states by weakening the ice‐albedo feedback. The role of the cloud shortwave feedback, in contrast, depends on the ICON version: in one version, increasing cloud condensate over the low‐latitude open ocean destabilizes waterbelt states and creates an additional small hysteresis. In the other two versions, the cloud shortwave feedback is stabilizing. While our study does not answer which of the model versions is most realistic, it provides a quantitative framework for understanding the atmospheric mechanisms that govern the existence and hysteresis of waterbelt states."

Rousset,Atmospheric Response to Antarctic Coastal Polynyas,"The lack of sea ice in Antarctic coastal polynyas enables strong ocean‐to‐atmosphere heat fluxes and intense sea‐ice production. Although these features are primarily driven by intense offshore winds, their impact on local atmospheric conditions remains poorly understood. This study employs a high‐resolution polar Weather Research and Forecasting model configuration over the Prydz Bay region, East Antarctica, home to two major coastal polynyas: Cape Darnley and Mackenzie Bay polynyas. Sensitivity experiments over three winters (2014–2016) comparing simulations with and without polynyas reveal a marked and spatially confined atmospheric response. Polynya openings induce substantial surface heat release (up to 700 W m−2), warming near‐surface air by over 5 K and triggering convection and clouds. This results in a thickening of the atmospheric boundary layer and the development of stronger surface winds (up to 4 m s−1) that converge toward a low‐pressure anomaly. A particular emphasis is placed on the mechanisms controlling wind anomalies, using a dedicated wind tendency analysis. This diagnosis highlights that the processes involved depend on location and altitude within the polynya region and involve a balance between vertical mixing, horizontal advection, and pressure gradient forces—vertical mixing acting as the initiating factor. This study provides a novel modeling framework used to isolate the atmospheric response to coastal polynyas, overcoming limitations of previous studies and coarse‐resolution models. It offers new insights into the role of polynyas in modulating regional climate and improving understanding of the processes driving their dynamics."

We use the dynamical adjustment approach to assess the contributions of atmospheric circulation and Soil moisture (SM) to this heatwave and find that they contributed 69.8% and 39.5%, respectively. The anomalous anticyclone that caused this heatwave was influenced by upstream signals. Easterly winds on the southern side of the anticyclone led to anomalous subsidence, which heated the air over North China. While such anomalous anticyclones over North China are not uncommon due to atmospheric circulation variability, the 2023 heatwave still broke records because the SM‐temperature coupling during the heatwave was unprecedented, with a strength four times that of typical years. The dry soil conditions during the heatwave stemmed from a lack of precipitation beforehand, with cumulative rainfall in North China being the lowest since 1979. The early dryness of the soil provided favorable conditions for land‐atmosphere feedback, and under the trigger of subsidence‐induced warming from the early summer anticyclone, the strong SM‐temperature coupling significantly amplified the intensity of this heatwave. For future projections, numerical experiment analysis shows that temperatures currently considered extreme during 2023 heatwave event will become commonplace in the future due to SM‐atmosphere coupling. However, by the end of the century, the impact of land‐atmosphere coupling on extreme high temperatures in North China will diminish compared to historical period, owing to increased SM."

Observations show a decline in WCAP from 1891 to 1946, followed by a recovery from 1947 to the recent decade. However, the relative contributions of external forcing and internal variability to these changes remain unclear. By analyzing observations and climate model simulations, this study finds that greenhouse gas forcing favors increasing WCAP, potentially offsetting drying trends driven by anthropogenic aerosols. Internal variability, primarily the phase transition of Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV), plays a dominant role in shaping WCAP trends. The AMV‐induced Rossby wave train, sustained by extracting baroclinic energy from the background mean flow, triggers barotropic atmospheric circulation anomalies that modulate WCAP. The cold‐to‐warm AMV phase transition (1891–1946) weakened the externally forced upward precipitation trend, reducing it from 0.19 to −0.20 mm month−1 decade−1. In contrast, the warm‐to‐cold phase transition (1947–1997) amplified the externally forced precipitation trend, increasing it from 0.28 to 0.99 mm month−1 decade−1. Under the high‐emission future scenario, the time of emergence of externally driven WCAP increases is projected to occur between 2030 and 2060, at least a decade earlier than the post‐2060 timeline projected under the medium‐emission scenario. These findings underscore the critical role of AMV in shaping WCAP variability and highlight the necessity of emission reductions to delay the time when externally driven precipitation increases exceed the region's adaptive capacity."

We examined soil carbon mineralization patterns under four common grassland management practices implemented on the Qinghai‐Tibetan Plateau (i.e., seasonal grazing, continuous grazing, perennial artificial grasslands, and annual artificial grasslands) using a 147‐day incubation experiment. We also analyzed soil properties, microbial communities, and carbon degradation genes to understand the mechanisms driving carbon mineralization. We observed distinct depth‐dependent responses to management practices. In surface soils (0–0.15 m), seasonal grazing exhibited the highest cumulative carbon mineralization (2993.32 mg CO2‐C kg−1), 1.5‐fold higher than annual artificial grasslands. However, in subsurface soils (0.15–0.30 m), continuous grazing showed the greatest cumulative carbon mineralization (2355.18 mg CO2‐C kg−1), 1.5‐fold higher than perennial artificial grasslands. Collectively, soil properties, carbon degradation genes, and fungal diversity explained 74% of the variation in cumulative carbon mineralization, with soil properties showing the strongest direct effect (path coefficient = 0.62). Interestingly, bacterial diversity exhibited a negative relationship with cumulative carbon mineralization, suggesting previously underappreciated mechanisms of carbon preservation involving microbial‐derived compounds and their interaction with soil minerals. The variability in the abundance of specific carbon degradation genes across grassland management practices revealed that peroxidase and limonene 1,2‐epoxide hydrolase genes showed positive correlations with cumulative carbon mineralization. Our results suggest that optimal soil carbon management in high‐altitude grasslands is challenging and requires careful consideration of both grassland management practices and soil depth, especially spatial and temporal patterns of grazing pressure."

Existing literature suggests that climate adaptation measures such as water conservation, cropland retirement, wastewater recycling, and managed aquifer recharge can alleviate some of these challenges. Few analyses, however, compare the relative efficacy and system‐wide effects of these adaptations under different climate projections across the entire Western United States. Here we use a Western US‐wide water systems model to evaluate, by sector and sub‐region, how the widespread implementation of these adaptive measures impacts water demands, water deliveries, and electricity use related to the water system for three different climate projections. We find that wastewater recycling has greater potential to lower unmet indoor water demands than urban indoor water conservation measures. However, when implemented at scale, indoor water conservation reduces electricity use by an average of 683 Terawatt hours while wastewater recycling increases energy use by an average of 721 Terawatt hours, cumulatively from 2020 to 2070. Cropland retirement and aquifer recharge adaptations increase the ability to meet agricultural water demand, increase groundwater storage, and reduce summertime electricity use. While most of these findings are consistent across different climate projections, the benefits of aquifer recharge are sensitive to spatial variation of precipitation. Given the limitations and tradeoffs of each individually, the results suggest that a portfolio of adaptation measures will be needed for a climate‐resilient water and energy future in the Western US."

This study investigates how urban and environmental factors affect particulate matter pollution (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) and its spatial inequality across 85 counties in Fujian, China. Twelve indicators across urban form, socio‐economic, and environmental domains were analyzed using principal component analysis and partial correlation networks. Our results show that while overall air pollution levels exhibit substantial variability, spatial inequality in exposure does not always correlate directly with these levels. Notably, while urbanized counties display higher pollution exposure, significant disparities in pollution distribution are observed within regions of similar pollution levels. Urban and socio‐economic features such as population density and road density are strongly correlated with higher pollution exposure, especially in more urbanized areas. In contrast, environmental factors, such as vegetation coverage and precipitation, significantly mitigate pollution levels. Principal component analysis reveals that development density and environmental changes primarily drive overall pollution levels, while economic activity and segregation contribute to the spatial inequality of exposure. Network analysis further corroborates that high‐density urban development exacerbates pollution exposure, while socio‐economic segregation contributes to uneven distribution across the population. Our findings underscore the need for integrated urban planning strategies that address these urban and environmental factors to reduce air pollution inequality and promote more equitable urban environments."

Community knowledge highlighted, among other sources, areas where cars and heavy‐duty vehicles idle, locations of construction, and locations of wood stoves. When creating a “traditional” land use regression (LUR) using easily accessible, and publicly available data sources, and a “community” LUR that uses community‐reported air pollution sources, model fit was improved in the community LURs for NO2 and NOx. This suggests that community knowledge can provide insight into sources that are not well captured in commonly used, publicly available data sets due to their transient and informal nature. Not all community‐reported short‐term events corresponded to peaks in monitor data, which could reflect that reports were more correlated with unmeasured pollutants. We suggest that future studies collecting community knowledge on short‐term pollution events through community mapping lower barriers to participation (i.e., through hosting a series of drop‐in events, providing childcare, or timing any event to coincide with neighborhood‐wide events).

 PINK1/Parkin-mediated ubiquitin-dependent mitophagy is a critical negative regulatory machinery for browning in the inguinal white adipose tissue (iWAT). However, the precise regulatory mechanism underlying PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy during browning of iWAT remains largely unknown. Here we report that PNPLA7, an Endoplasmic Reticulum and mitochondria-associated membrane (MAM) protein, inhibits browning of iWAT by promoting PINK1/Parkin-mediated mitophagy upon cold challenge or β3-adrenergic receptor agonist treatment. With genetic manipulation in mice, we show that adipose tissue overexpressing PNPLA7 induces mitophagy, abolishes iWAT browning and interrupts adaptive thermogenesis. Conversely, conditional ablation of PNPLA7 in adipose tissue promotes browning of iWAT, resulting in enhanced adaptive thermogenesis. Mechanistically, PNPLA7 interacts with Parkin to promote mitochondrial recruitment of Parkin for mitophagy activation and mitochondria degradation by disrupting PKA-induced phosphorylation of Parkin under cold challenge. Taken together, our findings suggest that PNPLA7 is a critical regulator of mitophagy that resists cold-induced browning of iWAT, thus providing a direct mechanistic link between mitophagy and browning of iWAT.

 Solid solutions are a unique and elegant crystal engineering strategy to control the properties of crystalline materials, and the tunability of physicochemical properties it provides has a wide scope of applications. In this research, we bring this strategy to the realm of smart molecular crystals and explore solid solutions of organic photomechanical crystals to create flexible structures that exhibit a gradient of predetermined emissive, mechanical, and reactive properties. Specifically, we demonstrate that fluorescence, mechanical properties, and solid-state photoreactivity in a binary mixed crystal system of 9-anthraldehyde (9AA) and 9-methylanthracene (9MA) can be simultaneously and precisely tuned simply by changing the composition. The statistical distribution of the two components in the solid solution was utilized to prepare a heterodimer by a cross-reaction between the molecules of the two components. The effect of doping on the rate and the extent of the solid-state photoreaction further enables modulation of the photomechanical bending of the crystals. This study shows that the solid solution method enables access to smart adaptive crystals that can perform specific solid-state photoreactions, exhibit a photomechanical response, and support flexible organic devices that cannot be achieved through conventional chemical modification strategies.

 Timely access to DNA lesions is crucial for genome integrity. This process requires profound remodeling of densely packed chromatin to establish a repair-competent architecture. However, limited resolution has made it impossible to fully understand these remodeling events. Here, combining microirradiation with live-cell multiscale imaging, we report that DNA damage-induced changes in genome packing rely on the conformational behaviour of the chromatin fiber. Immediately after damage, a transient increase in nucleosome mobility switches chromatin from a densely-packed state to a looser conformation, making it accessible to repair. While histone poly-ADP-ribosylation is required to trigger this switch, mono-ADP-ribosylation is sufficient to maintain the open-chromatin state. The removal of these histone marks by the ARH3 hydrolase then leads to chromatin recondensation. Together, our multiscale study of chromatin dynamics establishes a global model: distinct waves of histone ADP-ribosylation control nucleosome mobility, triggering a transient breathing of chromatin, crucial for initiating the DNA damage response. Chromatin “breathing” at DNA lesions is controlled by different waves of histone ADP-ribosylation."

 The pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase (PylRS) is widely used to incorporate noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs) into proteins. However, the yields of most ncAA-containing protein  remain low due to the limited activity of PylRS variants. Here, we apply machine learning to engineer the tRNA-binding domain of PylRS. The FFT-PLSR model is first applied to explore pairwise combinations of 12 single mutations, generating a variant Com1-IFRS with an 11-fold increase in stop codon suppression (SCS) efficiency. Deep learning models ESM-1v, Mutcompute, and ProRefiner are then used to identify additional mutation sites. Applying FFT-PLSR on these sites yields a variant Com2-IFRS showing a 30.8-fold increase in SCS efficiency, and up to 7.8-fold improvement in the catalytic efficiency (kcat/KmtRNA). Transplanting these mutations into 7 PylRS-derived synthetases significantly improves the yields of proteins containing 6 types of ncAAs.

 Plastic pollution is one of most daunting sustainability challenges. Multi-functional and biodegradable plastics are critical for both desirable end-of-life outcomes and petrochemical plastics replacement. Current bioplastics are either: short of mechanical properties, like polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB); lack room temperature biodegradability, like polylactic acid (PLA); or lack the functionality to create additional values. Here, we present the bioinspired Layered, Ecological, Advanced, and multi-Functional Film (LEAFF), for sustainable plastic packaging. This biomimetic composite, based on the structure of the natural plant leaf, synergistically improves mechanical strength while empowering PLA for rapid ambient soil biodegradability, achieving complete degradation in 5 weeks. The film is also highly transparent and water stable, and achieves high gas barrier properties to improve food shelf life and reduce waste. The biomimetic design showcases the synergistic advantage leveraged by the LEAFF’s multilayer structure to enhance mechanical performance while simultaneously retaining biodegradability and achieving multifunctionality for broad applications.

 The integration of basally located progenitors into an existing epithelium, termed apical emergence, is crucial for the morphogenesis and homeostasis of epithelial tissues and organs. Using Xenopus as a model system, we explore the role of intracellular calcium in apical emergence during the development of mucociliary skin epithelium. Our findings reveal that calcium transients precede the apical emergence of Multiciliated cell (MCC) progenitors and are essential for their insertion into the overlying skin epithelium. Furthermore, we demonstrate that phospholipase C (PLC) activity is required for generating calcium transients, which regulate MCC apical emergence via Calmodulin. The PLC/Ca²⁺/Calmodulin axis is necessary for the function of the apical actin network by influencing its stability. Lastly, we show that intracellular calcium regulates apical emergence in distinct basal progenitors.

 Clonal deletion through negative selection is critical to eliminate autoreactive T cells in the thymus. Negative selection, however, is imperfect such that some autoreactive thymocytes can escape thymic deletion and successfully populate peripheral tissues. This is also the case for autoreactive 2D2 TCR transgenic T cells, a widely employed mouse model in studying the pathogenesis of CD4 T cell-mediated experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. How autoreactive 2D2 thymocytes evade negative selection, however, remains incompletely understood. Here we show that negative selection of MHC-II-restricted thymocytes, specifically 2D2 TCR transgenic T cells, is associated with the induction of integrin CD103, and that forced expression of CD103 downregulates CXCR4 expression, alters intra-thymic trafficking, and reinforces clonal deletion of immature thymocytes. Stratification of positively versus negatively selected 2D2 T cells based on their distinct coreceptor expression further shows that CD103 does not affect the generation of conventional CD4 T cells but is deleterious for autoreactive CD4, CD8 double-negative 2D2 T cells that correspond to CD69-negative CCR7-intermediate thymocytes, displaying markers of agonistic TCR signalling. Collectively, these results propose CD103 expression as an indicator and contributor of negative selection for MHC-II-restricted T cells, providing further mechanistic insights into the process of T cell selection in the thymus.

Here the authors use eddy covariance data to show that respiration may adapt to warmer temperatures and carbon losses may be lower than expected. 
 Ecosystem respiration (ER) is the largest contributor to terrestrial carbon loss. ER responds positively to increasing temperature, so a warming world is hypothesized to lead to additional CO2 release, potentially further exacerbating climate warming. The long-term influence of thermal changes on this carbon–climate feedback, however, remains unresolved. Here, by compiling data from 221 eddy covariance sites worldwide, we observe decreases in the temperature sensitivity and reference respiration rates of ER with increasing mean annual temperature, suggesting that ER adapts to temperature changes. Our results further reveal that thermal adaptation would eliminate 17.91–31.41% of the anticipated increase in the respiration of unadapted ecosystems under future warming scenarios, equivalent to a net carbon loss of 0.85–11.83 Pg C per year. The increase in respiration rates of terrestrial ecosystems in response to climate warming may thus be lower than predicted, with important consequences for modulating future terrestrial carbon–climate feedback. Terrestrial ecosystems are expected to release more carbon under warming due to temperature-driven increases in ecosystem respiration.

 The use of molybdenum isotopes (δ98Mo) as a paleo-redox proxy requires quantifications of fluxes and isotopic fractionations in each molybdenum sink. However, no systematic tests on δ98Mo variations in different oxic sediments have been made due to limitations of analytical precision and sample number in pioneering studies. Here, we present the δ98Mo data of ferromanganese nodules sampled at various global basins, which exhibit large variations from −0.95‰ to −0.51‰ with appreciable negative correlations between δ98Mo and manganese–iron ratios. Diagenetic nodules, experiencing dissolution and re-precipitation of manganese oxides in marine sediments, have lower δ98Mo by ~0.3‰ and higher molybdenum contents relative to hydrogenetic nodules. We suggest that changes in relative proportions of manganese and iron oxides and early diagenesis of marine sediments likely influence overall molybdenum isotope fractionations in oxic sinks. Hence, evolution of ancient marine manganese and iron cycles can influence sedimentary δ98Mo signatures, especially in low-oxygen Precambrian oceans.

 Landfalling tropical cyclones frequently occur with strong winds and heavy rainfall, providing substantial water resources. The positive impacts of tropical cyclones on drought alleviation and termination remain unknown. Here, we estimate the dependency of drought terminations on tropical cyclone rainfall through frequency analyses and event coincidence analysis. Results show that ~3% of the tropical cyclone-affected areas have experienced multiple drought events terminated by tropical cyclone rainfall from 1999 to 2021. Globally, tropical cyclone-terminated drought events averaged 1.12 annually and increased significantly by 1.92% per year. Increases were especially significant in the Arabian Peninsula, South Asia, and the northwest of Australia.

 In recent years, research in flood mapping from remote sensing satellite imagery has predominantly focused on deep learning methods. While new flood segmentation models are increasingly being proposed, most of these works focus on advancing architectures trained on single datasets. Therefore, these studies overlook the intrinsic limitations and biases of the available training and evaluation data. This often leads to poor generalization and overconfident predictions when these models are used in real-world scenarios. To address this gap, the objective of this work is twofold. First, we train and evaluate flood segmentation models on five publicly available datasets including data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2, and both SAR and multispectral modalities. Our findings reveal that models achieving high detection accuracy on a single dataset (intra-dataset validation) do not necessarily generalize well to unseen datasets. In contrast, models trained on more diverse samples from multiple datasets demonstrate greater robustness and generalization ability. Furthermore, we present a dual-stream multimodal architecture that can be independently trained and tested on both single-modality and dual-modality datasets. This enables the integration of all the diversity and richness of the available data into a single unified framework. The results emphasize the need for a more comprehensive validation using diverse and well-designed datasets, particularly for multimodal approaches. If not adequately addressed, the shortcomings of current datasets can significantly limit the potential of deep learning-based operational flood mapping approaches."

 Northeast China is one of China’s most important rice production bases, contributing about one-fifth of the country’s rice production. In recent years, several agricultural policies have been implemented in Northeast China to adjust crop structures, driven by economic and ecological benefits. Timely monitoring of the changed pattern of rice cultivation is a prerequisite for policy assessment. Current paddy rice mapping methods are experiencing uncertainties due to confusion with wetlands and are highly parameter-dependent. To these, in this study, we developed a paddy rice mapping framework that integrates automatically generated training samples, time series features from key cultivation stages, and a deep learning model to improve paddy rice identification accuracy in Northeast China, which is a typical rice-wetland coexisting area. We produced 10 m paddy rice maps for 2019–2023 in Northeast China and examined their changes under agricultural policy implementation.

 Biodegradation of small organics by bacteria in the atmosphere efficiently competes with chemical losses despite the low number concentration of metabolically active bacteria. We measured biodegradation rates of formaldehyde by three bacterial strains isolated from fog water (belonging to the genera Comamonas, Pseudomonas and Methylobacterium) as a function of pH (4.8–6.8), with invariably highest rates for each strain at the highest pH. We also investigated the potential impact of formaldehyde biodegradation in the presence of sulfite on hydroxymethanosulfonate (HMS), an adduct of formaldehyde and S(IV) frequently detected in fog and cloud water. Our observations show that HMS formation reduces the rate of formaldehyde biodegradation by acting as a formaldehyde reservoir. The newly determined biodegradation rates were incorporated into a state-of-the-art atmospheric multiphase chemistry box model that realistically considers a small fraction of fog droplets contain bacteria to simulate for the first time the effect of biodegradation on formaldehyde and HMS concentrations under typical conditions of night-time radiation fog. The model results suggest that biodegradation decreases the concentration of formaldehyde by ∼1 % and that of HMS <0.1 %, i.e., likely below detection thresholds needed to confidently attribute changes in aqueous phase concentrations to biodegradation. The loss by biodegradation may contribute as much to the total loss of aqueous phase formaldehyde as chemical reactions since during night-time also chemical losses are small. The discrepancies between high biodegradation rates measured in laboratory and the low impaction on atmospheric chemistry from modelling findings can be attributed to differences in timescales (72–84 h in the lab vs. ∼1-h fog droplet lifetimes) and oxidative conditions, which result in rapid S(IV) oxidation in fog, thus limiting HMS formation."

 Aerosol-Cloud Interactions (ACI) plays a crucial role in the Earth's energy balance and significantly contribute to global climate change. However, the radiative forcing due to ACI remain highly uncertain, in both observational and model-based studies. In this study, we utilize an observational approach to quantify the effective radiative forcing due to ACI (ERFaci) over the Northern Indian Ocean (NIO) during 2003–2021. The results show that warm marine boundary layer clouds exert a negative forcing (cooling effect) at the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA), driven by both cloud albedo effect (intrinsic forcing) and cloud fraction adjustment (extrinsic forcing). In details, on a basin-scale, the annual mean intrinsic radiative forcing is about 17 % stronger over the Bay of Bengal (BoB: −0.48 ± 0.52 Wm−2) than over the Arabian Sea (AS: −0.41 ± 0.37 Wm−2). In contrast, extrinsic forcing is almost similar over both the basins (AS: −0.66 ± 0.39 Wm−2; and BoB: −0.64 ± 0.68 Wm−2). Annually extrinsic forcing is 61 % higher than intrinsic forcing over the AS and 33 % higher over the BoB. However, on a seasonal basis, the relative difference increases up to 269 % (101 %) and 304 % (197 %) during winter (post-monsoon) over the AS and BoB, respectively. These seasonal variations are further supported by positive correlations between cloudy-sky albedo (⁓ 0.02–0.06) and low-level liquid cloud fraction (⁓ 0.02–0.04) with the aerosol index (AI) across the region. The shortwave components of ERFaci (SWRFaci) dominate the annual mean NetRFaci, contributing approximately 106 % and 80 % over the AS and BoB, respectively. The strong SWRFaci over the NIO could be attributed to two main factors: an increase in anthropogenic pollution during the study period or, possibly a retrieval bias inherent in satellite-based observation. Thus, if the former, our ERFaci estimates can serve as useful reference estimates for assessing ACI effects in regional model simulations."

This study identifiesd-serine as a crucial regulator of gut ROS during SD. Knockdown of serine racemase (SR), the enzyme responsible ford-serine production, prevents the enhanced ROS buildup during SD inDrosophila. Gut enterocytes (ECs) respond to γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) signaling by producingd-serine, which influences downstreamN-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activity and modulates sleep pressure. However, the continuous demand for sleep disrupts this feedback loop. Prolonged SD leads to increased levels ofd-serine in the gut, an elevated pyruvate pool in ECs, enhanced mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, impaired lipid metabolism in peroxisomes, and the accumulation of harmful ROS. In conclusion, our findings illuminate the metabolic alterations and brain-gut communication pathways that may contribute to the increase in gutd-serine and subsequent ROS accumulation induced by SD."

The FGTNM features a small footprint (53 square micrometers) and low energy consumption (9.1 femtojoules per operation), outperforming previous CMOS-based modules. System-level IMC using the FGTNM shows a high accuracy (89.97%) on CIFAR-10 classification.

Inhibition of ac4C levels in vitro substantially reduced oocyte translation efficiency. Notably, through trace-cell ac4C-RNA immunoprecipitation (acRIP) sequencing, we mapped the ac4C landscape in SLE mouse oocytes and found that deficient ac4C modification substantially impaired the translation ofZygote arrest 1. Furthermore, we demonstrated that nicotinamide treatment notably and safely improved the quantity and quality of oocytes in SLE mice by enhancing ac4C modification levels.

We analyzed 58,007 US women with two or more singleton live births (146,064 pregnancies, 1956–2015). Offspring sex followed a beta-binomial rather than a simple binomial distribution, indicating that each family may have a unique probability of male or female births, akin to a weighted coin toss. Deviations from simple binomial distribution were more pronounced when we excluded each woman’s last birth to reduce the influence of sex-based stopping behavior. After excluding the last birth, older maternal age at first birth was associated with higher odds of having offspring of only one sex.

Here, we tackle these challenges by introducing multicomponent precipitates with much increased antiphase boundary (APB) energy. In a model Ni3Al-type (L12) precipitation-hardened face-centered cubic (FCC) NiCo-based alloy, we incorporate multiple elements at the Al sublattice sites within the precipitates, reducing antisite defects and enhancing ordering degree. This process yields multicomponent precipitates with an ultrahigh APB energy (~308 ± 14 millijoules per square meter), which notably strengthens the alloy. Moreover, the exceptionally high APB energy transforms the deformation mechanism from dislocation shearing to stacking fault shearing, thereby avoiding glide plane softening.

Adjacent earthquake swarms, separated by long quiescent periods, are found to be a dominant feature. We suggest that these swarms are controlled by the interplay between slowly diffusing aqueous fluids and rapid episodic fluid injections, which may result from the breaking of permeability seals. Our analyses also indicate that clustered seismicity beneath the caldera occurs on relatively immature, rougher fault structures, compared to more planar faults outside.

Despite extensive research on bone regeneration influenced by scaffold architecture, present studies have not addressed the biological mechanism underlying scaffold architecture-induced stress stimulation (SASS) on cells yet, posing a great challenge in revealing the biomechanical cues between scaffold architecture and osteogenic progression. Therefore, graphite, fullerene, and diamond scaffolds with gradient stress stimulation to cells after deformation were prepared. The cellular biomechanical mechanisms of SASS through single-cell RNA sequencing indicated that architectures providing SASS can induce the enrichment of focal adhesion and osteogenic differentiation pathways of bone mesenchymal stem cells and balance bone resorption of osteoclasts and bone formation of osteoblasts. Besides, SASS enhances bone regeneration for repairing critical-sized defects in vivo. These results provide insights for artificial bone scaffold design and clarify the biomechanical cues between SASS and osteogenic progression."

To address this limitation, we developed an artificial intelligence (AI) model that leverages cell morphology features and histological spatial organization to classify tumor cell differentiation status, infer cell dynamic trajectories, and quantify tumor progression from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)–stained whole-slide images. In three independent lung adenocarcinoma cohorts, our AI-based model accurately predicted cell differential status and provided quantifiable measures of tumor progression that were prognostic of patient survival. Spatial transcriptomic integrative analyses revealed cell components and gene signatures enriched in different cell differentiation statuses. Bulk transcriptomic analyses revealed that fast-progressing tumors exhibit up-regulated cell cycle pathways, while slow-progressing tumors retain characteristics of normal lung epithelium. This cost-effective method enables large-scale analysis of tumor progression dynamics using routinely collected pathology slides and provides insights into intratumor heterogeneity."

These excitations exhibit unique properties such as frequency-dispersive optical axes and asymmetric light propagation and energy dissipation. However, only non-vdW materials have been demonstrated to support hyperbolic shear polaritons, limiting their exotic properties and potential applications. Here, we introduce shear phenomena in low symmetry crystals by demonstrating elliptical and canalized shear phonon polaritons in gypsum, an exfoliable monoclinic sulphate mineral. Our results unveil a topological transition from hyperbolic shear to elliptical shear polaritons, passing through a canalization regime with strong field confinement. We observe a notable slowdown of group velocity, reaching values as low as 0.0005c. These findings expand the application scope of low-symmetry crystals with the benefits that an exfoliable material provides, such as stronger field confinement, tunability, and versatility for its incorporation in complex photonic devices."

To mitigate this secondary injury, we hypothesized that delivery of a fibrin-binding hemostatic polymer, PolySTAT, would act as a molecular patch and ameliorate brain vessel damage following TBI. We developed a three-dimensional (3D) pathology and analysis workflow to quantify the effects of PolySTAT versus a control polymer, PolySCRM, on neurovascular networks and neural tissue in whole mouse brains. Using a panel of fluorescent probes, our 3D pathology pipeline revealed that PolySTAT treatment preserves neurovascular density and function, reduces hypoxia and blood extravasation, and reduces brain tissue loss after TBI. To further corroborate the 3D microscopy–based findings, gene expression analyses show that PolySTAT attenuates the expression of inflammation and reactive gliosis biomarkers. These findings support future translational investigation of intravenous PolySTAT as an early post-injury therapy to mitigate neural tissue loss after TBI."

Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) offer a potential solution to combat bacterial resistance. However, key challenges remain in addressing the limitations of current peptide drugs and biomaterials, such as narrow action modes, poor protease stability, and challenges in pathogen-specific targeting. This study introduces a series of multifunctional AMPs by integrating self-assembling systems. By regulating the length of cationic amino acid side chains, the optimized peptide Nhar was identified as a triple-functional candidate with the potential to solve these limitations. In aqueous solutions, Nhar self-assembles into nanofibers that trap pathogens, prevent their spread, and selectively kill Gram-positive bacteria. Nhar demonstrates remarkable protease resistance, retaining antimicrobial activity even under protease conditions (10 milligrams per milliliter). It induces bacterial death primarily through membrane disruption and multiple synergistic mechanisms. In aStaphylococcus aureus–induced mouse bacteremia model, Nhar showed promising therapeutic potential. This work offers important insights for developing multifunctional antimicrobial therapies."

A notable example of this is the production of hydrogen gas (H2) and oxidants from rock fracturing. However, the potential interactions between these initial redox pairs and a key subsurface element—iron (Fe)—remain underexplored. Here, we simulated radical-induced water splitting to investigate the formation and evolution of redox gradients. Our results show that in the presence of Fe, ferrous iron (Fe2+) was marginally oxidized to ferric iron (Fe3+) by low concentrations of oxidants, whereas Fe3+was efficiently reduced back to Fe2+by reactive hydrogen atoms (•H). We propose that crustal faulting can generate various redox pairs and drive Fe redox cycling, thereby providing a sustained energy source for subsurface life on Earth and potentially on other planetary bodies."

Polymeric ligands address this limitation by enabling tunable nanocrystal softness through modifications of polymer molecular weight and grafting density. Here, we investigate phase transitions in polymer-grafted nanooctahedra by varying polymer length, nanocrystal size, truncation, and ligand density. In two-dimensional superlattices, longer polymers or smaller nanooctahedra induce a transition from orientationally ordered to hexagonal rotator lattices. In three-dimensional superlattices, increasing polymer length drives transitions from Minkowski to body-centered cubic and plastic hexagonal close-packed phases, while higher grafting densities further enable transitions to simple hexagonal phases. Polymer brush and thermodynamic perturbation theories, supported by Monte Carlo simulations, uncover the entropic and enthalpic forces that govern these transitions.

BLIMP1 inhibits IL-2 production by T cells; however, its role in IL-2 signaling remains unknown.

DeletingPRDM1in human CD4+T cells and Tregcells also increased IL-2 signaling. Furthermore, CD4+T cells from patients with ATL expressed less BLIMP1 and had enhanced IL-2 signaling, whereas overexpressingPRDM1in ATL cells suppressed IL-2 signaling. Thus, BLIMP1 inhibits IL-2 signaling during normal and pathophysiological responses, suggesting that manipulating BLIMP1 could have therapeutic potential."

Although seismic evidence for a BMO exists on present-day Mars and the Moon, the Earth’s BMO is (near-)completely solidified. Seismically observed “large low-velocity provinces” (LLVPs) are thought to have resulted from the canonical “fractional” style of BMO crystallization. However, we show using thermodynamic modeling that BMO fractional crystallization yields lowermost-mantle densities much higher than those of LLVPs. In turn, pollution of the BMO by progressive addition of recycled basaltic crust and related “reactive crystallization” can reconcile LLVP volumes, densities, and compositions. This model also makes testable predictions of the compositions of “ultralow-velocity zones,” enigmatic deep Earth seismic domains, and possible BMO remnants. The critical role of crustal pollution elucidates the survival of a BMO on Mars, but implies an Earth-like fate for any Venusian BMO."

RTL8 confers on UBQLN2 the ability to complex with and regulate PEG10. PEG10, a core component of stress granules, drives the recruitment of UBQLN2 to stress granules under various stress conditions but can only do so when RTL8 is present. Changes in UBQLN2, RTL8, or PEG10 levels further remodel the kinetics of stress granule disassembly and translation recovery. PEG10 also alters overall stress granule composition by incorporating select extracellular vesicle proteins. Within stress granules, PEG10 forms virus-like particles, underscoring the structural heterogeneity of this class of biomolecular condensates.
