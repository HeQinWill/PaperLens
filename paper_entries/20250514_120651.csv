Globally, a prevailing greening trend has been observed over the past decades using remote-sensing normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), suggesting increasing vegetation cover and primary productivity. However, NDVI responses to warming differ across regions. Cold, energy-limited alpine and tundra ecosystems tend to respond positively to warming, while arid, water-limited ecosystems may experience reduced NDVI due to higher transpiration rates limiting plant growth. Additionally, CO2 fertilization effect enhances vegetation productivity by improving plant water use efficiency. This study investigates the drivers of temporal trends in annual maximum NDVI (NDVImax) along an elevational gradient in the arid Western Himalaya (Ladakh, India). We hypothesize that NDVImax will be more sensitive to precipitation anomalies at lower elevations, whereas at higher elevations it will be more sensitive to temperature anomalies. Using Landsat satellite data from 2001 to 2022, we related NDVImax temporal anomalies to temperature and precipitation obtained from the ERA5-Land reanalysis dataset, and local snow cover from MODIS. Our results show complex interactions between climate and elevation that influence NDVImax. Contrary to our expectations, precipitation exhibited a strong positive effect on NDVImax across all elevations and seasons, except for autumn at higher elevations. Temperature effects were weaker and varied across seasons and elevations. Higher summer temperatures increased NDVImax at higher elevations but decreased it at lower elevations. We observed a multidecadal greening trend independent of temperature and precipitation, with this greening being more pronounced at lower elevations. This study highlights the importance of context dependency in understanding vegetation dynamics in fragile, low-productivity mountain ecosystems."

However, the predictive capability to capture the impact on solar electricity production still needs to be improved. For example, in the summer of 2023, smoke from Canadian wildfires spread to the northeastern U.S., impacting solar PV output in the region. The New York Independent System Operator (NYISO) day-ahead forecasts for this period significantly overpredicted PV output. This paper presents novel machine learning-based models for predicting the hourly solar capacity factor, focusing on improving predictive performance during periods of severe wildfire smoke. The results demonstrate a R2 value of up to 0.85 for the severe wildfire periods (aerosol optical depth (AOD) above the 99.99th percentile) from our models, significantly outperforming NYISO’s R2 value of 0.50 across six load zones included in the analysis. The greatly enhanced performance arises from two innovations. First, we adopted a series of data products, newly available in the public domain, from the high-resolution rapid refresh smoke (HRRR-Smoke) weather forecasting system. These include predictions of the AOD and the downward shortwave radiation flux incorporating aerosol impacts. Our study marks the first time the HRRR-Smoke wildfire AOD product has been used in solar electricity forecasts. Second, we employed upsampling strategies to address the data imbalance issues due to the inherently infrequent nature of wildfire events. As the data products are publicly available, our methodology can be readily adopted by power system operators to enhance predictions of solar electricity production during periods of wildfire smoke, ensuring the reliability of power grids with high penetration of solar energy."

Understanding the damage magnitude and preparing for the folly of its occurrence are critical given current geopolitical tensions. We developed and applied a framework to simulate global crop production under a nuclear winter using the Cycles agroecosystem model, incorporating ultraviolet (UV)-B radiation effects on plant growth and adaptive selection of crop maturity types (shorter cycle the lower the temperature). Using maize (Zea maize L.) as a sentinel crop, we found that annual maize production could decline from 7% after a small-scale regional nuclear war with 5 Tg soot injection, to 80% after a global nuclear war with 150 Tg soot injection, with recovery taking from 7 to 12 years. UV-B damage would peak 6–8 years post-war and can further decrease annual maize production by 7%. Over the recovery period, adaptive selection of maize maturity types to track changing temperatures could increase production by 10% compared to a no-adaptation strategy. Seed availability may become a critical adaptation bottleneck; this and prior studies might underestimate food production declines. We propose that adaptation must include the development of Agricultural Resilience Kits consisting of region- and climate-specific seed and technology packages designed to buffer against uncertainty while supply chains recover. These kits would be congenial with the transient conditions during the recovery period, and would also be applicable to other catastrophes affecting food production."

While current seasonal forecasting systems provide monthly precipitation forecasts operationally, their coarse resolution limits their effectiveness in capturing the localized precipitation patterns and snowpack conditions essential for water resource managers in the mountainous regions. Here, analog statistical downscaling is demonstrated as an effective approach to enhance the spatial resolution of operational seasonal forecasts provided by the North American Multi-Model Ensemble. Downscaling was performed by building an analog ‘library’, in which corresponding model forecasts and observed values during the training period were stored. In the testing period, unseen model forecasts referenced the closest historical forecast from the analog library and applied the corresponding observational value for each point. This analysis indicates that downscaled products can capture localized features more accurately than the original coarse resolution forecasts, reducing forecast error across the western United States. Moreover, downscaling individual ensemble members—rather than downscaling the ensemble mean—further reduces forecasting error for their multi-model ensemble mean products. The greatest error reductions in the downscaled product, measured by root mean squared error (RMSE), were observed at low to mid-elevations (500–2000 meters), with 50%–70% improvement relative to the original forecasts. In the higher elevations (2000 meters and above), changes in RMSE relative to the original forecast were limited to 10%–30% improvements. The improvement is more substantial for forecast systems with 10 ensemble members compared to that with 4 members, but this relationship does not hold for the system with 24 ensemble members. These findings show that analog statistical downscaling can effectively address the spatial limitations of seasonal precipitation forecasts with minimal computational cost, providing a valuable framework for enhancing coarse resolution forecasting products while providing insights into the timing of ensemble mean calculations during the downscaling process."

The scientific case for phasing out coal-fired electricity is clear, and many countries are progressing towards this. However, despite widespread concerns about risks and trade-offs, natural gas is often considered a bridge fuel, and there is currently no progress towards phasing down its capacity. Previous work on the political feasibility of coal phase-out only considered limited socio-political factors, missing the importance of governance quality and policies supporting the energy transition. There is even more limited understanding of factors associated with gas phase-down, while Europe and North America fall behind trajectories required to limit warming below 1.5 °C. We use multivariate regression and clustering analyses on over four decades of data to investigate the drivers and synergies of coal and gas transitions. This reveals opportunities to overcome fossil fuel lock-in through renewable energy expansion, energy policy reforms, and power market restructuring. Countries with greater reliance on fossil fuel infrastructure and workforce face additional difficulties in phase out. Social factors such as higher belief in climate change are positively linked with more ambitious coal phase-out efforts. However, disentangling these links for gas remains difficult given the limited historical evidence of phase-down progress. We identify four archetypes (Coal Reliance, Gas Reliance, Limited Policy, and Transition Underway) that illustrate different ways countries have transitioned from coal and gas over time. These provide blueprints for potential future transitions in other countries. Recognizing the diverse social, political, and institutional factors that shape transitions can inform the design of politically relevant future scenarios."

Using the Community Earth System Model version 2 Large Ensemble Community Project, we investigate the impact of BB variability on the tropical climate response. High BB variability leads to increased precipitation and a southward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) in the central Pacific (CP) and western Pacific (WP), but reduces precipitation and causes a northward ITCZ shift in the eastern Pacific (EP) and the Atlantic Ocean (AO). This ITCZ displacement is associated with the north–south tilt of the Walker circulation. High variability increases cloud cover over the CP and WP, which induces negative outgoing long-wave radiation (OLR) anomalies in the Southern Hemisphere. Lower OLR values cause cross-equatorial heat transport and lead to a southward ITCZ shift. Conversely, cloud thinning corresponds to higher OLR values and a northward ITCZ shift in the EP and AO. Our results unravel the mechanisms linking BB variability and large-scale circulation through aerosol–cloud–radiation interactions."

In this study, eddy covariance flux measurements from 50 forest ecosystems were integrated with simulations from 14 terrestrial biosphere models to investigate how climate conditions and atmospheric CO2 concentrations regulate forest GPP. This approach bridges site-level observations with biome-scale model estimates to develop a global understanding. Our findings suggest that in boreal and cold temperate regions, temperature primarily constrains the enhancement of the CO2 fertilization on forest GPP; however, warming and higher atmospheric CO2 levels are projected to alleviate these limitations. In tropical forests, CO2 fertilization strongly enhances GPP, but this benefit will be counterbalanced by the adverse impacts of projected climate warming. Consequently, the interplay between climate and atmospheric CO2 in affecting forest GPP is dynamic and subject to continual change."

This study investigated the relationship between these accelerated drying phenomena of flash droughts (FDs) and forest fire occurrence across 43 Indian ecoregions from 1979 to 2023, revealing patterns of escalating forest fire risk. We employed a four-criteria methodology based on the evaporative stress ratio (ESR) to identify and characterize FD events. The criteria included temporal duration (minimum 30 d), severity (SESR ⩽ 20th percentile), intensification rate (ΔSESR ⩽ 40th percentile), and mean intensification (ΔSESRz ⩽ 25th percentile). Our analysis uncovered significant regional variations in event frequency, with mountainous regions showing vulnerability—the Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe experienced 31 rapid drying events, while the Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests recorded only 10 events. The temporal analysis revealed clear seasonal patterns, with June being the primary onset month in 17.8% of ecoregions, followed by January and October, each dominating 14% of regions. Critically, 79.1% of ecoregions showed increasing forest fire trends from 2001 to 2023, with the Orissa semi-evergreen forests displaying significant vulnerability. High-altitude and semi-arid regions showed statistically significant positive correlations between rapid drying frequency and fire incidents (r = 0.68, p = 0.002 in Karakoram-West Tibetan Plateau alpine steppe; r = 0.59, p = 0.004 in Thar desert), suggesting that accelerated moisture depletion creates conditions conducive to fire outbreaks in these vulnerable ecosystems. Most ecoregions experienced these drying events for 1%–2% of the study period, indicating that even brief episodes of rapid desiccation can trigger lasting ecological impacts. These findings highlight the urgent need for integrated drought-fire management strategies that account for the unique challenges posed by rapid onset drying events in different ecological contexts."

While most climate models agree on the externally forced wetting signal in global monsoon precipitation (GMP), the chaotic nature of internal variability introduces substantial uncertainty in future projections, particularly in the near term. In this study, we utilize multi-model simulations and four sets of large-ensemble simulations to investigate the role of internal variability, particularly the interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO), in influencing uncertainty in future monsoon precipitation changes. We find that the externally forced wetting trend in GMP surpasses the range of internal variability only after the 2040s under both the SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Prior to this, internal variability contributes over 40% of the uncertainty in GMP projections, with the IPO accounting for nearly half of this internally induced uncertainty. To inform adaptation and mitigation efforts, we further propose near-term storylines of monsoon precipitation changes at both global and regional scales. Specifically, a transition from a negative to a positive phase of the IPO at a rate of +1 SD per decade during 2021–2040 leads to a decrease in GMP by −0.41% (−0.23%) per decade relative to 1995–2014 under the SSP2-4.5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario, while the reverse transition leads to an increase of 1.35% (1.53%) per decade.

Despite their significance, a comprehensive investigation into the effects of parametric uncertainty on their hydrologic predictions across diverse regions and flow characteristics remains lacking. This study contributes by detailing how variations in the response of the Community Water Model (CWatM) can be linked to the uncertainty associated with hydrologic parameters. Relying on the default hydrologic model parameters in CWatM may pose a risk, potentially leading to inaccurate streamflow predictions and improper decision-making in subsequent inferences. To confirm this, we first assess the effectiveness of CWatM in predicting streamflow across 481 basins spanning the Eurasian continent, utilizing the commonly employed default hydrologic parameters. Subsequently, we evaluate CWatM simulations using a comprehensive range of parameter realizations, employing the Latin Hypercube Sampling-based approach, and evaluate the daily performance based on 10 error metrics. Our results confirm the presence of significant variations in CWatM predictions in specific regions and across selected error metrics. In particular, the baseline CWatM exhibits relatively poor streamflow prediction skill in certain Eurasian regions, such as the arid region over Central Asia. In addition, the results show that the complex nonlinear behaviors in streamflow predictions are evident not only due to the overarching uncertainty in hydrologic parameters but also arise from the influence of the most dominant parameters. Ultimately, this exploration of parameter realizations offers insights for enhancing CWatM’s predictive capabilities and refining parameter selection in future studies."

Using forecasts initialised on 1 November 2009, transplanting more realistic cooler conditions in the South Pacific across ensemble members on 1 January 2010 significantly cools the resulting 2010/2011 winter ENSO one year later. The imposed perturbations migrate equatorward via wind–evaporation–sea surface temperature feedback and significantly alter tropical zonal gradients during late spring and summer. This drives the ensemble towards La Niña conditions, in line with observations. Repeating the experiment with warmer South Pacific conditions, results in the reverse signal and warms ENSO one year later. Across the experiments we find an almost four-fold increase in probability of La Niña and a three-fold decrease in probability of El Niño, demonstrating that long lead regional perturbations can systematically tip the climate system between ENSO states. Predicted surface conditions are significantly impacted across many parts of the world and the forecast global annual mean surface temperature for 2010 is significantly cooled, resulting in better agreement with observations.

The data are consistent with satellite-based observations and are made available for use in future geophysical and climate-related research. 
 Repeated absolute gravity measurements, conducted once or twice per year, have proven valuable for quantifying slow vertical land motion with a precision better than 0.4 μGal per year (1 μGal = 10−8 m s−2) after a decade or more. This precision is comparable to vertical velocity estimates derived from continuously operating space-based geodetic techniques such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS). Furthermore, absolute gravimeters are particularly well suited for long-term studies, as their measurements are based on fundamental length and time standards (laser and atomic clock) and remain independent of terrestrial reference frame realizations, unlike GNSS. Consequently, an absolute gravimeter can return years or even decades later and provide relevant measurements, provided the initial gravity data are well documented and the ground gravity marker remains undisturbed. Following this line of thinking, we have compiled and consistently reprocessed absolute gravity measurements collected between 1998 and 2022 in Brest, on the French Atlantic coast, near its century-long tide gauge station. The entire dataset has been reanalyzed in accordance with international recognized standards for instrumental and modelling corrections. This effort has yielded a 25-year time series of absolute gravity values, which we present and document for future studies, along with details on our reprocessing methodology.

Herein, we demonstrate that lanthanum carbonate exhibits a 1.8-fold higher phosphate adsorption capacity at pH 7 (33.2 mg-P/g) compared to pH 4 (18.5 mg-P/g), attributed to the enhanced formation of LaPO4 nanocrystals. Leveraging in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), we resolve real-time phosphorus sequestration dynamics, capturing LaPO4 nucleation within minutes, contradicting prior reports that LaPO4 formation is time-intensive. This discrepancy arises because conventional characterization techniques (e.g., X-ray diffraction) overlook transient amorphous LaPO4 intermediates due to insufficient sensitivity, whereas the nanoscale resolution of AFM directly tracks interfacial transformations.

We investigated how the vaping mixture composition affects indoor aerosol characteristics and exposures. Simulated cannabis vaping aerosol was produced by flash evaporation in a 20 m3 chamber of mixtures containing terpenoids, cannabinoids, cannabis extract constituents, and the adulterant vitamin E acetate (VEA). Aerosol time- and size-resolved concentrations (8 nm–2.5 μm at 1 Hz) were measured, and a dosimetry model was used to evaluate the intake of secondhand aerosols. The results showed peak particle number (PN) concentrations between 0.7 × 106 and 13 × 106 cm–3 and peak mass concentration (PM1.0) between 65 and 1191 μg m–3 at t = 5 min after emission. Concentrations decreased to 21–57% of peak PN and 33–69% of peak PM1.0 at t = 60 min. The PM1.0 yield was 0.06 for a terpenoid-only mixture, 0.22–0.36 for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC)-terpenoid mixtures, and >1 for mixtures containing high concentrations of cannabidiol (CBD) or VEA.

Previous studies reported that the prolonged warm SSTAs in the NEP are usually passively triggered by atmospheric high‐pressure anomalies. In this study, results show that the early winter positive SSTAs can actively reverse the high‐pressure anomalies into low‐pressure anomalies within the whole troposphere through diabatic heating and transient eddy vorticity forcing. However, when the positive SSTAs appear in mid‐winter, the atmospheric preconditioning of warm air temperature anomalies related to the high‐pressure anomalies prevents oceanic thermodynamic and dynamics feedback onto the atmosphere, which results in no reversal of the high‐pressure anomalies.

This study further elucidates that the long‐term LTD trend in the CEC exhibits a pronounced seasonal contrast that there is a significant increase from August to October, whereas a decline is observed from May to July. This seasonal reversal in the CEC LTD trend is attributed to the northward migration of an intensified diabatic heating source from May to October under global warming.

The particle deposition decreased with increasing EPS, because the EPS filled the pore spaces between individual sediment grains, reducing the porosity of the sediment bed. With decreased porosity, newly deposited particles could not settle in between the grains of the bed, so that particles were more exposed to the flow, making resuspension easier and leading to decreased deposition. For the same level of bio‐cohesion, increasing the near‐bed turbulence diminished deposition. For the vegetated channel, as bio‐cohesion increased, particles were easily resuspended around individual stems due to the enhanced exposure effect, expanding the regions where deposition was excluded and leading to a more heterogeneous spatial distribution of deposition. The effect of EPS was negligible for the smallest velocity magnitude, for which all particles deposited, and for largest velocity magnitude, for which most particles were resuspended."

It quantifies the absorption and scattering properties of gases in radiation, highlighting the crucial balance between accuracy and efficiency that affects model performance. The proposed scheme builds on the alternate mapping correlated K‐distribution method. A more efficient algorithm is implemented, which reduces the need for manual intervention in determining the number of subintervals required for pseudo‐monochromatic calculations in the gaseous transmittance scheme. We propose a variant alternate mapping method, that restores the monotonicity of Rayleigh scattering in the cumulative probability space after extracting strong absorption wavenumbers. This modification improves the accuracy of the simulated upward radiation flux in visible bands. Additionally, by incorporating a wider range of atmospheric profiles into the optimization of the gas‐optics look‐up table, our scheme demonstrates improved generalization capability. Moreover, we offer a clear physical interpretation of the optimization process. Evaluations using realistic profiles from the Correlated K‐Distribution Model Inter‐Comparison Project demonstrate that our shortwave gaseous transmittance scheme, which requires only 80 pseudo‐monochromatic spectral points, offers significant advantages in calculating radiation flux and heating rates across various scenarios."

High‐resolution (30 m) wind field structures in the lower boundary layer at the land‐sea interface were derived using the velocity‐azimuth display technique. This approach captures the wind field structure in unprecedented detail at the scale of tens of meters, providing a fine‐scale view of the coastal wind field during typhoon landfall. It was found that stronger winds were predominantly located at the periphery of the scanning area, where the underlying surface is water, whereas weaker winds tended to occur near the radar, where the underlying surface is land. Analysis of vorticity and divergence revealed small‐scale vortex structures, approximately 100 m in size, embedded within the large‐scale circulation of the typhoon. These structures became less distinct as the typhoon center approached. Furthermore, the turbulent energy spectrum derived from the directly observed radial winds followed Kolmogorov's −5/3 law, indicating that the turbulence was generally isotropic. Additionally, the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) calculated from the DWL data showed good agreement with previous tower‐based observations, particularly in terms of the relationship between TKE and wind speed, confirming the reliability of DWL measurements in capturing turbulence characteristics. These results suggest that DWL can serve as an effective alternative for future turbulence observations during typhoon landfall."

By investigating N concentrations and natural N isotopes in soils and plants, we evaluated and compared contributions of soil EIN and EON to plants of six same genera between Alaskan tundra (AT) with lower mean annual temperature (MAT, −6.8°C) and atmospheric N deposition (AND) (AND, 0.4 kg‐N/ha/yr) and northeastern China peatlands (NECP) with higher MAT (−3.3°C) and AND (5.1 kg‐N/ha/yr). Soil EIN was three times less than EON, but it contributed c.a. 54 ± 7% of N among studied plants. In NECP, higher MAT and AND caused more increments (by three times) in soil EON than EIN, but soil EIN's contributions to plants did not differ between AT (52 ± 6%) and NECP (57 ± 7%). We concluded that soil EIN's contributions to boreal plants are underestimated (by 17%) and insensitive to concurring warmer climates and higher N deposition.

Understanding long‐term changes in forest composition and resilience is crucial for developing effective, evidence‐based restoration strategies. This study presents a 1,600‐year paleoecological reconstruction of forest dynamics in northeastern China, based on sedimentary pollen records from Sihailongwan Maar Lake. The findings reveal that from 480 to 1930 CE, natural factors primarily governed forest dynamics, allowing for a stable adaptation of mixed coniferous and broadleaved species to climate fluctuations. However, since 1930 CE, human activities have become the dominant force, leading to significant shifts in forest structure, reduced coniferous populations, and a substantial decline in ecological resilience. This study provides an ecological baseline based on naturally driven forest dynamics, offering essential guidance for restoring a resilient mixed coniferous‐broadleaved forest structure. Furthermore, these recommendations emphasize the importance of strengthening forest protection, limiting logging, and engaging local communities in conservation efforts. However, as global warming continues to accelerate, the ecological baseline derived from historical dynamics may become less applicable.

This study developed a novel framework and integrated model to analyze Chl‐a response in Chaohu Lake to climate (e.g., precipitation, temperature, and wind) and socio‐economic (e.g., population, fertilizer application, and livestock farming). The results indicated that by around 2050, the Chl‐a concentration would change by −6.5% to −0.1% compared to around 2020. While socio‐economic and climatic factors significantly altered nitrogen and phosphorus loading, exogenous loading had a minimal effect on Chl‐a due to high endogenous releases. The decrease in Chl‐a is mainly due to the increase in precipitation. Chl‐a reduction was primarily driven by increased precipitation (0.6%–12.9%), leading to −9.4% to −4.4% Chl‐a changes. The runoff increase also provided an opportunity to treat the heavily polluted lake area. Air temperature increases of 5.1%–9.2% resulted in Chl‐a increases of 0.9%–3.1%. On annual scales the effects of precipitation and temperature were mainly due to changes in mean values. The effects of variability were significant at seasonal scales, for example, lower spring temperatures favored a decrease in summer Chl‐a.

Here the authors show in two mouse models that tumor-specific antigen presentation by B cells, rather than antibody secretion, is essential for tumor suppression. 
 B cells engage in anti-tumor immunity but how they contribute to cancer suppression remains unclear. We report that inhibiting plasma cell differentiation either in IgMi mice lacking Igh elements needed for antibody secretion or in mice with B cell-specific knockout of Blimp-1 (Blimp-1 BcKO) promotes rather than inhibits antitumor immunity and increases numbers of activated B cells. Deficiency of Blimp-1 in tumor-infiltrating B cells generates a unique transcription profile associated with expansion of mutated clones targeting cognate tumor cells. Major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC II) is required for anti-tumor efficacy. Blimp-1-deficient B cells have increased expression of CD80 and CD86 costimulatory molecules that enhance effector T cell function. The Blimp-1 inhibitor valproic acid suppresses tumor growth in a B cell-dependent manner. Thus, inhibition of plasma cell differentiation results in enhanced tumor-specific antigen presentation by B cells and thereby tumor repression, suggesting a potential avenue of immunotherapy against cancer. The contribution of tumor-infiltrating B cells in anti-tumor immunity is not yet fully understood.

 Thermogenic proteins are down-regulated under thermal stress, including PGC1α· However, the molecular mechanisms are not fully understood. Here, we addressed that chaperone-mediated autophagy could regulate the stability of PGC1α under thermal stress. In mice, knockdown of Lamp2a, one of the two components of CMA, in BAT showed increased PGC1α protein and improved metabolic phenotypes. Combining the proteomics of brown adipose tissue (BAT), structure prediction, co-immunoprecipitation- mass spectrum and biochemical assays, we found that PARK7, a Parkinson’s disease causative protein, could sense the temperature changes and interact with LAMP2A and HSC70, respectively, subsequently manipulate the activity of CMA. Knockout of Park7 specific in BAT promoted BAT whitening, leading to impaired insulin sensitivity and energy expenditure at thermoneutrality. Moreover, inhibiting the activity of CMA by knockdown of LAMP2A reversed the effects induced by Park7 ablation. These findings suggest CMA is required for BAT to sustain thermoneutrality-induced whitening through degradation of PGC1α.

 Transportin 3 (TNPO3) is a nuclear import receptor known for its broad substrate specificity, often recognizing arginine-serine (SR/RS) repeat-rich nuclear localization signals (NLS) in SRSF proteins. While serine phosphorylation or glutamate presence has been associated with these NLSs, recent proteomic studies identified TNPO3 cargoes lacking SR/RS repeats. One such example is the cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (CIRBP), which contains a non-classical RSY-NLS. Using X-ray crystallography, here we investigate the TNPO3-CIRBP interaction and find that tyrosines within the RSY-NLS play a key role in binding, independent of phosphorylation. Surprisingly, serine and tyrosine phosphorylation in CIRBP’s NLS inhibits TNPO3 binding, suggesting a regulatory mechanism for nuclear import. Our study reveals a non-conventional nuclear import mechanism mediated by TNPO3, which may extend to other known or yet undiscovered TNPO3 cargoes.

 Superconducting circuits provide a versatile and controllable platform for studies of fundamental quantum phenomena as well as for quantum technology applications. A conventional technique to read out the state of a quantum circuit or to characterize its properties is based on RF measurement schemes. Here we demonstrate a simple DC measurement of a thermal spectrometer to investigate properties of a superconducting circuit, in this proof-of-concept experiment a coplanar waveguide resonator. A fraction of the microwave photons in the resonator is absorbed by an on-chip bolometer, resulting in a measurable temperature rise. By monitoring the DC signal of the thermometer due to this process, we are able to determine the resonance frequency and the lineshape (quality factor) of the resonator. The demonstrated scheme, which is a simple DC measurement, offers a wide frequency band potentially reaching up to 200 GHz, far exceeding that of the typical RF spectrometer. Moreover, the thermal measurement yields a highly frequency independent reference level of the Lorentzian absorption signal. In the low power regime, the measurement is fully calibration-free.

 TGFβ superfamily proteins can affect cellular differentiation, thermogenesis, and fibrosis in mammalian adipose tissue. Here we describe a role for Growth Differentiation Factor 3 (GDF3) on mature adipocyte biology. We find inducible GDF3 loss of function in obese adult mice leads to reduced lipolysis, improved glucose tolerance, and reduced glycemic variability. The effects on lipolysis are driven by lower levels of β3-adrenergic receptor, decreased cAMP and PKA signaling. GDF3 is an ALK5, ALK7, ACVR2A and ACVR2B agonist and also a BMPR2 antagonist. Unlike ALK7 or activin E knockouts, acute GDF3 loss of function does not affect body weight or energy balance but significantly improves metabolic health. These results suggest that blocking GDF3 can improve metabolic health independent of body weight and food intake, an intriguing new model for developing anti-diabetic therapies. Together these results provide much-needed clarity to both the molecular pathways involved in GDF3 signaling and its physiological effects.

 Understanding climate change impacts in combination with other anthropogenic stressors, such as chemical pollution, is critical to identifying vulnerable marine ecosystems. This paper presents a systematic review and conceptual model mapping evidence of the marine environmental fate and biological effects of persistent organic pollutants with shifting climate drivers. Increasing ice melt, atmospheric deposition, and sediment remobilization are altering persistent organic pollutant dynamics in northern polar environments, but with data gaps elsewhere. While limited to fish and invertebrates, principal biological effect pathways involve reduced survival and perturbed thermal regulation and bioenergetics, notably in some populations residing in more heavily polluted and thermal edge habitats. Associated food web shifts with climate change are also altering persistent organic pollutant bioaccumulation among some marine mammal and seabird populations and assemblages. The evidence suggests potential ecological deterioration in some areas, with many unknowns underscoring the need for advancing experimental and modeling tools to evaluate these complex interactions.

 Atmospheric aerosol nucleation is an extremely complex chemical process that produces aerosols directly from gas phase species, impacting air quality, human health, and climate. Current understanding of urban aerosol nucleation processes is based on the findings made mostly in Chinese mega-cities, but it is not clear the proposed sulfuric acid-amine nucleation process can be applied to all urban sites worldwide. Here, we conducted comprehensive measurements of nucleation precursors in Houston, the 4th most populated and polluted urban site in the United States. Our observations and box model simulations show that rapid aerosol nucleation and growth can be explained by the measured sulfuric acid, base, and low-volatility organics formed from oxidation of anthropogenic and biogenic volatile organic compounds. Given rapid global urbanization and increasing emissions of emerging chemical pollutants in the United States and Europe, this multicomponent nucleation process will be crucial for mitigating air pollution in the evolving urban climate.

 Although tree restoration, including reforestation and afforestation, can enhance carbon sequestration and help mitigate climate change, this negative forcing can be strengthened or weakened through non-carbon cycle biogeophysical factors, including atmospheric chemistry. Here, we conduct climate modeling experiments with and without atmospheric chemistry driven by a high-end tree restoration scenario. Under both frameworks, the biogeophysical effects drive global mean warming due to surface darkening. This warming is muted in the Southern Hemisphere due to enhanced evapotranspiration. Furthermore, there is less warming—especially in the Southern Hemisphere—under interactive atmospheric chemistry, largely due to enhanced organic aerosol and cloud effects. Biogeophysical effects mute 45% of the biogeochemical cooling associated with enhanced land carbon storage, which decreases to 24% with atmospheric chemistry (including methane). Thus, higher climate change mitigation potential of tree restoration results from atmospheric chemistry effects, which are not usually considered.

Hughes;Jin Wu,Improved assessment of post-fire recovery trajectory of forests in Amazon's protected areas,"•Two types of post-fire areas coexist in Amazonian protected areas. •Multi-source data and machine learning effectively distinguish two types of areas. •Permanently converted vs. natural recovery types differ in recovery trajectories. •Distinct recovery patterns were observed from different structural traits. •Understory recovery and plant vertical space use exhibited stronger recovery rates. 
 Protected areas (PAs) in Amazon forests are vital in preserving tropical forest ecosystems and mitigating forest degradation. However, the increasing frequency and severity of fires in these regions necessitate a comprehensive understanding of post-fire vegetation recovery trajectories, which is essential to evaluate the effectiveness and resilience of PAs in the face of ongoing climate change. Recovery trajectories under natural conditions remain uncertain, as unregulated human settlements often interfere with or influence the recovery process, skewing the actual recovery rates detected by satellite remote sensing. To tackle this issue, we examined 2990 MODIS-derived fire events in eastern Amazon PAs from 2001 to 2020. We assessed the effectiveness of multi-source Earth observation data and the eXtreme Gradient Boost machine learning model to distinguish burned areas undergoing natural recovery (natural recovery areas) from areas that are permanently converted to other uses (permanently converted areas). We then analyzed greenness recovery rates and canopy structure recovery trajectories across all burned areas, natural recovery areas, and permanently converted areas. Greenness recovery rates were derived from Landsat data, while canopy structure recovery was assessed using GEDI lidar-derived metrics and the space-for-time substitution approach. Our model achieved an overall classification accuracy of 87.90 %, accurately differentiating natural recovery areas (n = 1944) from permanently converted areas (n = 1046). The differing patterns of post-fire greenness recovery rates and structure recovery trajectories highlight the importance of this distinction. In natural recovery areas, significant recovery of structural traits such as relative heights (RHs), canopy cover (CC), and plant area index (PAIs), was observed, returning to their pre-disturbance levels over a 20-year period. Notably, metrics related to understory recovery and plant vertical space use, such as PAI values across the entire vertical strata, exhibited stronger recovery rates than height-related metrics like RHs, highlighting their utility in characterizing complex ecosystem recovery processes. These findings demonstrate the potential and necessity of using multi-source Earth observation data to distinguish different post-fire vegetation recovery processes. This distinction improves our understanding of ecological recovery rates and the successional dynamics of post-fire forests under natural conditions, offering new opportunities to explore their biogeographical distribution, recovery rate variabilities, and impacts on carbon sequestration and ecosystem resilience."

 Glaciers in the European Alps are undergoing significant retreat and thickness decrease due to climate change, contributing to sea-level rise and impacting the mountain environment and its biodiversity, tourism and local economy. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) photogrammetry offers cost-effective methods for high-resolution glacier monitoring. However, multi-temporal UAV-based data usually must be improved in terms of consistency due to possible variable survey conditions, requiring precise co-registration. This study presents a novel application of the Iterative Closest Point algorithm of the NASA Ames Stereo Pipeline to co-register Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) from UAV images of Forni Glacier (Italy) collected under different conditions from 2014 to 2022. We co-registered the DEMs generated from Structure-from-Motion/Multi-View Stereo matching within a pairwise structure. This process demonstrated clear improvements in data consistency, with mean and median values tending to zero, RMSEs below 0.50 m, and NMADs below 0.32 m. The comparison of co-registered DEM highlighted glacier thickness losses at the terminus reaching 50 m, with side areas showing smaller reductions of around 25 m between 2014 and 2022."

 Chemical transport models often use moderate spatial resolution to simulate atmospheric pollution, thereby limiting the model's ability to represent variations in urban areas. Additionally, the contributions of individual sources of pollution transported to the urban areas of interest from elsewhere are rarely quantified. In this study, we developed an approach to simulate air quality, focusing on PM2.5 (particulate matter with a diameter lower than 2.5 μm), and its local and regional sources at high spatial resolution of 1 × 1 km2. The approach is applied in the largest city of Greece, Athens. The PMCAMx chemical transport model is employed in combination with the source apportionment algorithm, PSAT (Particle Source Apportionment Technology), to quantify the concentrations and sources of PM2.5, organic aerosol (OA) and elemental carbon (EC) for a typical summer and winter month. A novel approach is developed, allowing the quantification of the contributions of sources not only inside the simulated urban area but also of the regional sources located outside. Model predictions were combined with population distribution data to provide estimations for human exposure not only to total PM2.5 concentrations but also to specific sources within the city. Residential biomass burning and transportation were found to be the dominant local sources of PM2.5 exposure. The higher resolution (1 × 1 km2) offered a more detailed representation of PM2.5 spatial variability than a coarser one (36 × 36 km2). This underscores the importance of capturing local sources in specific areas of the domain. The proposed approach can be used to provide estimates of human exposure to specific local and regional sources of primary and secondary PM2.5 in an urban area."

 Aerosols significantly influence high cloud microphysical properties, playing a crucial role in Earth's radiation budget. This study introduces an innovative analytical framework that integrates multi-meteorological constraints through Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with derivative expansion to disentangle aerosol and ice water content (IWP) effects on high cloud properties. Analyzing satellite and reanalysis datasets (2014–2020), we investigate aerosol-cloud interactions at two mid-latitude continental sites with distinct aerosol compositions: the Semi-Arid Climate and Environment Observatory of Lanzhou University (SACOL) and the US Southern Great Plains (SGP) atmospheric observatory. By combining multiple meteorological factors into a single indicator, our approach enables an effective quantification of aerosol impacts. We find that aerosols enhance IWP at both sites, with SGP showing markedly higher susceptibility (1.22) than SACOL (0.89). Initial unconstrained analysis of ice particle radius (IPR) revealed opposing trends: decreasing with aerosols at SACOL but increasing at SGP. Through partial correlation analysis, we identified IWP as a key modulator of the IPR-aerosol relationship. After constraining both meteorological and IWP conditions, the increased aerosol concentrations consistently reduce IPR at both sites, resolving the apparent contradiction. Further investigation revealed distinct nucleation mechanisms: sulfate aerosols may dominate homogeneous nucleation, producing numerous smaller ice particles, while dust aerosols facilitate heterogeneous nucleation, forming fewer but larger ice particles when sufficient water vapor is present. These findings advance our understanding of regional variations in aerosol-cloud interactions and provide essential insights for improving cloud microphysics parameterization in climate models."

 Extratropical cyclones (ECs) are large-scale synoptic weather systems characterised by complex mesoscale precipitation-generating features. Unresolved questions remain regarding how their water budget varies depending on the origin of the rainfall. This study aims to address this gap by examining the variability in moisture uptake patterns across EC precipitation structures. To achieve this, 237 cases were selected during the maximum deep phase over the North Atlantic (NATL). The study utilizes ERA5 downscaled simulations and Lagrangian moisture source diagnostics to identify key moisture parameters. We compare different precipitation-targeting approaches, including the radius, Warm Conveyor Belt (WCB) footprint, and square root spiral contours centred on the EC. The radius approach captures central precipitation and innermost rainbands, while the WCB target better represents the full extent. The NATL region was divided into sectors to facilitate a detailed analysis of geographic influences and dynamic factors, including moisture availability. Using the radius approach, moisture sources in the western/W and northern/N NATL are predominantly aligned along the Gulf Stream. When considering WCB and spiral targets, the 95th percentile moisture uptake pattern expands into the subtropics. Moisture patterns shift southward and intensify for broader targets. In NNATL ECs, the spiral region's moisture source shows peak uptake at ∼3000 km, exceeding the radial target's 1500 km. WNATL ECs exhibit intense moisture uptake, with a southwest (southeast) source extending up to 4500 (4000) km. In eastern/E NATL, EC-relative composites indicate evenly distributed moisture uptake, constrained within a 2000 km radius."
