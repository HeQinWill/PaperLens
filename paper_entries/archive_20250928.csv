10.5194/acp-25-9519-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文使用大气传输模型和卫星数据，研究了中国香河地区的甲烷（CH4）观测数据。论文重点关注影响甲烷浓度的主要排放源，并讨论了气象因素的影响。研究利用WRF-Chem模型模拟了地表和柱浓度，并通过源区示踪分析识别了能源、居民供暖、废物管理和农业等主要贡献源。研究结果表明，该模型能够较好地捕捉甲烷观测的关键变化，但同时也存在季节性偏差，可能源于农业或废物管理活动排放的季节性变化不准确。总的来说，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,"['Methane (CH4)', 'Greenhouse gas column', 'In situ surface concentrations', 'Satellite data', 'Atmospheric transport model', 'WRF-Chem', 'TCCON', 'Emission sectors', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis']",Sieglinde Callewaert;Minqiang Zhou;Bavo Langerock;Pucai Wang;Ting Wang;Emmanuel Mahieu;Martine De Mazière,"A WRF-Chem study of the greenhouse gas column and in situ surface concentrations observed in Xianghe, China – Part 1: Methane (CH4)","We used an atmospheric transport model and satellite data to study CH4 observations  in Xianghe, China. Our study shows the key source sectors that influence the concentrations and their respective importance. Furthermore, meteorological factors such as wind direction are discussed. This research highlights the challenges in accurately simulating these kinds of measurements and helps us to better understand CH4 variability in the region. 
 This study is the first of two companion papers which investigate the temporal variability of CO2, CH4 and additionally CO concentrations measured at the Xianghe observation site near Beijing in China using the Weather Research and Forecast model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), aiming to understand the contributions from different emission sectors and the influence of meteorological processes. Simulations of the in situ (Picarro) and remote sensing (TCCON-affiliated) measurements are produced by the model's greenhouse gas option, called WRF-GHG, from September 2018 until September 2019. The present study discusses the results for CH4. The model shows good performance, after correcting for biases in boundary conditions, achieving correlation coefficients up to 0.66 for near-surface concentrations and 0.65 for column-averaged data. The simulations use separate tracers for different source sectors and revealed that energy, residential heating, waste management and agriculture are the primary contributors to the CH4 concentrations, with the energy sector having a greater impact on column measurements than surface concentrations. Monthly variability is linked to both emission patterns and meteorological influences, with advection of either clean or polluted air masses from the North China Plain playing a significant role. The diurnal variation of the in situ concentrations due to planetary boundary layer dynamics is quite well captured by WRF-GHG. Despite capturing the key variability of the CH4 observations, the model displays a seasonal bias, likely originating from an incorrect seasonality in the emissions from agricultural and/or waste management activities. Our findings highlight the value of WRF-GHG to interpret both surface and column observations in Xianghe, offering source sector attribution and insights into the link with local and large-scale winds based on the simultaneously computed meteorological fields. However, they also highlight the need to improve the knowledge on the seasonal CH4 cycle in northern China to obtain more accurate emission data and boundary conditions for high-resolution modeling."
10.5194/acp-25-9451-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了亚马逊中部火灾季节期间黑碳对气溶胶光学性质的强烈影响。研究重点关注生物质燃烧产生的气溶胶（包括黑碳和有机气溶胶）如何影响光的散射和吸收，进而影响区域气候。虽然没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究结果对于理解大气成分、改进气候模型以及更精确地量化辐射强迫具有重要意义。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测和大气成分分析）密切相关，因为这些技术可以用来验证和扩展研究结果。,"['aerosol optical properties', 'black carbon', 'biomass burning', 'organic aerosols', 'light scattering', 'light absorption', 'radiative forcing', 'climate modeling', 'atmospheric composition']",Rafael Stern;Joel F. de Brito;Samara Carbone;Luciana Varanda Rizzo;Jonathan Daniel Muller;Paulo Artaxo,Strong influence of black carbon on aerosol optical properties in central Amazonia during the fire season,"Our work reveals the impact of forest fires on climate. We found that fire-related particles not only absorb sunlight and warm the atmosphere, but also scatter light, which cools it. At our remote Amazonia site, most particles had different chemical makeups than direct fire emissions and were the main drivers of how much sunlight was blocked or redirected. 
 During the dry season, the Amazonian atmosphere is strongly impacted by fires, even in remote areas. However, there are still knowledge gaps regarding how each aerosol type affects the aerosol radiative forcing. This work characterizes the chemical composition of submicrometer aerosols and source apportionment of organic aerosols (OAs) and equivalent black carbon (eBC) to study their influence on light scattering and absorption at a remote site in central Amazonia during the dry season (August–December 2013). We applied positive matrix factorization (PMF) and multilinear regression (MLR) models to estimate chemical-dependent mass scattering efficiency (MSE) and extinction efficiency (MEE). Mean PM1 aerosol mass loading was 6.3 ± 3.3 µg m−3, with 77 % of organics, grouped into 3 factors: biomass burning OA (BBOA), isoprene-epoxydiol-derived secondary OA (IEPOX-SOA) and oxygenated OA (OOA). The bulk scattering and absorption coefficients at 637 nm were 17 ± 10 and 3 ± 2 Mm−1, yielding a single scattering albedo of 0.87 ± 0.03. Although eBC represented only 6 % of the PM1 mass loading, MSE was highest for the eBC (13.58–7.62 m2 g−1 at 450–700 nm), followed by BBOA (7.96–3.10 m2 g−1) and ammonium sulfate (AS, 4.79–4.58 m2 g−1). The MEE was dominated by eBC (30.8 %), followed by OOA (19.9 %) and AS (17.6 %). The dominance of eBC over light scattering, in addition to absorption, plays a remarkably important role for this important climate agent, with potentially broad implications for more precise radiative forcing quantification, increasing climate modeling precision and representing deep contributions to Earth's climate system comprehension."
10.5194/acp-25-9471-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了利用超轻型飞机观测研究法国南部低层对流层中水汽同位素的组成。研究重点在于水汽同位素的垂直和水平变异性，以及它如何受到自由对流层和地表蒸散通量的影响。论文强调了水汽同位素在追踪大气水文过程和评估数值模型中的作用，并讨论了如何利用地表观测来验证水汽同位素遥感反演结果。虽然主要数据来自飞机观测，但研究结果旨在改进地表与卫星观测的对比，并支持利用地表观测模拟对流层水汽同位素垂直剖面的简单模型，因此与大气环境遥感技术（如卫星观测和大气成分分析）密切相关。,"['water vapor isotopes', 'remote sensing retrievals', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition', 'humidity', 'vertical mixing', 'evapotranspiration']",Daniele Zannoni;Hans Christian Steen-Larsen;Harald Sodemann;Iris Thurnherr;Cyrille Flamant;Patrick Chazette;Julien Totems;Martin Werner;Myriam Raybaut,Vertical and horizontal variability and representativeness of the water vapor isotope composition in the lower troposphere: insight from ultralight aircraft flights in southern France during summer 2021,"High-resolution airborne observations reveal that mixing between the free troposphere and surface evapotranspiration flux primarily modulates the water vapor isotopic composition in the lower troposphere. Water vapor isotope structure variations occur on the scale of hundreds of meters, underlining the utility of stable isotopes for studying microscale atmospheric dynamics. This study also provides the basis for better validation of water vapor isotope remote sensing retrievals with surface observations. 
 The isotopic composition of water vapor can be used to track atmospheric hydrological processes and to evaluate numerical models simulating the water cycle. Accurate model–observation comparisons require understanding the spatial and temporal variability of tropospheric water vapor isotopes. The challenging task of obtaining highly resolved water vapor isotopic observations is typically addressed through airborne measurements performed aboard conventional aircraft, but these offer limited microscale insights. This study uses ultralight aircraft observations to investigate water vapor isotopic composition in the lower troposphere over southern France in late summer 2021. Combining observations with models, we identify key drivers of isotopic variability and detect short-lived, small-scale processes. The key findings of this study are that (i) at hourly and sub-daily scales, vertical mixing is the primary driver of isotopic variability in the lowermost troposphere above the study site; (ii) evapotranspiration significantly impacts the boundary layer water vapor isotopic signature, as revealed by the δ18O–δD relationship; and (iii) while water vapor isotopes generally follow large-scale humidity patterns, with separation distances that might range up to 100–300 km, they also reveal distinct small-scale structures (approximately hundreds of meters) that are not fully explained by humidity variations alone, highlighting sensitivity of water vapor isotopic composition to additional fine-scale processes. The latter are particularly evident for δD, which also exhibit the largest differences in horizontal and vertical gradients. Combined with other airborne datasets, our results support a simple model driven by surface observations to simulate tropospheric δD vertical profiles, improving surface–satellite comparisons."
10.5194/amt-18-4045-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究论文探讨了涂层材料对单颗粒烟尘光度计（SP2）测量黑碳（BC）混合状态准确性的影响。SP2是一种用于测量大气气溶胶中黑碳混合状态的仪器，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，尤其是在空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面。论文通过数值模拟，研究了硫酸盐、有机碳和棕色碳等不同涂层材料对黑碳混合状态测量结果的影响，并评估了由此产生的辐射强迫效应。研究结果表明，涂层材料和黑碳的形态会显著影响SP2的测量准确性，进而影响对黑碳气溶胶辐射效应的评估。因此，该研究对于提高大气环境遥感数据的解释和应用具有重要意义。,"['black carbon', 'mixing state', 'single particle soot photometer', 'radiative forcing', 'aerosol optical properties', 'atmospheric composition']",Jia Liu;Donghui Zhou;Guangya Wang;Cancan Zhu;Xuehai Zhang,Numerical quantitation on the effect of coating materials on the mixing state retrieval accuracy of fractal black carbon based on single particle soot photometer,"Single-particle soot photometer (SP2) measures the mixing state (Dp/Dc) of coated black carbon (BC) using core-shell Mie theory and coating refractive index is set to 1.50+0i. The retrieved Dp/Dc contains error due to the non-sphericity of BC and coatings with various refractive indices. We reveal the remarkable effects of coatings on the Dp/Dc retrieval accuracy of SP2 based on optical simulation of fractal BC aerosols, and further evaluate the simple radiative forcing efficiency of coated BC. 
 The mixing states of coated black carbon particles (BC) are essential for assessing their optical properties and radiative effects. The single particle soot photometer (SP2) measures BC mixing states based on the assumption that the refractive index (RI) of the coating material is constant 1.50 + 0i. However, atmospheric BC aerosols may be coated by diverse materials with various refractive indices, therefore, the unrealistic assumption of coating RI would bring errors in the measured mixing states. For the evaluation of the effects of coating materials on the measurement accuracy of BC mixing states, from the perspective of numerical simulation, typical materials: sulfate, non-absorbing organic carbon (OC), and brown carbon (BrC) are selected as coatings of BC in this study. The fractal closed-cell model and coated-aggregate model are constructed to represent BC with thin and thick coatings, multiple sphere T-matrix (MSTM) simulation results are used to study the optical properties of realistic coated BC, and the mixing states are optically retrieved based on Mie theory according to the retrieval principle of the SP2. Results showed that the SP2 would underestimate mixing states for fractal BC with BC core diameters larger than about 200 nm, and the relative errors of retrieved mixing states for BC coated by sulfate and OC are evidently larger than those for BC coated by BrC. Furthermore, when the SP2 measured mixing states are employed to estimate the absorption enhancement (Eab) and radiative forcing of BC aerosols, the estimation error of Eab for BC with BrC coating is significantly larger than that with sulfate and OC coatings, and the estimation Eab could be up to 6.19 times higher than the inherent value of fractal BC. Compared with fractal BC, the radiative forcing estimation error at 1064 nm for BrC-coated BC can reach −88.73 %, while the estimation errors of BC coated by the other two materials range from −65.22 % to −37.50 %. This study highlights that the coating materials and fractal morphology should be considered when the SP2 is used to measure the mixing state of BC."

Sensors were calibrated using data from reference instruments, and regression and machine learning models were evaluated, identifying opportunities and limitations in model transferability in both indoor and outdoor environments and showcasing the importance of integrating metadata such as activity logs and diffusive tubes to improve data validation and interpretation during deployment in the houses of the participants. 
 Over the past few decades, the study and the use of air quality sensors have significantly increased, leading to a wealth of experience and a deeper understanding of their strengths and limitations. This study aimed to develop and evaluate a methodology for PM2.5 and NO2 sensors to enhance sensor accuracy to a level suitable for epidemiological studies, where ensuring data quality is paramount. The performance evaluation of indoor and outdoor sensors was carried out during the co-location phase with reference-equivalent instruments (RIs), by calculating the relative expanded uncertainties (REUs) stated in the EU Air Quality Directive 2008/50/EC and the recently published EU Directive 2024/2881, target diagrams and common error metrics, before the deployment of the air quality sensor systems (AQSSs) in the houses of patients suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or asthma, in Stuttgart (Germany). Regression and machine learning (ML) models for sensor calibration were tested during the co-location. Moreover, an original methodology was designed and evaluated to validate the sensor data during the deployment in the houses of the participants. The study found that indoor sensor calibration using artificially generated NO2 and aerosols does not ensure model transferability, emphasizing the need for training data that matches the intended deployment environment in terms of real patterns of concentration, particle composition and environmental conditions. Moreover, the effect of the aggregation time (1, 5, 10, and 15 min) on the performance of the calibration models was evaluated for NO2 sensors. Integrating metadata such as activity logs, window status, and data from official monitoring stations, as well as NO2 measurements with diffusion tubes, proved to be helpful for data validation and interpretation during the sensor deployment in the houses of the participants."

We aimed to investigate the individual and joint effects of PM and night-time temperature on sperm quality. This population-based cohort study with 19,318 volunteers and 55,610 semen samples was conducted in Henan, China, from 2013 to 2020. High spatial resolution gridded data sets were used to estimated individual PM (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) and night-time temperature exposures during the entire period (0–90 lag days) and three critical periods (0–9, 10–14, 70–90 lag days) of sperm development. Generalized linear mixed models assessed the individual and joint effects on sperm quality. We found that the per interquartile range (IQR) increase in PM1 throughout spermatogenesis was associated with decreased sperm count (β, −0.068; 95% CI: −0.116, −0.021). Increasing PM2.5 per IQR was related to reductions in sperm concentration 0.052 (95% CI: −0.098, −0.005) and sperm count 0.086 (95% CI: −0.134, −0.039). Night-time temperature was negatively related to sperm concentration, sperm count, and sperm motility (all P < 0.05). Combined higher night-time temperatures and PM1 (or PM2.5) concentrations significantly impacted sperm concentration, count, and motility (all Pinteraction < 0.05). Synergistic effects of night-time temperature and PM1 on abnormal progressive motility were observed (relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI), 0.27; 95% CI: 0.02, 0.53). Similar joint effects of night-time temperatures and PM2.5 and PM10 on sperm quality were observed. Our results suggested that individual and joint effects of night-time temperature and PM exposure negatively impact sperm quality. These findings highlight the need for public health strategies to mitigate air pollution and global warming and promote male reproductive health."

Here the authors show that accounting for distinct wetland and lake classes leads to lower estimates of current methane loss as some classes emit low amounts of methane. 
 Methane emissions from the boreal-Arctic region are likely to increase due to warming and permafrost thaw, but the magnitude of increase is unconstrained. Here we show that distinguishing several wetland and lake classes improves our understanding of current and future methane emissions. Our estimate of net annual methane emission (1988–2019) was 34 (95% CI: 25–43) Tg CH4 yr−1, dominated by five wetland (26 Tg CH4 yr−1) and seven lake (5.7 Tg CH4 yr−1) classes. Our estimate was lower than previous estimates due to explicit characterization of low methane-emitting wetland and lake classes, for example, permafrost bogs, bogs, large lakes and glacial lakes. To reduce uncertainty further, improved wetland maps and further measurements of wetland winter emissions and lake ebullition are needed. Methane emissions were estimated to increase by ~31% under a moderate warming scenario (SSP2-4.5 by 2100), driven primarily by warming rather than permafrost thaw. How much methane will be emitted from the boreal-Arctic region under climate change is not well constrained. Here the authors show that accounting for distinct wetland and lake classes leads to lower estimates of current methane loss as some classes emit low amounts of methane."

 Atmospheric motion vectors (AMVs) constitute one of the most critical data sources assimilated in numerical weather prediction (NWP), yet current operational wind products fall short to meet forecast requirements. This study addresses a fundamental observational gap in satellite wind retrievals. Traditional polar-orbiting satellite retrievals are limited to high latitudes, and geostationary AMV products are restricted to mid-low latitudes. In the resulting gap regions, only morning-orbit Metop infrared AMVs currently provide limited coverage. This study introduces an optical flow-based atmospheric motion vector retrieval method employing spatiotemporal matching of 183.31 GHz microwave water vapor channel brightness temperatures from NOAA-20/21 Advanced Technology Microwave Sounders (ATMS), enabling highly vertically resolved wind retrievals with clear-sky pixels. Using a fixed 5° × 5° feature tracking regions (5° FTR), the wind speed bias ranges from 0.16 to 0.64 m·s−1, the root mean square error (RMSE) ranges from 3.45 to 3.81 m·s−1, and the wind direction bias was consistently constrained below 27.4°. The overall accuracy achieves the error levels of existing products.For extremely wind speed conditions, a hybrid-scale FTR optimization model, 3° FTR for slow wind speed region and 10° FTR for those high wind speed region, is also proposed. It can expand the detectable wind speed range from 45 m·s−1 to 70 m·s−1 with a sample size increase of over 10 % per channel. The RMSE for 3° FTR reduces by 0.5 m·s−1, while the 10° FTR achieves a 1.5° reduction in both angular deviations and their standard deviation (STD) at 500 and 450 hPa. For all the hybrid regions in all channels, the RMSE remains within 3.47–3.79 m·s−1, the correlation coefficient is enhanced by about 10 % and the wind direction bias is almost the same as that of the fixed FTR. This hybrid-scale tracking strategy can effectively balance spatial resolution and statistical reliability, and thus provides a new technical paradigm for polar-orbiting microwave AMV retrieval. The resulting afternoon-orbit microwave AMVs deliver a novel wind data source for NWP assimilation systems."

 Due to its high population density and extensive commercial activity, traffic emissions are the primary source of anthropogenic pollutants in Hong Kong, significantly contributing to ozone (O3) pollution. This study examined the impact of traffic emissions from ships, vehicles, and aircraft on O3 levels in Hong Kong using the WRF-Chem model. Currently, traffic sources accounted for about 60 % of NOx and 40 % of VOCs — the key precursors to O3 formation in Hong Kong. During the daytime, eliminating traffic emissions led to a reduction in O3 concentration as a result of decreased photochemical production. However, at night, O3 concentrations increased due to weakened NOx titration. On average, the effect of reducing traffic emissions on O3 levels in Hong Kong varied depending on both the quantity and the ratio of NOx to VOCs. Among the traffic sources, ships were significant contributors, responsible for 35 % of NOx and 15 % of VOCs. Eliminating ship emissions shifted Hong Kong from a VOC-limited regime to a transitional regime, resulting in a 0.6 % decrease in O3 concentration. Conversely, when the NOx to VOCs ratio was low, as with vehicles (21 % NOx and 19 % VOCs), or when both NOx and VOCs emissions were minimal, as with aircraft (6 % NOx and 2 % VOCs), Hong Kong remained in a VOC-limited regime, and removing these emissions led to a 0.2 % increase in O3 concentration. Furthermore, significant changes in O3 concentrations typically occurred downwind of the emission centers under prevailing northeasterly winds. These findings support the dual goals of improving air quality and combating climate change in Hong Kong, and they may be applicable to other coastal cities worldwide."

 Bacteria are important components of bioaerosols as a potential source of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere. Previous studies have shown that bacteria can be activated as CCN, but the reported CCN forming potential can vary greatly among different studies and for different types of bacteria. In particular, the effect of atmospheric aging on the CCN activity of bacteria under atmospheric relevant conditions remains largely unknown. In this study, the CCN activity of airborne Escherichia coli (E. coli) was determined and the effects of biological aging and atmospheric exposures were examined by chamber simulation experiments. Results showed that the aerosolized E. coli particles displayed a bimodal size distribution, with a larger particle mode composed of whole cells and a smaller mode composed of bacterial fragments that were present at much higher number concentrations. The calculated hygroscopicity parameter κ was 0.08 ± 0.01 for the cell, and 0.16 ± 0.01 for the fragments in the presence of purified air. The CCN activity and hygroscopicity of E. coli varied significantly under different experimental conditions, with the magnitude of the change depending on the degree of aging, the atmospheric conditions and the type of pollutant gas. An even larger increase in κ was observed under actual ambient air compared with any single exposure. Our study indicates that the CCN activity of bioaerosols previously measured in the laboratory may not be applicable to real atmospheric conditions because the effects of atmospheric aging were not taken into account. Due to the sensitivity to environmental conditions, the cloud nucleating abilities of bioaerosols may be underestimated. Therefore, atmospheric interactions need to be considered in assessing the contribution of bioaerosols to the atmospheric CCN population and hence the impact on indirect climate forcing."

In summer 2024, wastewater flows surged to millions of gallons per day despite no rain, enhancing water-to-air transfer of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) and other toxic gases at a turbulent hotspot. High wastewater flows and low winds led to nighttime H2S peaks, reaching 4500 parts per billion (ppb)—exceeding typical urban levels of <1 ppb.

By combining multiple datasets and modeling approaches, we identified the main contributing factors as more frequent transport passing through the lower layers of high-emission regions and the increase in local and non-local anthropogenic emissions. 
 Changes in tropospheric ozone over the Tibetan Plateau (TP) profoundly affect the local ecosystems and human health. Yet previous studies on the TP ozone have focused on the background regions, with much less attention to the urban ozone. Here we quantify the ozone trends over the whole TP from 2015 to 2019 in the context of its long-term trends, with a focus on urban ozone. For this purpose, we use ozone measurements from 30 urban stations in 17 cities from the Ministry of Ecology and Environment (MEE) of China, the Waliguan baseline station, and four satellite products of tropospheric ozone. We further analyze the drivers of ozone trends through a combination of chemical transport model simulations, back-trajectory calculations, a bottom-up emission inventory, and a recent satellite-derived emission dataset of nitrogen oxides (NOx). We find a strong increase in deseasonalized urban ozone at the MEE stations from 2015 to 2019 (by 1.71 ppb yr−1), which continues after the COVID-19 shock in 2020. The urban ozone trend far exceeds the trend at Waliguan (by 0.26 ppb yr−1) and the TP average trend (by up to 0.08 ppb yr−1) derived from the four satellite products. Interannual variations in meteorology do not produce significant ozone trends over the TP. Non-local factors contribute to the urban ozone growth, due to increased anthropogenic emissions in non-local source regions and changes in transport pathways. Another important contributor to the urban ozone growth is the 31.4 % increase in local anthropogenic NOx emissions. Emission reductions in both the local and non-local source regions can help mitigate the rapid urban ozone growth over the plateau."

The main aims were to evaluate different techniques and atmospheric processes. We focus on halogenated greenhouse gases and ozone-depleting substances. For this, air was collected with the AirCore technique and a cryogenic air sampler and measured after the flight. A companion paper reports observations of major greenhouse gases. 
 Many halogenated trace gases are important greenhouse gases and/or contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion, yet their spatial distribution and temporal evolution in the stratosphere remain poorly constrained. We here present a new high-altitude dataset of a large range of these gases. The results are based on a large balloon flight in the Arctic in summer 2021. Air samples were collected using a passive (AirCore) as well as an active (cryogenic) technique; the former being the largest AirCore flown to date, thus enabling the quantification of an expanded variety of halogenated gases. The evaluation of the results demonstrates good comparability in most cases, but also revealed strengths and weaknesses for both sampler types. In addition, we show examples of the scientific value of this data, including the identification of air masses likely originating from the Asian Monsoon region, and the derivation of the average stratospheric transit times (i.e., the mean ages of air) from multiple tracers."

Most previous studies have primarily focused on characterizing the surface O3 photochemical regime. Recent studies show significant vertical gradients in ozone precursor concentration ratios within the boundary layer, with weaker VOC-driven radical cycles and enhanced NOx-mediated photochemistry in the upper boundary layer. Given vertical transport of O3 within the boundary layer, quantifying a three-dimensional photochemical regime is critical. In this study, we employed the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem combined with the photochemical indicator to investigate changes in the O3 photochemical regime over the North China Plain (NCP) from 2013 to 2017. The analysis indicates that VOC-limited or transitional regimes prevail near the surface, whereas regions closer to the top of the boundary layer exhibit greater sensitivity to NOx. Notably, emission reduction policies have driven the NCP region to become increasingly sensitive to NOx, both horizontally and vertically. This shift stems from HO2 radicals increasing more significantly than OH radicals, causing pH2O2 to rise more than pHNO3. In turn, the elevation of radical concentrations and the transition of control regimes jointly boost daytime O3 formation and curbs nighttime O3 consumption, leading to O3 increases in the NCP."

Over the past seven decades, greenhouse gases enhanced evaporation through enhanced net longwave radiation, raising dryland precipitation, while aerosols suppressed evaporation by reducing net shortwave radiation, lowering humid region precipitation, thereby weakening the dry‐wet contrast. Future CMIP6 projections show greater precipitation increases in humid region than in dryland under both intermediate‐ and high‐emission scenarios. Observation‐constrained projections indicate a slight decrease in dryland and an increase in humid region, strengthening the dry‐wet contrast. This shift stems from aerosol reductions that increased net shortwave radiation, enhancing evaporation in humid region and reversing the historical suppressive effect of aerosols on precipitation. These findings highlight the distinct roles of greenhouse gases and aerosols in modulating regional precipitation, providing insights for climate adaptation strategies in East Asia."

This study presents the first comprehensive assessment of GIIRS IOECs, demonstrating their potential to improve the assimilation of GIIRS observations for numerical weather prediction (NWP). Results indicate that a more appropriate characterization of GIIRS error covariances enables IOEC to assign more optimal observational weights, leading to improved atmospheric state estimates. Cycling assimilation and forecasting experiments based on the CMA‐BJ operational NWP system further demonstrate that IOEC facilitates more accurate temperature and water vapor analysis by adjusting the magnitude and structure of the analysis increments.

 Cloud droplet nucleation, effective radius and cloud–water autoconversion rate (P) parameterization schemes are included in the fourth version of the Regional Climate Model (RegCM4). For cloud droplet nucleation, an empirical scheme (GI99), a semiempirical scheme (GH93), and a scheme based on aerosol activation theory (AG00) are involved. For P, a scheme dependent only on the cloud water mixing rate (Default), a scheme involving the droplet growth rate (BR67), a scheme highly correlated with aerosol components (BH94), a scheme weakly dependent on the components (TC80), a scheme involving the droplet size (LB95) and a scheme that derives a formula mathematically (IBS2) are adopted and tested. Dispersion (ε) is important when calculating the effective radius. Effective radius schemes with/without ε effects are further compared. An optimal combination of schemes is proposed. For cloud droplet nucleation, GH93 and AG00 are better. For P, LB95, BH94, and Default schemes could better simulate precipitation. Considering the ε effect would improve simulation accuracy. Overall, the AG00, BH94 and two-parameter-ε schemes are recommended for improving model simulations of precipitation in East Asia.

 Nitrous acid (HONO) serves as the key source of hydroxyl radicals (OH) in the atmosphere, significantly impacting atmospheric photochemical reactions and air quality. However, the source and formation process of HONO are influenced by numerous factors, and their synergy leads to a limited understanding of its formation mechanisms. In this study, we utilized a random forest (RF) model to elucidate the nonlinear relationships between these driving factors and HONO concentrations in winter and summer. To gain further insights, we combined RF model with SHapley Additive exPlanations and Partial Dependence Plot methods to reveal the sources, driving factors, and their synergy. The findings suggest that HONO is primarily driven by both primary emissions and NO2 transformation in winter, but by the heterogeneous transformation of NO2 in summer. A potential connection exists between winter PM2.5 pollution and HONO. By limiting primary emissions, HONO concentrations can be reduced, which in turn helps mitigate winter PM2.5 pollution. To lower HONO levels in summer, a synergistic approach is needed to control both NO2 and NH3, particularly under high relative humidity. The findings presented herein enhance our understanding of the HONO formation mechanisms and provide a scientific basis for developing comprehensive air quality improvement strategies."

Linear regression and machine learning models suggest that greater wind speeds and land slopes, particularly under uphill winds, are associated with increased fractions of coarser dust. Moreover, these positive correlations weaken during summer and afternoon events, probably related to the haboob storms. 
 The size of windblown dust particles plays a critical role in determining their geochemical and climate impacts. This study investigates the relationship between topographic wind conditions (speed and direction relative to land slope) and the particle size distribution (PSD) of dust emissions on a regional scale. We used the Multiscale Online Nonhydrostatic Atmosphere Chemistry (MONARCH) dust reanalysis dataset, which assimilates satellite data on coarse-mode dust optical depth (DODcoarse). Validation against flight measurements from the 2011 Fennec campaign confirms the effectiveness of the reanalysis in capturing coarse to super coarse dust. A 10-year dust reanalysis underwent selective screening to identify events with fresh emissions and the fraction of coarse dust concentrations was calculated as a surrogate for size distribution. The coarse fractions and associated meteorological and land characteristics obtained from various datasets were incorporated into multiple linear regression and machine learning models. Results indicate that dust particle size increases with wind speed, probably due to a higher fraction of fresh emissions and reduced deposition of coarse dust under stronger winds. A positive correlation between dust size and uphill slope suggests that enhanced vertical transport of dust by topography outweighs the impact of shifting emission microphysics over veering winds. Both positive correlations weaken in the afternoons and summer, probably due to the turbulence during haboob storms, which can suspend coarse dust from aged emissions, competing with the effect of uphill slopes. These findings on dust size dependency on topographic winds could improve representation of dust cycle and its impacts."

Here, using atmospheric mercury observations from ground-based monitoring stations along with air mass trajectories, we found that atmospheric Hg levels increase with air mass ocean exposure time, matching predictions for ocean Hg emissions. This finding indicates that ocean emissions directly influence atmospheric Hg levels and enables us to estimate these emissions on a global scale. 
 Air–sea exchange of gaseous elemental mercury (Hg0) is a major component of the global mercury (Hg) biogeochemical cycle but remains poorly understood due to sparse in situ measurements. Here, we used long-term atmospheric Hg0 (Hgair0) observations combined with air mass back trajectories at four ground-based monitoring sites to study Hg0 air–sea exchange. The trajectories showed that all four sites sample mainly marine air masses. At all sites, we observed a gradual increase in mean Hgair0 concentration with air mass recent residence time in the marine boundary layer (MBL), followed by a steady state. The pattern is consistent with the thin-film gas exchange model, which predicts net Hg0 emissions from the surface ocean until the Hgair0 concentration normalised by Henry's law constant matches the surface ocean dissolved Hg0 (Hgaq0) concentration. This provides strong evidence that ocean Hg0 emissions directly influence Hgair0 concentrations at these sites. Using the observed relationship between Hgair0 concentrations and air mass recent MBL residence time, we estimated mean surface ocean Hgaq0 concentrations of 4–7 pg L−1 for the North Atlantic and Arctic oceans (AA) and 4 pg L−1 for the Southern, South Atlantic and south Indian oceans (SSI). Estimated ocean Hg0 emission fluxes ranged between 0.57–0.86 and 0.60–0.87 ngm-2h-1 for the AA and SSI, respectively, with a global extrapolated mean flux of around 2270 t yr−1 (1600–2900 t yr−1).

Zhang,Evaluating reanalysis representations of climatological trace gas distributions in the Asian monsoon tropopause layer,"Atmospheric reanalysis products reconstruct past states of the atmosphere. These products are often used to study winds and temperatures in the upper-level monsoon circulation, but their ability to reproduce composition fields like water vapor and ozone has been questionable at best. Here we report clear signs of improvement in both consistency across reanalyses and agreement with satellite observations, outline limitations, and suggest steps to further enhance the usefulness of these fields. 
 Trace gas distributions in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) have important radiative and chemical impacts on climate. Although researchers have traditionally shunned direct outputs from reanalysis products at these altitudes, a looming gap in satellite observations may soon render these products essential. Here we use data from the Aura Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and five meteorological and composition-focused reanalyses to address the following two questions. Can current reanalyses reproduce essential features of UTLS composition above the Asian summer monsoon (ASM)? If so, do they reproduce these distributions from internal physics and dynamics or depend on data assimilation? All evaluated reanalyses capture regional water vapor anomalies despite moist biases in the zonal mean. Reanalysis water vapor budgets reveal the expected balance between advective hydration and “cold-trap” dehydration near the cold point; however, data assimilation effects are also influential. The scientific utility of reanalysis water vapor fields at these altitudes could be enhanced by suppressing assimilation effects to facilitate the dominant “advection–condensation” balance, as is now done by ECMWF. The two reanalyses that provide CO show good agreement with observed convective enhancement, highlighting the value of including CO-like transport tracers in reanalyses. All five reanalyses also reproduce the seasonal “ozone valley” above the monsoon reasonably well, but the only reanalysis to provide a complete ozone budget relies heavily on data assimilation to do so. The composition reanalyses, with more sophisticated chemistry, provide a better match to ozone observations, but it remains unclear whether they can do so without Aura MLS."

Our results reveal that substantial wetting trends since the 21st century have mitigated O3 growth in this region, with the influence of wetting on O3 evolution outweighing the warming effect. These findings should be taken into account in future policymaking aimed at scientifically reducing O3 pollution in NW. 
 Previous studies have shown that surface air temperature (SAT) facilitates the formation of surface ozone (O3), while relative humidity (RH) often inhibits ozone generation. However, the degree to which O3 may respond simultaneously to rising SATs and RH due to climate change remains less understood. We conducted extensive atmospheric chemistry model scenario simulations to investigate the impacts of long-term trends of humidification and warming on summer O3 concentrations in Northwestern China (NW) from 1998 to 2017, a period during which this region experienced both warming and the most significant wetting trend in China. We found that the summer mean O3 level in NW increased by 19.9 % during this time. The changes in meteorology led to a reduction in O3 levels, primarily due to humidification in NW, which counteracts the warming-induced O3 increase. We demonstrate that the wetting trend in NW will continue from 2019 to 2030 under a shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) in conjunction with a representative concentration pathway SSP5-RCP8.5, but will either cease or shift to drier conditions from 2019 to 2060 under the SSP2-RCP4.5. No significant responses of O3 fluctuations to RH variations were observed, partly due to manual intervention under the SSP2-RCP4.5."

For accurate identification and quantification of these reactive compounds in the environment, active sampling on sorbent tubes followed by thermal desorption–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry is commonly used. However, ozone present in the sampled air can degrade both the analytes and the sorbent material during the sampling process, leading to underestimation of target substances and overestimation of their degradation products. This study evaluates a novel reusable ozone filter designed for direct attachment to sorbent tubes and compatibility with multi-tube samplers. The filter utilizes potassium iodide (KI) or sodium thiosulfate (Na2S2O3) deposited on reusable glass filters and copper wool to improve the accuracy of BVOC measurements. Both types of ozone scrubbers were tested under varying ozone concentrations up to 50 ppb and relative humidity levels up to 90 %, utilizing a straightforward load-and-flush method as well as a permeation approach that simulates field sampling conditions. Furthermore, both methods were compared regarding their suitability for the systematic evaluation of ozone filters.Results indicate that both KI and Na2S2O3 effectively remove ozone, with KI showing a slightly higher performance and lower dependence on relative humidity, maintaining over 90 % removal efficiency even after 10 d of ambient air exposure. Recovery rates for four structurally different monoterpenes (α-pinene, myrcene, limonene, linalool) showed no significant differences between filtered and unfiltered samples at baseline ozone concentrations, demonstrating that the ozone filters did not negatively impact analyte recovery. When no filter was used, recovery rates for myrcene, limonene, and linalool declined with increasing ozone concentration while showing a method-dependent positive influence of increasing relative humidity. Both scrubber materials maintained high and comparable recovery rates across all tested conditions, except at very low relative humidity, thereby enhancing measurement accuracy and comparability under diverse environmental scenarios. Field tests confirmed the effectiveness of KI-loaded scrubbers in enhancing monoterpene detection in forest air while safeguarding the sorbent material. These results, combined with the easy reusability of the glass filters and the absence of additional equipment or power requirements, highlight that this scrubber design proves to be an optimal choice for the long-term environmental monitoring of volatile organic compounds."

Consequently, CO2 flux measurements have been conducted in Loobos site in the Netherlands since 1996, becoming one of the 17 first FLUXNET sites globally. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the instrumentation, data processing and the resulting data archive, enabling its further use in data analysis, model development and validation of satellite data retrievals. 
 We describe a 25 years (1996–2021) observational dataset of meteorology, turbulent fluxes and net ecosystem exchange collected from the first tower at the Loobos site, the Netherlands (NL). This is one of the 17 first FLUXNET sites globally. The presented dataset contains six data streams, namely (1) the NL-Loo_BM stream including meteorological data: four-component radiation (radiation balance), air temperature and relative humidity, wind information, precipitation and throughfall, photosynthetic active radiation, bole temperature and soil heat flux), (2) the NL-Loo_Profile stream containing vertical profiles of CO2 mole fraction, H2O pressure, air temperature and relative humidity, (3) the NL-Loo_ST stream derived from the aforementioned two streams including total stored heat flux, H2O and CO2 fluxes below the canopy, (4) the NL-Loo_EC stream including EC measurements of CO2 flux, sensible heat and latent heat fluxes, (5) the NL-Loo_Soil stream including vertical profiles of soil moisture and temperature and ground water level data, and (6) ancillary data including soil respiration, vegetation properties (i.e., tree height, stem width and dry aboveground biomass, Leaf Area Index, sap flow, needle foliage properties and the associated nutrient analysis) and ground water level. The data quality of these data streams is assured through standard operating procedures. To show the utility of gathering long-term and comprehensive measurements, we present analyses of mean diurnal storage CO2 flux, the trend of NEE over the last 25 years and the energy balance closure. Being one of the longest datasets of its kind in a temperate forest, this valuable dataset is anticipated to be used for investigating the performance of various gap-filling algorithms, semi-climatological trends including extreme climatic events (such as the heatwave of 2003 and the drought of 2018) and the role of forest ecosystem in the carbon, water and energy cycle. Meanwhile, it is expected to be employed for validating modelled land-atmosphere CO2 and turbulent exchange fluxes, verifying model assumptions and serving as ground truth for satellite data retrievals. The dataset is accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15721310 under a CC-BY4 open use license, where it is published as an associated station-like site and the same data will also be available at the European Fluxes Database Cluster. Hence, the data will be committed to the FLUXNET Data System Initiative too. It is noted that in 2021 a second tower was erected next to the first tower, which 40 was labelled as an ICOS Ecosystem Class 2 site in 2023 (van der Molen et al., 2025). Here we describe the first tower’s instrumentation and data processing up to a Level 1 product (derived variables and quality checks, but not gap-filled)."

The paper describes the protocols and models that participate in the experiments. We designed several experiments to achieve our goals of this activity: (1) to evaluate the climate model performance and (2) to understand the Earth system responses to this eruption. 
 The 2022 Hunga volcanic eruption injected a significant amount of water vapor and a moderate amount of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere, causing observable responses in the climate system. We have developed a model–observation comparison project to investigate the evolution of volcanic water and aerosols and their impacts on atmospheric dynamics, chemistry, and climate, using several state-of-the-art chemistry climate models. The project goals are (1) to evaluate the current chemistry–climate models to quantify their performance in comparison to observations and (2) to understand atmospheric responses in the Earth system after this exceptional event and investigate the potential impacts in the projected future. To achieve these goals, we designed specific experiments for direct comparisons to observations, for example from balloons and the Microwave Limb Sounder satellite instrument. Experiment 1 consists of two sets of free-running ensemble experiments from 2022 to 2031: one with fixed sea-surface temperatures and sea ice and one with coupled ocean. These experiments will help to understand the long-term evolution of water vapor and aerosols; quantify HTHH effects on stratospheric and mesospheric temperatures, dynamics, and transport; understand the impact of dynamic changes on ozone chemistry; quantify the net radiative forcings; and evaluate any surface climate impact. Experiment 2 is a nudged-run experiment from 2022 to 2023 using observed meteorology. To allow participation of more climate models with varying complexities of aerosol simulation, we include two sets of simulations in Experiment 2: Experiment 2a is designed for models with internally generated aerosol, while Experiment 2b is designed for models using prescribed aerosol surface area density. This experiment will help to analyze H2O and aerosol evolution, quantify the net radiative forcings, understand the impacts on mid-latitude and polar O3 chemistry, and allow close comparisons with observations."

Due to limited observational data, their contribution to haze formation in cold environments remains poorly constrained. In this study, we conducted field measurements of reactive chlorine species in snowy Northeast China, a region frequently affected by wintertime haze events. The average nitryl chloride (ClNO2) and molecular chlorine (Cl2) were 110 ± 193 and 13 ± 13 ppt during the day, and 186 ± 216 and 12 ± 17 ppt at night, respectively. In addition, we performed vertical profile experiments to determine the air-snow surface exchange fluxes of ClNO2 and Cl2. They generally exhibited net deposition to the snowpack at night but frequently showed net emissions from the snowpack during the day, suggesting photochemical production on the snowpack. On average, photolysis of Cl2 produced three times more chlorine radicals than ClNO2 on a daily basis. The combined chlorine radical production rate from Cl2 and ClNO2 reached approximately one-third of the hydroxyl radical production rate from nitrous acid, highlighting their substantial role in wintertime atmospheric oxidation. Our results contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric oxidation in the snowy, polluted regions worldwide."

However, the effectiveness of those actions on reducing environmental inequality is not clear. Here, we analyzed the air pollution disparity changes in China from 2013 to 2018 using a combination of air quality, population and urbanization data. For PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2 and CO, we found a general decline in both rural-urban disparity and geographic disparity, with SO2 and CO showing the most substantial reductions. For O3, we found mixed changes in rural-urban disparity and an increase in geographic disparity. Our findings suggest that China’s air pollution control strategies have been effective in improving overall air quality and reducing exposure inequalities. We underscore the importance of strategies to reduce NO2 emissions, given its significant rural-urban and geographic disparities, and its role as a precursor to both PM2.5 and O3. This study highlights the effectiveness of China’s clean air actions from a different perspective and emphasizes the need to further improve air quality and alleviate remaining disparities."

During superstorms, MLT equatorial temperature increase observed by TIMED/SABER can surpass 40 K and vary with local time, showing stronger responses during nighttime and the dawn sector compared to midafternoon and dusk. The equatorial MLT temperature increases surpassed those in low and even mid‐latitude regions.

 Reactive nitrogen plays critical roles in atmospheric chemistry, climate, and geochemical cycles, yet its sources in the marine atmosphere, particularly the cause of the puzzling daytime peaks of nitrous acid (HONO), remain unexplained. Here we reveal that iodide enhances HONO production during aqueous nitrate photolysis by over tenfold under typical marine conditions. Laboratory experiments and molecular simulations confirm that HONO formation from nitrate photolysis is a surface-dependent process, and the extreme surface propensity of iodide facilitates nitrate enrichment at interfaces, reducing the solvent cage effect and promoting HONO release. Global model simulations show that this process accelerates atmospheric nitrogen cycling, increasing the levels of nitrogen oxides, hydroxyl radicals, and ozone by over 25%, 30%, and 15%, respectively, and enhancing dimethyl sulfide and methane degradation by over 20% in the marine boundary layers.

We hypothesize that Bjerknes feedback sustains the La Niña conditions through an intensified anomalous Walker Circulation that connects strengthened precipitation and ascent in the western Pacific with anomalous subsidence, an invigorated South Pacific High, stronger Trades, and cooler SSTs across the tropical Pacific. Some ensemble members transition to El Niño after 2 years, driven by the development of a positive North Pacific Meridional Mode (NPMM) near Hawaii.

 It is known that dust storms frequently occur during the summer in southern Tajikistan, mainly from satellite-based observations. However, a comprehensive understanding of dust characteristics remains limited due to the scarcity of continuous ground-based measurements. In June of 2023, we established an observational station for investigating the physical and optical properties of dust aerosols in Shaartuz, southern Tajikistan. This study reports dust storms that occurred from July 19 to 26, 2023, focusing on the spatiotemporal distribution and sources of dust aerosols. It is shown that both number and mass concentrations of particles exceeding 10 μm remained substantial throughout the observation period, confirming the persistent presence of coarse-mode dust particles. During the event, PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations near the ground reached up to 3841 μg/m3 and 695 μg/m3, respectively, coinciding with the dust storm outbreak on July 19. Two coexisting distinct dust layers were found based on statistical analysis of lidar-derived depolarization ratio and color ratio. The lower layer, located below approximately 1.6 km, was predominantly impacted by air masses from northwest Central Asia, whereas the higher elevated layer distributed between 2.2 km and 4 km, was originated from the southern desert regions. Moreover, optical properties of these two dust layers are largely different, indicating that impact of dust aerosols originated from various dust sources on climate in southern Tajikistan may complex. These results highlight the characteristics of the spatiotemporal evolution, transport pathways of dust aerosols, helping to further evaluate their climatic and environmental impacts in southern Tajikistan.

 In recent years, the phenomenon of nocturnal ozone increase (NOI) has become increasingly common worldwide. The occurrence of such events can potentially enhance the risk of ozone pollution, but the connection between NOI events and ozone pollution remains poorly understood. Based on ground observations, ERA5 dataset and air quality models (CMAQ and CAMx), this study investigates the characteristics of ozone pollution and NOI concurrent events in Xinxiang, China from 2017 to 2021, and qualitatively and quantitatively analyzes the triggering factors on a typical persistent concurrent event (PCE, June 13–20, 2017). We identify the relationship between summer ozone pollution and NOI events. On ozone pollution days, NOI is more prone to occur (incidence: 46.8 %). At the same time, the occurrence of NOI events tends to cause a higher ozone base in the morning from 04:00 to 10:00 local time (LT, 9.12–16.20 μg m−3 higher than that of non-NOI days), promoting the emergence of ozone pollution. During PCE, for all NOI events (12 times) and ozone pollution, vertical diffusion (VDIF) is the primary trigger, followed by regional transport from the latitudinal (north-south) direction (YADV), which is mainly distributed in central and southern Henan (especially Zhengzhou). Additionally, local emissions from industry and transportation also have a significant influence on ozone levels in Xinxiang. This study identifies the characteristics and relationship between NOI events and ozone pollution, and reveals the formation mechanism of PCE, which provides new insights into NOI research and will promote local ozone pollution prevention and control."

 The evolution of the Thermal Internal Boundary Layer (TIBL) under Sea Breeze Circulation (SBC) plays a crucial role in pollutant dispersion, particularly in coastal urban areas. This study investigates the TIBL height (TIBLH) during a severe O3 pollution episode in Hangzhou on June 5, 2016, using high-resolution simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Traditional parameterizations such as the MK1992 method tend to overestimate TIBLH by neglecting urban heat island (UHI) effects and he inland enhancement of momentum by the SBC. To address these limitations, we develop an improved scheme, HS 2024, which explicitly incorporates both the UHI-driven thermal convection and SBC-induced mechanical turbulence. Compared to MK 1992, HS2024 more accurately captures the diurnal evolution of TIBLH and its modulation of vertical O3 transport. As the SBC progresses inland, the TIBLH gradually decreases and forms a capping layer that traps pollutants in the lower troposphere, exacerbating near-surface O3 concentrations. These findings underscore the importance of accounting for both thermal and dynamical processes in TIBLH estimation and provide a more physically grounded framework for air quality prediction in complex coastal cities."
10.1088/1748-9326/adfceb,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文探讨了城市功能与环境污染之间的关系，重点关注城市土地功能的空间组织如何影响PM2.5浓度。研究通过构建土地功能连通性指数（LFCI）来量化城市土地功能的空间排列，并使用空间计量经济学模型分析LFCI与PM2.5浓度之间的关系。研究发现城市和乡村地区存在空间异质性，并且在城市地区，LFCI与PM2.5浓度之间存在倒U型关系，表明紧凑的土地利用结构可能有助于减少环境影响。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但PM2.5浓度通常可以通过卫星观测等遥感手段进行监测，因此该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有一定的关联性，尤其是在空气质量监测方面。,"['PM2.5 concentrations', 'environmental pollution', 'spatial econometric models', 'urban land function', 'air quality monitoring (PM2.5 as proxy)']",Dan Su;Yu Cao;Yajuan Wang;Xinyu Dong;Sisi Meng,Evaluation of urban function and its heterogeneous relationships with environmental pollution in urban and rural areas,"Urban function plays a vital role in shaping environmental outcomes, yet its spatial organization remains underexplored compared to urban form. This study develops a land function connectivity index (LFCI) to quantitatively evaluate how urban land functions are spatially arranged and how they relate to environmental pollution. Using Hangzhou, China, as a case study, we examine the relationship between LFCI and PM2.5 concentrations, a widely used proxy for environmental pollution, through spatial econometric models, including the ordinary least squares, spatial error model and spatial lag model. Our findings reveal significant spatial autocorrelation and a positive relationship between LFCI and PM2.5 concentrations, with spatial heterogeneity between urban and rural areas. Moreover, to capture potential nonlinearities, we incorporate quadratic terms of LFCI in the models and observe an inverted U-shaped relationship in urban areas, where PM2.5 initially increases with LFCI but decreases after surpassing a threshold. This suggests that a well-integrated and compact land use structure may help reduce environmental impacts. In contrast, rural areas exhibit a more linear or U-shaped relationship, indicating a higher sensitivity to development intensity. The findings highlight the need for context-specific planning strategies, advocating for the re-utilization of urban land over rural expansion to improve environmental quality. Overall, this research provides quantitative guidance for the development of targeted land management strategies aimed at strengthening urban resilience and sustainability."

 BackgroundWhile evidence shows that ambient air pollution negatively impacts pregnancy outcomes, its effect on pregnancy outcomes in intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) patients remains underexplored.MethodsWe examined pre-pregnancy and gestational exposure to six pollutants (CO, NO2, O3, PM2.5, PM10, SO2) across six exposure windows in relation to ten pregnancy outcomes in singleton (n = 1, 770) and twin (n = 945) ICP pregnancies. Logistic regression models and outcome-wide analysis were used, with stratification by fetal sex and ICP severity based on total bile acids (TBA) levels using a restricted cubic spline (RCS) model.ResultsSO2 displayed significant effects on preterm birth and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) in both singleton and twin pregnancy. Exposure to PM2.5, PM10 and SO2 before pregnancy increased the risk of NICU admissions. Twin pregnancies and higher severity of ICP exhibit greater susceptibility to air pollution. Outcome-wide analysis found PM2.5, SO2, and O3 significantly impacted adverse outcomes in singletons, while PM2.5, SO2, CO, NO2, and O3 had more impact in twins.ConclusionAir pollutant exposure increases the risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes in ICP, varying by exposure window, fetal sex, and ICP severity.

 Current chemical transport models (CTMs), such as the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, often struggle to reproduce the peak levels of sulfate accurately due to missing sulfate production pathways. To address this issue, we propose an unaccounted pathway via the heterogeneous reaction of SO2, implementing a new parameterization of the uptake coefficient of SO2 (γSO2). This parameterization accounts for relative humidity and the mixing ratios of NO2 and NH3. When the parameterization was incorporated into the CMAQ model (i.e., EXP), sulfate concentrations increased from 3.85 μ g/m3 to 4.78 μ g/m3 during the Korea-United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) campaign. These enhancements improved model performance, as shown by a reduction in mean bias (MB) from −1.94 μ g/m3 to −1.00 μ g/m3 and an increase in the index of agreement (IOA) from 0.63 to 0.70. Additionally, we investigated sulfate concentrations in the EXP across four seasons to confirm that our approach is broadly applicable and not confined to specific temporal conditions. The results also demonstrated a significant improvement in sulfate prediction accuracy, with MB decreasing from −1.68 μ g/m3 to 0.18 μ g/m3 and IOA increasing from 0.65 to 0.69. Notably, the most substantial increases in sulfate concentrations were observed during spring and winter, with enhancements of 1.50 μ g/m3 (57.9 %) and 3.95 μ g/m3 (213.5 %), respectively. These findings emphasize the importance of utilizing an appropriate γSO2 to improve the representation of sulfate chemistry in CTMs."

 Induced by Super Typhoon Doksuri and Khanun, an extreme rainstorm hit the Beijing, Tianjin, and Hebei province (Jingjinji area) of China in 2023, causing severe damage and losses. To comprehensively understand the mechanism of water vapor supply, this study applied the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) tomography technique to retrieve three-dimensional (3D) water vapor fields during the rainstorm. After ensuring the feasibility of GNSS-derived water vapor field, the characteristics of water vapor during the rainstorm were analyzed with rainfall record and regional topography. Integrated water vapor (IWV) from GNSS tomographic results was first investigated. Temporal analysis at four selected GNSS station indicates that the IWV fluctuated and rose before the heavy rainfall occurred, and kept at a high level during the rainstorm. This was primarily due to the persistent transport of water vapor from the ocean surface through the warm and moist airflow caused by two typhoons. Combining analysis with the spatial distribution of IWV and topography, the transported water vapor converged in the central and southern parts of Jingjinji area due to the obstructions of Yanshan Mountains in the north and Taihang Mountains in the east. The falling area of this rainstorm coincided with water vapor convergence zone, demonstrating the potential of GNSS technique for rainstorm diagnosis. Besides, 3D water vapor variation was also investigated with regional topography. Horizontal distribution of water vapor density (WVD) at representative levels evidently exhibited the water vapor convergence through transportation of typhoon and obstruction of terrain. Moreover, profiles about WVD and vertical velocity in both latitude and longitude directions were analyzed. Vertical water vapor variation was in accordance with vertical velocity, indicating that the concentration process of water vapor due to topography can be captured by GNSS tomography. In general, GNSS tomography is a useful technique for clearly exhibiting water vapor variation in multi-dimensions. This is particularly important for monitoring severe rainstorms which are significantly influenced by topography."

Using lidar data from Cabo Verde (2021–2022) and hematite content from atmospheric model simulations, the results show that a higher hematite fraction leads to a decrease in the particle backscattering coefficients in a spectrally different way. These findings can improve the representation of mineral dust in climate models, particularly regarding their radiative effect. 
 This study investigates the relationship between lidar-measured intensive optical properties of Saharan dust and simulated hematite content, using data collected during the Joint Aeolus Tropical Atlantic Campaign (JATAC) in 2021 and 2022. Measurements were taken in Mindelo, São Vicente, Cabo Verde. The study aims to determine how changes in hematite content influence the intensive optical properties of dust particles, particularly in the ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrum. Given the well-documented impact of hematite on the absorption properties of dust, especially in the UV–Vis range, our hypothesis is that these effects will be detectable in lidar measurements. Specifically, this study focuses on the lidar ratio, particle depolarization ratio, and backscatter- and extinction-related Ångström exponents at 355 and 532 nm wavelengths. By analyzing dust plume cases separately regarding their size differences, the strongest positive correlation was identified between the backscatter-related Ångström exponent and hematite fraction (R2=0.63). These findings contribute to improving the representation of dust in atmospheric models, which often overlook the variability in mineralogical composition in their dust descriptions, and refining calculations of its direct radiative effect."

Four types of tropical waves (equatorial Rossby – ER, Kelvin, MRG-TD1, and MRG-TD2 – mixed Rossby gravity–tropical depressions) are studied using filters, satellite measurements, and in situ data from the Clouds–Atmosphere Dynamics–Dust Interaction in West Africa (CADDIWA) campaign held in September 2021 in Cabo Verde. ER waves impact temperature and humidity above 2500 m, MRG-TD1 around 3500 m, and MRG-TD2 around 2000 m. Interactions between these waves favor tropical cyclone formation. 
 In summer, mixed Rossby gravity waves–tropical depressions (MRG-TD) are known to drive intraseasonal humidity variability in the northeastern Atlantic troposphere, modulated by equatorial Rossby (ER) and Kelvin waves. However, their impact on dust remains poorly understood, and methods in the literature struggle to distinguish the two MRG-TD tracks. During the Clouds–Atmosphere Dynamics–Dust Interaction in West Africa (CADDIWA) campaign in September 2021, in situ data (from dropsondes and radiosondes) and remote sensing data (Global Navigation Satellite System data and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer data) were used to investigate the three-dimensional impact of tropical waves on dust and thermodynamics over Cabo Verde. The distinct contributions of Kelvin waves, ER, and MRG-TD were isolated using frequency–wavenumber filtering of total column water vapor. The latter was efficiently split into southern- and northern-track African easterly waves using distinct frequency windows (MRG-TD1 and MRG-TD2) and enabled us to demonstrate their distinct horizontal structures and impacts. ER waves mainly impacted thermodynamics above 750 hPa, MRG-TD1 affected jet-level thermodynamics, and MRG-TD2 modulated moisture in the lower troposphere. MRG-TD2 was identified as the main driver of dust events over Cabo Verde in September 2021. Tropical cyclogenesis was linked to interactions among multiple tropical waves. Notably, a delay of up to 2 d was observed between Kelvin wave interactions with MRG-TD1 and cyclone formation, consistent with previous findings. These results highlight the critical role of tropical wave interactions in cyclogenesis and underscore their potential to improve forecasting."

Triggered by deep convection and enabled by weaker wind fields, these CGWs reached the mesopause and thermosphere. Consistent detection via OI and OH airglow emissions confirms their vertical propagation, while asymmetric thermosphere propagation is linked to Doppler-induced wavelength changes. 
 Three groups of intense concentric gravity waves (CGWs) lasting over 10 h were observed by an airglow imager at the Southern Space Observatory (SSO) in São Martinho da Serra (29.44° S, 53.82° W) in southern Brazil on 17–18 September 2023. These CGW events were simultaneously captured by spaceborne instruments, including the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard Aqua, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board Suomi NPP, and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument operating on the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. The CGWs caused significant airglow radiation perturbations exceeding 24 %, and the distance of the wave centre movement exceeded 400 km. These CGW events were caused by fast-moving deep convection observed by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16). The weaker background wind field during the spring season transition provides the necessary conditions for CGWs to propagate from the lower atmosphere to the mesopause region. The 630 nm emission images were significantly contaminated by specific OH emission bands. The same CGW event was observed propagating from the OH airglow layer (∼ 87 km) to the thermospheric OI 630.0 nm airglow layer (∼ 250 km). The asymmetric propagation of CGWs in the thermosphere may be due to the vertical wavelength changes caused by the Doppler-shifting effect of the background wind field. This multilayer ground-based and satellite joint detection of CGWs offers an excellent perspective for examining the coupling of various atmospheric layers."

Many recently identified sources involve subjecting plastic materials to elevated temperatures; however, fundamental understanding of airborne emissions is limited. This study is the first systematic characterization of particle and volatile organic compound emissions from plastic smoldering combustion. Five common plastic types were studied, including low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). For all types of plastics, a dominant submicron mode of emitted particles is observed. The composition of NPPs and oxidation products is identified in aerosol mass spectra, where mass fractions of NPPs are estimated based on their distinctive fragment ions: hydrocarbon ions (LDPE and PP), aromatic ions (PS), phthalate ions (PET), and organochlorine and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ions (PVC). Emission factors of submicron particles (0.5–769 g kg–1) and VOCs (46–393 g kg–1) are calculated. NPPs from open plastic combustion are estimated to exceed oceanic microplastic emissions and be comparable to microplastics from tire and brake wear.

In this study, we collected 2727 atmospheric samples at the Shanghuang site in eastern China from August 2023 to July 2024. Using these observations with a Bayesian inversion algorithm, we quantify emissions of TCA in eastern China during August 2023–July 2024 at 0.21 ± 0.04 gigagram per year (Gg yr–1), comprising about 10.2% of global emissions. Moreover, TCA emissions in whole China have declined from 6.0–10.5 Gg yr–1 in 2003 to 0.30 ± 0.06 Gg yr–1 during August 2023–July 2024, demonstrating effective phase-out under the Montreal Protocol. Nonzero emissions likely arise from fugitive emissions in industrial processes (e.g., iron and steel industry, refined petroleum industry, and coking industry) and nonindustrial sources (e.g., biomass combustion), which are not controlled by the Protocol. Continued monitoring of TCA mole fractions and emissions would be valuable for confirming the sustained success of China’s phase-out efforts and long-term compliance."

However, the seasonality of BVOC emissions, especially from tropical and subtropical plants, remains poorly understood. This study investigated the seasonal variation in BVOC emissions from Eucalyptus urophylla, a common subtropical species, through in situ measurements during dry and wet seasons. We observed a marked seasonality in emission factors (Es), with light‐dependent BVOCs exhibiting increased emissions from the dry to wet season, while light‐independent BVOCs showed a decline. Isoprene emissions followed temperature‐driven patterns, with substantial increases in the wet season, while the seasonal dynamics of monoterpenes (MTs), particularly β‐ocimenes, exceeded model predictions, indicating more complex emission behaviors. Growth temperature was identified as the primary driver of these seasonal variations, with temperature sensitivity differing between light‐dependent and light‐independent compounds. Our results also suggest that the tropical/subtropical plants may emit more light‐dependent, highly reactive BVOCs in the hot wet season to protect plant leaves from damage by heat‐induced reactive oxygen species. Our study implies that BVOC emissions from subtropical vegetation are highly responsive to seasonal temperature changes, with significant implications for atmospheric reactivity and biosphere‐atmosphere interactions, highlighting the need for improvements in current emission models to better account for the complex seasonality of BVOCs, particularly MTs, in tropical and subtropical ecosystems."

In view of this, an all‐surface assimilation framework based on dynamic emissivity retrieval is established for radiance data over four main complex underlying surfaces (snow‐free land, snow, sea ice, and coast) from all microwave lower‐atmosphere‐sounding channels (at 50–60 GHz, 118 GHz, and 183 GHz) on all operational microwave instruments in CMA‐GFS, on the basis of summarizing previous research. A new emissivity correction scheme is proposed and the regression coefficients are determined for the assimilation of humidity‐sounding channels on ATMS over sea ice. Quality control procedures are designed for each instrument over each surface type. The performances of these modules are evaluated according to first‐guess departures, and the results are given for channel selection over each surface type. Five series of batch experiments, which add the observations over one surface type on top of the former experiment one by one, are carried out. Results indicate that all‐surface assimilation has significant positive impacts on the analysis of all variables across the entire atmospheric layer globally, and the 1–6 days forecasting in the Northern Hemisphere, 6–8 days forecasting in the Southern Hemisphere, and short‐to‐medium‐term forecasting in the tropics are all well improved.

This is the first time OMI LNOx column amounts have been evaluated using in situ data from aircraft profiles. For each case study, aircraft transects of the storm anvils were completed near the time of the OMI satellite overpass, allowing for direct comparison of satellite‐retrieved and aircraft‐sampled LNOx columns from the cloud top to the OMI optical centroid pressure. These comparisons were used to assess uncertainties in the satellite‐based columns. Differences between the aircraft and mean OMI LNOx column amounts varied with location and flash density. The DC3 and TC4 cases resulted in OMI column amounts 38%–56% less than the aircraft, while for the AMMA case, the OMI column was 20%–30% larger than the aircraft column. These differences are consistent but slightly larger than the 36% uncertainty estimated for the satellite retrieval method. Additionally, mean LNOx production efficiency (PE) was determined with values ranging from 52 to 691 mol/flash. These findings lend support for on‐going LNOx PE estimates using OMI, TROPOMI, TEMPO, GEMS, and Sentinel‐4 data and show the need for additional aircraft profiles to further reduce uncertainties."

The cloud is observationally characterized herein as consisting primarily of SO2 ${\text{SO}}_{2}$ and sulfuric acid droplets, and marked by multiple distinctive, quasi‐circular cloud features ∼ ${\sim} $300–400 km in diameter. Previous reports showed that one of these entities was traceable for 3 months. Anticyclonic circulation was also previously reported. We present multiple lines of evidence to characterize these cloud subelements by their spatial confinement, morphology, and sulfate‐dominated aerosol aspect, which was evident from plume onset. In addition, we show that they were ably identifiable in geostationary satellite “cirrus channel” reflectance imagery and had an enduring signal of window infrared absorption, detectable for at least 1 month. The term we apply to this phenomenon is “sulfate/SO2 anticyclonic contained circulation,” abbreviated SSACC. Anticyclonic circulation is first detectable on 24 June, 2 days posteruption. Two SSACCs persist beyond June. One is traceable until mid‐August over Canada. The other SSACC was discernible until 5 October after having completed three global circumnavigations. The internal SSACC circulation aspect is gleaned from geostationary‐based visible image animations and confirmed in situ via a novel application of high‐resolution radiosonde wind direction and balloon position data. We also examine diabatic lofting of both SSACCs in relation to their individual geographic and constituent morphologies. Thermal infrared observations show that SSACC aerosols produce brightness temperature depressions of ∼ ${\sim} $2.6 K, opening a new line of investigation into the source of heating that contributes to diabatic rise."

In this work, 1 year of DPC‐2/GF‐5(02) data has been used (from March 2022 to February 2023). Micro‐physical and optical aerosol properties as well as ocean properties have been simultaneously retrieved by the Remote sensing of Trace gases and Aerosol Products (RemoTAP) algorithm from DPC‐2/GF‐5(02) measurements.

 This study investigates the vertical structure of macro- and microphysical cloud properties associated with the Southwest Vortex (SWV) during the warm season, utilizing CloudSat satellite observations and Southwest Vortex Yearbooks (2012–2017). Results show that the SWV system's cloud top height exceeds 16 km, with a maximum average cloud cover of 35 %, approximately 17 % higher than the East Asian average. Single-layer clouds account for about 48 %, with frequency decreasing as cloud layer number increases. Altocumulus and high clouds are most frequent, while deep convective clouds and nimbostratus are least frequent. Cloud phase analysis under the SWV systems shows a balanced occurrence (37 %) of ice and liquid clouds, with mixed-phase clouds showing the lowest frequency (27 %). Radar reflectivity vertical profiles identify key layers at 2 km (raindrop evaporation) and 5 km (mixed-phase regions).The liquid cloud effective radius reaches a peak of 35 μm at 1.5 km, stabilizing to 15 μm above 2 km. The ice cloud effective radius is distributed between 25 and 95 μm, with a maximum value of 95 μm observed at 5 km. The ice water content exhibits a unimodal distribution, peaking at 0.3 g·m−3 at 8 km. As an α mesoscale convective system, the SWV's strong updraft drives airflow to the upper atmosphere, where low temperatures and supersaturated conditions facilitate the growth of ice crystals. These results clarify the SWV's unique cloud vertical structure and properties, reveal links between regional mesoscale convective systems and cloud-precipitation processes, and provide a basis for enhancing the accuracy of climate and weather forecasts."

 The aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) is a critical parameter in atmospheric research, providing valuable insights into aerosol concentration, composition, and their effects on solar radiation, air quality, and climate change. While the Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard the Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite offers high temporal continuity in vertical profiling, its AEC retrievals rely on multiple assumptions —such as fixed lidar ratios, layer homogeneity, and pre-defined aerosol models—which introduce uncertainties and limit retrieval accuracy. To address these limitations, this study proposes a deep learning-based method utilizing a ResNet architecture to estimate and retrieve AEC profiles more accurately. The model is trained using CALIOP data and ground-based measurements from European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) stations, enhancing predictive performance and generalization. The proposed model's performance was evaluated across multiple EARLINET stations, CALIOP Level 2 (L2) products, and two major aerosol events—a European dust storm and aged volcanic ash over north Europa—demonstrating robustness across diverse atmospheric conditions. Comparisons of total column Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and LiDAR ratio (LR) profiles derived from the estimated AEC with CALIOP L2 retrievals and EARLINET measurements highlighted the model's superior accuracy and generalization. Specifically, the model showed excellent agreement with EARLINET AOD (R2 = 0.98, RMSE = 0.01), significantly outperforming CALIOP (R2 = 0.21, RMSE = 0.06). Moreover, the model provides vertically resolved LR profiles from 0 to 15 km, whereas CALIOP L2 offers limited and often fixed LR values due to missing AEC data and restrictive assumptions. Notably, the backscatter, AEC, and LR profiles produced by the model consistently outperformed CALIOP L2 retrievals when validated against EARLINET Raman measurements. Additionally, AOD estimates showed strong agreement with EARLINET data, achieving R2 and RMSE values of 0.98 and 0.01, respectively, compared to CALIOP's 0.21 and 0.06. The analysis of LR values for the significant aerosol events aligned well with the physical characteristics of these phenomena, underscoring the model's ability to capture complex aerosol behavior across vertical layers of the European troposphere and lower stratosphere."

However, these processes were not fully integrated in past sulfur cycling models because of complexity from the gas-melt interactions in chemically and dynamically evolving magmatic systems with multicomponent volatiles. Here, we incorporate these processes to simulate how sulfur, carbon, and hydrogen degas from martian melts. We find that reduced sulfur species, H2S and S2, are dominantly emitted through degassing at crustal to surficial pressures. These sulfur species could condense as sulfide and elemental sulfur, potentially yielding the sulfate deposits observed on the martian surface through secondary oxidation. Our models also show that evolved magmas reach graphite and sulfide saturation at crustal pressures and thus may establish sulfur and carbon reservoirs in the martian crust. The degassed H2S and S2may form a hazy atmosphere with SF6, a potent greenhouse gas, to shape the paleoclimate of Mars."

High-accuracy sensors were deployed, and the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) was utilized to simulate CO2 transport, capturing variations and assessing contributions from both anthropogenic and biogenic sources. 
 Atmospheric CO2 concentrations in urban areas reflect a combination of fossil fuel emissions and biogenic fluxes, offering a potential approach to assess city climate policies. However, atmospheric models used to simulate urban CO2 plumes face significant uncertainties, particularly in complex urban environments with dense populations and vegetation. This study addresses these challenges by analyzing CO2 dynamics in the Metropolitan Area of São Paulo (MASP) using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Simulations were evaluated against ground-based observations from the METROCLIMA network, the first greenhouse gas monitoring network in South America, and column concentrations (XCO2) from the OCO-2 satellite spanning February to August 2019. To improve biogenic fluxes, we optimized parameters in the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) using eddy covariance flux measurements for key vegetation types, including the Atlantic Forest, Cerrado, and sugarcane. Results show that at the urban site (IAG), the model consistently underestimated CO2 concentrations, with a negative mean bias of −9 ppm throughout the simulation period, likely due to the complexity of vehicular emissions and urban dynamics. In contrast, at the vegetated site (PDJ), simulations showed a consistent positive mean bias of 5 ppm and closely matched observations. Seasonal analyses revealed higher CO2 concentrations in winter, driven by greater atmospheric stability and reduced vegetation uptake estimated by VPRM, while summer exhibited lower levels due to increased mixing and higher agricultural productivity. A comparison of biogenic and anthropogenic scenarios highlights the need for integrated emission modeling and improved representation of biogenic fluxes, anthropogenic emissions, and boundary conditions for high-resolution modeling in tropical regions."

Whether emissions or upward transport is the dominant factor remains debated. We analyzed UT CH4 variability with AMA dynamics, finding strong ties between CH4 distribution and the AMA's east–west oscillation. When centered near 80° E, vertical transport largely enhances CH4 anomalies, with circulation effects 1–2 times greater than those of emissions. 
 Substantial methane (CH4) emissions in Asia are efficiently transported to the upper troposphere through the monsoon dynamical system, which forms a remarkable seasonal CH4 enhancement in the upper troposphere. Using a chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem, driven by surface optimized CH4 flux, the CH4 enhancement over the Asian monsoon region is explored as a combined effect of the monsoon dynamical system and regionally increased emissions during the late monsoon season. The spatial distributions of CH4 at the upper troposphere show strong subseasonal variability, which is closely tied to the east–west oscillation of the Asian monsoon anticyclone (AMA). Besides, the AMA patterns influence the efficiency of methane-rich air transport to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere. The AMA center around 80° E favors the upward transport from organized monsoon convective sources over the Indian subcontinent and Bay of Bengal, while the AMA center around 105° E favors the source from southwest China transported to the upper troposphere.  When the AMA shifts over the Iranian Plateau, further vertical transport from the convective outflow level to the upper troposphere is weakened and the horizontal redistribution becomes dominant. According to our model sensitivity study, the differences in the upper-troposphere CH4 anomalies caused by large-scale circulation are 1–2 times the difference caused by regional surface emissions. Our research highlights the complex interaction between monsoon dynamics and surface emissions to determine the upper-troposphere methane."

While bulk composition is typically measured, key interfacial processes, including heterogeneous reactions, water uptake, and cloud activation, occur at the surface. Here, we present the first depth-resolved, in-flight X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis of natural salt aerosols generated from hypersaline lake brines in the Qaidam Basin, a pristine region on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau. These organic-poor aerosols offer a unique view of inorganic interfacial behavior. Using a synchrotron-based in-flight aerosol delivery system, we performed real-time, surface-specific analysis of freely suspended particles. Results reveal strong surface enrichment of minor ions such as Mg2+ and SO42– and depletion of major bulk ions like Na+ and Cl–. This divergence was consistent across aerosol types and confirmed by ion chromatography of the source brines. A simplified two-layer model indicates a subnanometer surface layer that substantially alters surface identity. Minor components, often overlooked in bulk analyses, dominate the interface and may influence reactivity and cloud activation potential. These findings underscore the need to further investigate the role of surface composition in atmospheric aerosol processes."

Despite their importance, HO2-related processes remain insufficiently represented in current air quality models. Here, we provide comprehensive insights into HO2 chemistry using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model together with airborne observations over South Korea during the KORUS-AQ campaign (1 May–9 June, 2016). Analysis of 20 flight scenarios suggests that modeled HO2 levels might be strongly linked to NO distributions. Under low-NO conditions, HO2 was simulated to be 6.0% higher than the observed levels, likely due to a missing pathway. To address this, we incorporated HO2 aerosol uptake into the CMAQ model by applying an uptake coefficient of 0.08, assuming no H2O2 production. Under high-NO conditions, a substantial underestimation of 9.90 ppt in modeled HO2 levels was observed. This discrepancy may be attributed to (i) underestimated isoprene, monoterpene, and CO emissions and (ii) overestimated NO levels. Finally, we further examined the impact of HO2 aerosol uptake on key atmospheric species (e.g., OH, HO2, H2O2, O3, and PM2.5 components) under different NO levels. Our results indicate that most of these species decrease in concentration due to a weakened oxidizing capacity. In contrast, nitrate concentrations increase in low-NO regions, likely driven by HNO3 partitioning facilitated by excess NH3. These findings pave the way for accurate simulations of HO2 radicals and advance our understanding of atmospheric HO2 chemistry."

BrC absorption notably decreased surface shortwave radiation by 7.07 W/m2 and increased atmospheric shortwave radiation by 0.73 W/m2, inducing non‐negligible land surface cooling, positive pressure anomalies, and higher near‐surface humidity. These findings underscore the notable radiative influence of BrC in haze‐prone regions of China, with implications for local climate and atmospheric dynamics."

 Solar radiation modification-based climate interventions may cause uneven regional hydrological changes while mitigating warming. Here, we investigate the effects of climate interventions on China’s North Drought-South Flood pattern using the Norwegian Earth System Model supplemented by volcanic data. Our results indicate that equatorial stratospheric aerosol injection could mitigate the north-south water divide by reducing inter-hemispheric and equator-to-North-pole temperature gradients, thereby modifying atmospheric circulation and the East Asian monsoon to increase precipitation and surface runoff in northern China while reducing them in the south, compared to the high emissions scenario. This mechanism is supported by observed precipitation changes following the Mount Pinatubo volcanic eruption. In contrast, marine cloud brightening may intensify southern flood risks, while cirrus cloud thinning and moderate emissions reduction might exacerbate northern droughts. Our findings reveal distinct regional hydroclimatic impacts of different climate interventions, highlighting potential synergies and trade-offs between their global intervention efficacy and regional water security.

 Wet scavenging is a critical determinant of aerosol–precipitation interactions, yet its net effect on atmospheric aerosol burdens remains poorly constrained globally. Here, we analyzed 146 rainfall events in total based onfield observations in a subtropical near coastal site, revealing that light rainfall has paradoxically amplified aerosol burdens by +6.1 % averagely, with approximate +40 % for hydrophobic species (e.g., HOA/COA) and +5 %–19 % for secondary hygroscopic components (e.g., sulfate, nitrate, OOA). This contradicts conventional knowledge of light rain wet scavenging, indicating critical flaws in model parameterizations of wet scavenging efficiency. Our study also illustrates a pollution-dependent wet scavenging mechanism and shows efficient removal of aerosol particles under polluted conditions (PM2.5 >30 μg m−3), whereas in very clean atmosphere (PM2.5 <10 μg m−3), precipitation elevates aerosol concentrations by +13 %–100 %, implying that precipitation may shift from a clearing sink to a source of aerosols with the continuous improvement of air pollution in future. Furthermore, we identify a nonlinear size-dependent scavenging threshold of ∼100 nm, where the precipitation shows a transition from production to scavenging of fine aerosols; the 20–30 nm particles show peak increases (+23 %–41 %), while particles of around 600 nm exhibit maximum scavenging (−20 %), yet scavenging declines unexpectedly for larger particles (e.g. >1 μm). These findings highlight rainfall's dual role in aerosols removal vs. enhancement, offering critical constraints for improving air quality forecast and refining model simulations of aerosol-cloud-precipitation interactions."

 The study presents observational evidence for the impact of Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) concentration and atmospheric thermodynamic conditions on the diffusion growth and collision-coalescence processes in warm cloud evolution. We used multi-band optical data from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) satellite (2013–2018) to identify the convective cloud clusters and examine the warm cloud evolution under different thermodynamic and pollution conditions based on cloud top temperature (T) - cloud drop effective radius (re) relationships. Analysis revealed that diffusion growth is predominant under polluted and stable (Estimated Inversion Strength (EIS) > 1 K) atmospheric conditions. In the unstable regime (EIS < 1 K), relative dispersion (ϵ) reaches its maximum (∼0.39) at a CCN concentration of around 1000 cm−3 and supersaturation remains higher at lower CCN concentrations and decreases rapidly beyond ∼1000 cm−3 which marks the transitional point between the aerosol-limited and updraft-limited regimes. However in the stable regime (EIS > 1 K), ϵ remains relatively low (between 0.10 and 0.25) with low supersaturation. In unstable conditions the estimated cloud top entrainment index (ECTEI) is found to be −5.6 ± 1.5 indicating more favourable conditions for entrainment, while in stable conditions ECTEI is found to be −2 ± 3.3 reflecting entrainment suppression. Although the Twomey effect is found to be predominant under stable atmospheric conditions, a nonlinear relationship exists between droplet growth and CCN concentration. In the aerosol limited regime, an increase in growth rate ranging from ∼0.0026 μm/s to 0.0032 μm/s is observed while at high CCN concentrations (above ∼1000 cm−3) growth rates decreases to 0.0025 μm/s. These observations can help refine aerosol–cloud interaction (ACI) parameterizations in climate models, thereby reducing uncertainties in the estimation of aerosol effective radiative forcing under a warming climate."

Our study examined how these particles form in a plant-rich region of Southeast Australia. We found frequent new particle formation (NPF) events, often linked to pollution plumes. Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from plants and other factors influence NPF and aerosol growth. Nighttime NPF requires further study. Overall, plant emissions play a key role in aerosol formation in this region. 
 Aerosols play an important role in atmospheric processes influencing cloud formation, scattering and absorbing solar radiation and affecting trace gases through chemical reactions occurring in and on aerosol particles. Ultimately, aerosols affect the radiative balance of the Earth, modifying climate. A large fraction of aerosols is formed through chemical reactions following gas-to-particulate processes in the atmosphere: nucleation and growth. Biogenic secondary organic aerosols (BSOAs) are formed when plant-produced volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react in the atmosphere through gas-phase oxidation. One of the highest biogenic VOC (BVOC)-emitting regions in the world is Southeast Australia due to the high density of Eucalyptus species. The Characterizing Organics and Aerosol Loading over Australia (COALA)-2020 (Characterizing Organics and Aerosol Loading over Australia) campaign worked towards gaining a better understanding of biogenic VOCs in quasi-pristine conditions in the atmosphere and their role in particle formation.The observations showed a highly reactive atmosphere with frequent new particle formation (NPF) occurring (42 % d with data), often associated with pollution plumes. Analysis of NPF events suggested that SO2 plumes likely triggered particle formation, while particle growth depended on available VOCs and hydroxyl radicals, and the presence of multiple SO2 intrusions promoted the growth of smaller clusters. Nighttime NPF events coincided with monoterpene ozonolysis but were rare. These findings highlight the significant role of biogenic VOCs in driving NPF and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation in Southeast Australia. The COALA-2020 campaign provided valuable insights into local atmospheric chemistry and its potential impact on regional air quality and climate. However, longer-term observations are crucial to understand seasonal variations, trends, and extreme events."

In this paper, we assess regional trends of tropospheric ozone column amounts, based on two different approaches of merging or synthesizing ground-based observations and their trends within specific regions. Our findings clearly demonstrate regional trend differences but also consistently higher pre-COVID than post-COVID trends. 
 Quantifying long-term free-tropospheric ozone trends is essential for understanding the impact of human activities and climate change on atmospheric chemistry. However, this is complicated by two key challenges: the differences among existing satellite-derived tropospheric ozone products, which are not yet fully understood or reconciled, and the limited temporal and spatial coverage of ground-based reference measurements. Here, we explore if a more consistent understanding of the geographical distribution of tropospheric ozone column (TrOC) trends can be obtained by focusing on regional trends from ground-based measurements. Regions were determined with a correlation analysis between modeled TrOCs at the site locations. For those regions, TrOC trends were estimated with quantile regression for the Trajectory-mapped Ozonesonde dataset for the Stratosphere and Troposphere (TOST) and with a linear mixed-effects modeling (LMM) approach to calculate synthesized trends from homogenized HEGIFTOM (Harmonization and Evaluation of Ground-based Instruments for Free-Tropospheric Ozone Measurements) individual site trends. For different periods (1990–2021/22, 1995–2021/22, 2000–2021/22), both approaches give increasing (partial) tropospheric ozone column amounts over almost all Asian regions (median confidence) and negative trends over Arctic regions (very high confidence). Trends over Europe and North America are mostly weakly positive (LMM) or negative (TOST). For both approaches, the 2000–2021/22 trends decreased in magnitude compared to 1995–2021/22 for most regions; and for all time periods and regions, the pre-COVID trends are larger than the post-COVID trends. Our results enable the validation of global satellite TrOC trends and assessment of the performance of atmospheric chemistry models to represent the distribution and variation of TrOC."

Easter;Philip J. Rasch;Kai Zhang;Xubin Zeng,Features of mid- and high-latitude low-level clouds and  their relation to strong aerosol effects in the Energy  Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2),"In the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) and many other global models, the simulated anthropogenic aerosol effective radiative forcing is sensitive to the presence of clouds with very low droplet number concentrations. Numerical experiments presented in this paper indicate that mid- and high-latitude low-level stratus occurring under weak turbulence is a key cloud regime for investigating the causes of these very low cloud droplet number concentrations in E3SMv2. 
 The E3SMv2 model, like various other global models that include representations of aerosol–cloud interactions, uses an empirically chosen lower bound on the simulated in-cloud cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) to help constrain the effective radiative forcing of anthropogenic aerosols, ERFaer.  This study identifies where ultra-low CDNCs (i.e., concentrations lower than 10 cm−3) occur in the stratiform and shallow convective clouds simulated by E3SMv2 and which of the occurrences have the strongest impact on ERFaer. Process-level analyses are presented to reveal characteristics of the cloud droplet formation and removal processes associated with impactful ultra-low CDNCs.Simulations performed with present-day emissions show that ultra-low CDNCs are most frequently found over the mid- and high-latitude oceans in both hemispheres, while the occurrences are also frequent in polluted continental regions despite the high aerosol concentrations.  Ultra-low CDNCs with the largest impacts on the simulated regional and global mean ERFaer are found in the lower troposphere in the Northern Hemisphere middle and high latitudes. These cases are typically associated with large cloud fractions, strong water vapor condensation, weak turbulence, and lack of cloud droplet nucleation from aerosol activation.  Under such atmospheric conditions, boosting aerosol activation and enhancing turbulent mixing of cloud droplet number can increase the simulated CDNCs, although the magnitude of the global mean ERFaer increases undesirably.  The reason for this model behavior is discussed.  Overall, our study suggests that mid- and high-latitude low-level stratus occurring under weak turbulence is a cloud regime worth further investigating for the purpose of identifying and addressing the root causes of ultra-low CDNCs and strong ERFaer in E3SM."

Previous bottom-up NH3 inventories are usually constrained by satellite observations, deposition measurements, or isotopic analysis and still lack careful validation at fine regional scales. This study develops a novel diagnostic framework combining multisite NH3 observations across the Pearl River Delta (PRD) with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model simulations and machine learning techniques to evaluate and refine a regional NH3 inventory. Our analysis indicates that the inventory overestimates agricultural emissions, particularly during the wet period, while underestimating nonagricultural sources. Underrepresented precipitation effects were a key driver of overestimated agricultural emissions (∼19% during the wet period). Conversely, a natural experiment during the Spring Festival holiday provided strong evidence that vehicle emissions are a key underestimated nonagricultural source. Adjusting the inventory based on these findings (agricultural sources reduced 39% (31%) during wet (dry) periods, nonagricultural sources increased 70%) improved NH3(g) simulations across the PRD. Our study highlights the value of multisite observations in validating NH3 inventory and the critical need to better characterize underestimated (e.g., vehicles) and missing sources (e.g., urban landscaping) in current inventories."

The degrees to which contemporary CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ and climate trends drive this absorption are uncertain, as are the governing mechanisms. To reduce uncertainty, we use Bayesian model‐data integration (CARbon DAta MOdel fraMework) to retrieve a terrestrial biosphere reanalysis where Earth Observations optimally inform mechanistic model processes: observations include satellite‐ and inventory‐based constraints on distributions and change in terrestrial C (including live biomass, dead organic C, and land‐atmosphere CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ exchanges) and underlying mechanisms (including photosynthesis, deforestation, water storage anomalies, and fire). We find that the impact of 2001–2021's atmospheric CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ increase on terrestrial C (+39.4 PgC) opposes and far outweighs the impact of climate trends over this period (− ${-}$10.5 PgC). Globally, C gains are mostly attributable to live biomass growth (+31.2 PgC), while CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$‐induced dead organic C gains (+7.8 PgC) are compensated by climate‐induced losses (− ${-}$8.8 PgC). The distribution of compensating dead C changes induces an aggregate shift in dead C from high‐ and mid‐latitudes (− ${-}$3.5 PgC) to tropical ecosystems (+2.6 PgC). We additionally find global residence time reductions attributable to CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ (− ${-}$2.6%) and climate (− ${-}$1.3%) reflected across latitudes, irrespective of reservoir C changes. In aggregate, these changes reveal an acceleration and redistribution of terrestrial C stores in response to CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ and climate trends, which together reflect a gradual but fundamental reorganization of the terrestrial C cycle. Tracking this reorganization—through robust and continual diagnosis of ecosystem function—is essential for accurately resolving the compensating dynamics governing the strength and resilience of the terrestrial C sink."

 Dust aerosols, primarily originating from arid and semi-arid regions, exert substantial influence on cloud radiative forcing (CRF) by altering cloud microphysical properties and radiative transfer processes. In this study, the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) was employed to quantify the impacts of dust aerosols on CRF over the Chinese mainland from 2000 to 2020. Scenario-based experiments indicated that dust aerosols reduce the cooling effect of shortwave CRF at both the top of the atmosphere (TOA) and the surface (SUR), with annual averages reduced by up to 0.20 ± 0.07 W m−2 and 0.18 ± 0.07 W m−2, respectively. Similarly, the heating effect of longwave CRF is weakened by up to 0.89 W m−2 at SUR and 0.19 W m−2 at TOA. Within the atmosphere, dust aerosols enhanced longwave heating by up to 0.71 W m−2, although their effects on shortwave forcing are more variable. These effects are most pronounced in northern and southwestern China, with stronger impacts observed during spring and summer. The results offer critical insights into how dust aerosols shape regional radiative energy budgets."

 Atmospheric particulate pollution is an important risk factors for stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate the association of size-specific particulate matter (PM) and their components with stroke hospitalization in Northwest China's arid area from 2018 to 2022. Stroke hospitalization data were collected from Gansu Province. Size-specific PM with chemical speciation profiles and concurrent meteorological Data spatially aligned with the geographical coordinates of the included hospitals. The space-time-stratified case-crossover design and the conditional quasi-Poisson regression model were used to analyze the association between PM and stroke hospitalization, and stratified analysis was conducted based on age, gender, region, season and stroke type. This study included 759,473 stroke patients. PM1, PM1-2.5, PM2.5 and PM10 were all observed the highest risk of stroke hospitalization at lag 06 day, with RRs of 1.238 (95 % CI: 1.217–1.260), 1.057 (95 % CI: 1.049–1.066), 1.067 (95 % CI: 1.060–1.074) and 1.012 (95 % CI: 1.009–1.015).

 The interaction between aerosol particles and thunderstorm evolution and properties is complex and was studied by direct observational campaigns, remote sensing from space and through numerical simulations. Aerosols invigorate convection and can lead to enhanced charging manifested in more lightning, but they can also lead to a “Boomerang Effect” where too large concentrations of particles lead to diminished vertical development and weaker electrical activity. The effects of ship exhaust on ocean cloudiness have been studied intensively in recent years, following the discovery of prolonged ship tracks in oceanic regions where maritime transportation is most heavy, leading to large-scale changes in albedo and reduced precipitation. Recently it was shown that aerosols emitted by ships also tend to increase lightning activity, by modifying the dynamics and microphysics of clouds formed directly above the busiest shipping lanes. Here, we study the effects of ship-emitted aerosols on thunderstorms in one of the busiest shipping routes in the world: the Mediterranean Sea between the Suez Canal and the Gibraltar Straights. This region hosts hundreds of ships daily, and space observations show considerable enhancement of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and sulphate concentrations there, some from land sources and others directly related to maritime transportation. The research utilized 14 winter months of lightning detection networks data (ENTLN, from 2018 to 2022) and studied the properties of lightning with respect to sulphate concentrations and cloud properties. The results were divided between before and after the International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulation change in January 2020 that curbed sulphate emissions from 3.5 % to 0.5 %. We show a marked increase in winter lightning activity over the main east-west shipping lanes. That spatial enhancement is all but gone following the reduction in sulphate emissions from ships from February 2020, and on average, clouds became shallower with a thinner charging layer, testifying to the role of aerosol particles in convective invigoration and lightning generation."

Here, we show that the water vapor injection not only accelerates SO2 oxidation and sulfate production but also increases the aging of ash (coating of ash by sulfate). Our study shows that aerosol aging alone does not explain the rapid loss of ash after the Hunga eruption as observed by satellite instruments. However, some ash might be masked in the observation due to the strong coating. 
 The 2022 Hunga eruption injected an unprecedented 150 Tg of water vapor into the stratosphere, accelerating SO2 oxidation and sulfate aerosol formation. Despite releasing less ash than previous eruptions of similar magnitude, the role of ash in the early plume and its rapid removal remain unclear. We performed experiments with the ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic model with Aerosols and Reactive Trace gases (ICON-ART) to better understand the role of water vapor, SO2 and ash emissions, the aerosol–radiation interaction, and aerosol dynamical processes (nucleation, condensation, and coagulation) in the Hunga plume in the first week after the eruption. Furthermore, we compared our results with satellite observations to validate SO2 oxidation and aerosol dynamical processes. Our results show that about 1.2 Tg of SO2 emission, along with water vapor emission, is necessary to explain both the SO2 column loadings and sulfate aerosol optical depth during the first week after the eruption. Although the model reproduces the development of SO2 and sulfate aerosols well, the aerosol dynamics alone cannot explain the ash removal after the eruption, as was seen in satellite images. However, some of the ash might not be detected due to the exceptionally strong coating of the ash particles. Both the strong coating and a doubling of the sulfate effective radii within 1 week occur only when water vapor emission is included in the chemistry. Furthermore, the aerosol–radiation interaction warms the plume and reduces or, depending on the experiment, even reverses the descent of the water vapor plume that would otherwise occur due to radiative cooling."

Nussbaumer;Laura Stecher;Matthias Kohl;Samuel Ruhl;Holger Tost;Jos Lelieveld;Andrea Pozzer,Changes in global atmospheric oxidant chemistry from land cover conversion,"This work examines the impact of replacing forests with farmland and grazing areas on atmospheric composition. Using a global climate–chemistry model, we found that deforestation reduces biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), increases farming emissions, and shifts ozone chemistry. These changes result in a slight cooling effect on the climate. Restoring natural vegetation could reverse some of these effects. 
 Human activities have profoundly altered natural vegetation, primarily by converting pristine natural land to agriculture and grazing. Land cover change (LCC) influences the Earth system through modifications of surface albedo, roughness length, evapotranspiration, and atmospheric composition. This work investigates how LCC-driven changes in biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) fluxes, anthropogenic surface emissions, natural soil NO emissions, and O3 deposition fluxes affect atmospheric chemistry. The chemistry–climate model EMAC was used to compare: (1) present-day land cover, which includes areas deforested for crops and grazing, with the potential natural vegetation (PNV) cover simulated by the model, and (2) an extreme reforestation scenario where grazing land is restored to natural vegetation. Our results show that the expansion of agricultural land reduces global BVOC emissions, leading to larger annual average surface OH concentrations (+5.7 %) and lower CO mixing ratios (−6.2 %), despite increased CO from agricultural burning. Meanwhile, NOx mixing ratios increase (+7.8 %) due to enhanced anthropogenic and natural soil sources. While regional ozone responses vary, global ozone production sensitivity shifts from a NOx- to a VOC-sensitive regime. These changes influence radiative forcing with reductions in tropospheric O3 and CH4 lifetimes exerting a combined radiative effect of −60 mW m−2 (cooling), partially offsetting the warming from reduced BVOC-driven aerosol formation. Reforestation of grazing areas reverses these trends to some extent, though with a weaker response."

The algorithm improves upon the OMI O2–O2 operational cloud algorithm in several aspects. The new approach improves consistency in cloud parameters and NO2​ retrievals between two sensors. 
 We present a new cloud retrieval algorithm using the O2–O2 absorption band at 477 nm, designed to provide harmonized cloud datasets from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). The goal of these derived cloud data is to mitigate the influence of clouds on the retrieval of tropospheric trace gases from UV–Visible nadir satellite spectrometers. The retrieval process consists of two main steps. First, spectral fitting is performed using the differential optical absorption spectroscopy (DOAS) method to determine the O2–O2 slant column and calculate the reflectance at the center of the fitting window. Second, these parameters are used to derive cloud fraction and cloud pressure.This retrieval algorithm builds on the OMI O2–O2 operational cloud algorithm (OMCLDO2) with several improvements. The fitting procedure uses a broader fitting window, incorporating the O2–O2 absorption bands at 446 and 477 nm, to more accurately derive O2–O2 slant column densities (SCDs). A de-striping correction is applied to address across-track variability, and an offset correction of −0.08 × 1043 molec.2 cm−5, motivated by radiative transfer simulations, is applied in the TROPOMI retrieval to improve the consistency with OMI. Additionally, a temperature correction factor is included to account for the temperature dependence of both the O2–O2 SCD and the O2–O2 absorption cross-section. Consistent auxiliary data, such as meteorological information and a surface albedo database, are used for both sensors. Due to the inadequate signal-to-noise ratios in the daily solar irradiance measurements by OMI, a fixed annual-averaged irradiance for 2005 is used as a reference for the reflectance spectra in the spectral fittings.To evaluate the performance of our retrieval approach, we compare it with the OMCLDO2 algorithm for both OMI and TROPOMI. The cloud fraction retrievals demonstrate good agreement, whereas the cloud pressure retrievals show a systematic bias, particularly in nearly cloud-free scenes. Our cloud pressure estimates tend to be higher than OMCLDO2 for OMI and lower for TROPOMI. Notably, our approach demonstrates improved consistency in cloud parameters, especially cloud pressure, between the two sensors compared to OMCLDO2. However, a consistent bias of approximately 0.05 in cloud fraction retrievals is observed, primarily attributed to differences in L1b data that show systematic biases between the OMI and TROPOMI reflectances. Applying these cloud corrections to NO2 retrievals reveals that the average impact of cloud corrections ranges from −6 % to 11 % in polluted regions. Differences in NO2 air mass factor (AMF) resulting from varying cloud correction methods can exceed 10 %. Importantly, the new correction approach achieves better consistency in NO2 retrievals between OMI and TROPOMI."

The dataset is considered unique with respect to a range of applications, including compensating for spatiotemporal gaps of sediment-trap measurements, assessments of model simulations, shedding light on physical processes related to the dust cycle, and improving the understanding of dust biogeochemical impacts on oceanic ecosystems, weather, and climate. 
 Quantification of atmospheric dust deposition into the Atlantic Ocean is provided. The estimates rely on the four-dimensional structure of atmospheric dust provided by the ESA-LIVAS climate data record established on the basis of CALIPSO-CALIOP observations. The data record of the atmospheric dust deposition rate is provided for the Atlantic Ocean region, between latitudes 60° S and 40° N, and is characterized by 5° (zonal) × 2° (meridional) spatial resolution and seasonal-mean temporal resolution for the period December 2006–November 2022. The estimates of dust deposition are evaluated on the basis of sediment-trap measurements of deposited lithogenic material. The evaluation intercomparison shows a good agreement between the two datasets, revealing the capacity of the satellite-based product to quantitatively provide the amount of dust deposited into the Atlantic Ocean, characterized by a correlation coefficient of 0.79 and a mean bias of 5.42 mg m−2 d−1. Integration of the satellite-based dust deposition rate dataset into AeroVal allowed assessment comparison of the dust deposition product against dust deposition field estimates provided by the MONARCH, EMEP MSC-W, and EC-Earth3-Iron models. The comparison revealed the capacity of the satellite-based product to follow the seasonal activation of dust source regions and the four-dimensional migration of dust transport pathways. Overall, the annual-mean amount of dust deposition into the Atlantic Ocean is estimated at 274.79 ± 31.64 Tg yr−1, of which 243.98 ± 23.89 Tg yr−1 of dust is deposited into the North Atlantic Ocean and 30.81 ± 10.49 Tg yr−1 of dust is deposited into the South Atlantic Ocean. Moreover, a negative statistically significant trend in atmospheric dust deposition over the Atlantic Ocean is revealed. The satellite-based dust deposition product is considered unique with respect to a wide range of potential applications, including compensating for geographical and temporal gaps of sediment-trap measurements, supporting evaluation assessments of model simulations, unraveling physical processes related to the atmospheric cycle of dust, and providing a deeper understanding of dust biogeochemical impacts on oceanic ecosystems, weather, and eventually climate.

Nevertheless, the uncertainties of temperature and humidity profiles in the boundary layer from the sounders are relatively large due to the difficulty on distinguishing surface contributions from radiances measured by low‐peaking channels, which limits the quantitative applications. Since the dense ground stations provide rich 2‐m temperature and moisture observations near continuously, although those observations do not contain vertical profile information directly, integration together with sounder measurements can improve the boundary layer profiling. Using Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard Fengyun‐4B (FY‐4B) as a precursor geostationary sounder through theoretical analysis, simulation, and real data experiments using the optimal estimation method, it is found that integration of ground station observations and satellite sounder measurements can substantially reduce errors by 0.3 K and 2% (absolute) for temperature and humidity, respectively, in the boundary layer, highlighting the value of integrating geostationary hyperspectral IR measurements with ground station observations for quantitative applications such as nowcasting the high impact weather events in near real time."

 This study investigated regional contrasts in the vertical structure and radiative characteristics of clouds between two mid-latitude continental regions—Oklahoma in the central United States and the Korean Peninsula in East Asia—using 12 years of satellite observations (2006–2017) from CloudSat and CALIPSO. Despite being located within a similar latitudinal band, the two regions exhibited contrasting cloud regimes due to variations in meteorological conditions, boundary-layer structure, and convective forcing. Satellite observation analyses showed that vertical development of clouds was generally deeper and more vertically continuous over Oklahoma, while clouds over Korea were typically shallower and more seasonally variable, especially confined to lower altitudes during winter. The analysis of radiative heating indicates that relatively stronger shortwave heating and longwave cooling frequently occur in the upper troposphere over Oklahoma, consistent with deep convective systems. In contrast, Korea exhibited heating rates that were dominant below the mid troposphere, associated with relatively weak vertical development of clouds. Thermodynamic analysis using equivalent potential temperature and relative humidity profiles showed that the atmospheric conditions over Korea were relatively more stable and humid, and exhibited greater seasonal variability compared to those over Oklahoma. Our findings showed that cloud radiative characteristics between Oklahoma and Korea regions were notably different based on long-term satellite observations. This study can contribute to providing a conceptual reference for conducting observational analysis of mid-latitudinal climate regions."

We exploit this sensitivity and perform the first retrieval of ice cloud properties using these wavelengths from an observation taken on an aircraft and evaluate it against measurements of the cloud’s properties. 
 Studies have indicated that far-infrared radiances hold significant information about the microphysics of ice clouds, particularly the ice crystal habit. In support of the European Space Agency's Far-Infrared Outgoing Radiation Understanding and Monitoring mission, we perform the first retrieval on an observation of coincident upwelling far- and mid-infrared radiances taken from an aircraft above a cirrus cloud layer. Four retrievals are performed: including and neglecting the far-infrared portion of the spectrum and assuming two different habit mixes. Results are compared to in situ measurements of the cloud optical thickness, cloud top height, cloud effective radius, and habit distributions. We find that despite the known limitations of ice cloud optical property models, all the retrievals show agreement within the in situ measurements of the cloud optical thickness, cloud top height, and cloud effective radius. However, the inclusion of the far-infrared enables a distinction between two different habits that is not possible using only mid-infrared channels. Furthermore, in this case study, the uncertainty in the retrieval of cloud top height and cloud optical thickness halves with the inclusion of the far-infrared. As with other studies, we also see an additional degree of freedom for the temperature and water vapour retrievals. Our study highlights the need for the improvement of current ice cloud optical models, with the radiance residuals from the converged retrievals still exceeding the instrument uncertainty within the far-infrared. However, it provides observational support for the theoretical improvement that far-infrared observations could bring to retrievals of ice cloud properties."

Both OMI and Pandora show that HCHO has a strong seasonal dependence. The daily amount of NO2 pollution is underestimated by the OMI satellite observations. Pandora O3 measurements have been successfully compared with hourly satellite measurements from the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC). 
 Observations of trace gases, such as O3, HCHO, and NO2, and their seasonal dependence can be made using satellite and ground-based data from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) satellite and Pandora ground-based instruments. Both operate with spectrometers that have similar characteristics in wavelength range and spectral resolution that enable them to retrieve total column amounts of formaldehyde (TCHCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (TCNO2) and total column ozone (TCO). The polar orbiting OMI observes at 13:30 ± 0:25 LST (local solar time) plus an occasional second side-scan point 90 min later at mid-latitudes. The ground-based Pandora spectrometer system observes the direct sun all day, with a temporal resolution of 2 min. At most sites, the Pandora data show a strong seasonal dependence for TCO and TCHCHO and less seasonal dependence for TCNO2. Use of a low-pass filter LOWESS(3-month) can reveal the seasonal dependence of TCNO2 for both OMI and Pandora at mid-latitude sites usually correlated with seasonal heating using natural gas or oil. Compared to Pandora, OMI underestimates the amount of NO2 air pollution that occurs during most days, as the OMI TCNO2 retrieval occurs around 13:30 ± 0:25 LST, which tends to be near the frequent minimum of the daily TCNO2 time series. Even when the Pandora data are restricted to between 13:00 and 14:00 LST, OMI retrieves less TCNO2 than Pandora over urban sites because of OMI's large field of view. The seasonal behavior of TCHCHO is mostly caused by the release of HCHO precursors from plant growth and emissions from lakes that peak in the summer, as observed by Pandora and OMI. Long-term averages show that OMI TCHCHO usually has the same seasonal dependence but differs in magnitude from the amount measured by Pandora and is frequently larger. Comparisons of OMI total column NO2 and HCHO with Pandora daily time series show both agreement and disagreement at various sites and for different days, with the Pandora results frequently being larger. For ozone, daily time-dependent comparisons of OMI TCO with those retrieved by Pandora show good agreement in most cases. Additional diurnal comparisons are shown of Pandora TCO with hourly retrievals during a day from the EPIC (Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera) spacecraft instrument orbiting the Earth–Sun Lagrange point L1."

Through simulations and analysis of real data, we show that NH3 can be measured effectively from spectra with reduced resolution, either in a contiguous spectral range or in select well-chosen bands. This approach opens possibilities for the development of smaller dedicated instruments for observing NH3 at high spatial resolution. 
 Over the past decade, hyperspectral infrared sounders on satellites have offered global measurements of atmospheric ammonia (NH3), providing valuable insights into its sources. However, due to their coarse spatial resolution and gaps in spatial coverage, inferring emissions from smaller sources or utilizing data from single overpasses remains very challenging. While a high-spatial-resolution imaging sounder would greatly enhance monitoring capabilities, developing an instrument that combines high spatial and spectral resolution is technologically difficult and expensive. Here, we analyze the feasibility of measuring NH3 with instruments having a largely reduced spectral coverage and resolution compared to current operational sounders. We explore the performance trade-offs using simulated spectra, measurements from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) satellite sounder, and spectra obtained from aircraft. The measured spectra are degraded spectrally, and their performance is evaluated using metrics such as NH3 measurement uncertainty, signal-to-noise ratio, and false alarm rate. Instruments that measure across a continuous spectral interval and instruments covering specific well-chosen spectral bands are both examined. We demonstrate that a future dedicated NH3 sounder with as few as 3 spectral bands of 1–5 cm−1 is feasible and would enable the detection of NH3 both at high spatial resolution and across continental scales. The advantage of choosing well-defined spectral bands is demonstrated, e.g., by showing that an instrument with 5 specific bands of 5 cm−1 performs similarly to one with 20 contiguous channels across 900–1000 cm−1. Additionally, we show that at high spectral resolutions (below 5 cm−1), the NH3 measurement capability is primarily driven by the instrumental noise. As the spectral resolution or number of measurement bands decreases, spectral interferences from other atmospheric constituents and the surface start to dominate the NH3 retrieval uncertainty budget, fundamentally limiting the unambiguous identification of NH3."

Catalytic oxidation is a leading VOC abatement method but suffers from catalyst deactivation due to metal sintering and competitive adsorption in complex mixtures. Strong metal–support interactions (SMSIs) provide atomic level control of interfacial electronic and geometric structures. SMSI enables bidirectional charge transfer, d band center modulation, oxygen vacancy generation, and tunable encapsulation that together promote O2 activation, lower barriers, and impart thermal and chemical robustness. This review synthesizes mechanistic insights and recent progress in SMSI-enabled VOC oxidation, integrating in situ and operando probes with kinetics. Reactivity and selectivity across aromatics, alkanes, oxygenates, and chlorinated species are rationalized by SMSI-mediated tuning of adsorption and intermediate evolution. Practical levers include control of particle size and dispersion, core–shell architectures, metal loading, and support acidity or basicity. Emerging directions include single atom catalysts, high entropy alloys, and nonmetal supports. Key challenges concern the dynamic evolution of SMSI under realistic feeds and the scalable, reproducible synthesis of interfaces. Future developments combining in situ characterization with data-driven catalyst design hold promise for achieving durable, high-performance VOC abatement with reduced precious metal usage."

This work comprehensively investigated the variation characteristics, driving mechanisms, and future projections of DPEs in the TB by leveraging integrated space–air–ground multisource observations combined with numerical modeling. Results show that DPEs are widespread in the TB. 78.55% of the DPEs that occurred had daily precipitation intensity of <3 mm d–1, and 92.85% of the DPEs produced with daily minimum horizontal visibility of <5 km. Statistical analyses suggested that DPEs might act as one of the main contributors to extreme precipitation events in the TB. Dust event creates conditions of moisture supply and dynamic forcing favorable for precipitation, while enhanced water vapor conditions further amplify dust–cloud interactions. Although the frequency and precipitation amount of DPEs are projected to decline by 2100 across various emission scenarios, they are expected to persist at elevated levels until 2050, particularly under medium-to-high emission trajectories.

Both PBMTSP and PBM2.5 exhibited positive odd and even mass‐independent fractionation (MIF), with Δ199Hg values in PBM2.5 enriched by 0.25 ± 0.35‰ relative to PBMTSP. The slopes between Δ199Hg and Δ201Hg, along with sulfur MIF and backward trajectories, suggest that intense photoreduction reactions during long‐distance and high‐altitude transport are the primary driver of the elevated Δ199Hg in fine particulate matter. Importantly, significant positive MIF signatures can occur not only in remote areas but also in anthropogenic Hg emission regions, underscoring the underestimated role of atmospheric transport, particularly on clean days."

 Vertical distribution of atmospheric aerosols has a significant impact on climate change, air quality, cloud-aerosol interactions, atmospheric remote sensing, and global transport. However, current aerosol layer height (ALH) retrieval algorithms, based on passive radiometry, are largely affected by surface reflectance, limiting their applicability to surface with low reflectance, for example, ocean and dark-target land surfaces. The Aerosol Single-scattering albedo and layer Height Estimation (ASHE) algorithm can be well adapted to both land and ocean, but it is strongly influenced by aerosol optical depth (AOD) uncertainty and requires estimation of expected aerosol-free radiation. In order to reduce the effects of AOD uncertainty and to simplify the method, a UV band difference quotient coefficient (UVD) method is developed in this study. First, in the retrieval process, UV aerosol index (UVAI), AOD, and Ångström exponent (AE) are incorporated to perform cloud screening and aerosol type classification (distinguishing between smoke and dust). Next, utilizing the high sensitivity of Rayleigh scattering and the wavelength dependence of aerosol absorption, the logarithmic difference of UV dual-band normalized radiance lnr340−lnr378 is used to capture and amplify the impact of ALH on radiance differences. By incorporating the normalization effect of the two-band difference r340−r378, the effects from AOD uncertainty are partially offset, resulting in a monotonic, stable, and sensitive response of the UVD to the ALH. Finally, lookup tables (LUTs) for smoke and dust aerosols are built to retrieve ALH. The UVD method was validated using CALIOP observations from a series of well-documented North American biomass burning events and Atlantic dust storms. The validation results indicate that the RMSE ranges from 0.67 to 1.42 km (mean: 0.99 km), while the bias varies between −0.62 and 0.57 km, with a correlation coefficient of 0.71. Additionally, the error distribution of UVD-CALIOP is concentrated within the range of −1 km to 1 km, with 75 % of the data points having an error within 1.13 km."

 Ammonia, a key alkaline gas in the atmosphere, plays a significant role in new particle formation and cloud condensation nuclei activity, particularly in marine environments. On islands rich in avian fauna, ammonia emissions often exceed those in urban areas and are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature and precipitation. This study investigated the NH3 emissions on Heron Island in the Great Barrier Reef using three different methods, namely offline active sampling, offline passive sampling, and online nitrate chemical ionization mass spectrometry (NO3-CIMS). The average NH3 mixing ratio of active sampling, passive sampling, and NO3-CIMS during the sampling period was 29 ± 23 ppb, 29 ± 22 ppb, and 39 ± 19 ppb. Results from the three methods revealed consistent NH3 mixing ratio trends. Changes in NH3 mixing ratio were highly correlated with precipitation events. During precipitation periods, the NH3 mixing ratio increased significantly within 30 min to a few hours after the rain started. Laboratory bird guano experiments further proved that NH3 emissions are more influenced by precipitation than temperature. Besides, the δ15N-NH3 values (−19.5 ‰ to −11.7 ‰) measured by passive samplers negatively correlated with NH3 levels, confirming seabird guano as the primary NH3 source. These findings highlighted the dynamic behavior of NH3 emissions and their sensitivity to environmental factors, shedding light on the potential importance of the Great Barrier Reef ecosystem for atmospheric processes relevant to aerosol formation."

 This study examines whether fine particulate matter (PM2.5) forecasts in New Delhi will continue to benefit from assimilation of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals in the same way as has been seen from assimilation of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) AOD assimilation. Three experiments were conducted with and without constraining aerosols initialization through assimilation of MODIS and VIIRS AOD retrievals in Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). Satellite AOD assimilation significantly improves the agreement between modeled and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) AOD at Kanpur with most of the changes in PM2.5 vertical distribution limited to altitudes below 5 km. Consequently, the assimilation of either MODIS or VIIRS AOD retrievals also reduces the mean bias in 72 h PM2.5 forecasts by 70–86 % and root mean squared error by 20–31 % with improvements of ∼200 μg/m3 during an acute air pollution episode in November 2017. However, the improvements due to VIIRS assimilation are slightly lower (0.5–3 %) than those due to MODIS assimilation. We conclude that VIIRS AOD can effectively replace MODIS in the operational air quality forecasting system after MODIS's end of life and can continue to support air quality management efforts in New Delhi."

 Oil and gas production increased dramatically last decade in the Bakken region, with accompanying changes to pollutant emissions and atmospheric concentrations. WRF-Chem model simulations of the Northern Great Plains were conducted comparing two emission scenarios using 2011 emissions to represent a baseline case with relatively low oil production (<0.4 million barrels per day) and 2014 emissions to represent a high production case (>1.0 million barrels per day). Assessment of model predictions from the baseline scenario against ground level meteorology and air quality measurements showed good overall agreement, demonstrating suitable model performance for assessing the effect of emissions changes on pollutant levels. In the high production scenario emissions of SO2 and NOx were lower across most of the domain (−80 % and −37 %, respectively), but were significantly higher in the Bakken region (+62 % for SO2 and +110 % for NOx), and changes in VOC emissions were also relatively higher in the Bakken. Simulated pollutant concentrations followed these emission changes, with average NOx levels decreasing for the high production scenario by 22 % in the overall domain, but increasing by 72 % in the Bakken. Predicted average O3 levels increased slightly by 0.2 % across the domain as NOx levels decreased, characteristic of VOC-limited conditions, with larger increases in urban areas where NOx reductions were greater. For the Bakken, simulations predict localized O3 decreases in the center of the region, but increases in downwind areas. Changes between the baseline and high production scenarios demonstrate the influence of oil and gas production associated emissions on pollutant concentrations."

 Ozone (O3) pollution is particularly prevalent in spring and exhibits distinctive characteristics in southwestern China. Two significant natural sources contribute to O3 pollution: stratospheric intrusion (SI) and cross-border transport of biomass burning (BB) emissions from Southeast Asia. However, the roles of SI and BB in tropospheric O3 pollution in Southeast China remain insufficiently understood. This study investigated their distinct contributions during a typical SI event, using multi-source observations from AIRS satellite and surface samplers combined with the Goddard Earth Observing System coupled with chemistry (GEOS-Chem). SI and BB were identified as the key drivers of tropospheric O3 enhancement. The upper-level jet stream facilitated SI, while low-level jets, the subtropical high, and low-level troughs created favorable dynamic conditions for the cross-border transport of BB. SI primarily influenced altitudes above 500 hPa, contributing 11.3–40.0 ppb of O3. In comparison, BB transport reached as low as 850 hPa, with a positive contribution ranging from 8.5 to 11.6 ppb. Notably, O3 precursor sensitivity (OPS) rapidly shifted to a VOC-limited regime under the influence of BB. This study highlights the importance of adopting a dynamic emission reduction strategy tailored to varying OPS conditions during different O3 episodes. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers in developing effective strategies to mitigate O3 pollution, considering the impacts of SI and BB."

 Nitrate plays an important role in the Earth system and air quality. A key challenge in simulating the life cycle of nitrate aerosol in global models is to accurately represent mass size distribution of nitrate aerosol. In this study, we evaluate the performance of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model version 2 (E3SMv2) and the Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2), along with Aerosol Comparisons between Observations and Models (AeroCom) phase III models, in simulating spatial distribution of fine-mode nitrate, the mass size distribution of fine- and coarse-mode nitrate, and the gas–aerosol partitioning between nitric acid gas and nitrate, using long-term ground-based observations and measurements from multiple aircraft campaigns. We find that most models underestimate the annual mean PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter less than 2.5 µm) nitrate surface concentration averaged over all sites. The observed nitrate PM2.5 / PM10 and PM1 / PM4 ratios are influenced by the relative contribution of fine sulfate or organic particles and coarse dust or sea salt particles. Overall, the ground-based observations give an annual mean surface nitrate PM2.5 / PM10 ratio of 0.7. Most models underestimate the annual mean PM2.5 / PM10 ratio in all regions. There are large spreads in the modeled nitrate PM1 / PM4 ratios, which span the full range from 0 to 1. Most models underestimate the surface molar ratio of nitrate to total inorganic nitrate averaged across all sites. Our study indicates the importance of gas–aerosol partition parameterization and the simulation of dust and sea salt in correctly simulating the mass size distribution of nitrate."

Tai,Effects of enhancing nitrogen use efficiency in cropland and livestock systems on agricultural ammonia emissions and particulate matter air quality in China,"Through a combination of emission models and air quality models, this study aims to address the pressing issue of poor nitrogen management while promoting sustainable food systems and public health in China. We discovered that improving nitrogen management of crops and livestock can substantially reduce air pollutant emissions, particularly in the North China Plain. Our findings further provide the benefits of such interventions for PM2.5 reductions, offering valuable insights for policymakers. 
 Chinese agriculture has long been characterized by low nitrogen use efficiency (NUE) associated with substantial ammonia (NH3) loss, which contributes significantly to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution. However, the knowledge gaps in the spatiotemporal patterns of NH3 emissions and the states of nitrogen management of agricultural systems render it challenging to evaluate the effectiveness of different mitigation strategies and policies. Here, we explore the NH3 mitigation potential of various agricultural NUE-improving scenarios and their subsequent effects on PM2.5 pollution in China. We developed and used a combination of bottom-up emission models and a nitrogen mass flow model to evaluate the NUE of different crop and livestock types at the provincial scale in China. We generated gridded NH3 emission input to drive a chemical transport model to provide an integrated assessment of the air quality impacts of four improved nitrogen management scenarios. The total agricultural NH3 emission of China was estimated to be 11.2 Tg NH3 in 2017, of which 46.2 % and 53.8 % are attributable to fertilizer use and livestock animal waste, respectively. Our results show that grain crops have higher NUE than fruits and vegetables, while high livestock NUE can be found in pork and poultry. We also found that by implementing different mitigation scenarios, agricultural NH3 emissions can be effectively reduced by 11.6 %–39.3 %. Consequently, annual population-weighted PM2.5 reductions were estimated to be 1.3–4.1 µg m−3. Our results provide decision support for policymaking concerning agricultural NH3 emissions and their public health impacts."

Zhang;Nuanliang Zhu,Covariability of dynamics and composition in the Asian monsoon tropopause layer from satellite observations and reanalysis products,"Swirling above summer storms, the Asian monsoon anticyclone functions as both gateway and gatekeeper to moisture entering the stratosphere. Although well monitored from space since 2005, many details of the anticyclone and the air that flows through it remain mysterious. Reanalyses, which combine model output and observations, may help to address how and why but only if they reliably capture the what and where of water vapor variations. Current reanalyses are beginning to meet these criteria. 
 The upper-level anticyclone above the Asian summer monsoon (ASM) greatly influences variations in stratospheric water vapor, which in turn have significant effects on climate. An impending data gap underscores the need to evaluate the reliability of recent reanalysis products in this region. Here, we describe three leading modes of deseasonalized water vapor variability in the tropopause layer (147–68 hPa) above the ASM. The first mode describes regional-scale moist or dry anomalies that peak in the lower stratosphere on interannual scales. Separating this mode into linear trend and detrended components, we find that the spatial pattern and sign of the trend disagree between observations and reanalyses. These discrepancies arise from different responses in the upper troposphere despite broad agreement in the lower stratosphere. Regional water vapor budgets suggest that the stratospheric trend originates outside the monsoon region, beyond our analysis domain. Interannual variability is more consistent, and arises mainly from the pre-monsoon influence of the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. The second mode features anomalies arcing around the northern flank of the anticyclone with weaker opposing anomalies in the southeast, while the third mode features a horizontal dipole oriented east to west. These two modes often vary in quadrature as quasi-biweekly waves propagate across the region but also vary independently when other modes of convective variability manifest in similar areas. Despite lingering questions on the linear trend, mean biases, and data assimilation effects, the consistency between observation- and reanalysis-derived variability demonstrates that reanalyses are increasingly able to capture the processes controlling water vapor near the tropopause."

Ristovski,Measurement report: Aerosol and cloud nuclei properties along the Central and Northern Great Barrier Reef – impact of continental emissions,"Aerosols play a role in global climate by interacting with incoming solar radiation and by taking up water vapour from the atmosphere to form clouds. Enhancing local-scale cloud cover can reduce sea surface temperatures. Coral bleaching events have increased in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) as sea surface temperatures have risen. Our study found that the number of aerosols and the cloud-forming ability over the GBR increased if the aerosols were transported from inland Australia rather than the ocean. 
 The frequency of coral bleaching events increased during the past decade in the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) due to climate change, and rising ocean temperatures. Recent work has demonstrated that enhancing local-scale cloud albedo can reduce the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) in this region. However, little research has been done on variations in the aerosol properties, as well as aerosol–radiation and aerosol–cloud interactions over different regions of the GBR, which is critical for predicting the potential for marine cloud brightening (MCB) climate forcing on a local or regional scale. Here, we examined trends in the aerosol population in terms of their physical and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) properties during a research cruise in the Central and Northern GBR. Overall higher particle number concentrations, CCN number concentrations, and CCN activation ratios were observed during periods where the air masses passed over the continent prior to reaching the research vessel, despite lower hygroscopicity parameters. We suggest that organics contribute considerably to CCN number concentrations in this region of the GBR, which highlight the important role of additional emissions from inland Queensland. As well as the total aerosol number concentration, precipitation history along the back trajectory affected CCN number concentrations. These results represent a first step towards building a climatological understanding of aerosol and CCN properties over the GBR during summertime, a region and season where no observations have been previously reported."

This study isolates fire-specific PM2.5 from observations, showing its increasing proportion in recent years. Our findings indicate that fire-specific PM2.5 disproportionately affects impoverished populations in the Asia Pacific. Furthermore, we suggest that, under future climate change, fire-specific PM2.5 will likely continue rising. This highlights the need for interventions to reduce fire-related air pollution and its health impacts. 
 Forest and vegetation fires are major sources of air pollution and have triggered air quality issues in many regions of Asia. Measures to reduce fires may be a significant yet under-recognized option for efficiently improving air quality and preventing related premature deaths. Here we isolate fire-specific fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from monitoring concentrations using an observation-driven approach in the region. Fire-specific PM2.5 concentrations average 2–15 µg m−3 during the fire season, with higher values in Southeast Asia (SEA), Northeast Asia (NEA), and northern India. The total PM2.5 in the Asia Pacific region exhibits a rapid declining trend from 2014 to 2021, while fire-specific PM2.5 decreases in early years but begins to reverse in SEA and NEA. The proportions of fire-specific PM2.5 increase in NEA from 0.2 to 0.3 during the fire season and increase in SEA from 0.2 in 2018 to 0.4 in 2021. Fire-specific PM2.5 exposure caused 58 000 (95 % confidence interval (CI) of 32 600–82 600), 90 000 (95 % CI of 63 700–106 000), 157 000 (95 % CI of 110 000–186 000), and 29 300 (95 % CI of 18 000–39 700) premature deaths annually in SEA, East Asia (EA), Central Asia (CA), and NEA, respectively, accounting for 40.9 % (95 % CI of 22.8 %–57.7 %), 14.9 % (95 % CI of 10.5 %–17.6 %), 19.4 % (95 % CI of 13.5 %–24.5 %), and 24.1 % (95 % CI of 14.8 %–32.5 %) of the numbers caused by the total PM2.5. Analysis of infant mortality rate data and PM2.5 exposure indicates that the total PM2.5 exposure had a greater impact in richer areas, while fire-specific PM2.5 exposure affected more populations in poorer regions. Based on the positive correlation between vapor pressure deficit and fire-specific PM2.5, this study suggests that, without further regulation and policy intervention, the emerging growth trend of fire-specific PM2.5 in the Asia Pacific region is likely to continue under the influence of future climate change."

We compare the refractivity retrievals from three RO processing centers – each with their own retrieval algorithm – in the PBL, finding a strong underestimation of refractivity in regions with the strongest refractivity gradients, especially in Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) processing, as well as areas of weak overestimation of refractivity near the poles. 
 Global Navigation Satellite System radio occultation (GNSS RO) performance in the planetary boundary layer is strongly dependent on retrieval algorithms. In this work, we characterize differences in refractivity retrievals in the planetary boundary layer across three major processing centers of GNSS RO data – NASA JPL, ROM SAF, and UCAR. Using a shared base of occultations from the FORMOSAT-3/COSMIC-1 GNSS RO mission, we identify key differences between the three processing centers that are especially strong in the regions of frequent super-refraction. We find that the minimum penetration height allowed by each processing center is correlated with the amount of super-refraction, resulting in poorer penetration and higher refractivity biases in the tropics. We found JPL to have the most conservative minimum height in this region at 1 km, followed by ROM SAF (640 m) and UCAR (420 m). We identify two key geopotential heights – 0.8 and 2.6 km – to sample the global distribution of inter-center refractivity bias, finding differences of 0.3 %–0.5 % in the tropics. We also find negative refractivity biases of up to −4 % relative to ERA5 reanalysis in regions of persistent high stratocumulus coverage and areas along the descending branch of the Hadley circulation, with negligible bias along the Intertropical Convergence Zone. A comparison to ERA5 also reveals areas of weak (0.2 %–0.5 %) positive refractivity biases in polar regions. We hypothesize potential causes for these biases based on truncation schemes, radio-holographic filtering choices, and quality control and identify findings deserving of further investigation."

We evaluate sensitivity dependence on a relatively few key instrument parameters and show that when these are held constant, consistent performance is achieved. We show that the maximum sensitivity of a given flow tube reactor across various reagent ion chemistries is a constant, which aids in the quantification of compounds lacking analytical standards. 
 Chemical ionization mass spectrometers are widely used for the detection of trace gases, particularly in the field of atmospheric science. Depending on the analytes of interest, chemical ionization instruments are operated under varying reactor conditions, which can make it difficult to compare instrument performance, even for the same reagent ion chemistry. This variability leads to inconsistent sensitivity distributions, particularly for weakly bound or labile analytes. As a result, determining sensitivity – instrument response per unit analyte concentration – is challenging, even when comparing the same compound detected with the same reagent ion across different studies. To address this issue, we employed multiple Vocus AIM reactors (Tofwerk AG) to systematically identify the critical parameters affecting sensitivity in flow tube chemical ionization mass spectrometers. Controlling these parameters for a given reactor geometry can significantly reduce sensitivity variations across instruments and operators. We demonstrate that sensitivity normalized to reagent ion concentration serves as a fundamental metric for interpreting results from different datasets operating under uniform chemical ionization conditions, such as those within regional networks or other monitoring applications. Calibrating the sensitivity of benzene cations to a group of hydrocarbons, and comparing it to the sensitivity of iodide anions to levoglucosan, a molecule known to react near the collision limit, reveals that it is possible to map kinetic constraints on sensitivity from one ion mode polarity to another, as long as the critical parameters are held constant. Additionally, we show that collision-limited sensitivity relative to the reagent ion is nearly constant across different ionization mechanisms for a given reactor geometry and set of conditions. This consistency enables the determination of the upper limit of sensitivity, even for reagent ions where the specific molecules reacting at the collision limit are unknown. As a result, the use of the voltage-scanning approach can be extended to a broader range of reagent ion chemistries. This study highlights how collision-limited sensitivity can enhance our understanding of the relationships between different instruments and simplify calibration requirements across various reagent ion chemistries."

Currently heater emissions are not regulated as part of vehicle emissions, so this research was done to assess harmful gaseous and airborne particle emissions from them. Heaters were found to be major source of particles, especially when particles formed after combustion were accounted for, and large carbon monoxide emissions were also observed. 
 Fuel-operated auxiliary heaters (AHs) are potentially significant additional sources of particle- and gas-phase pollution from vehicles, but information on their emissions is scarce. In particular, an understanding of secondary aerosol formation originating from AH exhaust is lacking. In this study, we measured the gas and particle emissions, including secondary emissions, of diesel- and gasoline-operated AHs used in passenger cars. Investigation revealed the importance of peak emissions during start and shutdown events of the heaters and differences between emissions of gasoline- and diesel-fuelled AHs: gasoline-operated AHs also produced particles under steady-state operating conditions, while their diesel counterparts did not. Furthermore, ambient air temperature was observed to impact the emission profiles, with, for example, higher nitrogen oxide (NOx) and particle mass emissions but lower particle number (PN) emissions observed in outdoor (−19 to −7 °C)  measurements compared to laboratory measurements (+25 °C). However, further quantification is necessary to fully connect the temperature-related effects and AH emissions. Our findings highlight the importance of also characterizing the atmospherically aged aerosols, specifically secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, which was simulated here both by an environmental chamber and by an oxidation flow reactor (OFR). The particle mass in photochemically aged aerosols surpassed the fresh exhaust particulate mass emissions by 1 to 3 orders of magnitude, with the increase depending mainly on fuel, combustion conditions, and ageing methods. Further research into formation pathways of secondary aerosols from precursors is still needed, along with the quantification of vehicle AH emissions at the fleet level, to enable the estimation of atmospheric and air quality effects of AH usage."

In this study, the first GHG column-averaged mole fraction measurements (Xgas) at QOMS are presented, including XCO2, XCH4, XCO, and XN2O, derived from a ground-based Fourier-transform infrared spectrometer (FTIR; Bruker EM27/SUN). We then compare them to surface in situ and satellite (the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument, TROPOMI, and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2, OCO-2) measurements. The mean FTIR XCO2 and XCH4 are 7.8 ppm and 97 ppb less than those near the surface, respectively. The difference between OCO-2 land nadir and EM27/SUN XCO2 measurements is 0.21 ± 0.98 ppm, which is consistent with OCO-2 retrieval uncertainty. However, a relatively large bias (1.21 ± 1.29 ppm) is found for OCO-2 glint XCO2 measurements, which is related to the surface albedos and surface altitudes. The EM27/SUN measurements indicate that the uncertainty in OCO-2 satellite XCO2 measurements is relatively large in the QTP mountain region, and its quality needs to be further assessed. The difference between FTIR and TROPOMI XCO measurements is −5.06 ± 5.36 (1σ) ppb (−4.7 ± 5.1 %) within the satellite retrieval uncertainty. The XCO measurements at QOMS show that the local air mass is largely influenced by atmospheric transport from southern Asia, and it is important to carry out long-term measurements to quantify the contribution of the cross-regional transport in this region."

This study examines the evolution of a June 2022 trans-Atlantic Saharan dust outbreak and contextualizes its impact on the 2023 PM2.5 design values (DVs) for continental U.S. air quality monitors. The results demonstrate that the intrusion of Saharan dust yielded mean 24 h PM2.5 values > 35 μg m–3 for multiple days across the Central U.S. and single-handedly elevated the 2022 mean annual PM2.5 by > 0.5 μg m–3 for some Gulf Coast communities. Moreover, the Saharan dust outbreak led to ∼0.1 μg m–3 increases in the 2023 PM2.5 DVs for approximately 20 monitoring sites in Texas and Louisiana, and in the case of Port Allen, La., and at least two other monitors, the Saharan dust pushed the DV above the 9 μg m–3 NAAQS. As this June 2022 episode illustrates, seemingly rare atmospheric phenomena are positioned to play disproportionately large regulatory roles, given the tighter air policy landscape."

E. Cabanes;Marie Méjean;Pascale Besse-Hoggan,Are Clouds a Neglected Reservoir of Pesticides?,"Pesticide contamination is a growing and alarming concern for both the environment and human health. Widely used in agriculture to control pests and disease carriers, pesticides undergo extensive long-range atmospheric transport in the gas phase, in aerosols, and, as shown here, in clouds. We measured the concentration of 32 pesticides at the puy de Dôme observatory (France) in the sub μg L–1 to μg L–1 range in cloud water, largely arising from regional to long-range transport that also involves pesticides currently banned for agricultural use in France. Half of the samples showed a total concentration of pesticides of over 0.5 μg L–1, which is the European drinking water limit. If 2,4-dinitrophenol, which can also be produced by photochemical reactions, is excluded,  two samples still present a total concentration of over 0.5 μg L–1. The frequent detection of pesticides in rainwater may thus depend on their presence in clouds as well as atmospheric washout. Estimates of pesticides’ quantity in clouds over France, ranging from 6.4 ± 3.2 to 139 ± 75 tons, suggest that their amounts in the cloud aqueous phase are potentially high and that these compounds would affect areas that are not directly impacted by agricultural activities."

This study uses TROPOMI satellite observations and mass balance modeling to estimate multiyear (2019–2023) methane emissions rates for a key CHOPS region spanning Alberta and Saskatchewan. The iterative 3-year mean emissions estimates were found to be ∼4.5 times higher than industry-reported data but show a notable downward trend, with a 71 ± 34% reduction over the study period. The methane emissions intensity decreased by 63 ± 31%, reaching 0.69 ± 0.25 gCH4/MJ, but remains substantially higher than that of other oil production basins globally. Although the TROPOMI-based emission reductions were found higher than the industry-reported reductions, our emission estimates remain notably higher than the industry-reported emissions. Deficient industry reporting makes identifying root causes difficult, underscoring the need for robust measurement systems to benchmark and drive performance improvements. Potential drivers for the observed reductions include regulatory efforts targeting vent gas and fugitive emissions, an increased use of solution gas combustors, and a 19% decline in production during the period. While the exact causes remain uncertain, the measurable reductions demonstrate progress toward lowering methane emissions in the region."

This study investigated the dark, photolysis, and oxidation reactions of methylglyoxal (MG) and butanedione (BD) by using a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A total of 11 or 10 gaseous products were detected in the initial MG or BD system, with acetaldehyde or acetone as the dominant product, exhibiting a concentration of 3.90 or 0.53 times that of gaseous MG or BD. Dark reaction increased the concentration of acetaldehyde by 95.91 ppb but decreased that of acetone by 3.15 ppb, and photolysis reaction further decreased the concentration of acetone by 4.75 times, while resulting in the concentration of acetaldehyde peaking at 106.78 ppb before decreasing to 17.34 ppb. “UV + OH” reaction rapidly decreased the concentrations of acetaldehyde and acetone, but quickly increased the concentration of acetic acid, which became the dominant product, accounting for >32%. Combined experimental data and Master Chemical Mechanism analysis revealed that dicarbonyls generated key acyl radicals, which then formed monocarbonyls that further polymerized into higher-mass oligomers.

Our results show that ephemeral lakes contribute as much as 52% of dust emission in the Southern Hemisphere (SH), but only 10% in the Northern Hemisphere and 13% globally. Due to the action of physical processes, dust mineralogy of the lakes differs from their surroundings. With no reliable data sets, we performed a sensitivity analysis of dust absorption. With increasing absorption from lakes, lake dust's radiative cooling decreases from −0.1 to −0.03 Wm−2, globally. These findings highlight the dominant role of ephemeral lakes in the SH dust budget and underscore the need to include them in climate models to better represent dust‐radiation interactions and ocean biogeochemical feedback."

Palm;Yuekui Yang,ICESat‐2 Lidar Estimates of Clear‐Sky Precipitation Over the East Antarctic Plateau,"Precipitation over Antarctica plays a critical role in determining the mass balance of the ice sheet, yet it remains poorly quantified due to the harsh environment and sparse number of observations. Over the East Antarctic Plateau, clear‐sky precipitation (CSP) is a significant portion of the total annual precipitation. CSP consists of very small ice crystals that form when the air becomes supersaturated and settles to the surface. This study presents the first continental‐scale estimates of CSP over the East Antarctic Plateau using atmospheric backscatter profiles from the Ice, Cloud and land Elevation Satellite‐2 (ICESat‐2) lidar. A method is developed to identify CSP based on calibrated attenuated backscatter and to estimate the associated precipitation amounts by deriving ice water content from lidar extinction and using an estimated particle fall speed to obtain precipitation rate. Comparisons with in situ measurements at Concordia Station, Dome C show general agreement. Results for the April–October 2021 period reveal a high frequency of CSP (up to 80%) across the high Plateau. The ICESat‐2 estimated CSP amount for this period ranges from about 5 to 8 mm snow water equivalent (SWE) south of about 80S and increases toward the north with maximum values of 18–20 mm SWE near 70S, 90E. The ICEsat‐2 estimated CSP amount for the grid box containing Dome C was 8.5 mm SWE which agrees well with the amount measured there (9.9 mm SWE). These findings demonstrate the unique ability of ICESat‐2 to detect and quantify CSP, offering new insight into Antarctic precipitation and providing a valuable data set for evaluating the surface mass balance of Antarctica."

Using models and global data, it finds that organic aerosols dominate in many regions, especially with wildfires or natural emissions. Pollution from sulfate and nitrate has decreased in Europe and North America due to regulations, while trends in Asia are more complex. The findings improve understanding and support policies for cleaner air and healthier environments. 
 Atmospheric aerosols significantly impact Earth's climate and air quality. In addition to their number and mass concentrations, chemical composition influences their environmental effects. This study examines global trends in aerosol composition from 2000 to 2020, using the EMAC atmospheric chemistry–climate model and a variety of observational datasets. These include PM2.5 surface data from regional networks and 744 PM1 datasets from 169 aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) field campaigns worldwide. Organic aerosol (OA) is the dominant fine aerosol component across all continents, particularly in areas with significant biomass burning and biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. EMAC reproduces the prevalence of secondary OA but underestimates OA aging, revealing uncertainties in distinguishing fresh versus aged secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Although sulfate remains a major component in filter-based observations, both AMS measurements and model simulations reveal that nitrate has emerged as the dominant aerosol species in Europe and Eastern Asia over the past decade, except in summer. Mineral dust also contributes significantly to specific regions, as highlighted by EMAC. The study identifies substantial declines in sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium in Europe and North America, attributed to emission controls, though EMAC underestimates these reductions, especially sulfate, due to discrepancies in early 2000s levels. In Eastern Asia, sulfate reductions due to SO2 controls are partially captured. OA trends differ between methodologies, with filter data showing slight decreases, while AMS and model results suggest slight increases in PM1 OA across Europe, North America, and Eastern Asia. These findings underscore the need for integrating advanced models and diverse datasets to better understand aerosol trends and guide environmental policy."

Mozammel Haque;Ambarish Pokhrel;Sangeeta Sharma;Leonard Barrie,Carbonate content and stable isotopic composition of atmospheric aerosol carbon in the Canadian High Arctic,"Carbonate carbon (CC) is not negligible in Arctic total suspended particles (TSPs). If not considered, CC biases the contribution of elemental and organic carbon. CC content in TSPs was strongly reflected in the δ13C values of total carbon (TC). The carbon contribution from CaCO3 supports the strong dependence of CC and δ13C on Ca. Finally, two hypothetical CC sources were identified based on the analysis of air mass back trajectories: dust resuspension and marine microorganisms. 
 The carbon cycle in the Arctic atmosphere is important in understanding abrupt climate changes occurring in this region; 2 years of measurements (summer 2016 to spring 2018) of carbonaceous aerosols at the High Arctic station Alert, Canada, showed that, in addition to organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), carbonate carbon (CC) was episodically but not negligibly present. The relative abundances of CC in total carbon (TC) ranged from 0 % to 65 %, with an average of approximately 11 % over the entire period. Also, there was a strong correlation of CC with aerosol Ca2+, which is associated mostly with soil dust and, to a lesser extent, sea salt aerosol. Based on this and the analysis of air mass back trajectories (AMBTs), we infer two possible sources of CC in the Arctic total suspended particles (TSPs). The major one is the erosion and resuspension of limestone sediments, particularly in the semi-desert areas of the northern Canadian Arctic. Another potential minor source of CC is marine aerosol, including calcified marine phytoplankton shells (coccoliths) introduced into the atmosphere via sea-to-air emission.The CC content significantly influenced the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of TC. The higher the CC content, the higher the δ13C values, which is consistent with the strong 13C enrichment in carbonates. Therefore, carbonates in Arctic TSPs must be taken into account not only in isotopic studies using δ13C analyses but also when assessing the impact of carbonaceous aerosols on the Arctic climate."

To address this issue, we incorporated 177 halogen reactions, together with anthropogenic and natural halogen emissions into the CTMs. Our findings reveal that incorporation of these halogen processes significantly improves model performances compared to observations. In addition, we emphasize the influence of halogen radicals on air quality. 
 Halogen radicals (Cl, Br, and I) significantly influence atmospheric oxidation capacity, affecting both O3 formation and destruction. However, understanding of halogen chemistry remains limited. To better investigate comprehensive atmospheric halogen chemistry, we incorporated halogen processes into the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model: (i) emissions of Cl2, HCl, Br2, and HBr from anthropogenic sources and Br2, I2, HOI, and halocarbons from natural sources and (ii) 177 multi-phase halogen reactions. Model performance was evaluated against observed ClNO2 levels and by comparison with reported ranges of BrO and IO levels. The updated model showed significant improvements in simulating ClNO2 mixing ratios, with the index of agreement (IOA) increasing from 0.41 to 0.66 and mean bias (MB) decreasing from −159.36 to −25.07 ppt at supersites. Furthermore, simulated BrO and IO levels fell within the ranges reported in previous studies. We found that these improvements were driven by four key reactions: (i) ClO self-reaction, (ii) heterogeneous HOBr chemistry, (iii) NO2 uptake, and (iv) revised N2O5 parameterization. Based on our modeling system, we found that the presence of halogen radicals led to changes in the net Ox production rate (P(Ox)), which increased from 3.08 to 3.33 ppb h−1 on land and decreased from 0.21 to 0.07 ppb h−1 over ocean. It was noted that levels of OH, HCHO, and NOx also increased by ∼0.007 ppt (5.5 %), ∼0.03 ppb (1.6 %), and ∼0.29 ppb (2.9 %), respectively, while levels of HO2 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) decreased by ∼0.45 ppt (5.3 %) and ∼0.71 ppb (5.9 %).

This study explores how pollutants from urban sources, as m-xylene and naphthalene, form new particles in the atmosphere under different conditions. Using advanced techniques, we show how temperature and nitrogen oxides affect the formation and behavior of these particles. Our findings will improve our understanding of secondary organic particle and air quality models. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react with atmospheric oxidants, resulting in oxygenated products of lower volatility known as semi-volatile and intermediate-volatility organic compounds (S/IVOCs), which form secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). Those compounds can partition between the gas and particle phases, a critical process that is influenced by several environmental parameters yet is poorly constrained. This study aims to evaluate the effect of temperature and the VOC/NOx ratio on SOA formation and the partitioning of individual SOA products from m-xylene and naphthalene OH oxidation.  Experiments are carried out in an oxidation flow reactor (OFR), and products are identified and quantified using a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) coupled to a CHemical Analysis of aeRosol ONline (CHARON) inlet. Results show that lower temperatures significantly enhance SOA formation, while lower VOC/NOx ratios reduce it. Gas-phase m-xylene major products are C3, C5, and C8 compounds, whereas particle–product distributions exhibit a progressive increase from C2 to C8. In contrast, naphthalene products partition more readily into the condensed phase, with C8–C10 products dominating. Most of the oxidation products from both precursors exhibit a volatility distribution in the SVOC regime, with fewer in the IVOC regime. The decrease in temperature shifts the effective saturation concentration (Ci∗) values towards lower values, although no clear relationship between Ci∗ and the oxidation state is observed. A comparison between observed and estimated volatilities using a model based on the group contribution method (SIMPOL.1) reveals systematic deviations for both light molecules and heavy compounds, suggesting a need for improved predictive models."

This paper shows that low-cost sensors coupled with artificial intelligence are an excellent alternative. 
 Ground-level ozone (O3) is a highly oxidizing gas with very reactive properties. It is harmful at high levels and is generated by complex photochemical reactions when primary pollutants from the combustion of fossil materials react with sunlight. Thus, its concentration indicates the activity of other air pollutants and plays a crucial role in smart cities.  With the growing interest in high-resolution air quality (AQ) monitoring, low-cost ozone sensors present an interesting alternative, although they lack accuracy and suffer from cross-sensitivity issues. In this context, artificial intelligence techniques, particularly ensemble machine learning (ML) models, can improve the raw readings from these sensors by incorporating additional environmental information to minimize inaccuracies and nonlinearities, as well as by including metadata to account for sensor aging effects and improve the models based on road traffic patterns.  In this paper, based on the low-cost ZPHS01B multisensor module with nine sensors, we analyze, propose, and compare different techniques using four ML models in a low O3 concentration scenario (mean value of 55.72 µg m−3). We carried out a thorough exploratory data analysis process to extract the main features (variables) and performed hyperparameter optimization for the different models. As a result, we reduced the estimation error by approximately 94.05 %. In particular, using the gradient boosting algorithm, we achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.022 µg m−3 and a mean relative error (MRE) of 7.21 %, outperforming related work while using a module approximately 10 times less expensive. To carry out this work, we generated two datasets in the city of Valencia (Spain), at two different locations with the same characteristics (close to the ring road but separated by 4.1 km), of 165 and 239 d."

In Chiang Mai, Thailand, we developed a new light detection and ranging (lidar)-based method to better distinguish key atmospheric layers by incorporating temperature-based adjustments. This improves accuracy, especially at night, compared to traditional techniques. Our findings help refine air quality models and provide better data for tackling pollution in Southeast Asia. 
 Accurate determination of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, mixing-layer height (MLH), and aerosol layer top (ALT) is essential for air quality and climate studies, particularly in regions with complex aerosol dynamics such as Chiang Mai, northern Thailand. This study introduces a novel lidar-based retrieval method that integrates a temperature-dependent, dynamic maximum analysis altitude (MAA) into the traditional Haar wavelet covariance transform (WCT) framework. Unlike conventional fixed-altitude WCT approaches, which often misclassify the ALT as the PBL – especially under stable nighttime or transitional conditions – this dynamic approach adapts the vertical search range for PBL detection in real time using observed surface temperature variations. The method is physically grounded in boundary layer thermodynamics, allowing for more accurate identification of the true PBL top while reducing contamination from residual aerosol layers and low clouds. Validation against radiosonde observations and comparison with previously validated WRF-Chem simulations demonstrate strong agreement, with the lidar-derived PBL heights capturing diurnal variations more reliably than traditional methods. The findings also reveal model biases during high-aerosol events, highlighting the need for improved aerosol–meteorology coupling in mesoscale models. This integrated retrieval framework represents a significant advancement in lidar-based boundary layer detection and offers a robust tool for enhancing pollutant dispersion analysis, air quality forecasting, and climate modeling across aerosol-rich regions in Southeast Asia."

Burrows;Hartmut Bösch,Improved detection of global NO2 signals from shipping in Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data,"This study presents our advanced methods to qualitatively detect ship-related nitrogen dioxide (NO2) signals in TROPOMI satellite data. By applying filtering techniques, we identify numerous global shipping routes, including previously undetected ones, as well as emissions from offshore platforms. Additionally, we compare the filtered satellite data with high-pass-filtered CAMS global model data to estimate the differences between observed and modeled NO2 emissions. 
 Shipping is an important source of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions worldwide, contributing to air pollution and negatively affecting marine environments, ecosystems, and biodiversity. TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) has significantly enhanced the ability to detect ship emissions from space due to its low measurement noise levels and high spatial resolution of 5.5×3.5 km2 at nadir. This study uses the TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 slant column density (tSCD) to identify global shipping routes qualitatively. Preprocessing techniques, including iterative high-pass and Fourier filtering, markedly improve the detection of shipping lanes, revealing previously undetectable routes. Our analysis examines the impact of high-pass-filter box sizes, demonstrating that smaller sizes enhance the visibility of narrow shipping features, whereas larger box sizes increase overall NO2 signals. Additionally, we investigate various flagging criteria that affect NO2 signal distribution, highlighting the critical importance of careful selection for accurate emission monitoring. Filtered TROPOMI NO2 tSCDs over oceans show a strong correlation with shipping activities, as confirmed by comparison with the CAMS-GLOB-SHIP (Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service for Global Shipping) inventory, and also reveal unknown shipping routes in regions such as the Bering Sea. Furthermore, TROPOMI effectively captures NO2 emissions from offshore oil and gas platforms, with NO2 hotspots in the TROPOMI data aligning well with locations of offshore installations listed in the OSPAR (Oslo and Paris Commission) and BOEM (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management) inventories. Lastly, the filtered TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities (tVCDs) are compared with the high-pass-filtered NO2 tVCDs from the CAMS (Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service) model, which has a coarse spatial resolution of 0.4°. While both datasets effectively identify global shipping lanes, the high-pass-filtered CAMS NO2 tVCDs are significantly higher than the filtered TROPOMI NO2 tVCDs in the North Atlantic and strongly depend on the masking threshold in the high-pass filtering method in the South Atlantic Ocean."

In flights, actual UCASS sample flows rarely match the ascent rates. Errors are minimised by real-time detection of the UCASS flows, e.g. by implementing a thermal flow sensor (TFS) within the UCASS. The TFSs were tested in flight and calibrated at up to 10 m s−1 and at variable angles of attack. 
 For balloon-borne detection of aerosols and cloud droplets (diameter 0.4 < Dp < 40 µm), a passive-flow Universal Cloud and Aerosol Sounding System (UCASS) was used, whose sample flow rate is conventionally derived from balloon ascent rates using GPS or pressure measurements. Improvements are achieved by implementing thermal flow sensors (TFSs) 94 mm downstream of the UCASS detection region for continuously measuring true UCASS sample flow velocities. UCASS-mounted TFSs were calibrated during wind tunnel experiments at up to 10 m s−1, and under various angles of attack (AOAs), as these vary during actual balloon ascents. It was found that the TFS calibration is determined with sufficient precision using three calibration points at tunnel flows of ∼ 2, 5, and 8 m s−1, simplifying efficient TFS upgrades of numerous UCASSs. In iso-axial alignment, UCASS flows are accelerated (by ∼ 11.3 %) compared to tunnel flows (at 2–8 m s−1). In-flight comparisons up to 7.5 km in height revealed that UCASS sample flows rarely match the balloon's ascent rate. Laboratory experiments show that equality (vGPS=vTFS) is achieved only at AOA ≠ 0°, potentially affecting the UCASS internal flow pattern and particle transmission efficiency in flight. To minimise errors in calculated UCASS-based particle number concentrations, real-time measurements of the true UCASS flow velocity are recommended."

However, knowledge about its adverse health effects is limited, particularly regarding its oxidative properties relative to other PM types. In 2023, Canada experienced its worst recorded WF season, with smoke strongly impacting air quality across North America. Here we collected ambient PM samples from two urban (Toronto and Champaign) and one rural (East Trout Lake) sites in North America in 2023 and assessed their oxidative potential (OP; mass-normalized) and burden (OB; volume-normalized) using the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. Our results indicate that OP of urban WF PM was not greater than non-WF PM. At the rural site, WF PM showed slightly higher OP than background PM, which may be related to a lesser extent of atmospheric aging of WF PM, or low OP of background PM in rural areas. During WF-influenced periods in Toronto, mass fractions of OP-active metals were significantly lower, but there was no significant difference in OP, indicating the importance of nonmetallic components to OP. Across all sites, OB was greater during WF periods, driven by elevated PM concentrations. Our findings suggest that while the OP of WF PM is similar to urban PM, higher PM concentrations during WF episodes can increase exposure to potentially harmful DTT-active species."

This study developed a CPM emission inventory for China using field measurements from 148 typical industrial plants/processes. CPM's contribution to total PM emissions from stationary combustion sources had surged from 48.5% to 59.9% during 2014–2020, and will reach approximately 76% by 2030 under current emission control strategies in China. Furthermore, CPM constituted 14.5 ± 8.5% of ambient PM2.5 concentrations during January 2019 in China. Within this CPM contribution, 21.8% was contributed by sulfate/ammonium from coal combustion and ammonia slip in air pollution control devices.

In this study, we use measurements from the Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) to investigate how the microphysical and optical properties of MBL clouds change at the cloud top when precipitation forms. These changes include (a) broadening of particle size distributions when transitioning from cloud droplets to raindrops, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in the cloud extinction‐to‐backscatter ratios; (b) lower droplet number concentrations, resulting in reduced in‐cloud signal attenuation, smaller backscatter coefficients, lower depolarization ratios, and deeper signal penetration into clouds; and (c) increased cloud inhomogeneity, arising from significant spatial variability in droplet size and number concentrations that yield corresponding variations in lidar backscatter signal intensities. The distinct differences observed in CALIOP measurements of precipitating and non‐precipitating clouds allow for effective discrimination between the two states. Independent detections of precipitating clouds from space‐borne lidar are expected to provide new insights into cloud life cycles and enhance the existing A‐Train data record by filling many of the existing gaps in global‐scale light precipitation detection."

Along with the warming climate system, CH4 emissions from these ecosystems are projected to increase, presenting challenges for accurate CH4 budget accounting and climate mitigation efforts. This study assessed CH4 emissions and controlling factors in wetlands across East, South, and Southeast Asia (EA, SA, and SEA) for 2010–2020, using a regional Earth system model coupled online with a microbial functional‐group‐based CH4 model (RegESM‐Microbe). The results from the RegESM‐Microbe model were evaluated against 11 offline wetland models from the Global Carbon Project and revealed consistent hotspots for wetland CH4 emissions, including the Yangtze River floodplain, the Ganges and Brahmaputra River basins, and the Mekong River basin. The annual total wetland CH4 emissions in Asia estimated (34.69 ± 2.55 Tg CH4 yr−1) by the RegESM‐Microbe model was close to the bottom‐up wetland model ensemble (36.66 ± 1.19 Tg CH4 yr−1). The time series of emissions showed a decreasing trend before 2014. Meanwhile, the weakening of anaerobic CH4 oxidation between 2014 and 2020 contributed to increased CH4 flow in the three transport sub‐processes, driving the enhanced CH4 emissions. Most wetlands in the region exhibited an upward trend in CH4 emission, with precipitation and radiation as the primary driver, followed by rising atmospheric CO2. Our study highlighted the critical role of climate change‐induced wetland CH4 emissions in shaping long‐term greenhouse gas mitigation strategies."

 Smoke from extreme wildfires in Canada adversely affected air quality in many regions in 20231,2. Here we use satellite observations, machine learning and a chemical transport model to quantify global and regional PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter) exposure and human health impacts related to the 2023 Canadian wildfires. We find that the fires increased annual PM2.5 exposure worldwide by 0.17 μg m–3 (95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.26 μg m–3). North America had the largest increase in annual mean exposure (1.08 μg m–3; 0.82–1.34 μg m–3), but there were also increases in Europe (0.41 μg m–3; 0.32–0.50 μg m–3) owing to long-range transport. Annual mean PM2.5 exposure in Canada increased by 3.82 μg m–3 (3.00–4.64 μg m–3). In the USA, the contribution of the Canadian fires to increased PM2.5 was 1.49 μg m–3 (1.22–1.77 μg m–3), four times as large as the contribution from the 2023 wildfires originating in the USA. We find that 354 million (277–421 million) people in North America and Europe were exposed to daily PM2.5 air pollution caused by Canadian wildfires in 2023. We estimate that 5,400 (3,400–7,400) acute deaths in North America and 64,300 (37,800–90,900) chronic deaths in North America and Europe were attributable to PM2.5 exposure to the 2023 Canadian wildfires. Our results highlight the far-reaching PM2.5 pollution and health burden that large wildfires can have in a single year.

The upward trends in heat extremes in China in the warm season (May–September) and their relationships with changes in aerosols and greenhouse gases are investigated using observations, reanalysis data and model results. Significant increasing trends in China are observed in daily maximum temperatures (TXx), heatwave frequency, and heatwave mean duration during 2011–2023, with increasing rates of 0.70 °C/decade, 3.77 d/decade and 0.31 d/event/decade, respectively. This study shows that 43 ± 3% of the TXx increases in China are attributed to the rising CO2 concentrations. Aerosol optical depth in China decreased at a rate of 0.054 per decade from 2011 to 2023 due to significant air quality improvements. The weakened aerosol cooling effect due to declining aerosols contributes 27 ± 3% to the observed TXx trend. In eastern China, where aerosol reductions were most significant, aerosol reduction even accounts for 79 ± 10% of the TXx increasing trend. The intensifying heat waves attributed to GHGs and aerosols are in accordance with the increasing extreme high temperatures. The results highlight the significant impacts of rising GHGs and decreasing aerosols on heat extreme events over China in recent years, emphasizing the need of considering both GHGs and aerosols to address the issue of intensification of heat extremes in a warming future."

While forest and shrub fires have decreased, cropland fires are rising, especially in northeastern China. Our findings suggest that climate and local policies affect wildfire emissions and that better fire management is needed to reduce future carbon impacts. 
 Wildfires release large amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, exacerbating climate change and causing severe impacts on air quality and human health. In this study, based on a bottom-up approach and using satellite data, combined with emission factor and aboveground biomass data for different vegetation cover types (forest, shrub, grassland, and cropland), the dynamic changes in CO2 emissions from wildfires in China from 2001 to 2022 were analyzed. The results showed that between 2001 and 2022, the total CO2 emissions from wildfires in China were 937.7 Tg (522.6–1516.0 Tg, 1 Tg = 1012 g), with an annual average of 42.6 Tg (23.8–68.9 Tg). The CO2 emissions from cropland and forest fires were relatively high, accounting for 45 % and 46 % of the total, respectively. The yearly variation in CO2 emissions from forest and shrub fires showed a significant downward trend, while emissions from grassland fires remained relatively stable. In contrast, the CO2 emissions from cropland fires showed an upward trend, primarily in Northeast China. Hot spot analysis and geographically and temporally weighted regression (GTWR) models revealed significant spatial heterogeneity in emissions across vegetation types. Persistent hot spots of shrub and forest fires were located in Southwest and South China, while Northeast China experienced sporadic but extreme fire events. The GTWR model for shrub fire CO2 emissions exhibited the highest predictive performance (R2= 0.87), and climatic factors (particularly temperature and humidity) were the main influencing factors. Notably, the recent rise in cropland fire CO2 emissions in Northeast China is closely linked to region-specific straw-burning policies. The research results provide valuable references for atmospheric transport models, regional fire management, and national carbon accounting frameworks in the context of climate change."

A total of 36 close approaches between December 2022 and February 2023 were identified and analysed. The comparison reveals that the two instruments have good structural agreement and that MATS detects a signal that is ~20 % stronger than what is measured by OSIRIS. 
 The MATS (Mesospheric Airglow/Aerosol Tomography and Spectroscopy) satellite was launched in November 2022 and began collecting scientific measurements of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) in early 2023. The satellite utilises a multichannel limb-viewing instrument designed to gather images across six distinct spectral bands, each selected to capture atmospheric airglow from O2 atmospheric band emissions and light scattered by noctilucent clouds (NLC). This article presents a comparison between the MATS limb measurements and the observations made by the OSIRIS spectrograph on the Odin satellite. Specifically, airglow signals from excited O2, as recorded by MATS infrared (IR) channels and OSIRIS, are analysed over the polar regions under temporally and spatially aligned conditions. From December 2022 to February 2023, 36 close encounters of the two satellites were identified and analysed.

France,An evaluation of airborne mass balance and tracer correlation approaches to estimate site-level CH4 emissions from LNG facilities using CO2 as a tracer of opportunity,"To ensure robust use of measurement-based approaches to estimate methane emissions from individual sites, it is important to validate the accuracy of the methods used in the field. By using co-emitted carbon dioxide, we evaluate the performance of one such quantification method at liquefied natural gas terminals. We further demonstrate the potential for a more efficient quantification approach via tracer correlation by considering the ratio of methane to carbon dioxide concentrations. 
 Accurate and representative quantification of methane (CH4) emissions from individual oil and gas facilities is crucial to improve our knowledge of CH4 sources, improve the reliability of emissions reporting and help facilitate mitigation opportunities. Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminals primarily emit carbon dioxide (CO2) but are also potentially large CH4 sources in the gas supply chain. Here, in work supported by the United Nations Environment Program International Methane Emissions Observatory (UNEP's IMEO), we evaluate two airborne measurement approaches to quantify CH4 emissions from four LNG facilities. The first approach applies a downwind mass balance method to quantify emissions of both CH4 and CO2. Since operator-reported CO2 emissions are relatively well-established, we evaluate the method's performance by comparing to operator-reported CO2 values. Using this approach, we show that an individual facility CO2 mass balance quantification has a mean relative difference to operator reporting of ±20 %, with no significant mean bias across all estimates. The second approach uses measured CH4 : CO2 mole fraction ratios as an alternative method for estimating site-level CH4 emissions. Using this tracer correlation approach, we show that uncertainties in the ratio of CH4 : CO2 from a single day can be below ±10 % at the 95 % confidence level. Due to uncertainty in the CO2 emission rate, the resulting mean 2σ uncertainty on CH4 emissions is ±30 %. CH4 : CO2 ratios are found to vary with height, with larger variation at lower altitudes (<250 m). Representative sampling across both horizontal and vertical space is needed to enhance the accuracy of the tracer correlation approach for individual emission estimates. We find that when repeated over multiple days and different atmospheric conditions, ratio measurements below 250 m provide a median estimate that is within 5 % of the mass balance and multi-height ratio methods. Whilst the CO2 : CH4 emission ratios derived from measurements could be applied to estimate CH4 emissions over longer timeframes, the degree of representativeness will depend on the variability of the ratio over time. Our results indicate that the mass balance and the CO2-based tracer correlation approaches provide estimates of CH4 emissions from LNG facilities that are consistent with each other."

Jimenez;Demetrios Pagonis,Deconvolution of Partitioning Delays from Time-Resolved Trace Gas Measurements,"Time-resolved measurements of low-volatility gas-phase compounds are limited by partitioning of the analyte to instrument surfaces, resulting in what are known as partitioning delays. These delays slow instrument responses and affect the accuracy of subsequent analyses. In this work, we introduce a deconvolution algorithm that corrects measurements affected by partitioning delays. We evaluate the performance of this algorithm using synthetic data and also demonstrate its utility in correcting partitioning delays in airborne nitric acid measurements. We compare the effectiveness of deconvolution to the current best practice for partitioning delays: frequent subtraction of instrument background. Frequent background measurements are outperformed by the deconvolution algorithm when sample concentrations are changing faster than the instrument response time. The deconvolution algorithm can be applied to time series that include frequent measurement of instrument backgrounds, enabling reanalysis of past data. Furthermore, the algorithm does not rely on any coincident data; it is effective without any external information about the true time series of an analyte. When applied to nitric acid measurements from a wildfire smoke plume, deconvolution increases the calculated normalized excess mixing ratio (ΔHNO3/ΔCO) by 72%. We conclude that the deconvolution algorithm is applicable to ground, airborne, and eddy covariance measurements of “sticky” compounds."

However, a global distribution of this sensitivity with observational constraints that may be implemented in climate models remain inadequately explored. Using long‐term satellite observations spanning 2003–2017, we propose an empirical methodology to assess the sensitivity of aeolian dust events to variations in wind velocity. Subsequently, we quantitatively analyze the relationships between this sensitivity and two key influential factors: soil moisture (SM) content and the leaf area index (LAI). Our findings reveal a global mean sensitivity of 0.06 s m−1, indicating that the dust optical depth would change by 0.06 s m−1 under one wind velocity unit variation. Dust events exhibit negligible sensitivity to variations in wind velocity when the SM exceeds 0.17 m3 m−3 or the LAI exceeds 0.45 m2 m−2, which means that dust emission processes are effectively constrained under these conditions. Furthermore, employing these critical thresholds, we compute the fraction of days with constrained dust events. We show that under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) (SSP126, SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585), areas experiencing an increase in constrained days and those experiencing a decrease account for approximately 10.6%–12.5% and 9.3%–10.3% of the global land area, respectively."

However, we found that heat produced by wildfires, a commonly neglected effect, can reduce fine particle concentrations (PM2.5) in the eastern United States (EUS) by an amount comparable to the increases in the WUS during the fire season. This phenomenon arises from fire heat–induced convection in the WUS and subsequent downstream meteorological changes distant from fires. Enhanced wet deposition and weakened eastward transport of fire aerosols lower PM2.5levels in the EUS. Therefore, neglecting the effect of fire heat on PM2.5pollution leads to an overestimate of 1200 additional premature deaths and 3.3 billion USD in economic losses, particularly in the densely populated EUS."

The findings indicate that the residential and commercial zones see notable air quality gains, but the improvement of air quality in the transportation zone is the least considerable. Moreover, the industrial zone has the most seasonal air quality variation. Therefore, air pollution prevention policies should consider differences in functional zones. 
 This study presents a comprehensive spatiotemporal analysis of air quality across various urban functional zones in China from 2017 to 2022, uncovering distinct impacts on air quality due to the unique characteristics of each zone. A general decrease in various pollutant concentrations is observed, a result of stringent pollution control policies. Specifically, the concentration of PM2.5 decreased from 46.1–30.6 µg m−3. Residential, commercial, and industrial zones show significant declines, whereas the transportation zone experiences the least decrease. However, ozone levels rebound significantly in densely populated residential and commercial zones and exhibit distinct weekend effects. The research highlights U-shaped seasonal patterns for five key pollutants and inverse seasonal patterns for ozone, which gradually decrease. Furthermore, the daily and seasonal variations of pollutant concentrations in the industrial zone are the largest, while those in the public management and service zone are the smallest. For example, the seasonal fluctuation of PM2.5 and PM10 in the industrial zone was 50.5 and 66.1 µg m−3, respectively. Urban scale has the most significant impact on public management and service zone. Notably, spatial heterogeneity is evident, with regional pollutant distributions linked to local emissions, control measures, urban morphology, and climate variability. This study emphasizes the critical link between urbanization and air quality, advocating for continuous monitoring and the development of zone-specific air quality strategies to ensure sustainable urban environments."

The satellite data have good accuracy and precision for estimating emissions. A computer model showed that changes in methane levels are influenced more by background levels than by local sources. 
 Satellite observations of column-averaged carbon dioxide (XCO2) and methane (XCH4) mixing ratios provide essential data for monitoring greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, the accuracy of emission estimates depends on the precision and bias of satellite retrievals, which require validation against ground-based reference measurements. This study presents a systematic validation of XCO2 and XCH4 data from GOSAT (Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite) and OCO-2 (Oribiting Carbon Observatory-2) satellites over South India using ground-based Fourier transform spectrometer (FTS) observations at Gadanki (13.5° N, 79.2° E) collected from October 2015 to July 2016. Satellite products from National Institute for Environmental Studies, Japan (NIES), NASA's Atmospheric CO2 Observations from Space (ACOS) project, USA (ACOS), and the University of Leicester, UK (UoL) were evaluated using a three-step spatial-temporal pairing method. Results show that the UoL's proxy XCH4 product meets the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) bias requirement (<10 ppb) across all spatial windows, while the NIES XCH4 product meets the requirement only for intermediate spatial scales. For XCO2, NASA ACOS and OCO-2 products meet the CCI bias requirement (<0.5 ppm), while NIES XCO2 exceeds this threshold. All products satisfy the precision requirement (<8 ppm for XCO2 and <34 ppb for XCH4) with substantial margins. In addition, FLEXPART model simulations using regional emission inventories revealed that agricultural activities dominate seasonal methane enhancements, contributing approximately 55 %, followed by waste and wetland emissions. The model captured seasonal trends but underestimated the amplitude of observed variations, highlighting the influence of changing background methane levels. These findings demonstrate the suitability of recent satellite products for regional GHG monitoring and emphasise the need for expanding ground-based FTS networks across South Asia to support improved emission assessments."

 Differential Absorption Radar (DAR) is an emerging technique for high-resolution humidity profiling inside clouds and precipitation. This study evaluates the potential of using a spaceborne DAR operating near the 380 GHz water vapor absorption line to profile water vapor in the mid and upper troposphere, particularly inside deep convective systems. To quantify the expected precision and accuracy of DAR and to define optimal channel selection, we modeled radar reflectivities from large-eddy simulation fields  and then implemented retrievals using the simulated observations.End-to-end retrieval simulations across the 350–380 GHz range were used to identify optimal radar frequency triplets, minimizing precision and biases, at each altitude. While dual-frequency DAR systems can be susceptible to biases caused by range-dependent hydrometeor scattering, incorporating a third frequency allows for partial separation of water vapor extinction from the scattering and absorption effects of hydrometeors. Each optimum triplet included the most transparent frequency available, with the other two radar tones varying with altitude. At higher altitudes, the optimization identifies frequencies close to the line center, and the optimum frequencies move progressively away from the line  at lower altitudes.  Results show that single-pixel (horizontal resolution ≃ 400 m and vertical resolution =200 m) precision generally exceeds 100 %, with biases typically below 10 %.  Precision can be enhanced by averaging along the track. For instance, by optimizing the triplet selection, a precision of 0.01 gm−3 can be achieved by averaging over 50 km in anvil outflows with extensive cloud coverage. We note that the improvement may be less than expected in scenarios where cloud coverage is limited since the DAR technique only works in cloudy volumes.Lastly, we use real-world clouds observed by CloudSat to quantify global yield. Most radar tones examined here achieve a global sampling yield of over 95 % at their target altitude. When developing a DAR instrument, selecting the appropriate triplet is essential, taking into account the target altitude and cloud types intended for observation."

The LHR employs balanced detection to measure tropospheric CO2 column concentrations. Simulations are validated against previously validated instruments. This work enhances greenhouse gas monitoring and supports campaigns for emissions studies and satellite validation. 
 In this study, heterodyne detection enables high spectral resolution, which in turn enhances the vertical sensitivity of ground-based CO2 measurements. The system's compact and portable design makes it particularly well-suited for deployment in field campaigns. An all-fiber coupled laser heterodyne radiometer (LHR), using a wideband tunable external cavity diode laser (1520–1580 nm) as local oscillator laser was developed for CO2 measurements. Optimal absorption lines and transmission spectra of the LHR was achieved by using a balanced photodetector to suppress the relative intensity noise of the local oscillator laser. This work aims to quantify how the LHR contributes to measuring tropospheric CO2 abundances in the atmospheric column from the ground. Here, we demonstrate the LHR's ability to measure CO2 vertical profiles through an extensive analysis of information content, channel selection, and error budget estimation. This comprehensive analysis relies on the radiative transfer model ARAHMIS, developed at the Laboratoire d'Optique Atmosphérique (LOA). Additionally, we present a comparison of the LHR with other ground-based instruments, such as the EM27/SUN and the IFS125HR from the TCCON network.

Bowler;Edmund K. Stone,Retrieving tropospheric refractivity structure using interferometry of aircraft radio transmissions,"Humidity observations are crucial for an accurate weather forecast. We propose a new way to measure humidity by measuring how radio signals from commercial aircraft are refracted by the atmosphere. Humidity affects the refractive index of air, allowing its presence to be detected. With thousands of flights in the airspace over the United Kingdom every day, there is the potential for a large increase in the number of humidity measurements for use in weather forecasting models. 
 Detailed measurements of atmospheric humidity in the lower atmosphere are currently difficult and expensive to obtain. For this reason, there is interest in the development of low-cost, high-volume opportunistic technologies to acquire measurements of tropospheric humidity. We demonstrate the use of interferometry to measure the atmospheric refraction of the Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) radio transmission routinely broadcast by commercial aircraft. Atmospheric refraction is strongly influenced by changes in humidity, and refractivity observations have proved to be an effective source of humidity information for numerical weather prediction models. A prototype ADS-B interferometer has been developed that can simultaneously perform angle-of-arrival (AoA) interferometry and decode ADS-B signals. Combining the measured AoA of the ADS-B signal with the known position of the aircraft (information contained within the ADS-B signal) allows the bending of the signal due to refraction to be determined. Combining the measured bending of numerous ADS-B signals allows for information concerning the refractivity structure to be extracted. An adjoint model is derived and used to retrieve synthetic one-dimensional refractivity profiles in a variety of atmospheric conditions. The results from an experiment using a prototype ADS-B interferometer are shown, and initial refractivity profiles are retrieved. Sources of uncertainty in the observations and the retrieved refractivity profiles are explored, and future work is suggested."

Evaluations show good agreement with observations, and source attribution of black carbon is also provided to quantify pollution pathways to Asia’s glaciers, major freshwater source for over a billion people. 
 We present MATCHA (Model for Atmospheric Transport and Chemistry in Asia), a 17-year (2003–2019) regional hydroclimate-chemical reanalysis for Asia (58° – 140° E, 4° – 40° N) at 12 km resolution that is based on the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), Community Land Model (CLM), and SNow, ICe and Aerosol Radiative (SNICAR) model as well as satellite data assimilation to explicitly represent interactions between key atmospheric composition and regional hydroclimate (including aerosol-snowpack interactions) across High Mountain Asia (HMA). Approximately two decades of satellite observations of aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and carbon monoxide (CO) profiles from the Measurement of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) were assimilated every three hours into WRF-Chem to further constrain the representation of aerosols and chemistry. MATCHA provides comprehensive outputs across different light-absorbing aerosol species, e.g., black carbon (BC), dust, and brown carbon (BrC), trace gases, and a range of meteorological, hydrological, and land-surface variables over the region. This paper describes the MATCHA coupled modeling and data assimilation framework and evaluates 12 key variables across aerosols (fine particulate matter (PM2.5/PM10), AOD, single scattering albedo (SSA), and surface BC concentration), trace gases (surface CO), meteorology (precipitation, planetary boundary layer height (PBLH), temperature, relative humidity, and wind speed), and hydrology (snow cover fraction) against available in-situ and satellite observations across Asia. Meteorological fields (surface and vertical profiles) are consistently well-reproduced with Kling-Gupta efficiencies (KGEs) ranging from 0.65 to 1. Notable issues include persistent cold and dry bias over high-elevation regions in winter, with stronger-than-observed surface winds. Snow cover fraction seasonality is well captured with slight underestimation during snowmelt seasons across major glacier regions. Daily accumulated precipitation estimates agree with satellite observations, particularly with the best KGE (0.6) during the monsoon season, albeit underestimated over high-elevation regions. The diurnal and seasonal evolution of PBLH is well-represented, with biases reflecting shallower heights in the morning and deeper heights in the afternoon in summer, likely due to model parameterizations and resolution limitations. MATCHA also captures the spatial and seasonal variability of AOD and SSA at 550 nm, yet overestimates summer AOD over India and southeast Asia with a strong negative bias in SSA. Biases in PM2.5/PM10 are also higher, which appears to be particularly related to high biases in wind speeds, causing overestimation of natural emissions of aerosols and overestimation of anthropogenic emissions. Comparisons with site-specific aerosol chemical composition derived from air samples at Kanpur confirm the positive bias in sea salt concentrations and lower carbonaceous aerosols during high pollution events. MATCHA captures the seasonal cycle of surface CO, but underestimates the observations, which can be attributed to the assimilation of CO profiles from MOPITT. A unique feature of MATCHA is its tagged-tracers of BC for sectoral and regional source attribution analysis. These tracers show anthropogenic BC peaking in winter, primarily from Chinese sources in the eastern and northern part of HMA, and Indian sources in western and central HMA. Biomass burning BC dominates during March–April along with substantial trans-boundary inflow throughout the year. BC emissions from Pakistan and Nepal also contribute significantly to the anthropogenic column burden of BC in parts of HMA. MATCHA is the first-of-its-kind high-resolution reanalysis to fully couple aerosols, radiation, and snow processes over HMA, offering a valuable dataset for investigating aerosol–cryosphere feedbacks and informing emission mitigation strategies in Asia. The dataset consists of hourly surface and column-integrated products and 3-hourly three-dimensional fields, and is publicly available at DOI: 10.5067/CG4OT8DJX2Z7."

We show that the uncatalyzed sulfite oxidation is size-dependent across varying O2 concentrations and temperatures. Reaction rates scale with the surface-area to volume ratio (1/radius) of the microdroplet.

Lane,Quantifying Aviation-Related Contributions to Ambient Ultrafine Particle Number Concentrations Using Interpretable Machine Learning,"Ultrafine particles (UFP, Dp < 100 nm) are abundantly emitted by aircraft, but quantifying their contributions to ambient particle number concentrations (PNC) is challenging due to confounding from local traffic and complex interactions between aircraft plumes and meteorology. We applied a machine learning (ML) model to a multi-year PNC data set collected near Boston Logan International Airport, incorporating meteorology, road traffic, and runway-specific aircraft activity. We used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), a game-theoretic method that attributes feature contributions to model predictions, to interpret the black box ensemble ML model. SHAP enabled hourly source attribution, revealing feature interactions and nonlinear effects often missed by traditional tools (e.g., linear regression). The model performed well (R2 = 0.66), exceeding typical hourly PNC models. SHAP results revealed that aircraft arrivals, particularly those on runways oriented perpendicular to the monitor–airport axis, were more influential than departures or on-ground airport activity. This suggests that aircraft not flying directly overhead can substantially impact ground-level air quality due to crosswinds. SHAP analysis further indicated that aircraft impacts depended on planetary boundary layer height, with intermediate heights associated with elevated PNC. This approach provides a novel and transferable framework for retrospective source-specific exposure assessment and improved characterization of aviation-related UFP in near-airport communities."
10.1021/acs.estlett.5c00791,True,Environmental Science & Technology Letters,该研究论文探讨了沙尘回流过程中，沙尘颗粒物中氧化潜势（OP）和环境持久性自由基（EPFRs）的浓度变化及其健康风险。研究发现，沙尘回流显著增加了PM的OP和EPFRs浓度，并与非意外住院率相关。论文指出，在沙尘回流期间，细颗粒物（PM2.5）成为OP和EPFRs的主要载体，其浓度激增归因于沙尘与人为污染物（如硫酸盐和硝酸盐）的混合。气象因素也促进了氧化反应，导致氧化活性物质的积累。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究内容与大气成分分析、空气质量监测密切相关，这些都是大气环境遥感技术的重要应用领域。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition (PM10, PM2.5, sulfates, nitrates)', 'dust pollution', 'oxidative potential', 'environmentally persistent free radicals', 'meteorological factors']",Linjun Qin;Guorui Liu;WuYuxin Zhu;Ling Liu;Xue Xia;Minghui Zheng;Lili Yang,Elevated Risks of Environmentally Persistent Free Radicals and Oxidative Potential during Dust Backflows,"Dust backflow, a secondary pollution process following dust storms, has unclear mechanisms for affecting key redox-active components, oxidative potential (OP), and environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) in dust particulate matter (PM). This study found that dust backflow increased PM’s OP and EPFRs concentrations to 9.7- and 4.2-fold of original dust levels. Dust backflow PM was strongly associated with nonaccidental hospitalizations (0.85%, 95% CIs: 0.50%, 1.21%) with each 10 μg/m3 increase in PM10. During the original dust stage, OP and EPFRs, primarily dominated by PM10, mainly originate from the physical migration of natural mineral components (e.g., metal oxides) in the dust, with their oxidative activity linked to coarse PM’s transport. However, during dust backflow, PM2.5 becomes the main carrier of OP and EPFRs, and their concentration surge is attributed to the mixing of dust with anthropogenic pollutants (such as sulfates and nitrates) during long-distance transport. Meteorological factors such as rising temperatures and weak winds enhance oxidation reactions, leading to redox-active substance accumulation. This study is the first to reveal the characteristics and health risks of dust backflow PM through natural-anthropogenic synergy, providing a scientific basis for health risk warnings about dust pollution and the coordinated control of fine PM during dust backflow."

We performed combustion experiments using fuel beds representative of three ecoregions in the Southeastern U.S. and varied the fuel-bed moisture content to simulate either prescribed fires (Rx) or drought-induced wildfires (Wild). We used fire radiative energy normalized by fuel-bed mass (FREnorm) as a proxy for combustion conditions. For fuel beds that contained surface fuels only, the higher moisture content in Rx led to lower FREnorm compared to Wild and consequently led to lower EC emissions, but higher OC emissions and SOC formation. For fuel beds that contained duff in addition to surface fuels, duff did not ignite in Rx because of the high moisture content. However, duff ignited in Wild, leading to prolonged smoldering and substantially lower FREnorm in Wild compared to Rx. Consequently, OC emissions and SOC formation were an order of magnitude higher in Wild compared to Rx for the duff-containing fuel beds. These findings indicate that characterizing fuel availability and variability in combustion conditions, which emerges from variability in fuel-bed composition and environmental conditions, is crucial for determining carbonaceous aerosol formation in wildland fires."

A source apportionment study was performed to investigate the impacts of high temperatures on atmospheric ozone and oxidative capacity formation from changing VOC emissions utilizing hourly VOC data from June to October 2023 in Qingdao, China. The results suggested that the biogenic emission contributions to the consumed VOCs increased with increasing temperature, especially for temperatures above 30 °C. Their contributions to the consumed VOCs increased substantially. The contribution concentration and proportion of the consumed VOCs increased by 73% and 77%, respectively, for every 5 °C increase in temperatures. The consumed biogenic VOCs’ ozone formation potential value and proportion increased by 82% and 83%, respectively. A mixed gasoline vehicle emission and gasoline evaporation sources showed a small increase. Most other source contributions to the consumed VOCs did not change substantially with the temperature. However, the contributions of solvent usage to the consumed VOCs decreased with rising temperatures. Its contributions decreased substantially when temperature was above 25 °C, likely due to the substantial reduction in human activities such as motor-vehicle spray painting at high ambient temperatures."

Fu;Li Li,"Amplification of Surface Ozone by the Aerosol Direct Effect under COVID-19 Lockdown in Shanghai, China","Elevated surface ozone (O3) concentrations present substantial risks to public health, ecosystem productivity, and global climate change. Shanghai implemented a citywide lockdown to control the spread of COVID-19 during April to May of 2022, leading to substantial reduction in air pollutant emissions. The surface O3 concentrations, however, increased by 3–10 ppb compared to 2021 in most areas of the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region. This phenomenon presented a unique real-world experiment on air pollution management. Here, we integrate observational data and two-way online meteorology–air quality modeling to investigate the causes of this unexpected O3 increase, with a focus on elaborating the interaction between the aerosol direct effect (ADE) and O3 formation. Results showed that aerosol loading suppressed early morning vertical mixing, enhancing photochemical reactivity below the boundary layer and delaying upward O3 transport. This ADE contributed an average 10.8 ppb increase in O3 concentrations during pollution episodes (O3 concentration >100 ppb), with emission-reduction-induced ADE raising O3 by 6.2 ppb in Shanghai and 3.5 ppb in Jiangsu. In addition, vertical transport contributed to −4 ± 1 ppb changes in O3, although the surface meteorological conditions in Shanghai were favorable for O3 photochemical formation. In contrast, meteorology dominated the O3 increase (5 ± 3 ppb) in northwestern YRD. The lockdown caused a 10% higher reduction in nitrogen oxides than volatile organic compounds, leading to O3 increases of 9 ± 1 ppb in Shanghai and 5 ± 2 ppb in southern Jiangsu. These findings highlight the risk of O3 increases resulting from imbalanced changes in the precursors, aerosols, and meteorology. We suggest taking into consideration the effect of aggregation of O3 by ADE when designing air quality management strategies."

Real-time measurements of NPs are still limited, preventing an in-depth understanding of the dynamics of their emission and formation. In this study, we used a Vocus proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) to quantify gaseous NPs and related aromatic compounds. Calibrations using a permeation-tube method showed that NPs, phenols, and nitroaromatics had protonated ions as the dominating ion, except for 3-methyl-2-nitrophenol. The combined effect of the methyl, nitro, and phenolic functional groups in this compound may lead to its steady fragmentation (dehydration) in the PTR-ToF-MS. The 5-s limits of detection (LODs) of these nitrated and/or oxygenated aromatic species ranged from 0.0001 to 0.0015 ppbv, demonstrating the capability of PTR-ToF-MS in the quantification of these compounds. In a campaign conducted in a coastal urban area in South China (Macau), NPs had average concentrations of 0.005 to 0.016 ppbv, lower than most reported concentrations in other urban areas. In addition to possible primary sources such as burning of coal or biomass in some periods, secondary formation of NPs was revealed to be limited by the availability of NO2 and could outweigh photolysis loss. This study provides new insights into the quantification and sources of NPs and their precursors in urban areas for a better understanding of their effects on the ecosystem, climate, and health."

 Although clouds and their properties are critical to radiation budget and weather change, the cloud products derived from passive radiometers remain significant uncertainties due to the complex variations of clouds and the limited spectral characterization of existing algorithms. In this study, a general algorithm is proposed to retrieve cloud top height (CTH), cloud top temperature (CTT) and cloud top pressure (CTP) simultaneously by establishing a look-up table (LUT) between lidar measurements and the cloud-sensitive spectral characteristics. Validated by an independent year, the algorithm has achieved accurate retrievals under both daytime and nighttime conditions, with an averaged Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.70 km, 9.0 K and 118 hPa for CTH, CTT and CTP, respectively. The above RMSEs are much lower than those reported for other algorithms proposed in recent years, and have decreased by about 40 % compared to the corresponding Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products, which indicates the better performance of the proposed algorithm. The algorithm’s superior performance and independence from auxiliary data make it a promising approach for characterizing the spatio-temporal patterns of global cloud layers."

 COVID-19 was a global public health crisis but, for atmospheric scientists, also an unprecedented opportunity. The lockdown measures unexpectedly created a near-perfect “controlled variable” experiment, enabling the development of a TROPOMI-based correction framework for near-surface concentrations of nitrogen dioxide (NSC-NO2) and the construction of a ten-day-scale dataset of NSC-NO2 across China, thereby facilitating precise quantification of human impacts on air pollution. The main findings are as follows: (1) the number of stations with a correlation coefficient greater than 0.6 between ground-based measured NO2 (GBM-NO2) and corrected column concentration of NO2 (CC-NO2) increased from 54 to 1200, indicating substantial quality improvement; (2) cross-validation results yielded an R2 of 0.91 and an RMSE of 4.05 μg/m3 for the estimated NSC-NO2, demonstrating strong spatiotemporal consistency with GBM-NO2; and (3) using the estimated NSC-NO2, China's NO2 concentrations showed a marked decrease attributable to both the “holiday effect” and the COVID-19 lockdown.

Here, we review evidence supporting this paradigm and quantify the differences in global and Northern Hemisphere estimates of the net land sink derived from atmospheric inversion and satellite-derived vegetation biomass time series. Our analysis, combined with additional synthesis, supports a hypothesis that the net land sink is substantially weaker than commonly reported. At a global scale, our estimate of the net land carbon sink is 0.8 ± 0.7 petagrams of carbon per year from 2000 through 2019, nearly a factor of two lower than the Global Carbon Project estimate.

Significant differences in the optical properties of samples from 2016 to 2023 were identified based on the mass and mass ratios of the chemical components. For the BC–FS relationship in the data set used in this study, increased FS mass lowered FMF and dSSABC–FS (SSA440–SSA870) by approximately 0.033 and 0.005 per 1 μg/m3, respectively. Higher ratios of nonabsorbing components (AS and AN) to BC (w = (AS + AN)/(AS + AN + BC)) increased SSA at all wavelengths. The correlation between w and SSA was stronger at longer wavelengths, with SSA440 and SSA1020 increasing by approximately 0.026 and 0.046 per 10% increase in w from the data set, respectivley. Site-specific results showed that dSSAw and rSSA (SSA440/SSA1020) increased as the BC proportion rose (w decreased).

The resulting free tropospheric aerosols may affect inference of ground-level fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from satellite aerosol optical depth (AOD), yet the effects of accounting for plume height in this inference are poorly understood. Here, we include in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model a fire plume height parametrization (GFAS, Global Fire Assimilation System) to examine its effect on PM2.5 inferred from satellite AOD during wildfires over the United States and Canada. Comparison with six years satellite observations of plume height reveals a low bias of a factor 1.7 in the GFAS plume height over evergreen needleleaf forests. We scale the GFAS plume height over evergreen needleleaf forests in GEOS-Chem to better represent the satellite observations, focusing on 2018 and 2020 when large wildfires yield prominent signals. Replacing the default ground-level wildfire emissions in GEOS-Chem with the scaled GFAS vertically distributed emissions reduces the bias between measured PM2.5 and PM2.5 inferred from satellite AOD, and significantly improves the consistency of simulated AOD with sun photometer measurements. Overall, this study signifies the importance of vertically distributing wildfire emissions for the inference of PM2.5 from satellite AOD."

The ratio of the production of HOx ${\text{HO}}_{x}$ to NOx ${\text{NO}}_{x}$ obtained in this study for saturated air ranges between 5×10−5 $5\times 1{0}^{-5}$ and 2.3×10−1 $2.3\times 1{0}^{-1}$ strongly influenced by air humidity, which is in better agreement with laboratory measurements than previous modeling results. We calculate the synthetic optical emissions of an exposed lightning section. We compare the simulated peaks in the 777.4 nm and the 337.0 nm photon fluxes with observations of shallow and exposed lightning by the Atmosphere–Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM). Our simulations of hot lightning plasmas result in negligible thermal (due to ions) 337.0 nm optical emissions below 30 kA peak current. This indicates that 337.0 nm optical emissions detected by ASIM are mainly produced by lightning streamers instead of by thermally produced ionic lines in lightning. Finally, we found that the hot lightning channel produces a significant amount of Vacuum Ultraviolet photons that can travel outside the channel to produce non‐negligible amounts of OH by photodissociation of water."

By compositing temperature, water vapor, and tropical upwelling during different phases of QBO and QBO disruptions (XQBO), we show that XQBO events lead to cold anomalies (relative to WQBO winters) of as much as −4.6 K during April 2016 at 60 hPa and −3.9 K during December 2019 at 50 hPa. These cold anomalies initiate around 50 hPa and propagate downward, cooling the cold point tropopause (CPT). We investigate regional CPT temperature anomalies in relation to different modes of natural variability such as the QBO, the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO), and the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) using multiple linear regression. The warm‐then‐cold evolution of the CPT during November 2015–October 2016 and November 2019–October 2020 can be explained in part by the modulation of convection and Walker circulation by ENSO and the IOD and by the impact of QBO on the stratospheric upwelling as all play major roles in regulating regional CPT. CPT temperatures during the boreal summer following the two disruptions are both colder than almost all summers following WQBO winters; CPT temperatures during summer 2016 are the coldest since 1979, suggesting that any increased frequency of QBO disruptions is likely to impact atmospheric stability near the tropopause."

In this study, the composition of non‐refractory fine particles (NR‐PM2.5) in an urban area in winter Chongqing was characterized by time‐of‐flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ToF‐ACSM). Organic aerosol (OA), accounting for 48.8% ± 14.6% of NR‐PM2.5, was the most abundant species. Positive matrix factorization model resolved more‐oxidized oxygenated OA (MO‐OOA) as the predominant component of OA (55.8% ± 11.1%), followed by less‐oxidized oxygenated OA (LO‐OOA) (19.0% ± 6.7%). LO‐OOA exhibited dual sensitivity to both aqueous‐phase processing (enhanced at higher Ox levels) and photochemical oxidation, whereas MO‐OOA was predominantly photochemically derived. Moreover, photochemical oxidation preferentially promoted MO‐OOA formation over LO‐OOA. OA exerted a key role in forming the first haze event, which was significantly related to the enhanced production of secondary OA (SOA). Compared to the second event, the first haze exhibited significantly stronger biomass‐burning emissions, likely promoting LO‐OOA formation and its subsequent oxidation to MO‐OOA. Moreover, biomass‐burning may substantially contribute to highly oxidized OA after haze. Generally, the results of this study provide new insights into SOA formation and emphasized the need of controlling biomass burning."

 Anthropogenic methane (CH4) sources have had a considerable impact on the Earth’s changing radiation budget since pre-industrial times. Localized sources such as those resulting from the fossil fuel industry and waste treatment have been shown to make up a substantial fraction of the emission total, and CH4 plumes from such sources are detectable through airborne and space-based hyperspectral imaging techniques. Here, we further develop a machine learning technique to estimate CH4 emission rates from such plume images without the need for auxiliary data such as local wind speed information. We directly build upon the idea of previous research which used a convolutional neural network (CNN) called MethaNet and a library of large-eddy-simulations (LES) of turbulent CH4 plumes as our synthetic data environment. Here we suggest appropriate error metrics and changes to the training procedure that reduce systematic biases present in previous studies. Our improved setup has a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 10% for sources with flux rates above 40 kg h−1, a Pearson correlation coefficient of 98% and is capable of providing meaningful error estimates for its predictions. This is a significant improvement to MethaNet and other studies and can be used as an efficient method for point source quantification in the future."

 Aerosols from human activities significantly affect the radiative balance and energy equilibrium of the atmosphere, thereby influencing air pollutant concentrations and meteorological factors. This study examines the Chinese mainland and its surrounding regions in 2014, revealing that aerosols influence meteorological factors and therefore the pollutant concentrations, especially in areas experiencing severe particulate pollution. The aerosol feedback not only increases the annual average concentration of pollutants such as PM2.5 (0.30 μg m−3) and CO (4.04 ppbV), but also reduces the annual average values of meteorological variables such as surface temperature (0.18 K) and wind speed (0.01 m s−1). The magnitude of aerosol feedback on pollutants and meteorological factors depends primarily on the mass concentration of aerosols. During the 2014 Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Summit in Beijing emission reduction period, the impact of aerosol feedback on pollutants and meteorology was clearly weakened in the key emission reduction areas, reflecting the influence of aerosol feedback. Importantly, the feedback effects of aerosols in heavily polluted areas is up to an order of magnitude greater than in the broader study region, although with large spatial variability. In the heavily polluted areas like Beijing, PM2.5 concentrations correlate well with the difference of temperature and wind speed between Beijing and its surrounding areas. It is also shown that, in case of heavy pollution, WRF-Chem model predictive capabilities often diminish, presenting underestimation and shortcomings in assessing the impact of aerosols on heavy pollution and regional disparities. This implies that some feedback processes involving anthropogenic aerosols may not be fully represented in the model. In the face of increasingly severe climate change, better understanding of the bidirectional interactions between aerosols and meteorology, along with associated feedback mechanisms, is essential for effectively mitigating air pollution, adapting to climate change, and managing climate impacts. This study highlights the critical role of aerosol feedback in regional pollution and modulating meteorological factors, providing a scientific basis for targeted air quality management and climate mitigation strategies in heavily polluted areas."

 Biomass burning is an important source of tropospheric ozone (O3). This study explored the impacts of Indochina springtime (March–April) biomass burnings on the variability and trend of tropospheric O3 in coastal South China using long-term (2000–2024) ozonesondes in Hong Kong and satellite fire retrievals in the Indochina Peninsula (ICP), complemented with EAC4 reanalysis data. We find that the lower-free-tropospheric O3 (LFTO3) concentrations in Hong Kong are significantly correlated with the Indochina biomass burnings, particularly with the two-day-ago biomass burnings in northern Laos (r = 0.57, p < 0.01). While Indochina biomass burning contributes more than 30 ppbv enhancements in LFTO3 concentrations over coastal South China, their impacts on surface O3 concentrations are insignificant. During the study period, there is a significant increasing trend in springtime LFTO3 concentrations in Hong Kong (0.37 ppbv/year), despite decreasing quantity and intension of Indochina biomass burnings. This long-term LFTO3 increasing trend is mainly driven by the eastward migration of Indochina biomass burnings (mainly due to the increase in biomass burnings in the central ICP region), which reduces transport distance to Hong Kong by ∼300 km and thereby improves the transport efficiency, ultimately contributing ∼90 % of the long-term LFTO3 increase in Hong Kong. These findings advance understanding of Indochina biomass burning transport impacts on multi-scale tropospheric O3 variability in coastal South China."

However, it is also deposited on the ocean surface by dry deposition thereby reacting with the enriched organic material within sea‐surface microlayer (SML) such as unsaturated fatty acids and humic substances. Here, we performed dedicated experiments on SO2 oxidation chemistry at authentic SML sampled from 10 sites in coastal area and open sea of the South China Sea, in dark and under simulated sunlight irradiation. Real‐time measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) formed by SO2 oxidation chemistry were performed by using ultra‐high resolution mass spectrometry. Intriguingly, a total of 104 product compounds were identified in dark whereas 843 compounds were produced upon sunlight irradiation, during the SO2 oxidation of the SML samples. We evaluated the potential influence of the SO2 oxidation on SML under light irradiation as a new marine VOCs source by a chemical transport model. The simulations suggest a significant change of oxygenated VOCs in marine atmosphere over Eastern Asia that potentially alters the budgets of HOx and ROx radicals and consequently the lifetime of methane."

Pierce,Going Off Grid: A Comparative Study of the Lagrangian and Eulerian Perspectives of New Particle Formation Events,"New particle formation and growth (NPF&G) is the process by which ultrafine particles are formed from gas‐phase precursors. NPF&G is the dominant source of global aerosol number with important influences on climate. Most observations of NPF&G events are conducted at stationary sites; however, NPF&G observed from stationary sites is influenced by gradual or rapid changes in the air masses passing over the site, complicating NPF&G analysis. In this work, we use observations and a 3D aerosol model to compare aerosol size distributions at a stationary site (Southern Great Plains [SGP] observatory, Oklahoma, USA) and along Lagrangian trajectories crossing the site. The model simulates the NPF&G events reasonably well at SGP. Using the model to compare the Lagrangian and stationary perspectives, we can explain previously unanalyzable days with some evidence of NPF&G as either non‐event or analyzable NPF&G days. We find most of the unanalyzable NPF&G days are due to isolated and inhomogeneous NPF&G occurring upwind of the stationary site, often in the outflow of urban regions. Finally, we compare formation rates of 3 nm particles, growth rates, and the survival probability of 3 nm particles growing to 25 nm between the stationary and Lagrangian perspectives. Because of the much larger number of analyzable days along the Lagrangian trajectories, this perspective potentially provides more robust statistics and better characterization of NPF&G event extremes. Our method for extracting chemical/physical properties along Lagrangian trajectories from 3D models can be applied to a wide range of science questions."

 Great efforts have been made to observe atmospheric volatile organic compound (VOC) concentrations. However, observation-based VOC datasets at surface level with broad temporal and spatial coverage are still lacking. This gap poses a barrier to understanding the vertical relationship between surface and column VOC concentrations, a critical scientific question limiting the application of satellite observations to infer surface VOCs. To bridge this gap, we developed a multistep deep learning (DL) framework. This framework integrates Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) satellite observations, GEOS-Chem model simulations, and meteorological and geographical data to generate a seamless, daily-resolution dataset of formaldehyde (HCHO) vertical column densities (VCDs) and surface concentrations over eastern China for the period 2019–2022. HCHO was chosen as a high-yield intermediate product of VOC oxidation and a good proxy for VOC sources. The dataset quality was assessed through comparisons with independent TROPOMI observations and ground-based in situ measurements. Our analysis revealed good consistency in the variability between surface and column HCHO concentrations at the annual scale, with correlation coefficients of 0.90 (spatial variability), 0.91 (temporal variability) and 0.81 (interannual trend). Nevertheless, this vertical relationship significantly weakened during summer, a period of peak VOC and ozone activity, due to the reduced sensitivity of HCHO VCDs to meteorological factors. Our analysis further provides useful insights into the seasonality and interannual trends in HCHO concentrations in the studied period. The observation-constrained dataset and its analysis is helpful for improving our understanding of HCHO variability in China and is useful for better applications of space-based HCHO observations."

Errors in modeled fossil fuel CO2 are evaluated using Δ14CO2 airborne data as an avenue to improving future regional models of atmospheric CO2 transport. 
 Accurately quantifying regional anthropogenic CO2 fluxes is fundamental to improving our understanding of the carbon cycle and for creating effective carbon mitigation policies, and the radiocarbon to total carbon ratio in atmospheric CO2 (Δ14CO2) is a robust tracer of fossil fuel CO2 that can discriminate between biogenic and fossil fuel CO2 sources. NASA's Atmospheric Carbon and Transport-America (ACT-America) airborne mission between 2016 and 2019 aimed to improve the accuracy of regional greenhouse gas flux estimates, through refining our understanding and characterization of fluxes and flux uncertainties in models. Δ14CO2 observations from 26 flights are presented for examining seasonal CO2 source partitioning in the Mid-Atlantic USA. Observed variability in boundary layer CO2 at timescales ranging from intra-day to seasonal was largely driven by biogenic CO2 (CO2bio) variability that ranged from −19.7 ppm in summer to 16.2 ppm in fall, while fossil fuel CO2 (CO2ff) variability remained at 3.3±2.0 ppm. Carbonyl sulfide uptake was well-correlated with CO2bio uptake, and examining this relationship, as well as that between CO2 and CO2bio variability reinforces the seasonal extent of gross primary productivity response throughout ACT-America. We use airborne Δ14CO2 flask sampling alongside in situ carbon monoxide measurements to calculate high-frequency CO2ff and evaluate the magnitude and diurnal variability of modeled CO2ff, deducing likely transport errors in an example flight. Although ACT-America CO2ff signals were attenuated due to the broad source regions sampled, results illustrate the value of Δ14CO2 sampling and observation-based methodologies for regional CO2 flux attribution, evaluation and improvement of modeled CO2."

Our study provides insights into critical particle-specific information and will contribute to better constraining climate models that consider mineralogical variations in their representation of the dust cycle. 
 Iceland is a significant high-latitude dust source area. Airborne Icelandic dust influences the climate system by interacting with radiation, clouds, and biogeochemical cycles; it also affects snow and ice albedo and air quality. These impacts are sensitive to the dust’s mineralogical, chemical, and physical properties. However, comprehensive measurements and analyses of Icelandic dust particles remain limited. This study examines dust samples collected during a field campaign in the Dyngjusandur desert (August–September 2021) using active and passive aerosol sampling. Over 190 000 individual particles, ranging from 0.1 to 120 µm, were analyzed for their chemical and physical properties using computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy/energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (ccSEM/EDX). Results show heterogeneity in particle size, shape, and composition. The most abundant particle type was medium-Al mixed particles, likely glass-like, comprising 35 %–92 % of the aerosol volume. Sulfate particles, suggesting volcanic contributions, were detected in some samples. Iron (Fe)- and titanium (Ti)-rich particles made up 3.3 % and 6 % of the aerosol volume, respectively, mainly in the size fraction < 1 µm. The median aspect ratio ranged from 1.37 to 1.53, increasing with particle size. Our findings highlight key differences in Icelandic dust compared to Saharan dust, including higher iron and titanium content and a lack of potassium in Icelandic dust. Additionally, Icelandic dust shows a size-dependent increase in aspect ratio, unlike Saharan dust, which remains constant. These observations can improve model simulations that account for the effect of high-latitude dust in the Earth system."

It finds that smoke aerosols, predominantly concentrated between 6 and 8 km in the mid-troposphere over southern HTP, likely alter regional atmospheric stability by modifying the vertical temperature profile, as indicated by a reduced lapse rate. 
 Atmospheric pollution from biomass burning contributes to climatic and cryospheric changes by influencing solar radiation and the albedos of snow and ice surfaces over the Himalayas and Tibetan Plateau (HTP). We utilize long-term Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) fire products together with ground-based and satellite-derived aerosol datasets to assess the primary effect of wildfires originating from the southern slopes of the Himalayas on aerosol loading in the HTP. Results reveal consistent interannual and seasonal variation patterns, accompanied by statistically significant correlations between aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 500 nm from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) stations (Pokhara, Qomolangma (Mt. Everest) Station for Atmospheric and Environmental Observation and Research, Chinese Academy of Sciences (QOMS), Nam Co) and Himalayan fires. Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) data further indicate elevated smoke aerosol extinction coefficients at altitudes of 6 to 8 km (middle troposphere) in the southern HTP during the peak fire season (March–April) in 2021. The intense wildfire activity in 2021 likely induced mid-tropospheric warming and alterations in the vertical temperature structure, evidenced by a pronounced reduction in the absolute lapse rate, representing the rate of temperature decrease with altitude. This reduction was observed at QOMS, South-East Tibetan plateau Station for integrated observation and research of alpine environment, Chinese Academy of Sciences (SETS), and Naqu stations compared to 2022. Santa Barbara DISORT Atmospheric Radiative Transfer (SBDART) simulations estimated increased heating rates (0.38–1.32 K d−1) and atmospheric warming (15.03–22.43 W m−2) in the mid-troposphere due to smoke aerosols. Such warming affects regional atmospheric stability and modulates surface temperatures (∼0.04 K). It is crucial to conduct further research into the heating/cooling processes induced by aerosols and their influence on the vertical temperature structure to comprehensively understand the impacts of aerosols on regional climate and the hydrological cycle."

Dubey,Orphaned oil and gas well methane emission rates quantified using Gaussian plume inversions of ambient observations,"This work uses ambient methane and wind measurements to quantify methane emissions from a leaking orphaned oil and gas well using Gaussian plume inversions. Our analysis shows that existing Gaussian plume methods that assume atmospheric stability are prone to large errors. We report a more robust analysis that determines plume dispersion coefficients from our in situ observations. Our technique enables more accurate methane quantification of orphaned oil and gas wells to prioritize plugging. 
 Annually, ∼ 3.6 million abandoned oil and gas wells in the US emit a combined ∼ 2.6 Tg methane (CH4), adversely affecting climate and regional air quality. However, these estimates depend on emission factors derived from measuring subpopulations of wells that vary by orders of magnitude due to very limited field sampling and poorly characterized distributions. Currently, US protocols to remediate orphaned wells lacks standardized quantification methods needed to both prioritize plugging and account for emission reductions. Therefore, sensitive, reliable, affordable, and scalable CH4 flux quantification methods are needed. We report the use of a simple Gaussian plume method where the dispersion parameters are constrained by in situ ground measurements of CH4 concentration at four locations 7.5–49 m downwind of the orphan well as well as local winds to estimate the leak rate from an orphan well. We derive a flux of 10.53 ± 1.16 kg CH4 h−1 during a venting procedure in April 2023 that agrees with the directly measured volumetric flow rate of 9.00 ± 0.25 kg CH4 h−1. This is 71 % greater than the 5.3 kg CH4 h−1 flux measured 7 months prior. Additionally, we discovered a secondary leak through the surface casing inferred as 0.43–0.67 kg CH4 h−1 both by our ground Gaussian analysis and by transecting the plume with an uncrewed aerial system (UAS). We show that in situ determination of the dispersion parameters used in our Gaussian inversions allows us to measure methane emissions to 15 % accuracy, significantly reducing errors when compared to the standard practice of assuming stability class. Our results help develop simpler methods and protocols for robust orphan well emission quantification that can be used for reporting."

Through the so-called forest filter effect (FFE), they can remove both gas and particulate matter (PM) associated organic contaminants, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) from air, reducing their concentrations. In this work, new aspects of FFE were investigated through several laboratory experiments of increasing complexity. More specifically, the study was designed to evaluate for the first time the contribution of light and phyllosphere microbial communities of Quercus ilex leaves to the degradation of deuterated PAHs (naphthalene-d8, acenaphthene-d10, phenanthrene-d10, pyrene-d10, chrysene-d12, and perylene-d12). Such degradation was investigated by observing the production of deuterated PAH hydroxy metabolites (OH-PAHs). OH-PAHs were produced in both  light and dark conditions, while their appearance in sterile controls was negligible, highlighting the importance of leaf-associated microorganisms in the degradation of parent PAH. The number of PAH metabolites and their isomers increased when entire leaves were used rather than the inoculated phyllosphere microorganisms only, confirming the degradation ability of native phyllosphere microbial communities. Although preliminary, these results showed that FFE can be enhanced by photo- and biodegradation processes. The continuous removal of PAHs through degradation could result in an enhanced PAH concentration gradient and flux of deposition  to leaves."

Sorooshian,High Accumulation Mode Aerosol Concentration and Moderate Aerosol Hygroscopicity Limit Impacts of Recent Particle Formation on Northwest Atlantic Post‐Frontal Clouds,"Postfrontal cloud regime transitions often result from strong aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation interaction. Using ACTIVATE measurements from 40 flights, we show a diurnal pattern of evolving aerosol particle size distributions (PSD) in the marine boundary layer upwind of clouds. A nucleation mode grows in size between 12 and 17 LT, likely from new particle formation (NPF), and an accumulation mode increases in concentration during daytime. Selecting the day of strongest size growth, we use quasi‐Lagrangian large‐eddy simulations to examine cloud impacts. With a morning PSD, moderate aerosol hygroscopicity aligns best with satellite and field campaign observational targets. Using a PSD near 17 LT, greater cloud droplet number concentrations delay the precipitation onset and keep albedo elevated for longer, primarily driven by increased accumulation mode concentrations, which facilitate an updraft‐limited regime and inhibit activation of smaller modes despite their growth after NPF. These results constitute a caveat for NPF‐related activation under polluted conditions."

Through analyses of observations and time‐slice model simulations, this study shows that South Asian autumn BC aerosols can cause instant and delayed responses of surface air temperature over the Arctic and Eurasia. In autumn, higher BC loading over South Asia leads to decreased rainfall and tropospheric diabatic cooling there. This cooling can remotely excite an anomalous anticyclone over Europe that transports warm and moist air into the Arctic to precondition sea ice melting over the Barents‐Kara Seas (BKS). The consequent decrease of sea ice cover (SIC) causes BKS warming through increased surface exchange fluxes, and the concurring anomalous anticyclone near the Ural Mountains induces surface cooling over Eurasia. This temperature anomaly pattern can persist into the ensuing winter due to the continued SIC decrease across seasons."

Westervelt,"Strong intermodel differences and biases in CMIP6 simulations of PM2.5, aerosol optical depth, and precipitation over Africa","Our research explores how well air pollution and rainfall patterns in Africa are represented in current climate models by comparing model data to observations from 1981 to 2023. While most models capture seasonal air quality changes well, they struggle to replicate the distribution of non-dust pollutants and certain rainfall patterns, especially over east Africa. Improving these models is crucial for better climate predictions and preparing for future risks. 
 Poor air quality and precipitation change are strong, rapidly changing, and possibly linked drivers of physical hazards in sub-Saharan Africa. Future projections of sub-Saharan air quality and precipitation remain uncertain due to differences in model representations of aerosol, aerosol–precipitation interactions, and unclear future aerosol emission pathways. In this study, we evaluate the performance of CMIP6 models in simulating PM2.5, aerosol optical depth (AOD), and precipitation over Africa relative to a range of observational and reanalysis products, including novel observational datasets, over the 1981–2023 period. While models accurately capture the seasonal cycle of PM2.5 concentrations over most regions, the concentration magnitudes show strong intermodel diversity. Dust AOD shows a generally accurate seasonal spatial distribution, with multi-model mean (MMM) pattern correlation coefficients within 0.77–0.94, despite strong intermodel diversity in magnitude. Seasonal spatial patterns of non-dust AOD are poorly represented, with MMM pattern correlation coefficients of 0.25–0.58 and the poorest performance during September through November. Emission inventory inaccuracies may explain systematic biases for non-dust AOD fields, with differences in circulation and precipitation patterns, as well as aerosol treatment causing intermodel diversity. The magnitude and annual progression of precipitation over both the east and west African monsoon regions are well captured, though there is poorer performance in simulating the east African monsoon. Biases found relate to the intertropical convergence zone, more apparent over east Africa, and rainfall magnitude, more apparent over west Africa. This evaluation highlights strong intermodel diversity in the representation of African air quality and climate and identifies model performance over sub-Saharan Africa and the reasons behind the biases as critical gaps to address for improving confidence in climate projections."

This article describes the methodology used to quantify the modulation of water vapour by atmospheric waves and deep convective cases. This methodology allows us to bring to light the influence of atmospheric waves and extreme deep convection on the observed water vapour anomalies. 
 Most atmospheric species enter the stratosphere through the tropical tropopause layer (TTL), a place of interplay between many processes of different scales. Water vapour (H2Ovap) is a key compound in this layer and its entry into the tropical stratosphere is crucial for stratospheric chemistry and climate. We present a methodology based on the calculation of in situ H2Ovap and temperature anomalies to estimate the modulation of H2Ovap due to atmospheric waves and deep convection. H2Ovap data were obtained from in situ measurements of five Pico-Strat Bi Gaz spectrometers that were flown under long-duration balloons during the Strateole 2 campaigns. The calculation of Pearson's correlation coefficients is performed between averaged ERA5 reanalysis temperatures and in situ H2Ovap anomalies. In the case of a monotonic vertical gradient of H2Ovap, the absolute value of the correlation coefficient is high (typically 0.65). For the other flights we highlight lower correlations, due to changes in time of the vertical gradient of stratospheric H2Ovap, and large convective systems overshooting the tropopause. This is the case for one of the flights, which flew over the Raï typhoon (correlation coefficient of 0.31 due to both contributions). Depending on the flights, we also show that for 47 % up to 70 % of the probed nights, H2Ovap anomalies can be explained by atmospheric waves, which highlights the major role played by waves on H2Ovap in the TTL. We also show that long-duration balloon measurements are important in highlighting the overshooting signature of H2Ovap in the upper TTL."

We found that dust pollution could reduce the effectiveness of ammonia emission controls by altering aerosol chemistry. Using field observations and modeling, we showed that dust particles affect nitrate distribution between gas and particle phases. Our findings highlight the need for pollution control strategies that consider both human emissions and dust sources for better urban air quality management. 
 Dust emissions significantly influence air quality and contribute to nitrate aerosol pollution by altering aerosol acidity. Understanding how dust interacts with ammonia emission controls is crucial for managing particulate nitrate pollution, especially in urban environments. In this study, we conducted field measurements of aerosol chemical components and gases across three cities in eastern China during the spring of 2023. By combining an aerosol thermodynamic model with machine learning, we assessed the relative contribution of dust to aerosol pH and its impact on nitrate formation. Our results show that changes in ammonia, in both the gas and particle phases, were the main factors affecting aerosol pH, with dust particles contributing to about 7 % of the total pH variation. During dust events, high concentrations of non-volatile ions increased aerosol pH, leading to higher nitrate levels in the particle phase. Machine learning analysis revealed that extreme dust storms caused a significant change in aerosol pH, enhancing nitrate partitioning. Further simulations indicated that while reducing ammonia emissions is effective in lowering nitrate levels under normal conditions, this effect is significantly reduced in dust-affected environments. Dust particles act as a buffer, reducing the sensitivity of nitrate formation to ammonia emission reductions. These findings emphasize the need to consider dust pollution when designing strategies for controlling particulate nitrate levels and highlight the complex interactions between dust and anthropogenic emissions."

 Ammonia (NH3) is an abundant alkaline gas in the atmosphere and a key precursor in the formation of particulate matter. While emissions of other aerosol precursors such as SO2 and NOx have decreased significantly, global NH3 emissions are stable or increasing, and this trend is projected to continue. This study investigates the impact of NH3 emission changes on size-resolved aerosol composition and acidity using the atmospheric chemistry–climate model EMAC (ECHAM5/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry). Rather than directly perturbing NH3 emissions, we employ three distinct emission inventories: two bottom-up inventories and one derived using an updated top-down method. The results reveal that sulfate–nitrate–ammonium aerosols in two fine-mode size ranges (0–1 and 1–2.5 µm) show the greatest sensitivity to NH3 emission changes. Regional responses vary depending on the local chemical environment of secondary inorganic aerosols. In “NH3-rich” regions (e.g., East Asia and Europe), the abundance of NH3 partially offsets the effects of reduced NH3 emissions when NOx and SO2 are available, especially for aerosols in the 1–2.5 µm range. This underscores the importance of coordinated control strategies for NH3, NOx, and SO2 emissions. Further, we find that NH3 has a buffering effect in densely populated areas, maintaining aerosol acidity at moderate levels and mitigating drastic pH shifts. While pH changes correlate strongly with NH3 variability, they are also influenced by concurrent changes in SO2 and NOx emissions. These results highlight the critical role of NH3 in shaping aerosol acidity, arguing for size-specific approaches to managing particulate matter."

 We used aerosol data from surface-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) and day-ahead aerosol optical depth (AOD) forecasts from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) to examine the spatiotemporal variations in AOD at selected sites worldwide. We evaluated three methods for day-ahead AOD forecasting: AERONET 1 d (and 2 d) persistence or monthly mean, along with CAMS forecast. High values of daily mean AOD indicates larger day-to-day variability in AOD and lower predictability. Using radiative transfer modeling, we quantify deviations in forecasts of cloud-free direct normal irradiance (DNI) induced by errors in AOD forecasts. The performance of each AOD forecast method in DNI forecast is assessed and compared. Taking into account the characteristic aerosol types at selected locations, we also draw quantitative implications about the reliability and usability of CAMS AOD forecasts for DNI forecasts as alternatives to AOD forecasts based on approaches using ground-based measurements. For example, CAMS forecasts perform better at more sites than AERONET persistence approaches do, among them many urban-industrial aerosol sites. AERONET persistence forecasts AOD with lower errors at dust aerosol sites. To date, none of the forecast methods for AOD discussed here reliably achieve an accuracy of < 5 % deviation in day-ahead forecasts of direct normal irradiation (daily sum), but most of the sites can expect better DNI forecasts with a threshold of 20 % DNI deviation."

Using conversion coefficient generated by MERRA-2, column concentration was converted to surface concentration. 
 Black Carbon (BC) is a carbonaceous aerosol that strongly absorbs solar radiation. The high emissions of these highly absorbent particles exacerbate regional air quality and pose significant threats to global climate, both in the short and long term. Therefore, accurately quantifying the spatial distribution of BC is crucial for improving regional air quality and mitigating the climate change impacts driven by human activities. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm for retrieving BC surface concentration jointly using MODIS and AERONET data. Firstly, the algorithm employed the K-means clustering method to determine seasonal background aerosols model based on AERONET V3 daily products. Then, the Maxwell–Garnett effective medium approximation model was utilized to calculate the complex refractive index of the internally mixed aerosols. Subsequently, the lookup tables were established using the 6SV2.1 radiative transfer code to estimate optimal BC fraction and column concentration. Next, the column concentration data were converted to surface concentration using a conversion coefficient derived from MERRA-2. Finally, the retrieved MODIS BC surface concentration was validated with in-situ Aethalometer measurements.

Schwab,Aerial estimates of methane and  carbon dioxide emission rates using a  mass balance approach in New York State,"Methane and carbon dioxide emission rates were calculated for facilities across several sectors in New York State using aerial observations. Of the sampled facilities, landfills dominated the methane emission rates, while combustion facilities had the highest carbon dioxide emission rates, followed by landfills. The self-reported Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) inventory mostly underestimates landfill methane emissions, apart from a few facilities with comparable numbers. 
 Accurate greenhouse gas (GHG) emission inventories are vital for climate mitigation as they can identify areas of need and ensure effective policy and regulation in reducing GHG emissions. Several studies have shown that self-reporting GHG inventories are undercounting methane emissions across all anthropogenic sectors, showing an increasing need to validate the inventory with direct measurements. This study carried out aerial observations and emission rates of methane and carbon dioxide across multiple sectors in New York State (NYS). Emission rates were calculated for each of the sources using a mass balance method and were subsequently compared to the 2021 Environmental Protection Agency GHG Reporting Program (EPA GHGRP) Inventory. Landfills were the source of the highest observed methane emission estimates, ranging from 161 to 3440 kg h−1. There was also significant variation in observed emissions within facilities between seasons, indicating a significant influence from meteorology. Variation in estimated measured emissions between different landfills could be due to operational differences. Observed carbon dioxide emission estimates were dominated by combustion facilities, followed by landfills. Comparisons with the inventory show that methane emissions averaged over 10 observed landfills are underestimated by a factor of 2. However, of the 10 landfills, 5 had observed methane emission estimates significantly higher than the inventory value, 4 had an inventory value within the uncertainty range of the observations, and 1 had a landfill-observed emission estimate that was markedly lower than the reported inventory estimate. Seneca Meadows Landfill was the highest emitter from the measurements and was ∼ 4.3× higher than the annual average estimate that was reported to the 2021 EPA GHGRP Inventory.

Climate models therefore need an accurate description of their properties and evolution. Satellites measure how strongly aerosol particles extinguish light passing through the stratosphere. We describe a method to use such aerosol extinction data to retrieve the number and sizes of the aerosol particles and calculate their optical effects. The resulting data sets for models are validated against ground-based and balloon observations. 
 Stratospheric aerosol is an important climate forcing agent as it scatters some of the incoming solar radiation back to space, thus cooling the Earth's surface and the troposphere. At the same time, it absorbs some of the upwelling terrestrial radiation that heats the stratosphere. It also plays an important role in stratospheric ozone chemistry by hosting heterogeneous reactions. Major volcanic eruptions can cause strong perturbations of stratospheric aerosol, changing its radiative and chemical effects by more than an order of magnitude. Many global climate models require prescribed stratospheric aerosol as input to properly simulate both climate effects in the presence and absence of volcanic eruptions. This paper describes REMAP, a retrieval method and code for aerosol properties that has been used in several model intercomparison projects (under the name Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment-3λ, SAGE-3λ). The code fits a single-mode lognormal size distribution for a pure aqueous sulfuric acid aerosol to aerosol extinction coefficients from observational or model data sets. From the retrieved size distribution parameters, the code calculates the effective radius; surface area density; and extinction coefficients, single-scattering albedos, and asymmetry factors of the aerosol within the wavelength bands specified for each individual climate model. We validate REMAP using balloon-borne observations after the Mount Pinatubo and Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha`apai (HTHH) volcanic eruptions, as well as 4 decades of lidar measurements. Within the constraints of a single-mode lognormal distribution, REMAP generates realistic effective radii and surface area densities after volcanic eruptions and generally matches the lidar backscatter time series within measurement uncertainty. Deviations in aerosol backscatter by up to a factor of 2 arise when (non-volcanic) tropospheric intrusions (e.g., from wildfires) are present and the size distribution deviates significantly from the single-mode lognormal type. We describe the products that have been used in CCMI (Chemistry–Climate Model Initiative), CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 ), and other model intercomparison projects and provide practical instructions for use of the code in future applications."
10.1021/envhealth.5c00045,True,Environment & Health,该研究探讨了气温变化（TV）与阻塞性睡眠呼吸暂停（OSA）严重程度之间的关联，以及空气污染在其中的调节作用。研究发现，气温变化越大，OSA病情恶化的风险越高，呼吸暂停低通气指数（AHI）增加，血氧饱和度（SpO2）降低。此外，空气污染与气温变化之间存在协同作用，共同加剧OSA的严重程度。虽然该研究主要关注健康影响，但它明确涉及了空气污染作为大气环境因素，因此与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测）间接相关，因为这些技术可以用于监测和评估空气污染水平，从而为这类健康研究提供数据支持。,"['air pollution', 'temperature variability', 'OSA exacerbation', 'Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI)', 'oxygen saturation (SpO2)']",Anni Li;Hao Wang;Qingli Zhang;Xinlei Zhu;Chang Xu;Su Shi;Haidong Kan;Yutao Guo;Renjie Chen;Xia Meng,"Nationwide Study of the Association between Temperature Variability and Sleep Apnea, and the Modifying Role of Air Pollution, in a Moderate-to-Severe Risk OSA Population","Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a severe sleep disorder that is associated with various health complications. Despite previous research investigating the impact of ambient temperature on the severity of OSA, the potential influence of temperature variability (TV) remains underexplored. We used a nationwide data set among wearable smart device users to assess the association between TV and OSA severity in a population at moderate-to-severe risk of OSA. A case time series statistical method was used to assess the associations between TV and the risk of OSA exacerbation, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), and mean oxygen saturation (SpO2). Additionally, we explored the interaction of TV and air pollution with OSA severity. A total of 52,752 participants with 6,349,414 days of monitoring were finally included in the study. A 1 °C increase in TV01 was associated with an increase of 0.92% (95%CI: 0.69, 1.15%) in excess risk of OSA exacerbation, increases of 0.046 events/h (95%CI: 0.036, 0.057) in AHI, and a decrease of 0.0064% (95%CI: 0.0059, 0.0068%) in SpO2. We observed a significant synergistic interaction of TV and air pollution on the OSA severity.

Ueyama,Stratospheric Injection Lifetimes,"Material injected to the stratosphere by volcanoes and pyrocumulonimbus clouds (pyroCbs) is observed to have different lifetimes depending on the altitude, latitude, season of the injection, and removal processes. We adopt a framework that describes the stratospheric lifetime of injected material as the sum of lag and decay timescales and compute these quantities in tracer simulations by injecting trajectory parcels and tracking them over 8 years. We simulate the evolution of the water vapor plume from the January 2022 Hunga eruption. The simulation suggests a lag time of 1.4 years and the decay time 2.35 ± 0.05 years, producing a stratospheric lifetime of 3.75 ± 0.05 years. From Microwave Limb Sounder observations, we estimate the Hunga water vapor plume decay time to be 2.6 ± 0.75 years and the lifetime to be 4.0 ± 0.75 years which is in good agreement with our model calculations. Overall, we find that injected material lifetime increases with altitude and decreases with the latitude. If polar stratospheric cloud formation is a loss process, the lifetime is shortened. Aerosol gravitational settling also shortens the lifetime and should be included especially for aerosols with >0.5 μm radius. We use the observed lifetime of the Hunga aerosol plume and gravitational settling rate to estimate a particle median radius of ∼0.3 µm in agreement with other estimates. Our calculations are also relevant to geoengineering plans for modifying the stratospheric albedo, where sustained stratospheric aerosol concentrations are envisioned."

The launch of the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite‐R Series (GOES‐R), including GOES‐16 (GOES‐East) and GOES‐17 (GOES‐West), has significantly enhanced AMV data volume and geographic coverage over the contiguous United States (U.S.) and adjacent oceans. AMVs from GOES‐16/17 products can augment wind data in data‐sparse oceanic areas such as those frequented by atmospheric rivers (ARs). However, AMVs exhibit biases and uncertainties, especially due to height assignment issues, and there are fewer conventional data (e.g., radiosondes) to assess GOES‐17 AMVs over oceans. The AR Reconnaissance (AR Recon) samples ARs to improve forecast skill over the U.S. West and provides a unique opportunity to compare GOES‐17 AMVs. This study quantifies biases and uncertainties in GOES‐17 AMVs in the northeast Pacific using dropsondes from AR Recon, and assesses Global Forecast System (GFS) model wind analyses and background fields during AR events. Results for four representative AR cases show that GOES‐R AMVs improved wind data distribution compared to cases prior to GOES‐R becoming operational, particularly in the upper and lower troposphere. A comparison with dropsondes reveals a small vector wind speed bias of −0.7 m s−1. The uncertainty for AMVs is estimated at 5–6 m s−1. Comparison of collocated GFS model background wind fields shows small biases. Data assimilation reduces root‐mean‐squared differences, but the small biases in operational AMVs need further attention as they are a predominant wind data source in the GFS over oceanic regions."

However, the onboard observations of water‐soluble trace metals that the phytoplankton can directly assimilate are still insufficient. In this study, springtime total suspended particulates (TSPs) were collected from the Yellow Sea and East China Seas (ECSs) to the northwest Pacific Ocean (NWPO) by the cruise in 2014, and concentrations of total and water‐soluble trace metals were analyzed. Total and water‐soluble trace metal concentrations in ECSs were higher than those in NWPO, suggesting anthropogenic and terrestrial emissions had greater impacts on TSPs in ECSs. Total and water‐soluble trace metal concentrations in dust TSPs were higher than those in normal TSPs in NWPO, indicating that dust plumes mixed with anthropogenic emissions can be transported to NWPO. Based on enrichment factors, correlation analysis, positive matrix factorization model, and characteristics of trace metals from different sources, four emission sources (crustal mineral, ship exhaust, fossil fuel combustion, and marine emissions) of trace metals in marine TSPs in NWPO were identified. Aerosol sources, aerosol pH values, aging processing, and dust loading significantly affect trace metal solubility in different types of TSPs. Dry deposition fluxes of trace metals in ECSs were higher than those in NWPO. Atmospheric deposition of water‐soluble Fe‐estimated nitrogen fixation (N2 fixation) fluxes in NWPO were comparable to in situ observations, indicating that atmospheric Fe may be an important micronutrient supporting new primary production in the open ocean of NWPO."

Water‐soluble organics averagely accounted for 45%–75% of the OA mass concentrations and 53%–87% of the OA light absorption at 300 nm (Abs300) in the fine particles over the YBS. However, the water‐insoluble organic fractions among marine OA increased obviously during periods dominated by dust or marine emissions. Source apportionment and fluorescent components of OA were further analyzed to gain a quantitative insight into the seasonal variations of the marine OA sources. During autumn, the severe influence of continental anthropogenic pollutants led to a dominant presence of water‐soluble components in the marine OA. Anthropogenic secondary formation contributed 61% and 82% of the mass concentrations and the Abs300 of water‐soluble OA in autumn. Asian dust led to an obvious elevation of OA and brown carbon (BrC) light absorption over the YBS in spring, which contributed 70% and 66% of the water‐insoluble OA mass and Abs300, respectively. In spring, 59% of the OA fluorescence intensity was attributed to the dust‐related protein‐like organics. During the summer cruise, marine emissions contributed 64%–69% to the mass concentration, 53%–79% to the Abs300, and 60% to the fluorescent intensity of OA over the YBS. Our result highlights the distinct sources of marine OA and BrC light absorption across seasons, as well as their vital roles in solar absorption relative to black carbon over marginal seas."

 Uncontrolled waste burning and accidental waste fires are an important source of emissions into the air. However, there are currently only few field studies providing data on these emissions. In this study, we investigated the emission rates, pollutant dispersion and particle composition for a large waste fire in Stockholm county, Sweden. Our results show that the waste fire, while burning, may have contributed as much as 5 times the mean PM10 emissions from road traffic of the municipality it was located in (ca 95 000 inhabitants), which highlights the potential impact of temporary events such as waste fires on air quality. Gaussian dispersion calculations were used to model the spatial distribution of measured PM10 data, demonstrating its use for assessment of exposure and deposition. Particles impacted by the waste fire were enriched in several potentially toxic metals and metalloids including arsenic, copper, cadmium and, in particular, lead when compared to particles collected after the fire. In addition, they may also pose an increased cancer risk on a per-mass basis compared to the post-fire period due to the larger mass fraction of relevant PAHs."

 In this study, we investigated the hygroscopic properties of aerosols containing organics related to biomass burning and atmospheric oxidation mixed with (NH4)2SO4 in various proportions during the hydration process using HTDMA. We extrapolated the morphology, phase transition, and potential chemical reactions based on the hygroscopic process of dried particles precipitated from the solution and findings from the literature. The levoglucosan-(NH4)2SO4 mixed particles exhibited deliquescence might be due to an incompletely encapsulated microstructure by levoglucosan, while a continuous growth process with gradual levoglucosan content increase could be attributed to the formation of a core-shell structure. Newly generated substances filled the micropores of succinic acid aerosol after the addition of (NH4)2SO4, but (NH4)2SO4 and succinic acid existed separately after droplet drying when (NH4)2SO4 was dominant. Experimental results of three-component aerosols with adjustable mass ratios reveal that hygroscopic properties and deliquescent relative humidity (DRH) significantly increased with (NH4)2SO4 content. In contrast, the increase in succinic acid reduced particle hygroscopicity at lower RH while having minimal effect on DRH. Furthermore, deliquescence was suppressed by forming a core-shell structure with levoglucosan increase, leading to continuous aerosol diameter increase. Overall, this study provides insights into the effects of (NH4)2SO4 on modulating the hygroscopic properties of typical organic surrogates related to biomass burning and atmospheric oxidation."

 Accurate characterization of aerosol optical depth (AOD) is crucial for atmospheric science, serving as a cornerstone metric in aerosol-climate process research and radiative forcing quantification. However, satellite-based AOD observations contain data gaps due to cloud contamination and high surface albedo. Appropriate statistical modeling of the spatio-temporal AOD process is therefore essential to filling those data gaps, so as to acquire a reliable and gap-free dataset. Owing to the high-dimensional nature of the underlying interpolation problem, traditional geostatistical approaches are computationally infeasible. In this study, a spatial mixed effect model is used to describe the AOD process, which separates the process into large-, small-, and fine-scale spatial variations, modeled through covariates and spatial basis functions. Since the dimension of the basis functions is fixed and is much smaller than the original data dimension, the method is known as fixed rank kriging (FRK), which makes the spatial prediction tractable. The empirical part of this study applies FRK on monthly and daily AOD observations from MODIS. On the monthly dataset, using the AERONET observations as the ground truth, FRK AOD is found to outperform several benchmarks, including inverse distance weighting interpolation, DeepKriging, and the MERRA-2 reanalysis. Additionally, on the daily dataset, FRK is shown to be able to effectively handle large-scale data, whereas other alternatives often fail due to computational infeasibility."

We use observations of methane point sources from the MethaneAIR instrument from 2021–2023 that covered ~80 % of US onshore oil and gas production regions. We attribute these observations to facility types to explore how emissions vary by industrial sectors. Oil and gas facilities make up most point source emissions nationally, but in certain basins other sectors can make up the majority. 
 High-emitting methane point sources, quantified by remote sensing methods at individual facilities, have gained significant interest for enabling rapid monitoring and mitigation of methane emissions from the oil and gas sector. Here, we present new methane point source quantifications from MethaneAIR, the airborne precursor to MethaneSAT, from campaigns in 2021–2023, which targeted major oil and gas basins covering ∼ 80 % of US onshore production. Flying at ∼ 12 km above ground, MethaneAIR provides wide-area methane mapping and high-resolution measurements of high-emitting methane point sources. Across 13 major basins, MethaneAIR detected over 400 point sources with emission rates >∼150kgh-1, for which we performed detailed attribution to facility categories within oil and gas and non-oil and gas sectors. In 2023, we quantified total point source methane emissions of 357 t h−1 (95 % confidence interval: 277–435 t h−1), with ∼ 80 % of the total attributable to oil and gas sources. Non-oil and gas sources made up 50 %–80 % of observed point source emissions in certain basins, with coal facilities in the Appalachian Basin being the largest source of non-oil and gas methane emissions (30–40 t h−1). We observe emission source intermittency and significant variation across facility types and basins, highlighting the complex characteristics of high-emitting point sources. Our results emphasize the importance of detailed source attribution for prioritizing mitigation efforts and provide the first analysis of methane point sources in several regions, which will be improved by the observational capabilities of a growing set of methane satellites."

Qomolangma,"This study reveals unexpectedly high levels of particulate nitrite at the Base Camp of Mt. Qomolangma, which overwhelmingly exists in coarse mode, and demonstrates that lofted surface soil and long-range transported pollutants contribute to the high levels of nitrite. The high particulate nitrite is likely to participate in atmospheric reactive nitrogen cycling through gas-particle partitioning or photolysis, leading to production of HONO, OH and NO and thereby influencing oxidation chemistry. 
 Atmospheric reactive nitrogen cycling, with nitrous acid (HONO) and particulate nitrite (NO2-) as important intermediates, is crucial for maintaining the atmospheric oxidation capacity of background atmosphere on the Tibetan Plateau. During an 11 d field campaign at the Base Camp of Mt. Qomolangma in spring of 2022, we observed significant enrichments of NO2- in total suspended particulate (TSP) with a mean concentration of 375±386 ng m−3, while NO2- was absent in fine particles (PM2.5). The comparison revealed that NO2- predominately exists in coarse particles. Local surface soil at the sampling site also exhibited high levels of NO2-, with δ15N value similar to NO2- in TSP. This isotopic similarity suggests that wind-blown soil is probably the primary source of NO2- in TSP, accounting for the background levels. While concentration changes of water-soluble inorganic ions in TSP and PM2.5 in response to shifts in air mass back-trajectories imply that atmospheric pollutants transported from South Asia may further elevate the NO2-, the specific mechanisms of long-range transport resulting in NO2- accumulation in TSP rather than PM2.5 remain unknown and need to be investigated. The elevated levels of TSP NO2- may readily participate in atmospheric reactive nitrogen cycling through gas-particle partitioning or photolysis, leading to the production of HONO, OH and NO and thereby influencing oxidation chemistry. Further efforts on the sources and atmospheric chemistry of particulate nitrite are warranted, particularly in the pristine Tibetan Plateau, where even small inputs of NOx or HONO can disproportionately affect oxidant budgets and reactive nitrogen cycling."

We evaluated the remote sensing column NO2 in relation to near-surface concentrations throughout the day and found that the prohibition of vertical transport in the morning and the mixing in the afternoon resulted in different relations between the near-surface (NS) and total column NO2 concentrations. These different relationships have consequences for the use of satellite remote sensing to estimate NS NO2 concentrations. 
 Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) is a major pollutant that at high concentrations may affect human health. It is also a photochemically reactive gas that is important for the oxidation potential of the atmosphere and acts as a precursor for the formation of aerosol particles and ozone. However, monitoring of near-surface (NS) NO2 faces the challenge of spatial discontinuity due to large distances between ground-based monitoring stations, whereas satellite remote sensing provides total vertical column density (VCD) that is related to near-surface (NS) concentrations in a complicated manner. In this study, the relation between total VCD and NS concentrations of NO2 was analyzed based on total VCD from remote sensing observations using a ground-based Pandora spectrometer and NS NO2 concentrations from in situ observations. Both instruments were located at the Beijing-RADI site (Beijing, China) during January 2022. The ratio between total VCD and NS NO2 concentrations varies throughout the day with substantially different relations in the morning and afternoon. During the night and morning, the atmosphere was vertically stratified, with disconnected layers that prevented vertical mixing of atmospheric constituents. In the afternoon, these layers connected, allowing for vertical mixing and transport between the surface and the top of the boundary layer. Thus, the prohibition of vertical transport in the morning and the mixing in the afternoon resulted in different relations between the total VCD and NS NO2 concentrations. These different relationships have consequences for the use of satellite remote sensing to estimate NS NO2 concentrations."
10.5194/acp-25-10677-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了2022年汤加火山爆发对平流层气溶胶的影响。研究利用卫星遥感技术，特别是CALIOP激光雷达和微波临边探测器（MLS），来分析火山爆发后平流层气溶胶和水汽的变化。论文关注气溶胶的来源，特别是火山与海洋相互作用产生的海盐气溶胶，以及它们对气溶胶光学厚度（AOD）的影响。研究表明，尽管二氧化硫排放量不高，但此次火山爆发产生的气溶胶浓度是自1991年皮纳图博火山爆发以来最高的，对平流层产生了显著扰动。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['stratospheric aerosol', 'volcanic eruption', 'satellite observations', 'CALIOP lidar', 'Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS)', 'aerosol optical depth (AOD)', 'stratospheric water vapor', 'atmospheric composition']",Bengt G.

Sporre,Stratospheric aerosol formed by intense volcanism–sea interaction during the 2022 Hunga Ha'apai eruption,"Highly variable stratospheric aerosol bears great importance for Earth's climate. The 1-year average aerosol load from the 2022 volcanic eruption in Hunga Tonga is the highest since the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption. The usual volcanic aerosol precursor gas (SO2) mass was not sufficient to explain the aerosol load. Intense volcanism–sea interaction amplified the eruption, and sea salt emission forms a plausible explanation for the high aerosol loading. 
 The Hunga Tonga eruption on 15 January 2022 (HT-22) induced vigorous volcano–sea interaction. Here we study the stratospheric aerosol and water vapor resulting from the eruption using satellite-based instruments: the CALIOP lidar and the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS). We investigate the stratospheric relative humidity following the record-breaking water vapor injections from the HT-22 eruption and the particle size of the aerosol. The HT-22 eruption injected its effluents into the deep Brewer–Dobson (BD) branch causing several years of stratospheric perturbation. The long duration and the aerosol concentration (among the highest) make the HT-22 eruption the strongest stratospheric aerosol event since the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption despite a modest SO2 injection explaining only ∼30 % of the aerosol optical depth (AOD) from the HT-22 eruption according to our estimates. The stratospheric AOD level was established after 2 weeks, or possibly even earlier, which is a short time compared with the usual 2–3 months required to reach the maximum AOD following volcanic eruptions. We discuss the sources of the aerosol from the HT-22 eruption in relation to the low emission of SO2, its e-folding time, and volcanological observations of strong interactions with the sea containing not only water but also high concentrations of dissolved substances."

In this study, we deployed the Department of Energy’s fixed-wing ArcticShark UAS to examine PM2.5 composition at varying altitudes─within and above the planetary boundary layer (PBL)─over the Southern Great Plains atmospheric observatory (SGP). A total of 22 flights were conducted across March, June, and August 2023. Composite filter samples were collected during each flight and analyzed with offline aerosol mass spectrometry (AMS), complemented by on-board real-time sensors and ground-based instrumentation, to provide a comprehensive view of regional aerosol characteristics. Results show clear vertical and seasonal differences in the aerosol composition. Relative to ground-level measurements, aloft samples exhibited shifts in the distribution of organic and inorganic PM, with the organic composition varying distinctly across seasons. Particulate organic nitrogen (ON) was elevated, with bulk compositions similar in March and June but strongly altered in August, likely driven by biomass burning and enhanced photochemical activity. Combined AMS and chemical ionization mass spectrometry analyses detected amines, amides, and amino acids. PM above the planetary boundary layer was enriched in oxidized organic aerosols, while ground-level PM contained higher nitrate and sulfate. Seasonal differences in aqueous-phase processing were also observed, which were strongest in March during persistent cloud cover and weaker in the drier August period, suggesting a shift from aqueous- to gas-phase SOA formation. These findings highlight the value of UAS in advancing PM measurements and vertical profiling of aerosol composition."

To assess the impact of anthropogenic emissions on atmospheric oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs) and regional air quality in the southeastern TP, we conducted intensive field observations using iodide chemical ionization mass spectrometry combined with a Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols (FIGAERO–CIMS) during the @Tibet field campaigns. We detected 653 distinct OOMs in both gas and particle phases, with most falling within the intermediate volatility range. Supervised machine learning was used to classify OOMs based on precursor origin, including biogenic (isoprene and monoterpenes) and anthropogenic (aromatics and aliphatics) sources. Notably, the OOMs derived from anthropogenic emissions dominated the measured compounds, representing 32.5% in the gas phase and 45.6% in the particle phase, substantially exceeding the contributions from biogenic sources (27.5 and 21.8% in the gas and particle phases, respectively). These results reveal the significant influence of anthropogenic emissions on atmospheric species even in remote areas, highlighting the urgent need to consider these impacts in future air quality assessments and pollution mitigation strategies in the TP region."

 Aerosols substantially influence the climate by modifying Earth’s radiative balance and marine biogeochemical cycles. However, accurate quantification of aerosol deposition onto ocean surfaces remains challenging due to the limited direct observations over oceanic regions. Here, to address this observational gap, we use the cosmogenic radionuclide beryllium-7, measured simultaneously in the atmosphere and seawater. Beryllium-7 is naturally produced in the atmosphere and rapidly attaches to submicrometre aerosol particles before being deposited onto the ocean surface through wet and dry processes, making it a direct tracer for quantifying aerosol deposition. We combine previous measurements from cruises in the North Pacific, equatorial Pacific, North Atlantic and Arctic oceans with measurements from the South Pacific, Indian and Southern oceans to derive a revised aerosol deposition parameterization across the global ocean. Compared with the parameterizations used in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model, we find that aerosol deposition rates over the global ocean have been underestimated by 39 ± 23%, consequently overestimating aerosol lifetimes over the oceans by an average of 69 ± 92%. Our observationally constrained results suggest that aerosol processes are more dynamic than previously estimated, with important implications for our understanding of aerosol-driven climate effects and marine biogeochemical processes globally.

 Blooming effect, a phenomenon that actual lit areas appear enlarged in nighttime light images acquired by satellites, has been widely studied in remote sensing community. However, the physical mechanisms behind its formation have not been quantitatively explored. In this study, we first reported a new and interesting phenomenon that the blooming effect exhibits an east-west elliptical shape at point light sources in VIIRS nighttime light images. Based on this observation we hypothesize that the blooming shape is influenced by the observation geometry (i.e., viewing zenith angle (VZA)) and atmospheric scattering. To test this hypothesis, the physical mechanism behind the formation of the blooming shape through numerical simulations using the Method of Successive Orders of Scattering (MSOS) model was revealed. More than 1000 numerical simulations were conducted using MSOS model under various aerosol conditions, observation geometries, and wavelengths, revealing a positive correlation between the eccentricity of the blooming shape and VZA, with R2 values exceeding 0.9. To validate these findings with satellite observations, we analyzed VNP46A1 data of Black Marble product from 10 gas flaring regions worldwide. The results reconfirmed the positive correlation between the eccentricity of the blooming shape and VZA across all the selected regions, with R2 values exceeding 0.5. Both numerical simulations and satellite observations supported the hypothesis. This study revealed the physical mechanism behind the blooming effect, suggesting that physical models are important to understand and advance nighttime light remote sensing."

 The interactions between metal ions and humic-like substances (HULIS) in cloud water significantly influence atmospheric metal fate, photochemistry, and cloud processes. Using EEM-PARAFAC, 2D-FTIR-COS, and hetero-2DCOS, under environmentally relevant pH conditions (pH = 6.5), this study systematically investigates complexation mechanisms of six metals (Cu(II), Hg(II), Pb(II), Fe(III), Mn(II), Zn(II)) with HULIS extracted from cloud water. EEM-PARAFAC resolves HULIS into three fluorescent fractions: low-oxygen (C1), high-oxygen (C2), and protein-like (C3). Fe(III) exhibits the strongest binding (logK ≈ 4.89–5.01), preferentially quenching C3, while Pb(II)/Hg(II) interact with C1 and Cu(II) with C2. Mn(II)/Zn(II) enhance fluorescence via alternative mechanisms. 2D-FTIR-COS reveals Fe(III)/Pb(II) target carboxyl/carbonyl groups, Cu(II)/Hg(II) aromatic moieties, and Zn(II) hydroxyl/polysaccharide functionalities. Hetero-2DCOS uncovers sequential structural changes: Fe(III), Cu(II), and Pb(II) induce fluorescence responses before C–H/O–H vibrations, whereas Hg(II) modifies C–H vibrations prior to fluorescence quenching. These findings provide novel molecular insights into metal-HULIS binding dynamics, highlighting HULIS as a critical mediator of metal solubility, transport, and photochemical reactivity in cloud systems, with implications for aerosol properties, climate feedbacks, and pollution mitigation strategies."

 The present study performed classification global aerosols based on particle linear depolarization ratio (PLDR) and single scattering albedo (SSA) provided from AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) Version 3.0 and Level 2.0 inversion products of 171 AERONET sites located in six continents. Current methodology could distinguish effectively between dust and non-dust aerosols using PLDR and SSA. These selected sites include dominant aerosol types such as, pure dust (PD), dust dominated mixture (DDM), pollution dominated mixture (PDM), very weakly absorbing (VWA), strongly absorbing (SA), moderately absorbing(MA), and weakly absorbing (WA). Biomass-burning aerosols which are associated with black carbon are assigned as combinations of WA, MA and SA. The key important findings show the sites in the Northern African region are predominantly influenced by PD, while south Asian sites are characterized by DDM as well as mixture of dust and pollution aerosols. Urban and industrialized regions located in Europe and North American sites are characterized by VWA, WA, and MA aerosols. Tropical regions, including South America, South-east-Asia and southern African sites which prone to forest and biomass-burning, are dominated by SA aerosols. The study further examined the impacts by radiative forcing for different aerosol types. Among the aerosol types, SA and VWA contribute with the highest (30.14 ± 8.04 Wm−2) and lowest (7.83 ± 4.12 Wm−2) atmospheric forcing, respectively. Consequently, atmospheric heating rates are found to be highest by SA (0.85 K day−1) and lowest by VWA aerosols (0.22 Kday−1).

By testing different strategies for selecting air samples, this study shows that increasing sample frequency and carefully choosing samples based on their fossil fuel and nuclear content leads to more accurate results, reducing the uncertainty and bias of the estimates. 
 During 2024, an intensive Δ14CO2 flask sampling campaign was conducted at 12 sampling stations across Europe as part of the CO2MVS Research on Supplementary Observations (CORSO) project. These Δ14CO2 samples, combined with CO2 atmospheric measurements, are intended to enhance the estimation of fossil CO2 emissions over Europe through inverse modeling. In this study, we perform a series of Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSEs) to evaluate the added value of such an intensive campaign as well as the different flask sample selection strategies on estimating fossil fuel emissions. We explore three main selection strategies and compare them against the currently more widely used method of two-week integrated samples: (1) collecting flask samples every 3 d according to a uniform schedule, without applying specific selection criteria; (2) selecting flask samples with high fossil CO2 content to better isolate anthropogenic signals; and (3) combining fossil CO2 selection with consideration of nuclear 14CO2 contamination to reduce potential biases from nuclear emissions. The results suggest that higher sampling density improves the estimation of fossil CO2 emissions, particularly during periods of high fossil fuel activity, such as in winter, while integrated sampling remains more effective during summer months when emissions are lower. Increasing the number of flask samples significantly reduces uncertainty and enhances the robustness of inverse modeling results. In addition, selecting samples with a high fossil CO2 content shows potential for improving the accuracy of emission estimates. The largest reduction in uncertainty is achieved when sample selection actively avoids periods of potential high nuclear 14CO2 contamination. This approach helps minimize potential biases, particularly in regions with significant nuclear activity such as France and the UK. These findings highlight the importance of not only increasing sampling frequency but also carefully selecting samples based on their fossil CO2 and nuclear 14CO2 composition to improve the reliability of fossil fuel emission estimates across Europe."

Hastings,Evaluating NOx fate and organic nitrate chemistry from α-pinene oxidation using stable oxygen and nitrogen isotopes,"We studied how chemicals released from plants and pollution interact in the atmosphere, affecting air quality and climate. By combining laboratory experiments and chemistry models, we tracked unique chemical fingerprints to understand how nitrogen compounds transform to form particles in the air. Our findings help explain the role of these reactions in pollution and provide tools to improve predictions for cleaner air and better climate policies. 
 The oxidation of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) such as α-pinene in the presence of nitrogen oxides (NOx= NO + NO2) initiates complex photochemical processes that produce organic nitrates (RONO2) and influence atmospheric oxidation capacity, air quality, and the fate of reactive nitrogen. However, tracking the chemical fate of RONO2 remains challenging as it includes pathways such as renoxification, aerosol partitioning, deposition, and/or hydrolysis to nitric acid (HNO3). Stable oxygen (Δ17O, δ18O) and nitrogen (δ15N) isotope measurements can provide a unique tool to probe these processes, as NOy species can exhibit distinct isotopic signatures due to characteristic oxygen-transfer dynamics and isotope fractionation. Here, we present chamber experiments of α-pinene oxidation in the presence of NOx under a range of oxidant and photochemical conditions, reporting the Δ17O, δ18O, and δ15N values of simultaneously collected NO2, HNO3, and particulate nitrate (pNO3), the latter of which derived predominantly from RONO2 in the conducted experiments. A strong linear relationship between δ18O and Δ17O across all NOy species (r=0.992; p<0.01) supports a two-endmember mixing model, in which oxygen atoms are transferred from isotopically distinct sources that include ozone (O3) with high δ18O and Δ17O as well as peroxy and hydroxyl radicals (RO2, HO2, OH) with lower values. Nitrogen isotope fractionation, quantified as the difference in δ15N values (Δδ15N), revealed consistently positive Δδ15N(HNO3–NO2) values (+28.9 ± 13.4 ‰ in daytime experiments; +22.2 ± 1.4 ‰ at night) and negative Δδ15N(pNO3–NO2) values (−13.6 ± 5.8 ‰ in daytime experiments). This reflected distinct formation pathways and isotope effects including NOx photochemical cycling, thermal dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5)–nitrate radical (NO3)–NO2 equilibrium, and HNO3 production mechanisms. Box-model simulations based on Δ17O values as a constraint were conducted using a newly developed gas-phase mechanism, which reproduced Δ17O(NO2) and Δ17O(pNO3) (compared to simulated Δ17O(RONO2)) accurately, with an average model bias of 0.9 ± 2.4 ‰ (R2=0.98) and −1.4 ± 2.4 ‰ (R2= 0.55 and R2= 0.97 when excluding one outlier), respectively. We further empirically derived important isotopic parameters such as the Δ17O value transferred from O3 through comparison of model-simulated oxygen atom source contributions with observed Δ17O values for NO2 and pNO3 across experiments. This yielded best-fit slopes of 39.4 ± 0.6 ‰ for NOx photochemical cycling and 41.7 ± 1.2 ‰ for RONO2 formation, consistent with near-surface observations of Δ17O in the terminal oxygen atom of O3. Despite the agreement with NO2 and RONO2, accurately simulating Δ17O(HNO3) proved challenging. Sensitivity tests revealed that model biases likely stemmed from a combination of factors including background HNO3 chamber blanks affecting low-NOx experiments, missing N2O5 heterogeneous hydrolysis under nighttime conditions, and an overestimation in the Δ17O(HNO3) mass balance resulting from the NO2+ OH reaction, which was improved by adjusting the contribution from (2/3)Δ17O(NO2) to (1/2)Δ17O(NO2). These adjustments reduced the average model bias in Δ17O(HNO3) from 6.7 ± 3.3 ‰ (R2= 0.39) in the base mechanism to 1.6 ± 1.3 ‰ (R2= 0.48) in the modified mechanism. These findings demonstrate the utility of Δ17O and δ15N for disentangling nitrate formation mechanisms, while also highlighting critical gaps in our understanding of the isotope dynamics involving HNO3 formation. Future experimental work targeting isolated HNO3 pathways is essential to refine isotopic mass balance assumptions and nitrogen isotope fractionation."

 Mass spectrometry techniques traditionally deployed in the field often operate at low mass resolution, making it hard to unambiguously identify and attribute organic molecules. In this regard, in-situ, accurate and precise online mass-spectrometric measurements of organic molecules in atmospheric organic aerosol (OA) are essential for understanding its sources, formation and chemical composition. In this study, we demonstrate the field applicability of a high-resolution (Orbitrap) mass spectrometer with Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionization (APCI-Orbitrap-MS) for real-time ambient OA measurements, achieving online, molecular resolution at atmospherically relevant concentrations with a high temporal resolution of 1 s, mass resolution of R = 120 000 at m/z 200, and mass accuracy of ±1.5 ppm. These features enable chemically reliable measurements in environments that are exhibiting chemically complex aerosol composition, through molecular-level detection and identification of anthropogenic pollutants, biogenic and biomass burning tracers. As proof of principle, we deployed the APCI-Orbitrap-MS for in-situ measurements in a mobile laboratory container at an urban background station at Campus Riedberg (CR, Frankfurt am Main, Germany) and an agricultural field site in Schivenoglia (SKI, Italy) in the heavily polluted Po Valley. The APCI-Orbitrap-MS showed good agreement with the organic aerosol mass of an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM), with Pearson's R values of 0.91 and 0.70 for the urban and agricultural sites, respectively. In SKI, we resolved distinct diurnal variations in compounds such as MBTCA (C8H12O6), a biogenic marker of photochemical aging, and C8H13O8N, an organic nitrate indicative of nighttime chemistry. Additionally, nighttime biomass burning events were detected frequently, with durations ranging from 10 to 40 min, emphasizing the importance of high temporal resolution. During these events we found up to 30 isobaric peaks per unit mass that are baseline-resolved. For the first time, the hydroxypinonyl ester of cis-pinic acid (C19H28O7) could be measured and confirmed with MS2 experiments in ambient aerosol by an in-situ method at CR. In addition, laboratory experiments were performed to confirm the broad applicability of the APCI-Orbitrap-MS for the real-time detection of biogenic and biomass burning tracers, as well as specific anthropogenic pollutants, such as pesticides, organophosphates or organic esters from aircraft lubrication oil."

During the Australian forest fires in 2019/2020, such convective plumes transported quantities of smoke into the tropopause region comparable to those of a large volcanic eruption. In this study, we investigate the heat emission threshold at which wildfire plumes transition into pyroCbs. We examine the sensitivity of the pyroCb to further changes in the total amount of heat released as well as to the latent to sensible heat flux ratio. Using the extreme Australian New Years Eve PyroCb event as a case study, we perform semi‐idealized simulations with a regional high‐resolution atmospheric model. The so simulated plumes show a pronounced bimodal behavior with an abrupt onset of pyroCb formation when the sensible heat flux exceeds 50 kW m−2. When a cloud is formed within the plume, the plume top height is mainly controlled by the sum of the sensible and latent heat flux, while the ratio between the two plays a subordinate role. Increasing either heat flux raises the plume water content and temperature anomaly within the cloud. The strong differences below the cloud between plumes with equal total heat flux but different sensible heat‐to‐latent heat ratios are buffered by changes in the cloud base height. These results show the importance of accurate estimates of heat and moisture released by fires for predicting pyroCb development. Encouragingly, a reliable estimate of the total heat flux might be sufficient to characterize the behavior of pyroCbs, reducing the need for detailed partitioning of sensible and latent heat."

 Global warming intensifies wildfires and exacerbates greenhouse gas and pollutant emissions1. However, global projections remain incomplete, hindering effective policy interventions amid uncertain warming futures2. Here, we developed an interpretable machine learning framework to project global burned areas and wildfire emissions. This framework accounts for the impacts of future climate change on fire activity and quantifies associated premature deaths and radiative forcing from fire-induced particulate matter (PM2.5). Here we show that from 2010–2014 to 2095–2099, fire carbon emissions are projected to increase by 23% under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 2-4.5. Increased fire-related aerosols reduce the 0.06 W m⁻² cooling effect north of 60°N. Projections show a surge in premature deaths from wildfire smoke, reaching 1.40 (95% Confidence Interval: 0.66–2.25) million annually during 2095–2099, roughly 6 times higher than current levels. Africa is projected to experience the greatest rise in fire-related deaths (11-fold), driven by emission changes and an aging population. Europe and the U.S. would experience a 1–2-fold increase under SSP2-4.5, linked to rising fire occurrences in the mid-latitude Northern Hemisphere. Overall, the health burden would become more evenly distributed across nations of differing development levels than present patterns, underscoring the need for coordinated efforts."

 Wildfire activity has increased in the US and is projected to accelerate under future climate change 1–3. However, our understanding of the impacts of climate change on wildfire activity, smoke, and health outcomes remains highly uncertain, due to the difficulty of modeling the causal chain from climate to wildfire to air pollution and health. Here we quantify the mortality burden in the US due to wildfire smoke fine particulate matter (PM2.5) under climate change. We construct an ensemble of statistical and machine learning models that link climate to wildfire smoke PM2.5, and empirically estimate smoke PM2.5-mortality relationships using data on all recorded deaths in the US. We project that smoke PM2.5 could result in 71,420 excess deaths (95% CI: 34,930 - 98,430) per year by 2050 under a high warming scenario (SSP3-7.0) – a 73% increase relative to estimated 2011-2020 average annual excess deaths from smoke. Cumulative excess deaths from smoke PM2.5 could reach 1.9 million between 2026-2055. We find evidence for mortality impacts of smoke PM2.5 that last up to three years after exposure. When monetized, climate-driven smoke deaths result in economic damages that exceed existing estimates of climate-driven damages from all other causes combined in the US 4,5. Our research suggests that the health impacts of climate-driven wildfire smoke could be among the most important and costly consequences of a warming climate in the US."

 Atmospheric particulate matter (PM), recognized as a key constituent of airborne pollutants, is directly or indirectly related to public health. The impact of PM2.5 on health is particularly serious and has received increasing attention. In this study, using the epidemiology-based health risk assessment model, we investigated the spatial-temporal characteristics of PM2.5 concentrations and the health burden attributable to short-term PM2.5 exposure across the country from 2017 to 2023 based on the ChinaHighPM2.5 dataset, the national high-resolution population distribution data and population mortality data. The results revealed a marked downward trajectory in PM2.5 levels in China between 2017 and 2023, with concentrations peaking during winter months and reaching annual minima in summer seasons. The population proportion with annual mean PM2.5 exposure concentrations below 15 μg/m3 demonstrated a significant increase from 0.06 % to 2.03 %, while the proportion exceeding 35 μg/m3 exhibited a significant reduction from 67.54 % to 33.30 %.

 The high PM2.5 concentrations significantly influence the air quality in the Maritime Continent region, especially in Peninsular Malaysia (PMY), which is affected by the annual burning season. However, the 2019 pollution case is unique due to the presence of a positive Indian Ocean dipole (pIOD) with a weak El Niño, which influenced the transport of pollutants toward PMY. This work aims to evaluate the ability of the numerical chemical weather prediction model (WRF-CMAQ) by performing a sensitivity analysis to reproduce the air quality during this event. Two model settings were studied: weather nudging and the burning emission amount of the fire inventory from NCAR (FINN). Three cases were established: 1) WRF-CMAQw (without nudging setting and with original fire emission), 2) WRF-CMAQn (with nudging setting and with original fire emission), and 3) WRF-CMAQa (with nudging setting and adjusted fire emission) to predict the PM2.5 concentration in PMY during the 2019 transboundary smoke event. The weather (temperature and wind profile) simulation results showed that WRF-CMAQa and WRF-CMAQn agreed up about 95 % and WRF-CMAQw agreed up to 93 % when compared with ground weather stations based on the statistical evaluation of correlation coefficient, bias, and error measures. For air quality, overall, WRF-CMAQa (87.23 %) demonstrated better performance compared to WRF-CMAQw (62.41 %) and WRF-CMAQn (78.72 %) in predicting the ground PM2.5. However, the diurnal prediction during the transboundary smoke event remains weak. For O3 concentration, the model performance agreement was quite low for all simulations. However, WRF-CMAQa could predict about 44.76 % compared to WRF-CMAQn (26.66 %) and WRF-CMAQw (41.90 %) in overall model performance, and all simulations managed to capture the diurnal trend of O3 when compared with ground observation station data. In conclusion, the sensitivity study on the weather and chemical prediction model, especially WRF-CMAQ, could help improve the air quality prediction system in PMY during the recurrence of transboundary smoke events."

Outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) is a critical component of the Earth’s energy budget, and the balance between absorbed solar radiation and OLR determines the net gain of energy of the entire climate system. Radiation computations using 43 years of ERA5 reanalysis profiles show an increase in clear-sky OLR in the polar regions and a decrease in the tropics. To understand this contrast, we analyze zonal- and annual-mean clear-sky OLR changes in the Northern Hemisphere from 1979 to 2021. We identify a transition in temporal clear-sky OLR changes from low to high latitudes, with a “crossover” point where the sign changes around 30°N. We improve upon previous studies by employing infrared spectrally-detailed line-by-line radiative transfer calculations, to decompose zonal-mean trends caused by forcing and feedback mechanisms. Our diagnostic investigation shows that the increase in water vapor exerts a dominant negative contribution to the OLR temporal change in the tropics due to a larger OLR sensitivity to water vapor increase there, while the increase in surface temperature (Ts) dominates the positive temporal change in the Arctic, both due to Arctic amplification and a larger OLR sensitivity to Ts increase. Greater greenhouse gases’ forcings and smaller OLR sensitivity to Ts change in the tropics, as well as an imperfect cancellation between atmospheric temperature and water vapor contribution, delineates the crossover point at around 30°N."

Here, we combined multi-model ensemble simulations from multiple Earth system models with different anthropogenic emission scenarios and the latest information from 14 072 solar plants in China to evaluate the impact of aerosol pollution on solar energy. Our results show that aerosol pollution mitigation can improve solar PV generation in China. Compared with preindustrial anthropogenic emission levels, aerosol pollution may reduce annual mean solar PV power generation by up to 48.13 TWh across the 14 072 solar plants in China. Notably, even low pollution levels can cause substantial generation losses in northwestern China because of their extensive installed capacity. Moreover, negative effects of aerosol pollution on solar energy will exist in the future. Our study highlights the importance of aerosol pollution mitigation for enhanced renewable energy in China."

Brennan;Lena Wilhelm,Saharan dust linked to European hail events,"In this study, we discovered that natural dust carried into Europe significantly increases the likelihood of hailstorms. By analyzing dust data, weather records, and hail reports, we found that moderate dust levels lead to more frequent hail, while very high or low dust amounts reduce it. Adding dust information into statistical models improved forecasting skills. 
 Saharan dust significantly influences hail occurrence in Europe. Using Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and reanalysis data, crowd-sourced hail reports, lightning data, and radar measurements, we find a strong correlation between elevated dust loading and hail events. Hail coverage exceeding 28 % of 1° × 1° grid cells only occurs when dust loading surpasses 2.4 mg m−2, while on hail days the median dust load is 1.82 times higher than on non-hail days (7σ difference). This effect is particularly strong along the Alpine crest, central France, eastern Germany, Austria, and Eastern Europe, where median dust loads more than double on hail days.By grouping data according to synoptic weather patterns, we confirm that hail days consistently exhibit higher dust concentrations regardless of prevailing synoptic conditions, supporting the robust link between dust and hail. Peak hail activity occurs at 38 mg m−2 or a dust optical depth of 0.033, suggesting enhanced cloud and ice nucleation. Above this range, hail frequency declines, likely due to microphysical or radiative constraints.Crowd-sourced reports show significantly more hail events on high-dust days, with up to 10 times more reports for hail >20 mm. Statistical hail models, including a logistic regression model (LRM) and a generalized additive model (GAM), rank dust as one of the top three predictors. Its inclusion increases the critical success index (CSI) by 5 % (LRM) and 12 % (GAM), and boosts explained variance in the GAM by 6 %. These findings identify Saharan dust as a key modulator of European hail activity, exerting both enhancing and inhibiting effects depending on dust concentration and the definition of hail events."

We measured SOA yields of seven alkanes and their oxygenated derivatives in oxidation flow reactor (OFR) measurements to assess their role in SOA formation. In addition, we observed that cyclic structure enhances SOA production. Furthermore, our observations indicate that multi-generational hydroxyl radical (OH) oxidation is important in the SOA formation. 
 Alkanes are hydrocarbons that are emitted into the atmosphere mainly by human activities such as combustion processes and via the use of volatile chemical products (VCPs). They are an important group of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can produce secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in the atmosphere via hydroxyl (OH) radical initiated reactions. For many other compound groups (e.g., aromatics and monoterpenes), highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) formed via autoxidation have been shown to be an important link between VOCs and SOA. Although alkane SOA has been intensively studied over the last decades, the importance of autoxidation and HOM in this system has received limited attention. The first HOM observations were only recently reported, but their relation so SOA has not been directly studied. Here, we show results of SOA yields from seven C10 alkanes and their oxygenated derivatives in oxidation flow reactor experiments. We observe the well-known behaviour of increased SOA yield with different structure in the order of cyclic > linear > branched. We also measured HOMs, and all seven SOA precursors produced detectable amounts of products, but HOM quantification was not possible due to the experimental setup configuration focusing on SOA formation. However, a comparison to previously reported HOM yields for the same precursors was conducted, indicating a correlation between HOM and SOA yields. Although not quantifiable, our own HOM observations did indicate that multi-generation OH oxidation played an important role in the SOA formation in our study."

By using long-term weather data and testing with global observation stations, the new method significantly improves accuracy compared to traditional approaches. This can benefit applications such as precise positioning and weather monitoring using navigation satellite signals. 
 Grid-wise Vienna Mapping Functions 1 (VMF1) and Vienna Mapping Functions 3 (VMF3) tropospheric products are widely used to interpolate the a priori zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD) and zenith wet delay (ZWD) over GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite Systems) stations for the mitigation of tropospheric delays contained in GNSS observations. Since these two products provide ZHD and ZWD values only for the ground surface at global grid points, the ZHD and ZWD at the four grid points nearest to a GNSS site used to interpolate for the GNSS site need to be reduced to the same height of the GNSS station before a horizontal interpolation (e.g., bilinear interpolation) is implemented. However, the accuracy of the officially recommended reduction model may not be as good as desired, especially in the case that the height of the GNSS site largely differs from that of the four ground grid points. To address this, a new vertical reduction model for reducing the ZHD and ZWD at the height of grid points to a target height was developed. The sample data for the modelling were the 10-year (2010–2019) ZHD and ZWD profiles over grid points obtained from ERA5 monthly averaged reanalysis data, while the 3-year (2020–2022) radiosonde profiles and the IGS (International GNSS Service) site-wise zenith tropospheric delay (ZTD) products were used to evaluate the new model. Results demonstrated that the accuracy of ZHD, ZWD, and consequently ZTD values interpolated from VMF1/VMF3 products and the new model considerably improved compared to traditional methods, especially at the target sites that have large height differences from its closest VMF grid points. This improvement has significance for those applications that need to use tropospheric delay corrections, e.g. in GNSS positioning and GNSS meteorology for a desired accuracy."

Satellite data show the presence of a transient ozone depletion event related to the water vapor anomalies and sulfate aerosol clouds. Ozone reduction was confined to two distinct layers. On 21 January, the fifth percentile of total and stratospheric column ozone anomalies reached −18.6 and −14.5 DU, respectively. 
 On 15 January 2022, the Hunga volcano (20.5° S, 175.4° E) erupted, releasing significant amounts of water vapor (H2O) and a moderate quantity of sulfur dioxide into the stratosphere. The resulting volcanic plume traveled westward with the southern hemispheric stratospheric circulation, reaching the Indian Ocean and Réunion (21.1° S, 55.5° E) within days. This study presents the first analysis of Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) ozone data to investigate the impact of the Hunga eruption, and also incorporates Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) and Ozone Mapping and Profiler Suite Limb Profiler (OMPS-LP) data, as well as ground-based measurements from Réunion. IASI observations revealed a transient ozone depletion event in the first week following the eruption. OMPS-LP aerosol extinction profiles, sun-photometer measurements, and lidar observations characterized the plume's vertical and latitudinal extent, showing its presence over Réunion at altitudes ranging from 26.8 to 29.7 km and its spread across more than 30° longitude and 20° latitude by 21 January. IASI ozone spatial distributions showed marked decreases in total and stratospheric ozone on that date, with the fifth percentile of the anomaly reaching −18.6 DU for total column ozone and −14.5 DU for stratospheric column ozone. A key finding, as shown by MLS profiles, is that the ozone reduction was confined to two separate layers (-0.7±(1σ) 0.6 ppmv in the 14.68–12.12 hPa range, and -0.6±(1σ) 0.5 ppmv in the 31.62–21.54 hPa range), each associated with a distinct aerosol cloud with excess H2O. This layered structure of ozone loss offers new insight into the chemical and radiative effects of the Hunga plume on stratospheric ozone."

Without ARIs, added aerosols do not significantly affect precipitation due to cloud competition for moisture. ARIs can stabilize or enhance convection. High aerosol levels lead to a combined ARI and ACI effect that greatly reduces precipitation. 
 Atmospheric aerosols influence clouds and precipitation by aerosol–radiation interactions (ARIs) and aerosol–cloud interactions (ACIs). In this study, the synergetic effect of ARIs and ACIs on the development and precipitation of a mesoscale convective system (MCS) that occurred in the Guanzhong Basin (GZB) of central China have been examined using a cloud-resolving fully coupled weather research and forecasting model with chemistry (WRF-Chem). The model reasonably reproduces the temporal variation and spatial distribution of air pollutants, the hourly rain rate, and daily precipitation distribution against observations in the GZB. Sensitivity simulations are conducted under different aerosol scenarios by adjusting the anthropogenic emissions. When the ARI effect is not considered, the daily precipitation does not show an increasing trend with increasing aerosols in the GZB. This primarily reflects the effects of ACIs due to competition among convective clouds to available water vapor in the development of the MCS. ARIs exert two opposite effects on convection: a stabilizing effect to suppress convection and a lifting effect to foster convection, which counteract each other. When the lifting effect outweighs stabilizing effect, the updraft is enhanced, which increases precipitation in the GZB. However, the synergetic effect of ARIs and ACIs significantly suppress precipitation when the particulate-matter (PM) pollution is severe. Note that the synergetic effect consistently decreases the precipitation in the whole domain with increasing aerosols, but ARIs play a more important role in the decreasing trend of the precipitation with deterioration of PM pollution."

 North Africa, the largest and most active dust source region globally, plays a critical role in the Earth's environment by dispersing dust over remote areas, especially in terms of circum-global transport that has occurred many times since the start of the 21st century. As a key indicator of the thermodynamic structure and dynamical circulation of the troposphere, the land–sea thermal contrast (LSC) can influence the variability in dust and subsequent large-scale propagation, but the extent of such influence is still unknown. This study reveals that in around the late 1990s, the influence of pre-winter LSC on the spring dust transport pathway was reversed in North Africa, which is attributed to the bridging effect of the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Before 2000, the warm land–cold ocean (+WLCO) pattern in pre-winter was typically associated with the NAO+ mode, and the anomalous northeasterly and zonal circulation in the following spring facilitated the westward transport of dust from the lower troposphere in western North Africa towards the Atlantic. Since 2000, the reversed zonal temperature pattern (−WLCO) has led to the NAO− mode and enhanced mid-latitude westerlies in winter, which has persisted into the next spring. Under conditions of unusually dry soil and strong dry convection, dust has been mixed into the middle to upper troposphere and subsequently transported eastward globally, affecting regions including West Asia, northern China, the Pacific, and southeastern North America after 2000. This study underscores the critical role of sea–land–atmosphere interaction in circum-global dust propagation and offers new perspectives for investigating dust change mechanisms in the context of climate change."

Aerosols influencing cloud droplets or influencing ice formation yield varying radiative effects. We introduce fingerprint metrics to discern these effects. Using detailed observations and modelling, we offer insights into high-cloud radiative effects and feedbacks. 
 Improved understanding of anvil cloud radiative effect (CRE) and feedback is critical for reducing uncertainty in climate projections, with recent research highlighting cloud microphysics and anvil albedo as requiring further investigation. In this study, we use nine observation-informed model experiments to simulate a 24 d period from the Deep Convective Microphysics Experiment (DCMEX), with our analysis quantifying the influence of cloud microphysics on high-cloud albedo. We find that increasing cloud droplet number (2×) or ice-nucleating particles (INPs) (∼10×), within the range of observed variability, significantly increased high-cloud albedo by 1 %–3 % (p value <0.05). To isolate the microphysical drivers of albedo changes, we introduce fingerprint metrics based on an ice water path (IWP) threshold, distinguishing between thick and thin high clouds. We find that increased droplet number enhances albedo in both thick and thin clouds, while higher INP concentrations primarily affect thick cloud albedo. These fingerprints offer a novel approach for elucidating causes of variability in high-cloud albedo in both models and observations. Future work should explore how the fingerprints translate across different high-cloud regimes and global climate context. Beyond direct microphysical influences, we also identify strong correlations between albedo and large-scale environmental factors such as relative humidity, thereby motivating future investigation of anvil albedo feedback using cloud controlling factor analysis. Our study highlights both the large-scale environment and microphysical processes as important for accurate prediction of CREs and feedbacks in climate models."

We examine how much can be learned about processes from snapshots using examples from cloud and atmospheric physics. We couch the analysis in terms of the theory of ergodic systems, space-time-exchange, and the Deborah number – concepts that are commonly applied in other branches of physics. We discuss the reasons for the varying degrees of success. 
 The cloudy atmospheric boundary layer is a complex, open, dynamical system that is difficult to fully characterize through observations. Aircraft measurements provide cloud dynamical, thermodynamical, and microphysical properties along a flightpath, at high spatial/temporal resolution (order 10 m/0.1 s). These data are essentially contiguous “snapshots” in time of the state of the cloud and its environment. Polar-orbiting satellite-based remote sensing yields snapshots of retrieved cloud and aerosol properties once or twice a day at spatial scales on the order of 250 m, but these are usually averaged to scales of ≈20–100 km to reduce data variability. Neither approach tracks a parcel of air in time, a view that would yield more direct insights into the evolving system.  Nevertheless, our long experience with aircraft and satellite-based remote sensing has taught us much about atmospheric processes, suggesting that one can gain insights into processes from these snapshots. Using mostly previously published work we present examples of collections of observation snapshots that reveal various degrees of process-level understanding. We couch the discussion in terms of the concepts of space-time exchange, ergodicity, and process vs. observation timescales. It is our hope that this paper will encourage the atmospheric sciences community to explore the value of these concepts more deeply."

In this paper, we introduce MetFluxNet, a deep learning model for methane plume source rate estimation. This model is trained on a new synthetic dataset designed to avoid network overfit. MetFluxNet can accurately estimate low source rates even in the case of heterogeneous backgrounds. To demonstrate its reliability for real-world plume estimation, we validated its predictions on real plumes with known source rates. 
 Reducing methane emissions from human activities is essential to tackle climate change. To monitor these emissions, we rely on satellite observations, which enable regular, global-scale tracking. Methane emissions are typically quantified by their source rate – the mass of gas emitted per unit of time. Our goal here is to estimate the emission source rate of methane plumes detected by hyperspectral imagers such as PRISMA or EnMAP. For this task, we generated a large synthetic dataset using large eddy simulation (LES) to train a deep learning model. This dataset was specifically designed to avoid network overfitting with careful plume temporal sampling and plume scaling. Our deep learning network, MetFluxNet, does not require any wind information or a plume mask. Moreover, it accurately predicts the source rate even in the presence of false positives. MetFluxNet performs well on our dataset with a mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 8.3 % over a wide range of source rates from 500 to 25 000 kg h−1. Notably, it remains effective at lower source rates, where background noise is typically high. To validate its real-world applicability, we tested MetFluxNet on real plumes with known ground-truth fluxes. The predicted source rates fell systematically within the 95 % confidence intervals, demonstrating its reliability for real-world plume estimation. Finally, in a comparison with recent state-of-the-art methods, MetFluxNet outperformed the deep learning-based S2MetNet and the physics-based integrated mass enhancement (IME) method."

This dataset offers improved accuracy and detail compared to earlier versions, meeting high international standards for climate data. By refining how measurement errors are calculated and reduced over time and space, we provide clearer insights into pollution patterns. This work supports better air quality monitoring and informs actions to address pollution globally. 
 We introduce the new ESA Climate Change Initiative TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) global monthly clear-sky Level 3 (L3) dataset of tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) for May 2018 to December 2021. The dataset provides spatiotemporally averaged tropospheric NO2 columns, associated averaging kernels, and L3 uncertainties at spatial resolutions of 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0° on a monthly timescale (https://doi.org/10.21944/CCI-NO2-TROPOMI-L3, KNMI, 2025). To improve our understanding of what fraction of the Level 2 (L2) uncertainty cancels when averaging over space or time (i.e. the random component of the L2 uncertainty) and what fraction persists despite the averaging (systematic component), we first determine spatial and temporal error correlations for all sources of uncertainty in the L2 retrieval. Spatial error correlations arise mainly from the stratosphere–troposphere correction and from coarse-gridded albedo climatologies used in the L2 air mass factor calculation and have been quantified in previous studies. We find the temporal error correlation in both the stratospheric uncertainty and the air mass factor uncertainty to be 30 %. Using these estimates, the L3 uncertainty budget has been established for every grid cell based on input L2 uncertainties and new methods to estimate spatial and temporal representativeness uncertainties and to propagate measurement uncertainties through space and time. The total relative uncertainty in the resulting L3 dataset is in the range of 15 %–20 % in polluted areas, which is significantly lower than in individual L2 orbit retrievals, and brings the tropospheric NO2 data to within the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) “goal” and “breakthrough” requirements. Validation of the tropospheric, stratospheric, and total columns confirms better correlation and reduced dispersion in the differences between satellite and ground-based reference data for the L3 data with respect to the underlying L2, albeit with a more pronounced negative bias in the tropospheric columns at pollution hot spots, most probably related to stronger spatial smearing."

Isoprene is a key biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emitted by select plants, which can impact atmospheric chemistry and climate. Increased temperatures, particularly in high latitudes, may enhance isoprene emissions due to extended growing seasons and heightened plant stress. The research was conducted in Finse, Norway, where isoprene and CO2 fluxes were measured with eddy covariance alongside spectral and meteorological data, and surface temperature. A random forest (RF) model was developed to predict isoprene fluxes, considering the variable importance of different environmental factors. The results showed that surface temperature and CO2 flux were consistently important predictors, across three differential temporal data aggregations (hourly, daily, weekly), while the PRI demonstrated low predictive power, possibly due to the heterogeneous vegetation and variable light conditions. The NDVI was more effective than anticipated, likely linked to phenological changes in vegetation. Model performance varied with temporal resolution, with weekly data achieving the highest predictive accuracy (R2 up to 0.76). The RF model accurately reflected seasonal emission patterns but underestimated short-term peaks, suggesting the potential to combine machine learning with process-based modelling. This research highlights the promise of proxy data from remote sensing for scaling BVOC emission models to regional levels, essential for understanding climate impacts in Arctic ecosystems."

The evaluation results show that the CDR has long-term consistency and continuity, and is more accurate than other similar products in climate covariability, suggesting that the CDR is suitable for climate change research and for constraining climate model simulations. 
 We developed a climate data record (CDR) of atmospheric column water vapor (CWV) and sea surface temperature (SST) under oceanic rain-free conditions using over two decades of observational records from three satellite instruments: the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer for Earth Observing System (AMSR-E), the MicroWave Radiation Imager (MWRI), and the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-2 (AMSR2). The AMSR-E and AMSR2 satellites operated in near-stable orbits, while the MWRI experienced orbital drifts of nearly 1 h during its operational period. The CWV and SST products were retrieved from well-recalibrated level-1 brightness temperatures observed by common channels with the same frequencies on these instruments, designed for measuring these properties. Adjustments for diurnal drifting errors caused by orbital drift were applied to MWRI data using a semi-physical model developed in previous studies. The combination of prior recalibration and diurnal drift adjustment ensured inter-satellite consistency in the CDRs. Compared to in-situ radiosonde and buoy observations, the biases and root mean square errors of the CDRs are within 0.1 and 4.4 mm for CWV, and 0.2 and 1.6 K for SST, respectively. Long-term trends of the retrieved CWV and SST align with observations from the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) and the Global Tropical Moored Buoy Array (GTMBA) products. The global oceanic trends of CWV and SST were 0.39 mm per decade and 0.16 K per decade, respectively, over the period 2002–2022. Inter-consistency between CWV and SST, as well as layer-mean temperatures derived from satellite microwave sounder observations, was examined and compared with climate model simulations from phase 6 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6). It was found that the trend ratio of the retrieved CWV to SST was 9.9 % K−1 in the tropics, which closely aligns with CMIP6 models. These validation results indicate that the presented CDR has high accuracy and is suitable for long-term climate change research. The CDR dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14539414 (Fu et al., 2024)."

Here the authors show that these fires delay the formation of snow cover in the Arctic, which will be exacerbated under future warming due to increases in burned areas. 
 Wildland fires in seasonally snow-covered areas can have lasting effects on both the snowpack and carbon stocks. Here, using long-term satellite data, we show that from 1982 to 2018, the burned area in the Arctic has significantly increased, while the duration of snow cover has significantly decreased. An XGBoost machine learning model and causal analysis confirmed the role of wildland fires in delaying snow cover formation, with this effect strongly linked to fire-induced reductions in albedo and increases in temperature. In addition, we observed a delay of more than 5 days in snow cover formation following major wildland fires. Looking ahead, our projections under a high-emissions scenario (Shared Socioeconomic Pathway, SSP 5-8.5) indicate that the burned area could increase by a factor of 2.6 and the annual mean snow cover duration could decrease by nearly 18 days between 2015 and 2100 compared with the historical average. Wildland fires are becoming more frequent in high-latitude regions.

Ryan;Lilani Toms-Hardman;Alexander Smirnov;Daniel P. Harrison;Robyn Schofield,Measurement report: Aerosol vertical profiling  over the Southern Great Barrier Reef using lidar  and MAX-DOAS measurements,"Measurements of aerosol vertical distribution are key for understanding how they interact with clouds and sunlight. Such measurements are currently lacking at the Great Barrier Reef, limiting our ability to validate climate models in this sensitive, ecologically rich environment. Here we use a range of techniques to quantify the vertical variation of aerosols above the Great Barrier Reef for the first time, using the comparison of techniques to also infer aerosol spatial variation. 
 Aerosol vertical profile measurements were made using a Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectrometer (MAX-DOAS) and Mini Micro Pulse Lidar (MPL) at One Tree Island in the Southern Great Barrier Reef from February to April 2023. This is an understudied location in terms of atmospheric aerosols and chemistry but is growing in importance as multiple research streams examine the influence of aerosols on radiation over the Great Barrier Reef. Solar radiation management proposals, such as marine cloud brightening, require regional-scale aerosol modelling, which is evaluated against aerosol extinction and optical depth measurements, necessitating a thorough understanding of measurements of these quantities. MPL aerosol retrieval showed extinction-to-backscatter ratios (0.031 on average) and depolarization ratios (0.015 on average) consistent with clean, unpolluted southern hemispheric marine aerosol. The maximum depolarization ratio tended to be above the layer of maximum MPL backscatter, consistent with dried sea salt layers above the boundary layer. MAX-DOAS and MPL extinction profiles show aerosol layers extending beyond 2 km altitude in the morning and to around 1 km in the afternoon. We run the MAX-DOAS retrieval at 360 and 477 nm simultaneously, using the Retrieval of Atmospheric Parameters from Spectroscopic Observations using DOAS Instruments (RAPSODI) algorithm, finding that this gives much better agreement with the vertically resolved diurnal cycle of aerosol extinction from the MPL. We also compared aerosol optical depth measurements from integrated MAX-DOAS and MPL extinction profiles, with observations from a hand-held Microtops sun photometer. Mean aerosol optical depth (AOD) values across the campaign compare well, being 0.084 ± 0.003 for the Microtops, 0.090 ± 0.040 for the MAX-DOAS and 0.091 ± 0.025 for the MPL (smoothed to match the MAX-DOAS vertical sensitivity). The diurnal cycles of the smoothed MPL and the MAX-DOAS AOD agreed within uncertainty in most hours of the day, showing a morning peak and afternoon minimum in boundary layer aerosol amount. These measurements show that even in this challenging environment with frequent occurrences of low marine clouds and high humidity, MAX-DOAS (with dual-wavelength retrieval) and MPL provide robust methods for probing aerosol vertical distributions and optical depth in the lower troposphere."

Our observations in Japan revealed that both mineral dust and anthropogenic aerosols are significant sources of dissolved Fe, and that atmospheric chemical weathering enhances their solubility. This finding is expected to play a crucial role in estimating the supply of dissolved iron to the ocean. 
 The deposition of dissolved iron (d-Fe) from East Asian aerosols to the North Pacific Ocean modulates primary productivity in surface seawaters, facilitating uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide by the ocean, thereby affecting the global climate. Given that microorganisms in surface seawater utilize d-Fe as a micronutrient, the bioavailability of aerosol Fe depends on its fractional solubility (Fesol%). Although emission sources and atmospheric processing influence Fesol%, their effects on Fesol% are incompletely understood. We assessed the factors controlling Fesol% in size-fractionated aerosol particles collected along the coast of the Sea of Japan over one year (July 2019–June 2020). Approximately 70 % of d-Fe in East Asian aerosols was present in fine aerosol particles (< 1.3 µm), with Fesol% ranging from 4.1 % to 94.9 %. Anthro-Fe accounted for approximately 50 % of d-Fe in fine aerosol particles during pre- and post-lockdown of COVID-19, but its contribution was negligible during the COVID-19 lockdown period. Fesol% in fine aerosol particles was correlated with the abundance of water-soluble Fe species (Fe-sulfates and Fe-oxalate). These water-soluble Fe species were detected in mineral dust and anthropogenic aerosols in fine aerosol particles. Dissolution models optimized for Fe in mineral dust and anthropogenic aerosols demonstrated that Fe in both aerosols dissolved through proton-promoted dissolution under acidic conditions (pH < 2.0). Subsequently, d-Fe dissolved from aerosols was stabilized by the formation of Fe(III)-oxalate in the aqueous phase. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of the chemical alteration processes of East Asian aerosols is essential for accurately quantifying their Fesol% upon transport to the North Pacific."

Sedlacek III,Aerosol hygroscopicity over the South-East Atlantic Ocean during the biomass burning season –  Part 2: Influence of sea salt and burning conditions on CCN hygroscopicity,"We studied aerosols over a remote island in the Atlantic Ocean to understand how they affect cloud formation. By analyzing data from two fire seasons, we found that changes in sea salt and smoke from fires strongly influenced how easily these particles form cloud droplets. In 2017, sea salt increased due to weather changes, making the particles more water-attracting. This helps us understand how natural and human activities impact clouds and climate. 
 Biomass burning (BB) significantly influences cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations over the southeastern Atlantic; however, aerosol hygroscopicity (κ) – a key factor for CCN activation – remains poorly constrained during the BB season. This study investigates κ variability using in situ measurements from Ascension Island during the 2016 and 2017 BB seasons. Results show substantial monthly variability, with κ values lowest in August and increasing through October. On average, κ was significantly higher in 2017 (∼ 0.55) than in 2016 (∼ 0.33), suggesting that the aerosols in 2017 were more hygroscopic and more easily activated as CCN. Sulfate and sea salt were the two dominant contributors to κ and the primary drivers of its interannual variability. During the 2017 BB season, sulfate – the major inorganic component – accounted for ∼ 34 % of the submicron aerosol mass, while sea salt, estimated via κ-closure analysis, contributed ∼ 17 %. The higher κ in 2017 was largely attributed to increased sea salt, likely driven by stronger marine winds. Approximately 67 % of sulfate was linked to BB emissions. Variations in BB combustion efficiency, modulated by regional meteorology, influenced sulfate fraction and thus κ values. Specifically, higher relative humidity and lower wind speeds over BB source regions in 2017 favored smoldering combustion, explaining the higher sulfate fraction. Overall, the observed interannual differences in aerosol hygroscopicity reflect the combined impacts of BB combustion characteristics and sea salt emissions, underscoring the critical roles of both BB and marine aerosol sources in regulating aerosol-cloud interactions over the southeastern Atlantic."

Reduced surface moisture leads to more energy being converted into sensible heat instead of evaporating as latent heat, which raises near-surface temperatures in Australia. Our findings offer insights for managing drought and wildfire risks in Australia. 
 A substantial decline in anthropogenic aerosols in China has been observed since the initiation of clean air actions in 2013. This study reveals a linkage between aerosol reductions in China and drier and warmer conditions in Australia. Aerosol decline in China trigger alterations in temperature and pressure gradients between the two hemispheres, leading to intensified outflow from Asia towards the South Indian Ocean, strengthening the Southern Indian Subtropical High and its related Southern Trade Winds. Consequently, this atmospheric pattern results in a moisture divergence over Australia. The reduction in surface moisture further results in more surface energy being converted into sensible heat instead of evaporating as latent heat, warming the near-surface air. The intensified dry and warm climate conditions further cause the increase in wildfire risks during fire seasons in Australia. Our study illuminates the potential impact of distant aerosols on precipitation and temperature variations in Australia, offering valuable insights for drought and wildfire risk mitigation in Australia."

Using lab-based simulations, we examined these reactions and measured particle formation and by-products. Our findings reveal that α- and β-phellandrenes are efficient particle sources and enhance our understanding of biogenic–anthropogenic interactions and their contributions to atmospheric changes affecting climate and health. 
 Nighttime NO3-initiated oxidation of monoterpenes plays a crucial role as source of organic nitrates (ONs) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA), impacting climate, air quality, and human health. Nevertheless, monoterpene reactions with NO3 remain poorly understood. This study provides an in-depth investigation of the NO3-initiated oxidation of α- and β-phellandrenes through simulation chamber experiments and a combination of various analytical techniques (FTIR, PTR-ToF-MS, ACSM, nitrate-CI-APi-ToF-MS, Orbitrap, SMPS). SOA yields were measured, and oxidation products, including highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs), were investigated in gas and aerosol phases. Numerical simulations were also performed to investigate the dominant chemical regimes for RO2 radicals. We found that α- and β-phellandrenes are efficient SOA precursors with yields reaching up to 35 % and 60 %, respectively, with β-phellandrene generating significantly more SOA than α-phellandrene. Both monoterpenes produce large quantities of ONs in gas and aerosol phases with total molar yields of 40 %–60 %. Similar gas-phase products were detected for α- and β-phellandrenes. In particular, carbonyl nitrates, dicarbonyl nitrates, and dicarbonyls were detected as first-generation products. Autooxidation processes were also shown to occur with numerous gas-phase HOM monomers and dimers detected. Chemical mechanisms have been proposed to explain the formation of the detected products. Since gas-phase products were similar for both monoterpenes, they do not explain the differences in SOA yields. However, some differences in aerosol-phase composition were observed, which may explain why β-phellandrene is a more efficient SOA precursor. This study is the first mechanistic investigation of the reactions of α- and β-phellandrenes with the NO3 radical."

And light absorption of oxygenated brown carbon (BrC) increases significantly with aging, but hydrocarbon-like BrC decreases over time. These results emphasize the necessity to classify BrC into different groups based on their mass absorption efficiency and atmospheric behavior in climate models. 
 Atmospheric brown carbon (BrC) plays a significant role in global warming, yet the evolution of its optical properties during aging remains poorly understood, leading to substantial uncertainties in its climate effects. In this study, we investigate the aging process of BrC and its driving factors using laboratory-generated biomass burning emissions, including four types of straw and one type of wood. Upon OH oxidation, there exists a large increase in OA fraction after 2 d aging, followed by a minor increase during aging to 7 d. The particle growth is dominated by the change in OA content and thus shows a similar trend during aging. The mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of fresh BrC measured at 370 nm is 2.1–5.7 m2 g−1. A sharp decline in MAE is observed after 2 d aging, equally attributed to photobleaching and secondary organic aerosol formation. Although a negative correlation is observed between particle size and MAE, the reduction in MAE is mainly driven by the decline in the imaginary part (k) of BrC, with particle size playing a minor role. Combined with positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis, the study reveals that oxygenated OA, characterized by higher O / C ratios but lower MAE, increases significantly with aging. In contrast, two hydrocarbon-like OA factors with lower O / C ratios and higher MAE decrease over time. These results emphasize the importance of categorizing BrC based on its MAE and atmospheric behavior in climate models."

The total emission of fine, water-soluble BrCaq was approx. 1 g kg−1 of wood burned, comparable with the emission factors of some semi-volatile organics from open biomass burning. Potential precursors of aqueous secondary organic aerosols (aqSOAs) and toxic molecules were selected among the newly identified molecules.The newly identified harmful tracers of fine BrC included plant and wood care products, alkaloids, and fungal metabolites. Fungal metabolites were also identified among the potential precursors of aqSOAs with high Henry's law constant values, alongside natural compounds occurring in roots and leaves, diterpenoids, flavonoids, anthraquinones, and coumarins. The release of these natural and man-made compounds is possible during wildfires and domestic uses of biomass. The atmospheric lifetimes calculated for the newly identified precursors of aqSOAs showed that natural dyes, bacterial and fungal metabolites, and (aromatic) glucosides can undergo aqueous OH oxidation in cloud water. Such molecules can produce low-volatility products without decomposing due to their large carbon backbones. Many new potential chromophores were also identified in BrC, including natural dyes and molecules with conjugated double bonds and aromatic rings."

Hollowed;Christiane Jablonowski;Thomas Ehrmann;Diana Bull;Benjamin Wagman;Benjamin Hillman,Volcanic aerosol modification of the stratospheric circulation in E3SMv2 – Part 1: Wave–mean flow interaction,"Simulations of the 1991 Mt. Pinatubo eruption are used to study how radiative heating by volcanic aerosols alters stratospheric winds. We found that heating of the tropical stratosphere by volcanic aerosols drives increased wind speeds in the midlatitude vortex region. A theoretical framework is then used to identify the dynamical origin of these enhanced winds, which we find to be a combination of a strengthened global circulation and a modification of large-scale atmospheric waves. 
 Following tropical volcanic eruptions, westerly zonal-wind accelerations have been observed in the winter hemisphere polar vortex region. This wind response has been reproduced in some (but not all) simulated eruption studies. As the primary effect of volcanic aerosols during the initial post-eruption period is to heat the tropical stratosphere, the midlatitude zonal-wind response is often explained as a thermal wind effect. Several studies have shown that this explanation is insufficient in understanding the relative significance of the aerosol direct effect and indirect dynamical feedbacks. In this work, we use a Transformed Eulerian Mean (TEM) framework to identify the dynamical origins of stratospheric wind anomalies following the simulated 1991 eruption of Mt. Pinatubo. A paired set of volcanic and non-volcanic 15-member ensembles is used to isolate the volcanic impact. A TEM decomposition of the net zonal-wind forcing is then performed to close the differenced momentum budget between the two ensembles. Zonal-wind accelerations near 30–40° N and 3–30 hPa are identified with significance in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) during both the summer and winter. We find each of these seasonal acceleration episodes to have distinct dynamical drivers. In the summertime, the response is primarily governed by an accelerated meridional residual circulation. In the wintertime, the response is eddy-driven, where an equatorward deflection of planetary waves was robustly identified near 30N and 30 hPa. We additionally identified that a deficit of wave forcing in the tropical stratosphere dampens the amplitude of the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) for at least 2 years following the eruption."

Donovan;George Georgoussis;Tommaso Parrinello;Thorsten Fehr;Jonas von Bismarck;Vassilis Amiridis,Validation of the Aeolus L2A products with the eVe reference lidar measurements from the ASKOS/JATAC campaign,"This study presents the results from a validation study on the Level 2A products (aerosol optical properties) of the ESA's (European Space Agency) Aeolus mission. Measurements from the eVe lidar, a combined linear/circular polarization and Raman lidar and ESA's ground reference system, that have been collected during the Joint Aeolus Tropical Atlantic Campaign are compared with collocated Aeolus Level 2A profiles obtained from the latest version (Baseline 16) of the Aeolus algorithms. 
 Aeolus was an ESA Earth Explorer satellite mission launched in 2018 with a lifetime of almost five years. The mission carried the Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument (ALADIN), a Doppler wind lidar for providing wind profiles on global scale and also vertically resolved optical properties of particles (aerosols and clouds) using the high spectral resolution lidar technique. To validate the particles' optical properties obtained from Aeolus as Level 2A products, the eVe lidar, ESA's reference system for the calibration and validation of Aeolus mission, has been deployed at the ASKOS campaign in the framework of the Joint Aeolus Tropical Atlantic Campaign (JATAC). ASKOS is the ground-based component of JATAC where ground-based remote sensing and in-situ instrumentation for aerosols, clouds, winds and radiation observations has been deployed at Cado Verde during summer 2021 and 2022 for the validation of the Aeolus products. The eVe lidar is a combined linear/circular polarization and Raman lidar specifically designed to mimic the operation of Aeolus and provide ground-based reference measurements of the optical properties for aerosols and thin clouds. The eVe lidar measurements can be used for the validation of the Aeolus L2A products while taking into consideration the ALADIN's limitation of misdetection of the cross-polar component of the backscattered signal. As such, in this validation study the cloud-free Aeolus L2A profiles obtained from the Standard Correct Algorithm (SCA), the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and the AEL–PRO algorithms of Baseline 16 are compared against the corresponding cloud-free Aeolus-like profiles from eVe lidar, which are calculated using the retrieved particle circular depolarization ratio profile from eVe in order to account for the lack of the detection of the circular cross-polar backscatter component from Aeolus. The analysis focuses on the 14 collocated measurements between eVe and Aeolus during the nearest Aeolus overpass from the ASKOS site passing within a radius of 100 km from the site and within a temporal window of ± 1.5 h from the overpass time. The validation results reveal good performance for the co-polar particle backscatter coefficient, being the most accurate L2A product from Aeolus with absolute systematic and random errors up to 0.37 and 2 Mm−1 sr−1, respectively. The particle extinction coefficient also performs good with absolute systematic and random errors up to 53  and 183 Mm−1, respectively. The co-polar lidar ratio seems to be the noisiest L2A product with extreme error values and variability. The observed discrepancies between eVe and Aeolus L2A profiles increase at lower altitudes where higher atmospheric loads (molecules and aerosols) are encountered leading to increased noise levels in the Aeolus retrievals due to enhanced laser beam attenuation, and greater atmospheric variability (e.g. Planetary Boundary Layer inhomogeneities) are typically encountered. Overall, this study underlines the strengths of the optimal estimation algorithms (MLE and AEL–PRO) with consistent performance and reduced uncertainties, while the standard inversion algorithm (SCA), which was originally developed, could be further improved particularly in the retrieval of the particle extinction coefficient and lidar ratio. In addition, the SCAmid-bin resolution profiles outperform the corresponding SCAnormal-bin as expected, since mid-bin resolution is obtained when averaging the values from two consecutive SCAnormal height bins."

First, aerosol load retrieval performance is demonstrated based on realistic synthetic data. Second, the potential for aerosol type characterization is proven, with the estimation of fine mode fraction. This work opens pathways for the future study of diurnal aerosol variations from space thanks to the high temporal resolution of geostationary satellites. 
 Aerosols have significant effects on Earth, which vary according to the type of these atmospheric particles. Different observing systems exist today to monitor aerosols, mainly through the retrieval of aerosol optical depth (AOD), among which meteorological satellites in geostationary orbit provide unique information thanks to their acquisition of several Earth's images per hour. The third generation of European geostationary satellites, Meteosat Third Generation-Imager with the onboard Flexible Combined Imager (FCI) operational since December 2024, brings new possibilities for aerosol remote sensing compared to its predecessor, Meteosat Second Generation, with the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager (SEVIRI) on board. This article assesses the improvements in aerosol characterization that will be made possible thanks to FCI, based on realistically generated synthetic data that are processed by optimal estimation methods to quantify aerosol information content and to retrieve relevant aerosol properties. Two case studies corresponding to challenging aerosol retrieval situations are simulated, a dust outbreak in North Africa and the wildfire season in South West Africa. First, synthetic data are used to study the potential for AOD retrieval of new FCI spectral channels in comparison to SEVIRI's. Results prove that channel VIS04 (centered at 444 nm) is the best suited for this task, with a significant decrease in retrieval error (root square mean error by 23 % and mean bias error by 65 %) in comparison to AOD estimated from the SEVIRI-heritage channel VIS06 (centered at 640 nm). Second, the FCI capabilities to further characterize aerosol particles are investigated, with the joint retrieval of AOD and fine mode fraction (FMF), which is linked to particle size distribution and therefore aerosol type. This is achieved by exploiting near-infrared channel NIR22 (centered at 2250 nm, and found to be sensitive to coarse particles only in the first part of the study) in addition to channel VIS04. Experiments show that, except under certain unfavorable conditions, the joint retrieval of AOD and FMF is possible, even if fast but less accurate radiative transfer models are used, which could be employed in an operational setting. This article demonstrates the possibility of obtaining advanced high temporal frequency aerosol observations from FCI and opens pathways for the future study of aerosol diurnal variations from space."

Launched in August 2024, AWS features a 19-channel microwave cross-track radiometer. Notably, it introduces groundbreaking channels at 325.15 GHz. In addition, AWS acts as the stepping stone to a suggested constellation of satellites, denoted as EUMETSAT Polar System Sterna. 
 The Arctic Weather Satellite (AWS) is a project led by the European Space Agency (ESA) that has several novel aspects. From a technical perspective, it serves as a demonstrator of how to expand the network of operational satellite-based microwave sensors cost-effectively and acts as the proto-flight model for a suggested constellation of satellites, denoted as EUMETSAT Polar System (EPS) Sterna. The design philosophy has been to reduce complexity and instead focus the efforts on critical parts and characterise the instrument well before the launch. The single instrument onboard is a 19-channel microwave cross-track radiometer. There are 15 channels covering ranges around 54, 89 and 174 GHz. These are channels similar to ones found on existing sensors, however, thanks to the short development process, allowing use of more modern and recent technology, the performance and resolution of these channels on AWS exceed or match similar sensors, despite being a small satellite. Additionally, four channels around 325.15 GHz form a completely new frequency band for observations from space. The addition of these new channels aims to improve sensitivity to ice hydrometeors.In this article, we outline the mission and describe the instrument in detail, to support the usage of radiances measured by AWS. The satellite was launched in August 2024, and the status towards the end of the commissioning phase is reflected here. For example, a characterisation of the noise performance is provided, showing that the target specifications have been met, for most channels with a margin. This is except for two channels identified to have technical issues already before the launch. If EPS-Sterna is selected by EUMETSAT, these and other identified problems will be corrected, but otherwise the constellation is expected to consist of recurrent models of AWS with minor modifications."

Ott;Hartmut Bösch,Surface reflectance biases in XCH4 retrievals from the 2.3 µm band are enhanced in the presence of aerosols,"In space-based estimates of atmospheric methane concentrations, one can often observe biases that look like imprints of surface features. We performed realistic simulation experiments and find the root cause to be unaccounted aerosols. Since good knowledge of aerosols is difficult to achieve for operational science data processing, we conclude that a comprehensive surface bias correction scheme is highly important for missions utilizing the 2.3 µm spectral band for methane retrievals. 
 In this work, we present the results of an observing system simulation experiment (OSSE) in which we investigate the emergence of a surface-reflectance-dependent bias in retrieved column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of methane (XCH4). Our focus is on single-band retrievals in the shortwave infrared (SWIR) at 2.3 µm. This particular bias manifests as artificial gradients in XCH4 fields that relate to surface features on the ground and can, for example, cause erroneous estimates of methane source emission rates.We find that even for near-ideal conditions (that being a perfectly calibrated instrument, perfect knowledge of meteorology and trace gas vertical distributions, and an absence of clouds and aerosols) a surface-reflectance-related bias appears in the retrieved XCH4. While the magnitude of the bias is much lower than is observed in, for example, real data from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI), the overall qualitative shape is strikingly similar. When we study a more realistic scenario by considering synthetic measurements that are affected by aerosols, the surface bias increases in magnitude roughly by a factor of 10. We hold all other properties of the synthetic measurements fixed and thus can make the following statements about these surface biases from the 2.3 µm  absorption band. First, the bias already appears in the near-perfect scenario, meaning that its origin is likely fundamental to XCH4 retrievals from this particular absorption band and using an optimal-estimation-type retrieval approach. Second, the magnitude of the bias increases significantly when aerosols are encountered. As aerosols give rise to a magnification of the bias, we have implemented a retrieval configuration in which the retrieval algorithm knows the true aerosol abundance profiles along with their optical properties. With this configuration, the surface bias returns mostly to the level first seen when synthetic measurements were not affected by aerosols.The results we present in this work should be considered for new missions where XCH4 is a target quantity and the design relies on the 2.3 µm  absorption band. Since the surface bias will likely emerge, it is crucial that a validation approach is planned which sufficiently samples the needed range of surface reflectance in areas of near-uniform methane concentrations in order to capture the bias and thus correct for it."

From spring to early summer, changes in ASR are associated more with sea ice than with the clouds. Conversely, the cloud contribution explains more of the ASR anomaly after June. Overall, variations in cloud cover and sea ice extent can explain 50%–93% of the ASR variability in each sunlit month. Both the sea‐ice‐ and cloud‐associated ASR variations are positively correlated with the observed ASR anomaly, but their trends over the 20‐year observational period are opposite. The positive ASR trend revealed by the kernel decomposition, primarily driven by the observed decline in sea ice extent, is dampened by clouds, particularly in June. Annually, clouds counteract 55% of the ASR trend induced by Arctic sea ice loss."

It reveals that the 2023 fire season set new records for total pyroCb activity regionally (142 events in Canada alone) and worldwide (169 events). Smoke injection altitudes range from the mid-troposphere to the lower stratosphere (8–18 km), with 414 pyroCb events (55%) linked to smoke injection within 1 km of the tropopause or higher. Estimated aerosol mass in these plumes spans four orders of magnitude, which has significant implications for climate-scale radiative effects and ozone chemistry. The cumulative aerosol particle mass injected near the tropopause over an active fire season can rival that of recent extreme pyroCb events and significant volcanic eruptions. This pyroCb inventory is critical for advancing fire weather prediction capabilities to aid firefighting efforts and improving smoke transport forecasts. It sets a foundation for an Earth System Data Record that can be used to identify longer-term trends in pyroCb activity and consequent impacts."

 To investigate the impacts of anthropogenic and natural substances transported from the Asian continent in winter on the abundance of atmospheric aerosols and cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and free troposphere (FT) over the receptor region, aircraft observations of number concentrations of aerosol and CCN as well as sulfur dioxide (SO2) were carried out over the East China Sea (ECS) during the Asian Atmospheric Particulate Environmental Change Experiment 1 (APEX-E1) in December 2000. Reanalysis data of meteorology (ERA5) and aerosols (MERRA-2) were used to interpret the observation results. The results on December 23 were characterized by the highest concentrations of all parameters including CCN more than 400 cm−3 at supersaturation (SS) of 0.40 % and SO2 (>4 ppbv) in the PBL under relatively fresh polluted air, due to rapid transport of anthropogenic and natural substances through the PBL by subsidence of air and strong winds behind cold front. On December 24, anthropogenic pollutants and dust particles were transported into the FT by ascent of air associated with a low-pressure system over the Asian continent. SO2 and coarse mode aerosols were higher than those in the PBL and CCN concentration was more than 100 cm−3 (SS = 0.40 %). In addition, this kind of ascent of air to the lower FT occurs several times on average in December. Our results suggest that in addition to traditional trajectory analysis, it is necessary to incorporate the history analysis of vertical transport and wind-induced aerosol emissions along the transport pathway."

Simulations using bulk and bin microphysics initialized with observed aerosol profiles are compared to cloud-top retrievals of cloud droplet effective radius (Reff), effective variance (νeff), and number concentration (Nd) from the airborne Research Scanning Polarimeter (RSP). Both schemes reproduce characteristics of cloud-top Nd and Reff that increase and decrease with altitude, respectively. Cloud-top Nd is low-biased relative to RSP retrievals in both schemes, potentially due to limitations in both simulations and retrieval assumptions. Cloud-top Reff is low-biased in the bulk scheme but reasonably reproduced by the bin scheme. Profiles of Nd and Reff are sensitive to the collision–coalescence process and the vertical variation in aerosol size distribution. Comparison of simulated and in situ droplet size distributions (DSDs) shows that, to first order, integrated moments are always sensitive to sizes <∼30 µm and can also be sensitive to larger sizes if the DSDs are sufficiently broad, with implications for the assumed maximum observed size retrieved by the RSP. The bin scheme captures the observed extended tail of the DSD, while the bulk scheme is unable to due to parametric constraints. Differences in expected relationships between in situ measurements of cloud cores and cloud-top retrievals by RSP demonstrate difficulty in constraining well the case presented herein. Finally, a thermal-tracking framework demonstrates that the dilution of  Nd throughout a thermal's lifetime is heavily determined by collision–coalescence and the height-varying aerosol distribution and that, in the absence of these, the impact of entrainment on diluting  Nd is largely offset by secondary activation. Implications for evaluating warm-phase convective microphysics schemes in ESMs and translating results for use on global, space-based polarimetry platforms are discussed."

Mansfield;Seth N. Lyman,"Seasonal trends in the wintertime photochemical regime of the Uinta Basin, Utah, USA","Precursor compounds must be present in the lower atmosphere for ozone to form. Ozone abatement strategies focus on reducing such precursors, but measuring and modeling are necessary to determine the most efficient way to do this. We show that the sensitivity of ozone to various precursors changes over the course of the winter. We also argue that similar seasonal changes probably occur in many regions of the Northern Hemisphere. 
 Several lines of evidence indicate that the photochemical regime, i.e., the degree to which ozone production is either VOC- or NOx-limited, varies with season in the Northern Hemisphere. For most regions, the question is patently academic, since excessive ozone occurs only in summer. However, the Uinta Basin in Utah, USA, exhibits ozone in excess of regulatory standards in both winter and summer. We have performed extensive Framework for 0-D Atmospheric Modeling (F0AM) box modeling to better understand these trends. The models indicate that, in late December, the Basin's ozone system is VOC-sensitive and either NOx-insensitive or NOx-saturated. Sensitivity to NOx grows throughout the winter, and, in early March, the system is about equally sensitive to VOC and NOx. The main driver for this trend is the increase in available solar energy as indicated by the noontime solar zenith angle (SZA). A secondary driver is a decrease in precursor concentrations throughout the winter, which decrease because of, firstly, a dilution effect as thermal inversions weaken and, secondly, an emission effect because certain emission sources are stronger at colder temperatures. On the other hand, temperature and absolute humidity (AH) are not important direct drivers of the trend."

Booth,Identifying synoptic controls on boundary layer thermodynamic and cloud properties in a regional forecast model,"Low-level clouds have important radiative feedbacks and can occur in a range of meteorological conditions, yet our knowledge and prediction of them are insufficient. We evaluate model forecasts of low-level cloud properties across a cold front and the associated environments that they form in. The model represents the meteorological conditions well and produces broken clouds behind the cold front in areas of strong surface forcing, large stability, and large-scale subsiding motion. 
 Although most of our understanding of boundary layer cloudiness is based on idealized, subtropical, barotropic marine environments, boundary layer clouds exist across a range of conditions. In this study, we use the Naval Research Laboratory's Coupled Ocean/Atmosphere Mesoscale Prediction System (COAMPS) and an automated cold-front-relative analysis framework to explore the boundary layer structure associated with low clouds across a transect through the cold front of a midlatitude synoptic cyclone. The model credibly captures boundary layer structure in line with conceptual models of midlatitude cyclones and ground-based observations at Graciosa Island in the Azores. The warm sector is conditionally unstable, with clouds that are too shallow and with too little liquid water, compared to cloud property retrievals from satellite and surface-based instruments. The cold-frontal region exhibits convection associated with weak stability and ascent. Northwest of the cold front, the boundary layer is well mixed, deeper, and capped by a strong inversion maintained by large-scale subsidence. Simulated clouds in frontal and post-frontal regions are mostly too thick, with too much liquid water and too little cloud base drizzle. The post-frontal clouds are associated with grid-scale updrafts, which appear to be the model's attempt to represent mesoscale organization of cellular convection typically observed in the cold sector of midlatitude cyclones. The deep, well-mixed post-frontal boundary layers and cloudiness are maintained by strong surface fluxes, as in cold air outbreaks. Our analysis framework serves as a unique approach to model verification, and our results offer insights into differences in boundary layer cloud behavior between subtropical and synoptic cold-sector regimes."

 Aerosol–radiation interactions play a crucial role in air pollution and climate change, with scattering being the dominant process. The complex refractive index of organic aerosols is essential for accurately simulating these interactions, with the scattering capability being predominantly determined by the real part of the refractive index (mr). Prevailing models often assume a constant mr for organic aerosols (e.g., 1.53 or 1.45) at different wavelengths or claim that the mr of primary organic aerosols (POAs) is substantially higher than that of secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) (e.g., 1.63 for POA and 1.43 for SOA), largely due to a lack of direct measurements. This study employs direct measurements from the DMA-SP2 system to demonstrate a strong diameter dependence of dry state mr at 1064 nm, closely associated with primary aerosol emissions and secondary aerosol formation. Source apportionment of aerosol size distributions reveals that the mr of SOA is substantially higher than that of POA. Optical closure calculations, based on extensive dry-state observations of aerosol scattering at 525 nm, size distributions, and chemical compositions, confirm that SOA formation can enhance aerosol mr substantially (from lower than 1.45 when POA dominates to higher than 1.55 when SOA dominates). These results challenge existing model assumptions. In addition, further analysis reveals the mr of SOA increases substantially with oxidation level, which is likely associated with multiphase SOA formation. Our analysis recommends mr values at 525 nm of 1.37 for POA and 1.59 for SOA in urban regions with emissions and meteorological conditions similar to those at the observation site in Guangzhou, a city located in humid southern China. These findings underscore that current modeling practices may introduce substantial inaccuracies in estimating the radiative effects of organic aerosols."

Our model generates hourly PM2.5 maps with high spatial resolution, by combining satellite data, ground measurements, geophysical model data, and different geographical indicators. The model properly accounts for spatial and temporal variability of the urban pollution levels, and can be highly beneficial for air quality monitoring and health protection. 
 Understanding PM2.5 variability at fine scale is crucial to assess urban pollution impact on the population and to inform the policy-making process. PM2.5 in-situ measurements at ground level cannot offer gapless spatial coverage, while current satellite retrievals generally cannot offer both high-spatial and high-temporal resolution, with night-time estimation posing further challenges. This study tackles these difficulties, introducing an innovative deep learning data fusion method to estimate hourly PM2.5 maps using a grid with cell size 100 m × 100 m on urban areas. We combine low resolution geophysical model data, high resolution geographical indicators, PM2.5 in-situ ground stations measurements and PM2.5 retrieved at satellite overpass. To simultaneously treat spatial and temporal correlations in our data, we deploy a 3D U-Net based neural network model. To evaluate the model, we select the city of Paris, France, in the year 2019 as our study region and time. Quantitative assessment of the model is carried out using the ground station data with a leave-one-out cross-validation approach. Our method outperforms MERRA-2 PM2.5 estimates, predicting PM2.5 hourly (R2 = 0.51, RMSE = 6.58 µg m−3), daily (R2 = 0.65, RMSE = 4.92 µg m−3), and monthly (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 2.87 µg m−3).

We propose a novel machine learning framework for wind profile correction and the Aeolus satellite is used to verify the reliability of the algorithm further to enhance data reliability in meteorological remote sensing. 
 Doppler wind Lidars (DWLs) have been widely used to detect wind vector variations, based on ground monitoring of atmospheric boundary layer and wind shear. This study evaluates the performance between three DWLs and in situ balloon radiosonde. Lidars data comparison focuses on low altitudes (height <2 km) from July to September 2021 from three producers: MSD (Minshida), CUIT (homemade), and WP (windprofile) Lidars. Within the research height range, comparisons show the root mean square errors (RMSE) for wind speed were 1.11, 4.45, and 5.15 m s−1, while wind direction RMSE were shown at 49.83, 82.89, and 84.87°, respectively. The measurement accuracy decreases with the altitude increase (up to 2 km). The Lidar performance requires a certain amount of aerosol backscattering, when PM2.5 ranges within 35–50 µg m−3, MSD Lidar exhibited the highest wind speed correlation (R2=0.82) with radiosonde, and the wind direction accuracy observed with the three Lidars is enhanced with the increase of aerosol concentration, indicating that particle loading is the critical factor affecting the wind profile. Lidar performance varied significantly with planetary boundary layer heights (PBLH), particularly, the Lidar performance is relatively optimal when the PBLH within 500–750 m, with the Pearson correlation coefficients (PCCs) of wind speed are 0.97, 0.92, and 0.72, while the wind direction is shown at 0.98, 0.75, and 0.70, respectively. The vertical relationship between cloud base height (CBH) and PBLH had also varied influences on the Lidar measurements. Machine learning was used to remove anomalies and complement missing values, the random forest (RF) demonstrated superior performance, with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.93(CUIT) and 0.90(WP) in the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. RF-based correction of CUIT data enhanced the R2 from 0.42 to 0.65. The R2 between the RF-based CUIT and Aeolus satellite data was 0.83, indicating that the method effectively improved data, even in circumstances of anomalies. We proposed a new correction algorithm combined with the isolation forest (IF) and RF to handle high-dimensional and incomplete datasets. Our procedure could increase the Lidar measurement quality of wind."

Its structure is informed by the physical and chemical principles of the atmosphere, allowing it to learn and replicate complex atmospheric processes. FastCTM demonstrated matching accuracy to traditional models with less computational demand. It also provides analysis of how different atmospheric processes contribute to air quality changes. 
 Chemical-transport models (CTMs) are indispensable for air-quality assessment and policy development, yet their operational use is hampered by high computational cost. We present FastCTM, a physics-informed neural-network emulator that rapidly predicts hourly concentrations of ten key pollutant variables: major PM2.5 species (SO42-, NO3-, NH4-, organic matter, elemental carbon, crustal material), coarse PM10, SO2, NO2, CO, and O3. FastCTM embeds five process-specific neural modules – primary emissions, horizontal transport, turbulent diffusion, chemical reactions and deposition within a unified framework. Given 1 h initial condition data, FastCTM can simulate future 24 h concentrations for ten air pollutants using corresponding meteorological fields and emissions as input. Trained on 2018–2022 WRF-CMAQ forecasts over China and evaluated on 2023 data, FastCTM reproduces CMAQ with mean RMSE (µg m−3) of 9.1, 11.9, 4.4, 4.0, 48.9, 10.9 and R2 of 0.80, 0.81, 0.80, 0.83, 0.90, 0.70 for PM2.5, PM10, SO2, NO2, CO and O3, respectively. Sensitivity tests confirm physically plausible responses to temperature, wind speed, boundary-layer height and precursor emissions. The modular architecture enables quantitative process analysis, offering CTM-like insight at GPU-accelerated speeds. In a nutshell, FastCTM provides a computationally efficient solution for air-quality simulations, sensitivity analysis, and process attribution with high accuracy and physical consistency."

The Retina v2 algorithm creates high-resolution pollution maps by integrating satellite and local measurements with an air quality model. Easily portable to other cities, it balances accuracy with low computational demands, matching or outperforming complex dispersion models and data-heavy machine learning. Satellite data proves especially valuable in cities with sparse or no monitoring networks. 
 Urban air pollution poses a significant health risk, with over half the global population living in cities where air quality often exceeds World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines. A comprehensive understanding of local pollution levels is essential for addressing this issue. Recent advancements in low-cost sensors and satellite instruments offer cost-efficient complements to reference stations but integrating these diverse data sources in useful monitoring tools is not straightforward. This study presents the updated Retina v2 algorithm, which generates high-resolution urban air pollution maps by assimilating heterogeneous measurements into a portable urban dispersion model. Tested for NO2 concentrations in Madrid during March 2019, it shows improved speed and accuracy over its predecessor, with the ability to incorporate satellite data. Retina v2 balances performance with modest computational demands, delivering similar or better results compared to complex dispersion models and machine learning approaches requiring extensive datasets. Using only TROPOMI satellite data, citywide NO2 simulations show an RMSE of 19.3 µg m−3, with better results when hourly in-situ measurements were included. Relying on data of a single ground station can introduce biases, which can be mitigated by incorporating satellite data or multiple ground stations. Including more stations improves accuracy, with 24 stations yielding a correlation of 0.90 and an RMSE of 13.0 µg m−3. The benefit of TROPOMI diminishes when data from five or more ground stations is available, but it remains valuable for many cities which have limited monitoring networks."

Throughout these 19 years, the equatorial crossing time of Terra's orbit varied by less than 1 min from its mean value. This variation created a homogeneous time series of deseasonalized and deregionalized height anomalies unaffected by sun‐glint position changes. We analyzed the changes in effective cloud height (i.e., the integral of cloud occurrence weighted by cloud‐top height) and the influence of all altitudes, from the surface to 20 km, on the effective height. We show that cloud fractions tended to decrease at low altitudes, especially in the tropics, and to increase at high altitudes for most latitudes. The globally effective height has very likely risen, at an average rate of about 1 m/yr. The rise was most significant at high latitudes, reaching 5 ± 1 m/yr between 45°N and 65°N. Tropical high clouds have risen, but this was offset by a reduction in tropical low clouds, resulting in an insignificant change in tropical effective height. The increase in effective height typically reduces the outgoing longwave radiation, thereby augmenting the cloud greenhouse effect. The observed height increase may be an adjustment to the radiative forcing of the stratosphere over 19 years that presumably causes changes in upper tropospheric stability, the tropopause, the Brewer‐Dobson circulation, etc. If so, the observed height increase should be included in modeling the effective radiative forcing."

This study introduces the USTC Parameterized Retrieval Method (USTC‐PRM), an algorithm for retrieving profiles of aerosol extinction and trace gas concentration from MAX‐DOAS measurements. Using the Radiative Transfer Model (RTM), we evaluate the impact of various observation geometries and profile shapes on the air mass factor (AMF) and establish the look‐up table (LUT). USTC‐PRM overcomes the underestimation of high‐altitude aerosols by optimal estimation method (OEM) since it does not rely on prior profiles. The correlation between the retrieved AOD and AERONET AOD is 0.896, compared to 0.826 for the contrasted OEM. For trace gas retrieval, we propose a real‐time LUT establishment method based on retrieved aerosol profiles, significantly reducing memory requirements by over 90% (7.8 GB) and improving the correlation with in situ measurements from 0.867 to 0.911. Additionally, we introduce the concept of look‐up error table (LET) to quantify the AMF bias by retrieving it from LUT. We establish a quality evaluation system based on fitting results, LUT errors, and parameter statistics. Using synthetic data and long‐term MAX‐DOAS measurements, USTC‐PRM demonstrates high performance in retrieving profiles under various aerosol scenarios across high, medium, and low extinction levels, while also identifying abnormal situations, such as foggy and cloudy conditions. USTC‐PRM provides a robust, accurate and efficient approach for MAX‐DOAS profile retrieval, which can be utilized for studying regional transport and tracing atmospheric pollutants."

For Ontario, this term is positive and significant for hypertension (change = 1.88, CI = 1.18–2.57), ischemic heart disease (0.50, CI = 0.12–0.88), arrhythmia (0.12, CI = 0.03–0.22), and asthma (0.31, CI = 0.05–0.57). For Alberta, there is a significant and positive interaction for arrhythmia (0.48, CI = 0.12–0.85). These results indicate that there was a statistically significant increase in adverse health outcomes for five of the eighteen disease‐province pairings associated with the increase in atmospheric CO after 2011 coinciding with enhanced wildfire emissions."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108507,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文探讨了地表反射模型（Ross-Li和RPV模型）对气溶胶成分反演的影响。通过分析POLDER/PARASOL卫星观测数据，利用GRASP/Component方法在全球AERONET验证站点进行气溶胶成分反演，研究了不同地表反射模型对气溶胶成分反演结果的不确定性。研究发现，Ross-Li和RPV模型在气溶胶成分反演方面总体上表现出良好的一致性，但吸收成分的反演差异小于散射成分，细模态成分的反演差异小于粗模态成分。RPV模型在北非、东亚和东南亚地区呈现出较高的气溶胶不溶性散射成分，但较低的溶解性散射成分。这项研究强调了地表反射参数化在气溶胶成分反演精度中的关键作用，尤其是在粗模态主导的地区。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['aerosol component retrieval', 'surface reflectance models', 'POLDER/PARASOL', 'GRASP/Component approach', 'aerosol absorption', 'aerosol scattering', 'aerosol composition', 'satellite observations', 'air quality monitoring']",Shuhui Liu;Lei Li;Xindan Zhang;Cheng Chen;Haoling Zhang;Ke Gui;Yu Zheng;Jingrui Ma;Huizheng Che,Comparative impact of surface reflection models on aerosol component retrieval,"•Aerosol component retrievals using Ross-Li and RPV models show good agreement. •Absorption component retrievals show smaller divergence than scattering components. •Fine-mode component retrievals diverge less than coarse-mode components. 
 Accurate characterization of land surface reflectance remains a critical challenge in aerosol retrieval algorithms, particularly in reducing uncertainties associated with satellite-derived aerosol composition products. Through a comprehensive analysis of aerosol component retrievals derived from POLDER/PARASOL observations at global AERONET-validated sites by the GRASP/Component approach, this study investigates the uncertainties in component retrievals based on the Ross-Li and RPV surface reflectance models. We found that these aerosol component retrievals between Ross-Li and RPV models generally show good agreements globally (aerosol absorbing components: R = 0.90 for BC, R = 0.79 for BrC, and R = 0.84 for CAI; aerosol scattering insoluble components: R = 0.94 for FNAI, R = 0.90 for CNAI; aerosol scattering soluble components: R = 0.80 for FNAS+FAWC, R = 0.74 for CNAS+CAWC). Compared to component retrievals based on Ross-Li model, RPV model presents higher aerosol insoluble scattering components but lower soluble scattering components in North Africa, East Asia, and Southeast Asia. These findings highlight the critical role of surface reflectance parameterization in aerosol composition inversion accuracy, particularly for coarse-mode-dominated regions."

Based on a novel isotope method to trace methane sources, we identified that the methane emission from the oil and gas sites makes the major contribution to changes in atmospheric methane isotope signals. 
 Current evaluation of methane (CH4) emissions to the atmosphere from global oil and gas (ONG) sector is subject to considerable uncertainty. Particularly for China, few measurements have been conducted, making it difficult to quantify emissions and conduct mitigation measures. Recently, the isotopic composition of CH4 (δ13C) has been used for evaluating the contributions of fossil fuel sources to global budgets, providing a more effective approach across both regional and global scales. Here, we present a field study of CH4 mixing ratios and δ13C based on UAV sampling and ground monitoring across 11 ONG sites located in southwestern China. We found that the values of δ13C-CH4 provide a solid basis for identifying the CH4 leakage and characterizing source distributions at the ONG site-levels, despite that the meteorological and site conditions as well as the surrounding environment could exert influence on the signal strengths. With the Keeling plot approach, we determined that the mean δ13C source isotopic signatures of CH4 emission from these ONG sites were −25.66 ‰, heavier than previously found for other sites globally. This also indicates that they were mainly thermogenic sources. Finally, by incorporating the updated source isotopic signatures determined for China, we conducted a back-of-envelope assessment to qualitatively infer the global CH4 emission from the fossil fuel sources. The result suggests an overestimation of global CH4 emission from the fossil fuel inventory by 2.86 Tg CH4 yr−1, and an underestimation from the microbial sources. This study highlights the necessity of determining CH4 isotopes on ONG site-levels, providing an indirect but important reference to quantifying CH4 inventories among global industrial sectors."

By collecting 3 years of data in the Indian Ocean, we demonstrate that high-quality measurements can be made, even on a moving platform. These results open new possibilities for observing aerosols over the ocean and improving satellite data and climate studies. 
 The Earth's oceans play a critical role in regulating the global climate and atmospheric processes, with marine aerosols significantly influencing weather patterns, air quality, and climate dynamics. Despite extensive land-based aerosol monitoring through networks like AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork), marine aerosol characterization remains a critical gap, due in part to the logistical challenges of conducting measurements in remote oceanic environments. To address this, robust, automated, and precise monitoring systems adapted for research vessels are essential.This study reports on the first 3 years (July 2021–June 2024) of continuous aerosol optical depth (AOD) measurements collected aboard the research vessel Marion Dufresne using a ship-adapted CIMEL CE318-T automatic photometer in the frame of the MAP-IO (Marion Dufresne Atmospheric Program  –  Indian Ocean) program. The dataset comprises over 25 000 quality-assured AOD measurements, primarily from the southwest Indian Ocean region, revealing mid-range AOD and Ångström exponent values consistent with previous studies. The reliability and precision of the system were validated through dual-instrument comparisons conducted during the Amaryllis-Amagas/Transama campaign, yielding strong correlations (R>0.96 for different wavelengths) and low root-mean-square error (RMSE<0.01), within the expected error margins for AERONET ground-based sites and benefiting from the continue tracking system implemented for ship-adapted version. Additionally, recurrent comparisons with the ground-based AERONET site at Saint-Denis (La Réunion) further confirm the system's accuracy, presenting good correlations despite differences in altitude and the greater influence of local urban aerosols in Saint-Denis.Retrievals from spectral AOD and sky radiance data collected over the Indian Ocean during a biomass burning event (October 2023) demonstrate the feasibility of deriving detailed aerosol properties, including size distribution and optical characteristics, from shipborne platforms adapted for marine conditions, following the protocols of the AERONET standard algorithm. Observed single scattering albedo (SSA) values, ranging from 0.88 to 0.95 with higher absorption at longer wavelengths, align with those recorded at the Saint-Denis site during the event and are consistent with expectations for a mixture of biomass burning (at the end of the dry season) and sea salt aerosols. These preliminary results underscore the potential of shipborne systems to provide comprehensive aerosol characterization in remote marine environments."

Air masses isolated from land for 72+ hours are systematically selected as essentially oceanic. Among the 11 global regions, they show daytime decreases of 11–16 % in the tropics, while near-zero depletions are rare, unlike in the Arctic, implying different mechanisms. 
 Studying tropospheric ozone over the remote areas of the planet, such as the open oceans and the polar regions, is crucial to understand the role of ozone as a global climate forcer and regulator of atmospheric oxidative capacity. A focus on the pristine oceanic and polar regions complements the available land-based datasets and provides insights into key photochemical and depositional loss processes that control the concentrations and spatiotemporal variability in ozone as well as the physicochemical mechanisms driving these patterns. However, an assessment of the role of ozone over the oceanic and polar regions has been hampered by a lack of comprehensive observational datasets. Here, we present the first comprehensive collection of ozone data over the oceans and the polar regions. The overall dataset consists of 77 ship cruises/buoy-based observations and 48 aircraft-based campaigns. The dataset, consisting of more than 630 000 independent ozone measurement data points covering the period from 1977 to 2022 and an altitude range from the surface to 5000 m (with a focus on the lowest 2000 m), allows systematic analyses of the spatiotemporal distribution and long-term trends over the 11 defined ocean/polar regions. The datasets from ships, buoys, and aircraft are complemented by ozonesonde data from 29 launch sites or field campaigns and by 21 non-polar and 17 polar ground-based station datasets. The datasets contain information on how long the observed air masses were isolated from land, as estimated by backward trajectories from the individual observation points. To extract observations representative of oceanic conditions, we recommend using a subset of the data with an isolation time of 72 h or longer, from the analysis with coincident radon observations. These filtered oceanic and polar data showed typically flat diurnal cycles at high latitudes, whereas daytime decreases in ozone (11 %–16 %) were observed at lower latitudes. The ship/buoy- and aircraft-based datasets presented here will supplement the land-based ones in the TOAR-II (Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report Phase II) database to provide a fully global assessment of tropospheric ozone.

CHN-CH4, a map of anthropogenic methane emissions was created by combining satellite data, national statistics, and climate guidelines. Over 30 years, China emitted about 1157 Tg of methane, peaking in the 2010s. Shanxi province had the highest emissions. CHN-CH4 helps improve tracking, informs global climate models, and strengthens collaboration between science and policy to combat climate change. 
 China is the largest emitter of global methane emissions, contributing about 10 % to anthropogenic climate change based on existing methane inventories. However, significant uncertainties in these statistics limit the accuracy at both national and sub-national scales. The lack of continuous gridded emissions inventories also constrains the inverse analysis of atmospheric observations. To address these, we present CHN-CH4, a spatially aggregated 0.1°×0.1° anthropogenic methane emission inventory for mainland China from 1990 to 2020 annually. CHN-CH4 offers the country with new temporal coverage and details, by means of national statistical yearbooks and remote sensing products. Over the three decades, mainland China emitted 37.3 [28.1-46.4 Tg of methane annually, with the highest emission occurred in the last decade. But this decade also marked the beginning of a decreasing trend, from 45.0 [32.8–56.5] Tg in 2010 to 43.4 [31.6–53.4] Tg in 2020. As important priors, CHN-CH4 enables robust comparisons between estimated emissions and atmospheric observations, thereby improving the accuracy of inverse modelling, which is crucial for effective tracking of methane emissions. By providing a reliable and detailed emissions inventory, CHN-CH4 would be a valuable tool in accelerating the global effort to achieve equitable methane emission reduction goals, as well as supporting China's climate policy. The dataset of methane emissions in China and its eight major sectors is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15107383 (Guo et al., 2025)."

MOSAIC includes metal cation reactions and is a non-equilibrium, double-moment scheme that conserves aerosol number. Compared to the current aerosol sub-model, MOSAIC produces a more accurate size distribution and aerosol number concentration. It also improves the simulated nitrate and ammonium distribution. This work serves to expand the capacity of GEM-MACH for chemistry and weather coupling. 
 The Model for Simulating Aerosol Interactions and Chemistry (MOSAIC) aerosol thermodynamics and sectional framework has been implemented into the Canadian operational air quality model GEM-MACH. The original aerosol sub-model in GEM-MACH is based on the Canadian Aerosol Module (CAM), which uses a single-moment (mass) sectional scheme, and inorganic thermodynamics derived from the equilibrium ISORROPIA model without base metal cations. MOSAIC features non-equilibrium inorganic thermodynamics and a double-moment (mass and number) sectional scheme. For evaluation we conduct four 1-year simulations with the same emissions and meteorology over the North America domain. A reference run (REF) with the Zhang et al. (2001) aerosol dry deposition scheme and a sensitivity run (EMR) with updated parameters from Emerson et al. (2020) are conducted for each aerosol model option. The results are compared to station observations and surface monthly-mean model–observation synthesis data. MOSAIC exhibits a shift in the accumulation-mode mass and number distribution compared to CAM that results in more aerosol dry deposition in the REF run and a surface PM2.5 sulfate low bias of about 15 % relative to CAM. This bias is essentially removed in the MOSAIC EMR run, resulting in a better fit to aggregated urban and rural stations compared to CAM over the North America domain. Comparison with the AERONET volume size distribution inversion product shows that MOSAIC gives a much higher level of agreement in terms of location of the accumulation-mode peak diameter and separation of the accumulation and coarse modes. PM2.5 nitrate and ammonium for the MOSAIC EMR run shows overall better agreement with observation station data compared to both REF and EMR CAM runs at rural stations. At urban stations, MOSAIC has a high bias for nitrate relative to CAM and observations during summer, but it is reduced in the EMR run compared to the REF run. The high bias in ammonium seen with CAM for both REF and EMR runs relative to aggregated rural and urban station observations is reduced with MOSAIC by about 25 % between April and November."

However, simulating pyroCb is particularly challenging in Earth system models.

Our simulation successfully reproduces many pyroCb features, including cloud height, spatiotemporal evolution, and convective intensity in comparison with satellite and ground‐based observations. Sensitivity experiments show that realistic pyroCb simulation depends on vertical water vapor transport. These advances provide a basis for future exploration of pyroCb impacts at regional and global scales within climate models."

However, earth system models neither resolve fine‐scale orographic impacts nor the radiative effects of Saharan dust aerosols on precipitation over the island's mountains. Here, we use the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF‐Chem) to downscale global climate model projections to a convection‐resolving 4‐km resolution for both dust and no‐dust scenarios. We compare the regional hydroclimate during three periods: historical (2014–2018), mid‐ (2045–2049) and end‐21st century (2085–2089), using output from an RCP8.5 simulation of the Community Earth System Model, version 1. For each period, the coarsest parent domain is simulated both with and without dust emission, transport and radiative effects, and the ensuing thermodynamic perturbations passed to the 4‐km domain via nesting. The downscaled output indicates that precipitation over eastern Puerto Rico is expected to decline through the end of the century, leading to an increase in consecutive dry days and a depletion of soil moisture that is evident across all seasons. The inclusion of dust exacerbates the drying signal during late summer when Saharan air outbreaks are active but ameliorates drying in other seasons relative to its historical simulation. Rainfall decreases rapidly by the mid‐21st century, and the declines plateau through 2100 when dust is included, whereas there is a modest rebound to wetter conditions when dust is ignored. Although the highest elevations exhibit resilience to future drying, there is a clearer drying signal at low elevations."

The turbulence energy spectrum characterizes the distribution of turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) across different eddy scales, with the total energy affecting the diffusion coefficient and pollutant dispersion. Current methods for calculating TKE are sensitive to the temporal resolution of wind speed data, and the limited sampling frequency of instruments is much lower than the dissipation scale. Thus, the high‐frequency turbulence energy is missed, and the total TKE is underestimated. To address this issue, this study used high (∼10 Hz) and low (∼0.05 Hz) frequency wind observations from the Beijing 325‐m meteorological tower to assess how sampling frequencies impact TKE calculations. The −5/3 law of the turbulence spectrum was applied to estimate the relationship between observed and theoretical total TKE, and a parameterization scheme was completed. Results showed that the underestimation due to sampling frequency limitations ranges from 10% to 37%, with higher proportions during night and winter. Then a correction factor (HTMC) was incorporated into the BouLac PBL scheme in WRF‐Chem. Sensitivity simulations of a heavy haze event in Shenyang were set. The experimental group (EXP) showed lower concentrations of PM2.5 near the surface and higher in higher altitudes than those in control group (CTR) during night, indicating stronger vertical turbulent transport. The concentrations in EXP better match observations, with simulation bias reduced from 23.77% to 6.18%.

This study reports continuous measurements of CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$, δ $\delta $13C and δ $\delta $2H for 8 months in Cluj‐Napoca, Romania. An automated extraction and a purification system, coupled to an isotope ratio mass spectrometer alternately measured δ $\delta $13C and δ $\delta $2H of CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ with 20‐min time resolution at the campus of the Babeş‐Bolyai University. In addition, point source samples were measured to isotopically characterize CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ sources in the region. The time series show regular CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ elevations during the night, occasionally superimposed on multiday events. From these elevations, we identified three main CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ emission categories: Transylvanian biogenic gas (75%); biogenic emissions from rivers and wastewater (38%), predominantly observed during the summer; and a third source emitting 13C‐enriched CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ in winter, likely of pyrogenic origin (5%). We simulated the CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ mole fraction at the measurement site using Lagrangian footprints generated from the FLEXPART‐COSMO model convolved with emissions from the TNO‐CoCO2 inventory. The simulations show that the emission inventory is not granular enough to represent the city center.

Most of the existing footprint models assume horizontal homogeneity. However, as more and more flux towers are established over complex terrain, it is necessary to advance our understanding of footprints over complex terrain. Here we use a Lagrangian particle model coupled into a large‐eddy simulation model to investigate footprints over an idealized 2‐dimensional forested hill. Coordinate rotation, which is similar to that performed in real eddy‐covariance measurement, is considered in the calculation of footprints. For detectors over the upwind slope, their footprints are generally larger than the footprints of the detectors over the upwind flat ground. For detectors over the separation point, which is slightly downwind of the hill crest, their footprints extend both in the upwind and downwind directions. For detectors over the downwind slope and away from the separation point, their footprints also extend to the downwind direction, provided that the sources are released at the lower half of the canopy. This substantial downwind extension is in contrast to the conventional viewpoint. It is found that the footprints for the whole soil‐canopy system can be calculated by assuming that the canopy source/sink occurs at the single layer with the strongest source/sink. Compared to the footprints calculated with coordinate rotation, footprints calculated without coordinate rotation extend much farther upwind for detectors over the upwind slope, and have opposite signs for detectors over the downwind slope."

However, there are large uncertainties related to the HONO budget due to a lack of field measurements to support mechanistic studies. Here, we performed flux measurements of HONO emissions from rice paddies in Shanghai and evaluated their potential impact on the atmospheric HONO budget. Our results show distinct roles of rice paddies between daytime and nighttime. Unfertilized rice paddies emit HONO during the daytime with an average flux of 0.68 ± 1.37 ng N m−2 s−1, which corresponds to ∼10% of the total atmospheric HONO production for a daytime mixing layer height of 100 m. However, rice paddies act as a sink for HONO at night due to deposition and the high solubility of HONO in paddy water with an average flux of −0.30 ± 0.73 ng N m−2 s−1. Our correlation analyses reveal that water evaporation is a crucial factor influencing HONO emissions from rice paddies. Furthermore, the average HONO flux in rice paddies after nitrogen fertilization increased up to 2.24 ng N m−2 s−1 and contributed ∼40% to atmospheric HONO production. HONO emissions from rice paddies were estimated to be 0.10 ± 0.25 kg N ha−1 over the entire cultivation cycle (∼150 days) with an emission factor of 1.3 × 10−3 relative to the applied nitrogen. Our results highlight the crucial impact of rice paddies on the atmospheric HONO budget especially in regions and/or during periods when combustion sources have limited influence."

Specifically, the AOD retrieval is adapted from Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite retrieval algorithm using blue and red bands, and ALH retrieval is adapted from Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument algorithm using O2B band. Analysis of initial results indicated that TEMPO top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectances have positive biases across different wavelengths. Therefore, we developed a soft calibration by deriving regression relationships calculated TOA reflectance with measured TOA reflectance over the ocean. The retrieved AOD and ALH show significant improvements compared to those without soft calibration, particularly over water. Compared to AErosol RObotic NETwork AOD, the retrieved TEMPO AOD has a correlation of 0.83, a bias of −0.01 and a root‐mean‐squared‐error (RMSE) of 0.10 over land, and a correlation of 0.90, a bias of −0.05, and an RMSE of 0.08 over water. The ALH retrievals are compared against measurements from the High Spectral Resolution Lidar 2, which show a bias of 0.14 km, an RMSE of 1.19 km over land and a bias of −1.12 km, an RMSE of 1.25 km over water.

To develop effective air quality management and mitigation strategies, understanding PM2.5 source attribution and associated health risks is essential. This study investigates the source attribution and health burden of PM2.5 focusing on Mainland Thailand (MT), North Thailand (NT), and the Bangkok Metropolitan Region (BMR), using the WRF‐Chem model and a brute‐force method for source attribution. PM2.5 contributions from biomass burning including both crop and non‐crop burning are quantified, along with contributions from transportation, industry, energy, residential, and other anthropogenic sectors. This study focuses on the haze season (February–April) in 2019. Our research shows that in‐domain foreign country's biomass burning is a major contributor to PM2.5, accounting for 23%–38% of PM2.5 concentrations in MT. In NT, non‐crop burning within MT contributes the most (21%–36%) to PM2.5 levels, while crop burning within MT has a minimal impact (less than 6%). In the BMR, PM2.5 is strongly impacted by sources outside the model domain. Overall, industrial and transportation emissions are the most impactful anthropogenic sources. We further estimate the total health burden, associated with long‐term PM2.5 exposure during the haze season contributes to 46% of this PM2.5 health burden in MT in 2019, 66% in NT, and 37% in the BMR. These findings suggest that reducing biomass burning within MT and from in‐domain foreign countries during February–April could reduce the annual health burden in MT by up to 20%."

 Aerosols affect radiation, cloud properties, convection, air temperature, and large-scale circulation, yet their influence on precipitation distribution over the Maritime Continent (MC), a complex tropical region composed of islands interspersed with shallow seas, remains poorly understood. Using high-resolution cloud-system resolving model simulations, satellite observations, and reanalysis data, we demonstrate that rising aerosol concentrations amplify oceanic precipitation more than they suppress land precipitation, thereby increasing the sea-to-land precipitation ratio over the MC. This shift is supported by observations and contrasts with the land-enhanced precipitation distribution seen in pristine simulations or those without aerosol radiative effects. Our results underscore that aerosol-induced radiative cooling stabilizes the lower troposphere more over land than over the ocean, enhancing low-level convergence and convection over the sea. Moreover, high aerosol concentrations delay the diurnal precipitation peak over land from late afternoon to midnight, driven by diminished daytime heating and subsequent nighttime increases in moist static energy—an interesting pattern evident in some observed high-aerosol days."

 Nitroaromatic compounds (NACs) are important light-absorbing constituents of brown carbon (BrC), yet their seasonal characteristics, particle-size distributions, optical properties, and sources remain insufficiently resolved in highly polluted urban environments. This study presents a year-long field investigation of NACs in PM2.5 in urban Beijing, focusing on their seasonal variations, size distributions, optical properties, and sources. Eight NAC species were quantified across four seasons, with winter showing the highest concentrations due to enhanced emissions and unfavorable meteorology. Size-resolved analysis revealed fine-mode dominance (0.43–1.1 μm), reflecting secondary formation from aromatic precursors and implying strong radiative and health relevance, while coarse-mode occurrence suggested contributions from primary biomass burning and heterogeneous processes. NACs exhibited distinct light-absorbing properties, with laboratory-calibrated mass absorption efficiency (MAE) and absorption Ångström exponent (AAE) confirming their role as contributors to methanol-soluble brown carbon (MSBrC). On annual average, NACs accounted for 2.7 ± 1.5 % (0.35–8.3 %) of MSBrC absorption at 365 nm, indicating that they are a non-negligible but limited contributor to BrC light absorption. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) identified biomass burning, coal combustion, vehicle emissions, dust, and secondary formation as major sources, with seasonal variations highlighting the importance of mixed combustion sources in summer and autumn. Overall, this work provides a comprehensive molecular- and size-resolved dataset that links NAC concentrations, optical properties, and source apportionment, offering new insights into the atmospheric role of NACs and their implications for urban air quality and radiative forcing."

This study combines a ACTRIS/EARLINET ground-based LIDAR, all-sky camera imagery, ADS-B aircraft tracking, and ECMWF-ERA5 reanalysis to analyse contrails formation and evolution over Clermont-Ferrand, France, on June 2, 2023. Twelve contrails are documented throughout the day, including five persistent and seven non-persistent contrails. Persistent contrails formed at 10.36 km altitude or lower are observed under ice-supersaturated conditions (relative humidity with respect to ice, RHi > 105 %) and at temperatures between 217 and 223 K. Non-persistent contrails produced by higher altitudes aircrafts, are associated with lower RHi mostly below 100 % and colder temperatures (214–217 K).

We find that the below‐average Antarctic total column ozone and large ozone holes in each of the years of interest resulted from a different combination of the following: anomalously low ozone within the stratospheric polar vortex, strong chemical ozone depletion, weak dynamical ozone resupply, and the size and geometry of the polar vortex. We also interpret our findings in the broader context of ozone recovery, with a particular focus on September, the month when signs of recovery are most evident. We find no evidence challenging the current consensus that springtime Antarctic ozone is recovering in response to the implementation of the Montreal Protocol and its amendments."

However, direct satellite measurements of theoretical clear‐sky albedo for cloudy pixels are impossible. To address this limitation, we developed a Multi‐Layer Perceptron (MLP) model trained on over 20 million samples from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) data set, enabling the estimation of instantaneous clear‐sky albedo at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). The MLP model achieves an RMSE of 0.004 and R2 of 0.96, having a closer agreement with direct observational products compared to other radiation products, and provides the temporally perfect match to the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer instantaneous observations. Furthermore, we correct undetected sub‐resolution cloud contamination and sea‐ice contamination within clear‐sky pixels present in CERES observations. Based on clear‐sky albedo across cloudy regions, the estimated instantaneous noon SW CRE is −113.44 W·m−2. By employing another MLP model to scale the instantaneous clear‐sky albedo to daily values, the estimated daily CRE is −44.51 W·m−2, which is 1.02 W·m−2 weaker than that from the CERES Synoptic TOA and surface fluxes and clouds (SYN) product, mainly since imperfect temporal match, as well as the differences in aerosol sources and treatment.

Coggon,Air Quality Field Measurements in Las Vegas: Ozone Formation and Its Sensitivity to NOx and VOCs,"Las Vegas, Nevada is an urban center in the southwest US where the population is rapidly growing. In Las Vegas, surrounded by the Mojave Desert, biogenic emissions are low, but anthropogenic emissions, especially along the Las Vegas Strip, are a large source of volatile organic compounds (VOC) and nitrogen oxides (NO + NO2 = NOx) from volatile chemical products, cooking, and fossil fuel usage. This makes Las Vegas an ideal place to study anthropogenic VOC emissions and oxidation in the absence of a strong biogenic signal. The urban air quality in Las Vegas was measured at a stationary site and with a mobile laboratory. Biogenic VOC influence, VOC enhancement ratios, and weekday‐weekend effects were evaluated. An Eulerian box model was constructed to evaluate the chemical processes impacting air quality in Las Vegas. The model showed that the daily ozone (O3) enhancement, taken as the maximum O3 produced midday above background, was approximately 30 ppb. The O3 sensitivities to VOCs and NOx showed that reductions in both would reduce O3 production. Reducing NOx or VOCs by half would reduce O3 by 10.5 and 11.5 ppb, respectively. Reducing both NOx and VOCs together would decrease O3 by 15 ppb. The O3 contribution from biogenic VOCs was ∼3.5 ppb, which is about 10% of the total produced O3. This differs from other regions of the US, such as New York or Los Angeles, where biogenic VOCs contribute significantly to urban ozone."

Constrained by comprehensive observations from the CloudRoots‐Amazon22 campaign, spanning leaf stomatal to upper atmosphere, we design and evaluate a representative shallow convective numerical experiment with the turbulence‐resolving Dutch Atmospheric Large Eddy Simulation model, incorporating a bulk rainforest representation. We assess contributions from the rainforest, clouds, and environment through the vertically integrated, domain‐averaged CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ budget by comparing simulations with and without the dynamic effects of clouds. Our findings reveal three distinct diurnal regimes named: entrainment‐diluting, cloud‐ventilation‐and‐entrainment, and CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$‐assimilation. Shallow convective clouds (∼ ${\sim} $23%), clear air entrainment (∼ ${\sim} $21%), and rainforest CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$‐assimilation (∼ ${\sim} $56%) collectively influence the diurnal evolution and vertical exchange of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ within the clear‐to‐cloudy boundary layer, with their relative importance varying per diurnal regime. In the absence of clouds, ventilation ceases and CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ exchange is driven solely by entrainment and CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$‐assimilation, resulting in a 20%–25% reduction in mixing effectiveness. In the vertical, shallow clouds ventilate CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ to heights reaching twice the boundary layer depth, significantly affecting the vertical distribution until late afternoon. Analysis of the correlation between CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ and H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$O shows that shallow convective clouds organize the turbulent exchange at shallow cloud‐scales, shaping a vertical pattern of negative to positive CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$‐H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$O correlation from the roughness sublayer into the cloud layer. These findings highlight key processes crucial for accurately representing the lower tropical tropospheric CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ budget across clear‐to‐cloudy conditions."

Tassi,"A novel integrated strategy for air quality monitoring in volcanic-hydrothermal, wetland, urban and industrial areas","•A novel strategy for air monitoring is developed and tested. •Fixed low-cost and mobile high-tech monitoring instruments are combined. •The strategy includes CO2, CH4, PM, H2S, SO2, δ13C-CO2and δ13C-CH4measurements. •Hydrothermal-volcanic, wetland, urban and industrial areas were investigated. •The strategy provides insights into pollution sources, mixing processes, and critical sites. 
 In the present era, environmental challenges are becoming increasingly prominent, necessitating innovative solutions that facilitate air quality monitoring and mitigation strategies aimed at safeguarding human health, the climate, and ecosystems. This study demonstrates how combining low-cost and high-tech stations (through integrated fixed and mobile monitoring) offers an effective and complementary approach. The strategy was applied in diverse environments (volcanic-hydrothermal areas, a wetland, and a CO2 production plant), providing high spatial and temporal resolution data. Fixed low-cost stations, calibrated using machine-learning techniques, enabled continuous monitoring of key pollutants (CO2, CH4, PM2.5, PM10), depicting temporal variability linked to atmospheric dynamics, meteorological conditions, and emission strength. Their affordability allowed denser monitoring networks, enhancing spatial resolution and identifying critical areas that require long-term observation. This was especially effective in the wetland, where eutrophic zones emitting higher CH4 levels were clearly identified. Mobile high-tech monitoring complemented fixed data by extending spatial coverage, with repeated transects allowing partial temporal tracking. An integrated analysis of pollutant concentrations, wind patterns, and isotopic ratios (δ13C of CO2 and CH4) enabled source apportionment, distinguishing between geogenic-hydrothermal and anthropogenic emissions, particularly in volcanic and industrial contexts. Despite its strengths, some limitations persist in the combination of the two approaches: (i) the drift over time and aging of low-cost sensors were not addressed, despite the necessity of their evaluation to ensure their proper use over longer monitoring periods; (ii) mobile monitoring lacks continuous temporal data and measurements are not simultaneous, limiting its effectiveness for tracking long-term trends and comparing pollutant levels across different areas."

 The retrieval method for ozone (O3) profiles was investigated using spectra measured by the Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) technique in Kunming and Shanghai. Through simulations,it was found that stratospheric O3 differential slant column density (DSCDₛₜᵣₐ) significantly affects tropospheric O3 differential slant column density (DSCDₜᵣₒₚ). The Umkehr effect was integrated into MAX-DOAS, and O₃ DSCDₛₜᵣₐ calculated from O₃ profiles above 10 km—was used to separate O₃ DSCDₜᵣₒₚ from total O₃ DSCD (DSCDₜₒₜₐₗ). Subsequently,Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (DOAS) technique and the optimal estimation method (OEM) were combined to retrieve tropospheric O₃ profiles. Using Electronic Chemistry Cell (ECC) O₃ sounding profiles in Kunming as a reference, comparisons between MAX-DOAS (Umkehr) profiles and verification profiles from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI),Dobson spectrophotometers, and Brewer spectrophotometers showed good consistency, with deviations only at specific heights.Near the tropopause, the relative deviation between MAX-DOAS retrievals and ECC data increased;however,MAX-DOAS retrievals at heights of 20–40 km were highly sensitive to the Umkehr effect and exhibited small deviations from ECC data. For tropospheric O₃ profiles retrieved via MAX-DOAS (OEM),the maximum relative deviation between O₃ concentrations in the 1-km surface layer and ECC data was-7.8 %.Additionally, O₃ profiles retrieved by the Shanghai MAX-DOAS (Umkehr) were consistent with OMI profiles. Overall,combining the DOAS technique with the Umkehr principle enables the retrieval of stable and reliable O₃ profiles."

 The long time series of precipitable water vapor (PWV) derived from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) provides valuable information about atmospheric water vapor. However, existing long time series of PWV exhibits considerable data missing, and the short-term forecasting of PWV is insufficiently investigated, which becomes the focus of this paper. Accordingly, a hybrid driving framework is developed based on physical constraints and neural networks (PWV-FSFnet) utilizing GNSS PWV and meteorological (MET) data. This framework is used for long-time-series PWV filling and short-term PWV forecasting. In this framework, the long-time-series PWV filling model is first proposed by combining the linear and nonlinear variations of PWV and the relationship between PWV and MET parameters. Moreover, a short-term forecast model of PWV is developed by combining convolutional neural network and long short-term memory to predict the PWV of the next 1–6H, which considers the spatio-temporal relationship between PWV and multiple MET parameters. The experiment is performed in Mainland China using 957 GNSS stations, 1614 MET stations, and 87 radiosonde stations over the period of 2017–2024. Statistical results show that the PWV-FSFnet framework enables high-quality filling of long-time-series PWV with average RMS of 1.45 and 2.52 mm for internal and external accuracy, respectively. In addition, PWV-FSFnet demonstrates strong robustness in predicting PWV across different seasons, months, PWV levels, and climate regions, and the average RMS of hourly PWV forecasts is only 2.72 mm. The results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed PWV-FSFnet framework in filling and forecasting PWV, highlighting its strong application potential in GNSS meteorology."
