10.1088/1748-9326/adb5a0,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注的是热浪的定义以及其对健康的影响，并对不同国家的热浪定义政策进行了回顾。研究重点在于生物气象指标、热浪定义中的变量和阈值，以及如何调整热浪预警阈值以适应不断变化的极端高温条件。虽然该研究涉及大气环境，但其核心在于公共卫生政策和热浪的健康影响，而非大气环境遥感技术本身，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['heat wave definition', 'biometeorological indices', 'heat-health associations', 'policy review', 'extreme heat', 'heat stress limits']",Sai Venkata Sarath Chandra N;Samuel H Gunther;Tord Kjellstrom;Jason Kai Wei Lee,Advancing heat wave definitions: a policy review towards prioritizing health impacts of extreme heat,"Approaches to defining a heat wave vary globally. While they are mostly meteorology-centric, there is an increasing need to consider their health implications. Our methodology involved a review of biometeorological indices, followed by a systematic policy search of country-level heat wave definitions to explore the variability of heat protection mechanisms. We analyzed the regional coverage of heat wave definitions and warnings by examining the diversity of variables and threshold limits for 112 countries/territories. We identified the upper-most heat stress limits of biometeorological indices that trigger illness or death. The findings highlight that a large proportion of countries define heat waves based solely on maximum temperature, while only a few countries combine them with minimum temperature and/or humidity. We also find significant geographical variability in the incorporation of temperature limits with most countries in northern latitudes defining heat waves at lower thresholds. We highlight the need for policy reforms towards adjustment of heat warning thresholds to regionally appropriate levels considering rising extreme heat conditions. Given the predominance of maximum temperature-centric approaches, we argue that the focus of heat protection at the policy level must shift beyond projecting heat wave episodes and consider broader heat-health associations beyond mortality."
10.1088/1748-9326/adb6bf,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注欧洲海域的海面温度变化，并试图区分由外部因素引起的趋势和内部气候变率。研究使用了气候模型来分析大西洋多年代际变率（AMV）对欧洲海面温度的影响，以及不同排放情景下未来海面温度的预测。虽然气候变化与大气环境有关，但该研究的重点是海洋温度而非大气成分或空气质量，因此与大气环境遥感技术的直接关联不大。,"['Sea Surface Temperature', 'Climate Modeling', 'Atlantic Multidecadal Variability', 'Emission Scenarios']",L Barghorn;F Börgel;M Gröger;H E M Meier,Atlantic multidecadal variability control on European sea surface temperatures is mainly externally forced,"The semi-enclosed European seas (Baltic Sea, North Sea, Mediterranean Sea, and Black Sea) have been among the fastest warming seas worldwide during the last decades. Projections of future temperature trends can provide essential information for decision makers, but they are subject to a number of uncertainties. One important source of uncertainty is the rather high internal climate variability in that region. Separating internal variability and forced trends is therefore paramount. Particularly powerful tools for this separation are Single-Model Initial-condition Large Ensembles (SMILEs). In such ensembles, the same model is run multiple times with similar forcing but varying initial conditions, resulting in different realizations of internal variability. This study employs two SMILEs to decompose European sea surface temperatures (SSTs) into forced trends and internal variability and to investigate whether and how the latter is affected by the Atlantic multidecadal variability (AMV) in the historical period and different future emission scenarios. It is shown that on a decadal scale, the effect of the AMV on the European SSTs will stay important, especially in lower emission scenarios. However, on longer time scales, forced trends will be much higher and in all but the lowest emission scenario considered, more than 2 C warming compared to 1950 are very likely to be reached until the end of the century in all semi-enclosed European seas."

However, whether these record-shattering extremes were connected to each other remains unknown. Here we identify a dynamical linkage behind the spatiotemporal compounding nature of heatwaves over those three regions. By investigating the 2023 case and conducting historical analysis, we show that the Northern Hemispheric concurrent heatwaves in July 2023 can be attributed to a recurrent wave-6 pattern. In particular, pre-existing warmth and drought over Eastern Canada in early-July intensified the wave-6 teleconnection; which then led to extreme heatwaves over the Mediterranean and Central Asia in mid-July 2023. Furthermore, we reveal that the wave train was generated by early-July convection over the subtropical western Pacific. This, combined with the lowest May snow cover over North America in the past 40 years helped to warm Eastern Canada. Multiple models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 are able to simulate those compound extremes connected by the wave-6 pattern with a high inter-model agreement. Our research offers insights into record-breaking compounding heatwaves in disparate parts of world during the mid-summer of 2023, with implications for disaster decision-making and risk management."

Previous literature has highlighted the benefits of material efficiency that cities can provide. However, there is little research on household material footprints (MFs) in this context. MFs cover all material requirements throughout global supply chains and allocate these to the final consumer of a product or service. The study aims to fill this literature gap by analysing how household MFs and their different categories vary in Europe according to socioeconomic variables and the degree of urbanisation. Furthermore, we adjust our baseline model to see how adding the MF of transport infrastructure use affects the outcomes. The MFs decrease strongly with an increasing degree of urbanisation when infrastructure is taken into account, but much less so, when only household material consumption is considered. Surprisingly, household metal footprints are higher in rural than urban areas. This is mainly because household vehicles have a larger impact on metal footprints than electronic devices, for example. Differences in the MF patterns between countries highlight the importance of tailored material efficiency policies considering local characteristics."

Changes in precipitation regimes, temperature fluctuations, and the frequency of extreme hydro-climatic events driven by climate change accelerate the deterioration of GWQ, thereby threatening ecosystems and human health. In response to these challenges, recent research has increasingly focused on developing and refining analytical models (AM) and machine learning (ML) techniques to understand better and predict the impacts of climate change on GWQ. This systematic literature review critically examines the current state of knowledge on applying AM and ML models in the context of GWQ assessment under climate-induced stressors. By synthesizing findings from a comprehensive review of existing studies, this paper discusses the capabilities, limitations, and future directions of hybrid ML and traditional AM in GWQ prediction, vulnerability, and threshold estimation. The review reveals that while ML approaches significantly enhance predictive accuracy and model robustness, there remain substantial challenges in their application due to the complexity of climate-induced variables and the scarcity of high-resolution data. This paper aims to provide GWQ researchers, water resource managers, and policymakers with an advanced understanding of the interactions between climate change and GWQ and the innovative AM and ML modelling approaches available to address these challenges. By highlighting the potential and limitations of current models, this review offers insights into developing more effective and adaptive management strategies for safeguarding GWQ in an era of rapid climatic change."

The factors underpinning these variations are unclear. Using the CanESM5 large ensemble, including the single forcing simulations, we find that anthropogenic aerosols played an important role in influencing the above SibH trends on top of pronounced internally-generated variations. Changes in the SibH during both periods are embedded in aerosol-induced upper-tropospheric mid-latitude wave trains propagating from upstream regions, with subsequent downward propagation of the signal to the surface via three-dimensional dynamical adjustments. Further insights into the physical mechanisms using regional aerosol perturbation experiments with CESM1 reveal a dominant role of decreased North American aerosol emissions in driving the atmospheric wave train through interaction with the North Atlantic jet during the first period. In the second period, European aerosol emissions, characterized by a large and extensive decrease, are crucial to explain the SibH recovery. A better understanding of the factors driving multidecadal variability of the SibH, and in particular of the interplay between internal variability and external forcing, is critical to reducing uncertainties in future projections of regional extremes, such as cold surges, which can cause large social and economic impacts on densely populated East Asia."

ROS events can directly alter the physical structure and thermal properties of the snowpack, leading to rapid melting and runoff-induced flooding, reduced snow insulation, and permafrost degradation. However, tracking ROS events and regional trends remain uncertain due to limited ground measurements and lack of long-term satellite ROS observations representing vast and remote boreal-Arctic landscapes. We quantified ROS dynamics over Alaska by developing a daily 6 km resolution ROS record using an established gradient ratio polarization approach and 30 year (1988–2017) satellite observations from the Special Sensor Microwave Imager/Image Sounder (SSMI/S) sensors. The data record captured well-documented ROS events and showed high consistency (R 0.94) with alternative ROS predictions from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer-EOS/2 sensors. Analysis showed an overall increasing ROS frequency with significant trends mainly identified during early winter. Notable rises in ROS frequency were also detected in mid-to-high elevation ranges (>400 m above sea level (ASL)), while this increase diminished at higher elevations (>1000 m ASL). Our analysis further confirmed that the warming climate plays a fundamental role in driving these ROS events, with significantly positive correlations between ROS frequency and air temperature. However, the significant correlations did not extend to the Eastern and Western Gulf climate zones of southern Alaska, where the ROS retrievals were likely affected by coastal ocean contamination of SSMI/S observations."

However, for socioeconomic drought, none of the existing indices is both spatially distributed and standardized. To fill this gap, this study proposes a novel index, Distributed Standardized SocioEconomic Drought Index (DSSEDI), to accurately identify socioeconomic drought over time and space. Moreover, a high-precision, long-term gridded water demand dataset is developed as the basis of establishing this index. For the East River basin, DSSEDI accurately detected significant socioeconomic droughts in 2002, 2004–2005, 2009, and 2011, mostly during autumn-winter-spring. The Pearl River Delta was found to have significant population and economic vulnerability to droughts, with economic exposure peaking at $4.66 billion near Shenzhen during severe events. As a standardized index, it can be adaptable to other regions. Overall, this study provides a new perspective on socioeconomic drought by increasing spatial resolution of water demand data and accounting for the impacts of water conservation measures on observations during the establishment process of DSSEDI."

The aerosol NOC pollution during winter in China is closely associated with the intensity of precursor emissions and the aqueous-phase processes. Our results highlight the importance of emission reduction strategies in controlling aerosol NOCs pollution during winter in China. 
 Nitrogen-containing organic compounds (NOCs) impact air quality and human health. Here, the abundance, potential precursors, and main formation mechanisms of NOCs in PM2.5 during winter were compared for the first time among Haerbin (dependent on coal for heating), Beijing (natural gas and coal as heating energy), and Hangzhou (no centralized heating policy). The total signal intensity of CHON+, CHN+, and CHON− compounds was highest in Haerbin and lowest in Hangzhou. Anthropogenic aromatics accounted for 73 %–93 % of all identified precursors of CHON+, CHN+, and CHON− compounds in Haerbin. Although the abundance of aromatic-derived NOCs was lower in Beijing than in Haerbin, aromatics were also the main contributors to NOC formation in Beijing. Hangzhou exhibited the lowest levels of aromatic precursors. Furthermore, non-metric multidimensional scaling analysis indicated an overall reduction in the impact of fossil fuel combustion on NOC pollution along the route from Haerbin to Beijing to Hangzhou. We found that aqueous-phase processes (mainly condensation, hydrolysis, or dehydration processes for reduced NOCs and mainly oxidization or hydrolysis processes for oxidized NOCs) can promote the transformation of precursors to produce NOCs, leading to the most significant increase in aromatic NOC levels in Haerbin (particularly on haze days). Reduced precursor emissions in Beijing and Hangzhou (the lowest) constrained the aqueous-phase formation of NOCs. The overall results suggest that the aerosol NOC pollution in coal-dependent cities is mainly controlled by anthropogenic aromatics and aqueous-phase processes. Thus, without effective emission controls, the formation of NOCs through aqueous-phase processes may still pose a large threat to air quality."

The sensor measurement performance was quantified, and natural and anthropogenic CO2 emission sources were explored with a focus on what drives high CO2 levels. The observations will be used further by others to validate what is thought to be known about CO2 emissions in the region. 
 As a component of the ICOS Cities project, a “mid-cost” NDIR (nondispersive infrared) CO2 sensor network was deployed across the city of Zurich (Switzerland), known as ZiCOS-M. The network was operational between July 2022 and July 2024 and consisted of 26 monitoring sites, 21 of which were located in or around the city of Zurich, with 5 sites outside the urban area. Daily calibrations using two reference gas cylinders and corrections of the sensors' spectroscopic response to water vapour were performed to reach a high level of measurement accuracy. The hourly mean root mean squared error (RMSE) was 0.98 ppm (range of 0.46 and 1.5 ppm) and the mean bias ranged between −0.72 and 0.66 ppm when undergoing parallel measurements with a high-precision reference gas analyser for a period of 2 weeks or more. CO2 concentrations (technically, dry-air mole fractions) were highly variable with site means in Zurich ranging from 434 to 460 ppm, and Zurich's mean urban CO2 dome was 15.4 ppm above the regional background. Some of the highest CO2 levels were found at two sites exposed to strong plant respiration in a very confined nocturnal boundary layer. High-CO2 episodes were detected outside Zurich's urban area, demonstrating that processes acting on a variety of scales drove CO2 levels. The ZiCOS-M network offered significant insights at a cost an order of magnitude lower compared to reference instruments, and the observations generated by ZiCOS-M will be used in additional ICOS Cities activities to conduct CO2 emission inventory validation with inversion modelling systems."

Computational fluid dynamics simulations are performed to evaluate the sampling efficiency for different droplet sizes. In situ measurements show very good water collection rates and sampling efficiency. BOOGIE is compared to other cloud collectors and the efficiency is comparable, as are the chemical and biological compositions. 
 In situ cloud studies are fundamental to study the variability in cloud chemical and biological composition as a function of environmental conditions and assess their potential for transforming chemical compounds. To achieve this objective, cloud water collectors have been developed in recent decades to recover water from clouds and fogs using different designs and collection methods. In this study, a new active ground-based cloud collector was developed and tested for sampling cloud water to assess the cloud microbiology and chemistry. This new instrument, BOOGIE, is a mobile sampler for cloud water collection that is easy to operate with the objective of being cleanable and sterilisable, respecting chemical and microbial cloud integrity, and presenting an efficient collection rate of cloud water. Computational fluid dynamics simulations were performed to theoretically assess the capture of cloud droplets by this new sampler. A 50 % collection efficiency cutoff of 12 µm has been estimated. The collector was deployed at Puy de Dôme station under cloudy conditions for evaluation. The water collection rates were measured at 100 ± 53 mL h−1 for a collection of 21 cloud events; considering the measured liquid water content, the sampling efficiency of this new collector has been estimated at 69.7 ± 11 % over the same set of cloud events. BOOGIE was compared with other active cloud collectors commonly used by the scientific community (Cloud Water Sampler and Caltech Active Strand Cloud Collector version 2). The three samplers presented similar collection efficiencies (between 53 % and 70 % on average). The sampling process can affect the endogenous cloud water microflora, but the ATP / ADP (adenosine triphosphate and adenosine diphosphate) ratios  obtained from the samplers indicates that they are not stressful for the cloud microorganisms. The chemical compositions of hydrogen peroxide, formaldehyde, and major ions are similar between the collectors; significant variability is observed for magnesium and potassium, which are the less concentrated ions. The differences between collectors are the consequence of different designs and the intrinsic homogeneity in the chemical composition within the cloud system."

Therefore, a digitization method which used image-processing techniques was developed to extract them from the historical paper rolls. This allowed them to be saved in a machine-readable format that is easily accessible to the scientific community. 
 This study describes the digitization and calibration of historically significant solar absorption spectra recorded at the Jungfraujoch International Scientific Station in the 1950s. Using a homemade Pfund-type grating spectrometer, these spectra were recorded on paper rolls to study the solar spectrum which was then used to compile a solar atlas between 2.8 and 23.7 µm (421 to 3571 cm−1) that, in particular, later contributed to the development of the HITRAN (High-Resolution Transmission Molecular Absorption Database) database. We have now digitized these analogue recorded spectra to make them available for atmospheric studies. Our approach involves image-processing techniques, including colour masking for digitization and peak detection for accurate wavenumber calibration against a synthetic spectrum.We have also developed a validation method by re-digitizing degraded Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra to the same resolution as the old spectra to evaluate the digitization accuracy. Furthermore, we have studied the influence of line thickness on the digitization error.The number of spectra transformed into a machine-readable format is 106 (freely available for download), with an average digitization error of 1.55 % and a wavenumber shift standard deviation of 0.075 cm −1. These digitized and calibrated spectra now offer a valuable resource for atmospheric studies, providing essential historical data for atmospheric research.

The retrievals of spatially resolved horizontal wind fields and vertical winds are also facilitated, benefiting from the extensive meteor detections. The successful deployment and maintenance of CONDOR provide 24/7 and state-of-the-art wind measurements to the research community. 
 The Chilean Observation Network De Meteor Radars (CONDOR) commenced deployment in June 2019 and became fully operational in February 2020. It is a multi-static meteor radar system consisting of three ∼ 1° latitudinally separated stations. The main (central) station is located at the Andes Lidar Observatory (ALO; 30.25° S, 70.74° W) and is used for both transmission and reception. The two remote sites are located to the north and south and are used for reception only. The southern station is located at the Southern Cross Observatory (SCO; 31.20° S, 71.00° W), and the northern station is located at the Las Campanas Observatory (LCO; 29.02° S, 70.69° W). The successful deployment and maintenance of CONDOR provide 24/7 measurements of horizontal winds in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) and permit the retrieval of spatially resolved horizontal winds and vertical winds. This is possible because of the high meteor detection rates. Over 30 000 quality-controlled underdense meteor echoes are detected at the ALO site each day, and in total ∼ 88 000 events are detected each day over the three sites. In this paper, we present the configuration of the CONDOR system and discuss the validation and initial results of its data products. The motivations of deploying the CONDOR system also include combining measurements from other co-located ground-based instruments at the ALO site, which provide uniquely cross-validated and cross-scale observations of the MLT dynamics with multiple scientific goals."

The coverage of Tavg, Tmax, and Tmin in the C-LSAT 2.1 dataset has been significantly enhanced, further enhancing the representativeness of global land diurnal temperature range (DTR) data with greater spatial heterogeneity. Compared to C-LSAT 2.0, C-LSAT 2.1 shows consistent overall trends, except for a slight increase in LSAT anomaly observed in the Southern Hemisphere after 2010. Furthermore, we employ a ""Thin Plate Spline (climatology) + Adjust Inverse Distance Weighted (anomaly fields)"" technical framework to develop a high-resolution (0.5° × 0.5°) LSAT (C-LSAT HRv1) and DTR (C-LDTR HRv1) dataset from January 1901 to December 2023. Except for some differences existing during the period of 1901–1950 due to the limited number of observational stations, the C-LSAT HRv1 and C-LDTR HRv1 datasets effectively capture the corresponding variation patterns at both global and regional scales for the other periods.

Haerter;Romain Fiévet,DiuSST: a conceptual model of diurnal warm layers for idealized atmospheric simulations with interactive sea surface temperature,"The daily cycle of sea surface temperature (SST) impacts clouds above the ocean and could influence the clustering of thunderstorms linked to extreme rainfall and hurricanes. However, daily SST variability is often poorly represented in modeling studies of how clouds cluster. We present a simple, wind-responsive model of upper-ocean temperature for use in atmospheric simulations. Evaluating the model against observations, we show that it performs significantly better than common slab models. 
 The diurnal variability in sea surface temperature (SST) may play an important role in cloud organization above the tropical ocean, with implications for precipitation extremes, storminess, and climate sensitivity. Recent cloud-resolving simulations demonstrate how imposed diurnal SST oscillations can strongly and delicately impact mesoscale convective organization. In spite of this nuanced interaction, many idealized modeling studies of tropical convection either assume a constant, homogeneous SST or, in the case of a responsive sea surface, represent the upper ocean by a slab with fixed thickness. Here we show that slab ocean models with constant heat capacity fail to capture the wind-dependence of observed diurnal sea surface warming. To alleviate this shortcoming, we present a simple yet explicitly depth-resolved model of upper-ocean temperature dynamics under atmospheric forcing. Our modular scheme describes turbulent mixing as diffusion with a wind-dependent diffusivity, in addition to a bulk mixing term and heat fluxes entering as sources and sinks. Using observational data, we apply Bayesian inference to calibrate the model. In contrast to a slab model, our model captures the exponential reduction in the diurnal warming amplitude with increasing wind speed. Further, our model performs comparably to a more elaborately parameterized diurnal warm-layer model. Formulated as a single partial differential equation with three key tuning parameters, the model is a suitable  interactive numerical boundary condition for idealized atmospheric simulations."

Total CO2 emissions of the two data sets are comparable, with a 2.4% emission difference, and the total emissions’ spatial determination coefficient (R) at 0.1° is 0.66 in 2021. However, the sectoral emissions and spatial patterns show significant differences. At the grid level, the absolute value of the median of relative percent difference (RPD) of power, ground transportation, and shipping across the domain all reach 200%. CAMS-REG is recommended for fine-scale historical emission analysis in Europe due to its higher spatial resolution and the use of localized data sets. GRACED, with a maximum latency of 3 months, is more appropriate for applications requiring near-real-time data. This work characterizing the difference between two state-of-the-art emission maps is also valuable for atmospheric modelers who need to account for the uncertainty of a priori fossil fuel emissions when performing inverse calculations of land and ocean CO2 sinks."

However, quantitative evaluation of this abiotic catalysis is lacking. Here, we investigated the dephosphorylation kinetics of eight ribonucleotides, with different nucleobase structures and P stoichiometry, reacting with common iron oxides. X-ray absorption spectroscopy determined that 0–98% of mineral-bound P was recycled inorganic P (Pi). Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization with mass spectrometry demonstrated short-lived triphosphorylated and monophosphorylated ribonucleotides bound to goethite. Based on Michaelis-Menten type modeling of the kinetic evolution of both dissolved and mineral-bound Pi, maximal Pi production rates from  triphosphorylated ribonucleotides reacted with goethite (1.9–16.1 μmol Pi h–1 ggoethite–1) were >5-fold higher than with hematite and ferrihydrite; monophosphorylated ribonucleotides generated only mineral-bound Pi at similar rates (0.0–12.9 μmol Pi h–1 gmineral–1) across minerals. No clear distinction was observed between purine-based and pyrimidine-based ribonucleotides. After normalization to mineral-dependent Pi binding capacity, resulting catalytic turnover rates implied surface chemistry-controlled reactivity.

While the number of adsorbent cations plays a key role in separation, their influence on purification under low humidity remains insufficiently understood. The breakthrough results indicate that, even under extremely low humidity, the adsorption capacity of CO2 and CO can decrease by up to 6 and 24%, respectively. It is found that  the presence of water could increases the CO2/CO separation factor from 6.91 to 9. This enhancement occurs because CO, with its lower quadrupole moment, experiences a more significant reduction in adsorption capacity than CO2. The  quantity and accessibility of cations significantly influence the water tolerance in adsorption processrs. As the number of cations decreases, CO adsorption stabilizes due to the associated hydrophobicity. However, for CO2, the high accessibility of cations at the S3 site in NaX(88) facilitates its conversion to stable carbonates and bicarbonates in the presence of water, enabling exceptional water resistance. These findings offer valuable insights into designing high-performance adsorbents for efficient CO2 capture and separation from industrial flue gas under low-humidity conditions."

This study demonstrates that conventional advanced oxidation processes (UV/H2O2 and UV/peroxydisulfate) are ineffective in degrading CA, while the UV/sulfite system successfully achieves its breakdown. Hydrated electrons (eaq–) were identified as the primary reactive species responsible for cleaving the stable triazine ring, with minimal contributions from SO3•– and H•. The pH value influences both the activity of eaq– and the degradability of CA by altering its structure; lower pH increases the electron-deficient regions in dihydrogen CA, enhancing its susceptibility to nucleophilic attack by eaq–. The high concentrations of Cl– can inhibit CA removal, likely due to the formation of reactive chlorine species that react with sulfite and suppress eaq– production. Effective CA degradation was also demonstrated in real wastewater, highlighting the UV/sulfite system as a sustainable solution for water treatment. These findings offer valuable insights into CA transformation and present effective approaches for eliminating emerging contaminants in the context of the extensive use of disinfectants."

However, their complex composition, small size, and history-dependent properties result in great uncertainty in the modeling of aerosol phase state and atmospheric processes. Herein, using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM), we examined model submicron aerosols composed of organic compounds and ammonium sulfate and established a parametrization for the separation relative humidity (SRH) that accounts for chemical composition, particle size, and equilibration time. We evaluated different variables that describe chemical composition: O/C ratio, partition coefficient, solubility, molar mass, and polarizability. The O/C ratio fits the SRH of micrometer droplets best, and by using a scaling factor to translate the micrometer SRH parametrization to submicron aerosols, we incorporate the effects of size and equilibration time. The measured scaling factor for the submicron mean SRH (30 nm–1 μm, 20 min equilibration times) is 0.80, and the factor becomes 1 with equilibration time over 1 h and is equal to 0, meaning that SRH is absent, when the aerosol dry diameter is smaller than 30 nm.

The ratio of O + S ENA intensities and O + S ion intensities estimated to be interacting with Io's atmosphere along JEDI lines‐of‐sight are 4%–7%. Those estimates are below expectations (∼11%–∼14%), but presently within uncertainties, based on integrations along the JEDI lines‐of‐sight through a prevailing but uncertain, local‐time‐symmetric model of Io's extended atmosphere. Expected ENA production rates will remain uncertain until detailed modeling of ion/atmosphere interactions are performed, and knowledge of charge exchange cross sections is verified."

Traditional GMMs often oversimplify source complexity, such as stress drop, due to high variability in estimation. This study aims to address this issue by extracting robust spatial variations in stress drop estimates and ground motion residuals. We introduce a non‐ergodic modeling framework using Bayesian Gaussian Process regression to analyze data from over 5,000 earthquakes (M2‐4.5) in the San Francisco Bay area. Our findings reveal consistent spatial patterns in non‐ergodic stress drop and peak ground acceleration (PGA), providing a reliable approach to understanding the spatial distribution of stress drop and its link to regional tectonics. Furthermore, integrating source models derived from the non‐ergodic stress drop into GMMs can effectively account for source effect in ground motions and reduce aleatory uncertainty. This study establishes a framework for utilizing stress drop data sets to enhance seismic hazard assessment."

However, the impact of AR‐fueled snowfall has received less attention, partly due to limited empirical evidence. Here, we relate new firn core stratigraphy and isotopic analyses with glacio‐meteorological data sets from SE Greenland to examine an intense AR in mid‐March 2022. We demonstrate that the associated snowfall—up to 11.6 gigatons d−1—delayed summer melt onset by11‐days and offset Greenland's 2022 net mass loss by 8%. Since 2010, our synoptic analysis reveals that snow accumulation across SE Greenland increased by 20 mm water equivalent a−1, driven by enhanced Atlantic cyclonicity. We find that the impact of ARs on the GrIS is not exclusively negative and their capacity to contribute mass recharge may become increasingly significant under ongoing Arctic amplification and predicted poleward intrusion of mid‐latitude moisture."

PDI of TCs over the Arabian Sea (AS) has a significant positive correlation with SST over the East Central Pacific Ocean (ECPO). This relationship appears to develop in March and peaks during the monsoon and post‐monsoon seasons. Conversely, PDI of TCs over the Bay of Bengal has a significant negative association with SST over the Niño region. Regression analysis and numerical simulations reveal that heating over ECPO produces anomalous walker circulation, leading to favorable conditions for TC genesis and intensification over AS. This study has implication for forecasting TC activity and understanding how SST variability affects TCs over NIO in a changing climate."

It is associated with deep convection and occurs mostly over continents. The Chemistry of the Atmosphere Field Experiment in the Pacific (CAFE Pacific) was conducted in early 2024 from Cairns, Australia, taking airborne measurements across the Australian continent and the surrounding maritime regions. Based on cloud top properties, lightning data and in situ observations of NO, O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ and carbon monoxide, we show that deep convection occurs over Northern Australia and the Indo‐Pacific Warm Pool. While we identify strong lightning activity over Australia, we observe deep convection in the Warm Pool that is not electrified. Our observations of low O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$ in the Warm Pool can be attributed to O3 ${\mathrm{O}}_{3}$‐poor air from the marine boundary layer, which is not replenished by photochemical production from NO at high altitudes."

Unique characteristics of heavy metals and water‐soluble ions have been detected to provide a comprehensive perspective on their presence and behavior within hailstones. 34 hailstone samples were collected from 12 cities in China between 2016 and 2021. Regional differences in heavy metal concentrations between northern and southern China are influenced by anthropogenic pollution sources. Water‐soluble ions are dominated by distant marine aerosol sources. The most notable distinction is that heavy metals display negligible correlation with PM10, whereas water‐soluble ions exhibit a statistically significant relationship. This suggests that chemical components contribute to hailstone formation through diverse pathways. Water‐soluble ions with hygroscopicity primarily act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to promote the formation of cloud droplets. Heavy metals are barely noticeable when attached to aerosol particles due to random collisions with various hydrometeors."

Beckett;Susan J. Leadbetter;Jeremy C. Phillips;Anthony Lee;Mark J. Woodhouse,Incorporating Eruption Source Parameter and Meteorological Variability in the Generation of Probabilistic Volcanic Ash Hazard Forecasts,"Explosive volcanic eruptions can produce large masses of tephra that are transported over long distances, with potential impacts on the ground and to aircraft. Volcanic Ash Advisory Centers (VAACs) provide advice to aviation following an eruption, using atmospheric dispersion models, initialized with eruption source parameters (ESPs) and driven by forecast meteorological data. In this paper, we develop a framework for producing probabilistic forecasts incorporating uncertainty in these inputs. Meteorological uncertainty is typically provided as an ensemble of numerical weather prediction (NWP) data and ESPs include eruption plume height and mass eruption rate (MER); these are linked by atmospheric processes, and their relationship can be modeled by Bayesian regression to quantify their uncertainties. These uncertainties can be propagated through the model to compute probabilistic quantities of ash concentration. The linearity of the advection‐diffusion‐sedimentation (ADS) equation solved by dispersion models allows us to run a single simulation for each of the NWP ensemble members, and then rescale the results to any combination of MER (or height) and emission profile. This gives a computational speed‐up compared to conventional approaches of computing every combination of ESPs and NWP. We demonstrate our method in the operational setting of the London VAAC, using the UK Met Office's NAME dispersion model, although it can be applied to any eruption scenario using any dispersion model that solves the ADS equation. The major source of uncertainty for this case study arises from the MER (due to limited variation in NWP data), although both sources of uncertainty are significant."

However, satellite precipitation is often the only forcing available to run hydrological models in data‐scarce regions compromising hydrological calculations. The Integrated Multi‐satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) product estimates precipitation from passive microwave and infrared satellites, which are intercalibrated based on Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM)'s Dual‐frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) and GPM Microwave Image (GMI) instruments. GPM‐DPR radar algorithms have a limited consideration of particle size distribution (PSD), attenuation correction, and ground clutter, resulting in snowfall estimation degradation especially in mountain regions. This study aims to improve satellite radar snowfall for this situation. Nearly 2 years (2019–2022) of aloft precipitation concentration, surface hydrometeor size, number and fall velocity, and surface precipitation rate from a Canadian Rockies high‐elevation site and collocated GPM‐DPR reflectivities were used to develop a new snowfall estimation algorithm. Snowfall estimates using the new algorithm and measured GPM‐DPR reflectivities were compared to other GPM‐DPR‐based products, including the combined radar‐radiometer algorithm (CORRA), which was employed to intercalibrate IMERG. Snowfall rates estimated with measured Ka reflectivities, and from CORRA were compared to Micro Rain Radar‐2 (MRR‐2) observations and had correlation, bias, and RMSE of 0.58 and 0.07, 0.43, and −0.38 mm hr−1, and 0.83 and 0.85 mm hr−1, respectively. Predictions using measured Ka reflectivity suggest that enhanced satellite radar snowfall estimates can be achieved using a simple measured reflectivity algorithm. These improved snowfall estimates can be adopted to intercalibrate IMERG in cold mountain regions, thereby improving precipitation estimates."

However, natural sources of chlorate are uncertain. Here, we quantify the importance of atmospheric sources of chlorate. We use GEOS‐Chem, a global three‐dimensional chemical transport model, to simulate the formation, photochemical loss, transport, and deposition of atmospheric chlorate on present‐day Earth. We also develop a method to estimate the 17O‐excess (∆17O) and the 36Cl‐to‐total‐Cl ratio (36Cl/Cl) of atmospheric chlorate to interpret the observed isotopic composition of chlorate accumulated in desert soils. The model predicts that gas‐phase chemistry can produce 15 Gg Cl year−1 of chloric acid (HClO3), which predominantly is taken up by aerosols to form particulate chlorate. Comparing the model with observations suggests that particulate chlorate undergoes chemical loss in the atmosphere, which controls the amount reaching Earth's surface. We show that the initial ∆17O that atmospheric chlorate acquires during formation would be erased rapidly in acidic aerosols due to the exchange of oxygen atoms with water. The analysis of 36Cl/Cl does not preclude a partial stratospheric origin for chlorate deposits in the Atacama Desert. In Death Valley, aqueous‐phase oxidation of oxychlorine species and anthropogenic activities potentially have greater influence. Our findings highlight the need for more observations of atmospheric chlorate and laboratory measurements of its reactivity in acidic conditions. Atmospheric chemistry should be considered in the future studies of the origin of chlorate on Mars."

In this study, we conducted in situ and controlled field experiments on subtropical Eucalyptus trees using a portable LI‐6800 photosynthesis system to isolate and quantify the temperature and light responses of major MTs. Additionally, we qualitatively assessed the light dependence of minor MTs and SQTs through dynamic chamber measurements. Our results revealed distinct light dependence across different compounds: β‐ocimenes were fully light‐dependent but exhibited unexpected suppression under high light conditions, whereas α‐pinene and 1,8‐cineole were light‐independent. Temperature response experiments indicated that the temperature sensitivity (β) for light‐dependent β‐ocimenes (0.095 K−1) and light‐independent α‐pinene (0.071 K−1) and 1,8‐cineole (0.102 K−1) were similar to the model value (0.1 K−1), but significantly lower than previously reported values from uncontrolled tropical measurements (0.2 K−1), suggesting an influence of light on observed temperature sensitivity. Chamber‐based results revealed that acyclic MTs and α‐phellandrene were fully light‐dependent, similar to β‐ocimenes, while cyclic MTs and the SQT α‐longipinene were light‐independent and followed an exponential temperature function. Other SQTs exhibited partial light‐dependence and would need a hybrid modeling approach. These results provide valuable insights into the emission mechanisms of various terpene types, with important implications for enhancing predictive models of BVOC emissions."

However, the inception and development of the +FD cannot be convincingly explained by existing discharge theories. With our new 3D broadband interferometric mapping and polarization system, we observed that the +FD was sometimes followed by an even faster and more extensive negative discharge (−FD) that propagated backward and overshoot the origin by a few hundred meters, as reported by an earlier 2D study. Surprisingly, the signal polarization, which measures the orientation of the discharge current, systematically slanted from the discharge propagation direction and rotated between the two opposite discharges, showing the +FD and −FD were driven by other storm‐independent factors in addition to the storm electric field, or otherwise all would align in the same direction. Assuming a cosmic‐ray shower (CRS) piercing through the cloud immediately before the +FD/−FD discharge, we found that their path is consistent with a pre‐ionized path by the CRS, and the polarizations for the two opposite discharges are consistent with the respective deflected trajectories of high‐energy positrons and electrons in the geomagnetic and an electric field. We further analyzed the more commonly observed +FD and showed that it is consistent with the CRS interpretation, suggesting these flashes in thunderstorms were ignited by cosmic‐ray showers."

To address this challenge, the IAP‐CAS A2D dynamical ensemble climate prediction system has been developed by expanding the existing operational sub‐seasonal to seasonal (S2S) prediction system approved by the WMO/WWRP S2S panel. Using a full‐field atmosphere‐ocean initialization experiment which covers the period from 1981 to 2015, several key findings are revealed: First, the model demonstrates significant positive skill for regional surface temperature predictions globally, except for the North Atlantic, likely due to the initial shock. Despite this, the model effectively captures the global mean surface temperature warming trend. Second, the model exhibits relatively high predictability for the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), with correlation skill up to 3 years, comparable to the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Decadal Climate Prediction Project multi‐model ensemble mean. The spread‐error ratios close to 1 in the PDO predictions indicate high reliability. Additionally, the model shows significant skill in predicting the El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) for up to 1 year, comparable to leading seasonal dynamical prediction models. Further analysis reveals an established teleconnection between ENSO and the North Pacific atmosphere in the IAP‐CAS model, likely underpinning the PDO predictive skill at forecast year 1.

In this study, aerosol samples collected throughout the year from a regional receptor site in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) were analyzed for BB tracers, primary biological aerosol particle (PBAP) tracers, and biogenic secondary organic aerosol tracers. The BB aerosol concentrations were highest from November to January, and this was mainly attributed to domestic biomass burning in southern China. Biomass burning emissions in Southeast Asia affected the PRD through long‐range transport between May and August. Two primary sugar concentration peaks, one in September and October and the other in March, may reflect regional plant phenology, and the constant concentrations for most of the year indicated regional PBAP background emissions. Concentration and correlation analyses indicated that the use of arabitol, erythritol, and inositol as PBAP tracers may not be appropriate because of strong interference by intensive BB emissions. Positive matrix factorization source apportionment showed that plant debris and fungal spores (46%) were the dominant contributors to BB and biogenic organic aerosols (BOAs) during the marine monsoon, but that BB (28%) was the most important contributor during the continental monsoon. The positive matrix factorization results agreed well with the molecular‐level radiocarbon‐based source apportionment results.

However, limited observations of dust particles in the free troposphere hinder our understanding of its spatial distribution and climatic impacts. In this study, aerosols were collected on filters using aircraft over the western North Pacific at 0.2–8 km altitudes in summer 2022. Individual water‐insoluble particles dispersed in water were analyzed using a complex amplitude sensor (CAS), which enabled classifying particle type, sizing, and counting from the particle's complex amplitude data. During the eight observation flights, the number and mass concentrations of dust were 1.2 ± 1.0 cm−3 and 0.6 ± 0.4 μg m−3 (mean ± 1σ), respectively, in the 0.3–2.5 μm diameter range, which were 2–3 orders of magnitude lower than previously reported values near the major dust sources in East Asia. A comparison with the total aerosol data from an optical particle counter onboard aircraft suggested that dust dominated aerosols larger than 0.8 μm, consistent with electron microscopy analyses. The observed dust size distributions implied more efficient removal of larger dust during transport. Since our samples were collected at −18°C to 21°C, the free tropospheric dust could contribute to ice formation in clouds. Our observation using the CAS revealed microphysical properties of dust over the western North Pacific when no distinct Asian dust events were observed near the ground, aiding in the validation of models that assess the climatic impacts of dust."

This paper examines three events (May 16‐23, June 3‐9 and June 17‐30, 2023) during which the composition of smoke was measured over Toronto and Egbert, Ontario. Tropospheric columns (0–10 km) of CO, C2H6, CH3OH, HCN, HCOOH, NH3 and O3 were measured using high‐resolution Fourier transform infrared spectrometers. Coincident enhancements of CO and other gases during the events were used to calculate enhancement ratios. Correlations with CO were observed for C2H6, CH3OH, HCN and HCOOH, but not for NH3 and O3. Plume transport was investigated with the Hybrid Single‐Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model, the GEM‐MACH‐FireWork (GM‐FW) air quality model, and Measurements of Pollution in the Troposphere (MOPITT) CO satellite data. Additional measurements examined were surface CO, O3, and PM2.5, plume height from a Mini Micro Pulse Lidar, and EM27/SUN XCO columns. GM‐FW model output was compared with ground‐based surface and 0–10 km column measurements, and MOPITT CO maps. Over the 2023 forest fire season (May‐September), the model underestimated background tropospheric columns of CO, NH3 and O3, but generally overestimated enhancements during smoke events. Relative to surface in situ measurements, GM‐FW seasonal averages overestimated CO and underestimated O3 (which was not generally enhanced during smoke events), while PM2.5 fluctuated between a positive and negative bias. Compared to MOPITT, the GM‐FW event‐averaged CO columns appropriately represent plume dispersion across the country, with some offsets on the scale of the ground‐based locations that are consistent with the discussed findings."

Here, we identify two types of BSISO events, one which propagates northward over South Asia from the equatorial Indian Ocean (EIO), and the other which doesn't. Contrasting their behavior shows that the northward propagation occurs in multiple stages after convection is initiated over the EIO. First, the convection moves into the southern Arabian Sea (AS) due to moistening of the free troposphere via horizontal BSISO anomalous winds acting on the background moisture distribution, and forms a northwest‐southeast (NW‐SE) oriented convection band. Subsequently, in the presence of an easterly vertical shear of monsoon winds and meridional gradient of anomalous vertical velocity, a NW‐SE oriented tilting term is generated that results in a tilted gyre north of the existing convective anomaly and south‐easterly BSISO winds over the South Asian landmass. In the second stage, these winds tap the ambient north‐westward moisture gradient and help move the convection further north over land. Moreover, the background winds advect anomalous moisture to initiate convection over the Bay of Bengal. For the non‐propagating events, though a Rossby gyre results as a response to the nascent EIO convection, it is smaller, thus the BSISO advection of background moisture is weaker and does not initiate convection over the southern AS. In turn, the meridional gradient of the anomalous vertical velocity is weak, and the background vertical shear cannot generate sufficient tilting over the northern AS. Therefore, the convective wind response stalls, and large‐scale convection does not propagate north of 15N. Thus, free‐tropospheric moisture advection and vortex tilting due to the background vertical shear work together for robust northward propagation of the BSISO, and strong BSISO easterlies over the southern AS is critical behind this propagation."

 Realizing high electroluminescence dissymmetric factor and high external quantum efficiency at the same time is challenging in light-emitting diodes with direct circularly polarized emission. Here, we show that high electroluminescence dissymmetric factor and high external quantum efficiency can be simultaneously achieved in light-emitting diodes based on chiral perovskite quantum dots. Specifically, chiral perovskite quantum dots with chiral-induced spin selectivity can concurrently serve as localized radiative recombination centers of spin-polarized carriers for circularly polarized emission, thereby suppressing the relaxation of spins, Meanwhile, improving the chiral ligand exchange efficiency is found to synergistically promote their spin selectivity and optoelectronic properties so that chiroptoelectronic performance of resulting devices can be facilitated. Our device simultaneously exhibits high electroluminescence dissymmetric factor (R: 0.285 and S: 0.251) and high external quantum efficiency (R: 16.8% and S: 16%), demonstrating their potential in constructing high-performance chiral light sources.

 Disorder is known to have a profound influence on classical phase transitions, and it is anticipated to be even more important for quantum phase transitions. However, experimental investigation of the influence of disorder on phase transitions normally requires numerous samples over the range of disorder.

 The targeting of cancer stem cells (CSCs) has proven to be an effective approach for limiting tumor progression, thus necessitating the identification of new drugs with anti-CSC activity. Through a high-throughput drug repositioning screen, we identify the antibiotic Nifuroxazide (NIF) as a potent anti-CSC compound. Utilizing a click chemistry strategy, we demonstrate that NIF is a prodrug that is specifically bioactivated in breast CSCs. Mechanistically, NIF-induced CSC death is a result of a synergistic action that combines the generation of DNA interstrand crosslinks with the inhibition of the Fanconi anemia (FA) pathway activity. NIF treatment mimics FA-deficiency through the inhibition of STAT3, which we identify as a non-canonical transcription factor of FA-related genes. NIF induces a chemical HRDness (Homologous Recombination Deficiency) in CSCs that (re)sensitizes breast cancers with innate or acquired resistance to PARP inhibitor (PARPi) in patient-derived xenograft models. Our results suggest that NIF may be useful in combination with PARPi for the treatment of breast tumors, regardless of their HRD status.

 The connection between amino acid metabolism and pyroptosis remains elusive. Herein, we screen the effect of individual amino acid on pyroptosis and identify that methionine inhibits GSDME-mediated pyroptosis. Mechanistic analyses unveil that MYO6, a unique actin-based motor protein, bridges the GSDME N-terminus (GSDME-NT) and the endocytic adaptor AP2, mediating endolysosomal degradation of GSDME-NT. This degradation is increased by the methionine-derived metabolite spermidine noncanonically by direct binding to MYO6, which enhances MYO6 selectivity for GSDME-NT. Moreover, combination targeted therapies using dietary or pharmacological inhibition in methionine-to-spermidine metabolism in the tumor promotes pyroptosis and anti-tumor immunity, leading to a stronger tumor-suppressive effect in in vivo models. Clinically, higher levels of tumor spermidine and expression of methionine-to-spermidine metabolism-related gene signature predict poorer survival. Conclusively, our research identifies an unrecognized mechanism of pyroptotic resistance mediated by methionine-spermidine metabolic axis, providing a fresh angle for cancer treatment.

Near full-length HIV-1 sequencing in longitudinal samples from matched blood, lymph nodes, and gut indicates that clones of infected cells, including those carrying an inducible provirus, persist and spread across various anatomical compartments. Finally, uniform genetic diversity across sites suggests the absence of ongoing replication in tissues under treatment.

The results show particularly strong losses of connectivity in deeper ocean strata, affecting 95% of abyssopelagic species. 
 Marine life are expected to have fewer thermal barriers restricting their movement to adjacent habitats than terrestrial species do. However, it remains unknown how this warming-induced connectivity loss varies in different ocean strata, limiting the predictability of warming impacts on biodiversity in the whole ocean. Here, we developed a climate connectivity framework across seascape strata under different climate change scenarios, which combines thermal gradient, human impacts and species tolerance thresholds. We show that warming may lead to connectivity loss, with its magnitude increasing with depth. Connectivity loss is projected to increase rapidly in 2050, particularly in deep strata, and may impair the movement capacity of deep-sea phyla in adapting to warming. With the compression of habitat ranges, over one-quarter of deep-sea species inhabit areas that may experience disrupted connectivity, threatening the maintenance of deep-sea biodiversity. Our results highlight the challenges that climate change poses to biodiversity conservation through disruption of deep-sea connectivity.

 Certification schemes for agriculture aim to incentivize sustainable land management. To be credible, they need robust metrics to assess the practices of producers. We demonstrate an approach for evaluating practice, which is repeatable and explicitly representative of stakeholders. We apply it to nomadic pastoralism in Mongolia, where livestock overgrazing is of concern. Our approach uses judgements from stakeholders about the sustainability of hypothetical but realistic herding scenarios. From these, we create models to predict sustainability scores. These can be applied as tools to assess the actual practices of herders. We use two judgement datasets: one representing producers’ judgements, another a subset that also conforms to the environmental expectations of the certifier. The differences must be negotiated when we choose evaluation methods. The approach could be used for any production system, provided variables are devised that summarize practice and appropriate stakeholders are available to judge the sustainability of different practices. Credible sustainability certifications require robust evaluation to ensure trustworthiness; however, judgements of sustainable practices may differ between the practitioners and the certifiers.

 Earth’s climate sensitivity quantifies the ultimate change in global mean surface air temperature in response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 concentrations. Recent assessments estimate that Earth’s climate sensitivity very likely lies between 2.3 °C and 4.7 °C, with the representation of clouds in climate models accounting for a large portion of its uncertainty. Here, we adjust the climate sensitivity of individual contemporary climate models after using satellite observations to alleviate biases in their representation of mixed-phase clouds. A resulting moderate average climate sensitivity of 3.63 ± 0.98(1σ) °C arises due to opposing responses of clouds. While increasing the proportion of liquid within cold clouds prior to CO2 doubling increases climate sensitivity via transitions from solid to liquid hydrometeors, a strongly opposing increase in reflective cloud cover decreases climate sensitivity. This emphasizes the need to reconsider the role of mixed-phase cloud cover changes in climate sensitivity assessments."

 Global high-resolution emission inventories of trace gases require refinement to align with ground-based observations, especially for extreme events and changing sources. This study utilizes two satellites to globally quantify NO2 and CO concentrations on daily to weekly scales and estimate emissions with uncertainty bounds, grid-by-grid, for regions with significant variability in 2010. These emissions demonstrate overall increased emissions and identify missing sources compared with various inventories. The NOx and CO emissions are 5.76 × 105–6.25 × 106 Mt/yr and 1.06 × 107–2.78 × 107 Mt/yr, representing a mean 200% and 130% increase. Significant emissions originate from typical and atypical sources, exhibiting short-to-medium-term variability, primarily driven by biomass burning and anthropogenic activities, with substantial redistribution and compression due to long-range transport. The extra CO emissions chemically decay into CO2, resulting in an increase in CO2 mass equivalent to 3.5% of CO2 emissions from Central Africa and 6.1% from Amazon, reflecting the importance of addressing CO from biomass burning."

 Mesoscale eddies are ubiquitous features in the ocean affecting the cycles of nutrients and carbon. Cyclonic eddies formed in Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems can substantially modulate primary production by phytoplankton and the vertical and lateral export of organic carbon. However, the impact of eddy activity on the biochemical composition of eukaryotic phytoplankton, bacteria and archaea and associated consequences for carbon and energy flows are largely unknown. Here, we investigated the microbial lipidome in the surface ocean in and around a cyclonic eddy formed in the coastal upwelling system off Mauritania. We show that the eddy contained almost three times the amount of lipids compared to the surrounding open-ocean and coastal waters. The eddy lipid signature with energy-rich triacylglycerols and essential fatty acid-containing membrane lipids of eukaryotic phytoplankton origin was further significantly different from the ambient waters. Strong variability in lipid distributions within the eddy was related to differences in microbial community composition. Estimates indicate that in the Mauritanian upwelling area, as much as 9.7 ± 2.0 gigagrams of lipid carbon per year is delivered to the open ocean by coastal cyclonic eddies potentially fueling higher trophic levels and contributing to the maintenance of secondary productivity and carbon export offshore.

 Anthropogenic activities such as hydraulic fracturing (HF) can trigger destructive earthquakes, the triggering mechanisms of which are still in debate. We utilize near-fault seismic recordings to study the preparatory phase of the 2019 ML 5.6 earthquake in the Weiyuan shale gas field (WSGF), Sichuan Basin, China, which struck 3 months after stimulation completion. This is one of the largest HF-triggered earthquakes worldwide. We observed an 11-month-long precursory fault activation, during which continuous seismicity illuminated the fault plane and provided warnings for a potential destructive earthquake. The fault activation is a consequence of injections in multiple HF well pads, with a variety of mechanisms at play. Numerical simulation reveals that the occurrence of the mainshock involves stress perturbation from post-injection aseismic slip. This work promotes our understanding of HF-induced earthquakes and suggests incorporating long-term near-fault observations and taking post-injection aseismic slip into account for effective hazard management.

Xi'an aerosols exhibited continental characteristics, with κccn = 0.26 ± 0.07 in summer and κccn = 0.33 ± 0.09 in winter.

 The increasing impacts on regional climate of sea ice anomalies have spatio-temporal uncertainties, this study investigates the possible relationships between Arctic sea ice anomalies and intra-seasonal evolution of winter temperature in Northwest China (with a particular emphasis on Xinjiang). The reanalysis dataset during 1990–2022 from the National Centers for Environmental Prediction and the National Center for Atmospheric Research are utilized, with multiple statistical methods including season-reliant empirical orthogonal function (EOF) and regression analysis being employed. The results show that the first and second EOF modes of intra-seasonal temperature evolution in winter over Xinjiang are characterized by in-phase and out-of-phase variations, explaining 32 % and 19 % variance, respectively. The in-phase (out-of-phase) evolution of intra-seasonal temperature is affected by the in-phase (out-of-phase) variations of sea ice in the Kara Sea-East Siberia Sea-Chukchi Sea (KEsC) and the Barents Sea (BS) during the preceding October. The reduction in the KEsC sea ice triggers upward-propagating wave energy anomalies, which is favorable for the wave train shaping as a meridional dipole pattern from the Ural Mountains to Central Asia in early winter through the stratosphere-troposphere coupling, thereby leading to temperature anomalies in Xinjiang during the following December and January. The BS sea ice anomalies favor the formation and maintenance of a North Atlantic Oscillation-like pattern, the wave energy disperses downstream and enhances in February, triggering a Scandinavian teleconnection pattern-like wave train. This leads to circulation anomalies over Xinjiang, further causes temperature anomalies in February. In summary, the KEsC and BS sea ice in October serves as key precursor signals impacting the intra-seasonal evolution of winter temperature in Xinjiang, with the significant impacts of sea ice in these two key regions on intra-seasonal temperature variations occurring at different times."

 This study analyzes the role of dust particles on the formation of an anomalous charge structure in a thunderstorm observed on 14 October 2016 around Corsica. The cloud-resolving model Meso-NH with explicit aerosol-microphysics coupling is used to simulate realistically the interactions between the storm and the dust plume. This reference simulation shows no liquid water content in the convective region below −10 °C, which is conducive to only positive charging of the graupel according to traditional liquid water content temperature diagrams of the non-inductive charging mechanism. Differential hydrometeor fall speeds lead to a positive charge region below a negative charge region at the cloud scale, the so-called anomalous charge structure.To disentangle between the radiative and microphysical role of dust particles on cloud structure, additional simulations are performed. First, using a climatological extinction of dust particles over Corsica, the microphysical structure of the storm is similar to the one of the reference simulation, excluding the radiative role of dust particles as a factor controling the charge structure in this case. Secondly, a low, constant and homogeneous ice nuclei particle concentration profile is imposed in the microphysics scheme. It enables the presence of supercooled water at temperatures below −20 °C, allowing the negative charging of the graupel at higher levels of the cloud, and potentially leading to a normal tripole. It highlights the role of desert dust as ice nuclei in the depletion of liquid water content in the mixed phase region of the cloud, which could lead to an anomalous charge structure."

 This study, using a dataset consisting of in-situ daily temperature records and ERA5 reanalysis data, analyses the extreme temperature events (i.e., heat waves and warm spells) occurred in the Apennine Mountains (Italy) over the period 1961–2022. The available dataset has been employed to meet the following two main goals: i) to assess the linear trends of the heat waves and warm spells in terms of number of events, duration, and severity by applying the Seasonal Kendall test; ii) to shed light, on a seasonal basis, on the synoptic climatology of such events. From the linear trend analysis, it emerged that the Apennines, as many other regions of the world, experienced an increasing trend in extreme temperature episodes. In particular, in the last 30-year reference period (1991–2020), the number of regional extreme heat events increased by 134 % in summer and 102 % in spring compared to the 1961–1990 period, while in winter and autumn the increase in warm spells is smaller (53 % and 27 %, respectively) and generally not statistically significant in terms of duration and severity. Using Principal Component Analysis and k-means clustering, several synoptic-scale patterns that can trigger extreme hot conditions in the study area are identified. In the last 30-year period, notable changes in the synoptic climatology of extreme heat events have been detected in summer, as well as in spring and autumn. Specifically, in summer the large-scale patterns characterised by a cyclonic area over the eastern North Atlantic (over the British Islands or off the coasts of Ireland) and by a ridge from North Africa to the eastern Europe provide a larger relative contribution to the total number of events. Such patterns promote the advection, over the study area, of hot subtropical air masses, mainly at mid-tropospheric levels. Summer heat waves in the Apennines are generally preceded and accompanied by negative sea surface temperature anomaly with a negative tendency in the eastern North Atlantic area.Such results supply new insights about the links between extreme heat events in the central Mediterranean area and large-scale atmospheric types as well as useful tools to improve the predictability of heat waves and warm spells at both meteorological and climatological time scales."

 The abrupt alternation between floods and droughts can have catastrophic impacts on local communities. In 2019, Southeast China experiences an extreme flood-drought abrupt alternation (FDAA), characterized by record-breaking flood in July and extreme drought in August. This study investigates the atmospheric circulations driving this FDAA and identifies the key mechanisms involved. Both the flood in July and the drought in August are closely associated with cyclonic circulation anomalies, but with distinct locations and dynamics. In July, a cyclonic anomaly over the East China Sea causes moisture convergence and ascending motions, leading to heavy rainfall. In contrast, two cyclonic anomalies in August—one over Northeast China and the other over the Western North Pacific (WNP)—induce northerly winds, moisture divergence, and descending motions, resulting in rainfall deficits. The July cyclonic anomaly is linked to positive soil moisture anomalies over Eastern Europe, which, through cooling surface air temperature, triggers eastward-propagating wave trains that induce cyclonic anomalies over the East China Sea. The August anomalies, on the other hand, are connected to North Atlantic and tropical Indian/Pacific SST anomalies. North Atlantic SST anomalies induce the anomalous Northeast China cyclone through modifying overlying atmosphere and triggering eastward-propagating wave trains. Significant positive IOD and warm SST anomalies over the central Pacific collaboratively trigger cyclonic circulation anomalies over the WNP through modifying the Walker circulation and the Hadley circulation. Our findings highlight the importance of understanding intraseasonal changes in tropical and midlatitude forcings to improve predictions and mitigate the impacts of compound climate disasters."
