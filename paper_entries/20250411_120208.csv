A photometer was used to observe the vertical component of the GWs, whereas the horizontal component was observed by an all-sky imager. Using the parameters from these two instruments and background wind from meteor radar, the momentum flux and potential energy of the GWs were determined and studied. It is noted that the dynamics of the downward-propagating GWs were controlled by observed ducts. 
 Momentum flux and propagation dynamics of two vertically propagating atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) are studied using observations at São João do Cariri (7.40° S, 36.31° W), Brazil, from co-located photometer, all-sky imager, and meteor radar instruments. Time series of the atomic oxygen green line (OI 557.7 nm), molecular oxygen (O2 (0–1)), sodium D-line (NaD), and hydroxyl (OH (6–2)) airglow intensity variations measured by the photometer were used to investigate the vertical characteristics and vertical phase progression of the GWs with similar (± 10 % of the error margin) or nearly the same (± 5 % of the error margin) period across these emission layers. The horizontal parameters of the same GWs were determined from the OH airglow images, whereas the intrinsic parameters of the horizontal and vertical components of the GWs were estimated with the aid of the observed winds. Using the phase of the GWs at each emission layer, the characteristics of the phase progression exhibited near-vertical propagation under a duct background propagation condition. This indicates that the duct contributes significantly to the observed near-vertical phase propagation. The GW momentum flux and potential energy were estimated using the rotational temperatures of OH and O2, revealing that the time series of momentum fluxes and potential energies are higher in the O2 emission band than in the OH band, indicating a transfer of momentum and energy across OH to the O2 altitude. These results reveal the effect of a duct on vertically propagating GWs and the associated momentum flux and potential energy transfer from the lower to the upper altitudes in the mesosphere."

Fossum;Darius Ceburnis;Lu Lei;Chunshui Lin;Wei Xu;Colin O'Dowd;Jurgita Ovadnevaite,Marine organic aerosol at Mace Head: effects from phytoplankton and source region variability,"This study presents the first source apportionment of organic aerosol at Mace Head via high-resolution mass spectrometry. Introducing transfer entropy as a novel method reveals that aged organic aerosol originates from both open-ocean ozonolysis and local peat-burning oxidation. Methanesulfonic acid and organic sea spray both mirror phytoplankton activity, with the former closely tied to coccolithophore blooms and the latter linked to diatoms, chlorophytes, and cyanobacteria. 
 Organic aerosol (OA) is recognized as a significant component of particulate matter (PM), yet their specific composition and sources, especially over remote areas, remain elusive due to the overall scarcity of high-resolution online data. In this study, positive matrix factorization was performed on organic aerosol mass spectra obtained from high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) measurements to resolve sources contributing to coastal PM. The focus was on a summertime period marked by enhanced biological productivity with prevailing pristine maritime conditions. Four OA factors were deconvolved by the source apportionment model. The analysis revealed primary marine organic aerosol (PMOA) as the predominant submicron OA at Mace Head during summertime, accounting for 42 % of the total resolved mass. This was trailed by more oxidized oxygenated organic aerosol (MO-OOA) at 32 %, methanesulfonic acid organic aerosol (MSA-OA) at 17 %, and locally emitted peat-derived organic aerosol (peat-OA) at 9 % of the total OA mass. Elemental ratios (O:C–H:C) were derived for each of these factors: PMOA (0.66–1.16), MO-OOA (0.78–1.39), MSA-OA (0.66–1.39), and peat-OA (0.43–1.34). The specific O:C–H:C range for MO-OOA hints at aliphatic and lignin-like compounds contributing to more oxidized organic aerosol formation. The total mass concentrations of primary organic aerosol and secondary organic aerosol were overall equal and almost exclusively present in the marine boundary layer, in agreement with previous findings. This study reveals that OA not only reflects atmospheric chemistry and meteorology – as evidenced by the significant ageing of summertime polar air masses over the North Atlantic, driven by ozonolysis under Greenland anticyclonic conditions – but also serves as an indicator of marine ecosystems. This is evident from MSA-OA being notably associated with stress enzyme markers and PMOA showing the typical makeup of largely abacterial phytoplankton extracellular metabolic processes. This study also reveals distinct source regions within the North Atlantic for OA factors. MSA-OA is primarily associated with the Iceland Basin, with rapid production following coccolithophore blooms (lag of 1–2 d), while diatoms contribute to a slower formation process (lag of 9 d), reflecting distinct oceanic biological processes. In contrast, PMOA is sourced from more variable ecoregions, including the southern Celtic Sea, western European Basin, and Newfoundland Basin, with additional contributions from chlorophytes and cyanobacteria at more southerly latitudes. Overall, these findings emphasize the need for longer-term investigations to further map the influence of phytoplankton taxa variability on aerosol composition and the broader impacts on aerosol–climate interactions."

Wake;Becky Alexander,Dimethyl sulfide chemistry over the industrial era: comparison of key oxidation mechanisms and long-term observations,"Marine phytoplankton emit dimethyl sulfide (DMS), which forms methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and sulfate. MSA concentrations in ice cores decreased over the industrial era, which has been attributed to pollution-driven changes in DMS chemistry. We use a model to investigate DMS chemistry compared to observations of DMS, MSA, and sulfate. We find that modeled DMS, MSA, and sulfate are influenced by pollution-sensitive oxidant concentrations, characterization of DMS chemistry, and other variables. 
 Dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is primarily emitted by marine phytoplankton and oxidized in the atmosphere to form methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and sulfate aerosols. Ice cores in regions affected by anthropogenic pollution show an industrial-era decline in MSA, which has previously been interpreted as indicating a decline in phytoplankton abundance. However, a simultaneous increase in DMS-derived sulfate (bioSO4) in a Greenland ice core suggests that pollution-driven oxidant changes caused the decline in MSA by influencing the relative production of MSA versus bioSO4. Here we use GEOS-Chem, a global chemical transport model, and a zero-dimensional box model over three time periods (preindustrial era, peak North Atlantic NOx pollution, and 21st century) to investigate the chemical drivers of industrial-era changes in MSA and bioSO4, and we examine whether four DMS oxidation mechanisms reproduce trends and seasonality in observations. We find that box model and GEOS-Chem simulations can only partially reproduce ice core trends in MSA and bioSO4 and that wide variation in model results reflects sensitivity to DMS oxidation mechanism and oxidant concentrations. Our simulations support the hypothesized increase in DMS oxidation by the nitrate radical over the industrial era, which increases bioSO4 production, but competing factors such as oxidation by BrO result in increased MSA production in some simulations, which is inconsistent with observations. To improve understanding of DMS oxidation, future work should investigate aqueous-phase chemistry, which produces 82 %–99 % of MSA and bioSO4 in our simulations, and constrain atmospheric oxidant concentrations, including the nitrate radical, hydroxyl radical, and reactive halogens."

We develop climatological relationships to estimate potential persistent contrail formation for existing as well as future aircraft and propulsion system designs. We identify latitudes and pressure levels where the introduction of novel aircraft designs would result in significant changes in potential persistent contrail formation compared to existing conventional aircraft. 
 Mounting evidence has highlighted the role of aviation non-CO2 emissions in anthropogenic climate change. Of particular importance is the impact of contrails, to which recent studies attribute over one-third of the total effective radiative forcing from aircraft operations. However, the relative importance of the aircraft-design-dependent and environmental factors that influence the formation of persistent contrails is not yet well understood. In this paper, we use ERA5 data from the 2010s to better understand the interplay between the factors on a climatological timescale. We identify ice supersaturation as the most limiting factor for all aircraft designs considered, underscoring the importance of accurately estimating ice supersaturated regions. We also develop climatological relationships that describe potential persistent contrail formation as a function of the pressure level and Schmidt–Appleman mixing line slope. We find that the influence of aircraft design on persistent contrail formation reduces with increasing altitude. Compared to a state-of-the-art conventional aircraft with an overall propulsion system efficiency of 0.37, water vapour extraction technologies envisioned for the future have the potential to reduce persistent contrail formation by up to 85.1 %. On the other hand, compared to the same reference, hydrogen combustion and fuel cell aircraft could increase globally averaged persistent contrail formation by 46.5 % and 54.7 % respectively. Due to differing contrail properties, further work is required to translate these changes into climate impacts. This study is a step towards the development of a new and computationally inexpensive method to analyse the contrail climate impact of novel aviation fuels and propulsion technologies."

To address these, it introduces the empirical scattering model (ESM) based on high-quality Doppler spectra from a 94 GHz radar. The ESM offers improved accuracy and directly incorporates natural rain's microphysical effects. This new model can enhance retrieval and calibration methods, benefiting cloud radar polarimetry experts and scattering modelers. 
 The established relationships between the size, shape, and terminal velocity of raindrops, along with the spheroidal shape approximation (SSA), are commonly employed for calculating radar observables in rain. This study, however, reveals the SSA's limitations in accurately simulating spectral and integrated backscattering polarimetric variables in rain at the W-band.Improving existing models is a complex task that demands high-precision data from both laboratory settings and natural rain, enhanced stochastic shape approximation techniques, and comprehensive scattering simulations. To circumvent these challenges, this study introduces a simpler and more straightforward approach – the empirical scattering model (ESM).The ESM is derived from an analysis of high-quality, low-turbulence Doppler spectra, which were selected from measurements taken with a 94 GHz radar at three different locations between 2021 and 2024. The ESM's primary advantages over the SSA include superior accuracy and the direct incorporation of microphysical effects observed in natural rain.This study demonstrates that the ESM can potentially clarify issues in existing retrieval and calibration methods that use polarimetric observations at the W-band. The findings of this study are valuable not only for experts in cloud radar polarimetry but also for scattering modelers and laboratory experimenters since explaining the presented observations necessitates a more profound understanding of the microphysical properties and processes in rain."

 From autumn 2021 through summer 2023, scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and partners conducted the Study of Precipitation, the Lower Atmosphere, and Surface for Hydrometeorology (SPLASH) campaign in the East River watershed of Colorado. One objective of SPLASH was to observe the transfer of energy between the atmosphere and the surface, which was done at several locations. Two remote sites were chosen that did not have access to power utilities. These were along the valley floor near the East River in the vicinity of the unincorporated town of Gothic, Colorado. Energy balance measurements were made at these locations using autonomous, single-level flux towers referred to as atmospheric surface flux stations (ASFSs). The ASFSs were deployed on 28 September 2021 at the Kettle Ponds Annex site and on 12 October 2021 at the Avery Picnic site and operated until 19 July and 21 June 2023, respectively. Measurements included basic meteorology; upward and downward longwave and shortwave radiative fluxes and subsurface conductive flux, each at 1 min resolution; 3-D winds from a sonic anemometer and H2O/CO2 from an open-path gas analyzer, both at 20 Hz from which sensible, latent heat, and CO2 fluxes were derived; and profiles of soil properties in the upper 0.5 m (both sites) and temperature profiles through the snow (at Avery Picnic), each reported between 10 min and 6 h. The system uptime was 97 % (Kettle Ponds) and 90 % (Avery Picnic), and collectively 1184 d of data was obtained between the stations. The purpose of this article is to document the ASFS deployment at SPLASH, to document the data acquisition and post-processing of measurements, and to serve as a guide for interested users of the data sets, which are archived at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10313363, Cox et al., 2023b; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10327409, Cox et al., 2023c; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10313894, Cox et al., 2023d; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10307825, Cox et al., 2023e; https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10310520, Cox et al., 2023f) with the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license."

The provided time series and catchment attributes will be of interest to those modelers wishing to analyze hydrological behavior and perform model assessments. 
 Over the last decade, large-sample approaches, i.e., based on large catchment sets, have become increasingly popular in hydrological studies. Efforts were made to assemble and disseminate national catchment datasets. This article aims to make a contribution to the construction of a large international database of catchments by proposing the CAMELS-FR dataset, a contribution to the CAMELS (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies) initiative. The first version presented here gathers hydroclimatic data and physical attributes for a set of 654 catchments in France. These catchments cover a wide spectrum of hydroclimatic conditions (from oceanic to continental, mountainous, or Mediterranean conditions) and are considered to have limited human influence. Data include time series of daily streamflow (with at least 30 years over the 1970–2021 period, also aggregated to monthly and yearly time steps) and of 11 catchment-scale daily climate variables (including precipitation, potential evaporation, and air temperature), as well as a total of 255 catchment attributes organized into 10 classes (e.g., geology, soil, land cover). River flow time series were quality-checked. Along with the database itself, two graphical tools are proposed, namely dynamic graphs to visualize time series and graphical fact sheets to summarize the main catchment characteristics. Care was taken to provide as many metadata as possible to help users interpret their results based on this dataset. We intend to update the database regularly to include new available data and account for end users' feedback. CAMELS-FR (Delaigue et al., 2024c) is available at https://doi.org/10.57745/WH7FJR."

However, comprehensively quantifying the contribution of microplastics with different biodegradability to AMR is lacking. In this study, we systematically quantified AMR risk mediated by biodegradable and nonbiodegradable microplastics using abundance-based methods and a custom AMR risk ranking framework that includes antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) abundance, mobility, and host pathogenicity. Our results demonstrated that biodegradable microplastics exhibited higher AMR risk compared to that of nonbiodegradable plastics. Key resistance genes, including those for multidrug, bacitracin, and aminoglycoside resistance, were predominant. Machine learning analysis identified cell motility as the most significant signature associated with AMR risk, highlighting its potential role in promoting ARGs dissemination. In addition, biodegradable microplastics promoted oxidative stress and SOS responses, which likely enhanced horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and AMR. Metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) analysis uncovered the colocalization of microplastic degradation genes, ARGs, and virulence factors (VFs), further supporting the elevated risk in biodegradable plastisphere. The proximity of ARGs to mobile genetic elements (MGEs) suggests that microplastic degradation processes might favor ARGs mobility. These findings would contribute critical insights into AMR dissemination in the plastisphere, emphasizing the need for integrated environmental and public health strategies under the context of One Health."

The present study evaluated biofilm formation and bioluminescence of a marine bacterium on poly(vinyl chloride) MPs and examined the predative behavior of fish Sphaeramia nematoptera toward glowing and nonglowing MPs. Biofilm formation was significantly higher on UV-aged MPs than on pristine MPs, ethanol-washed MPs, and silica sand. Microplastics and their leachates enhanced the bioluminescence of the bacteria with maximum increases of 60% and 70% for pristine and UV-aged MPs, respectively, primarily driven by Ca2+ release. Behavioral assays showed that fish preferentially fed on glowing MPs, indicating that bioluminescence enhanced the visibility and attractiveness of MPs. These findings suggest that interactions between MPs and luminescent bacteria may boost the tendency of fish to feed on MPs, raising concerns about their potential accumulation in marine food webs."

However, the underlying physicochemical mechanism of how organic matter, such as BBOA, promotes ice nucleation remains difficult to predict. Here, we investigated the ice-nucleating ability of lignin, a major component of BBOA, by synthesizing lignin nanoparticles (LNPs) from three different plant sources, namely, a conifer (softwood, sw), an angiosperm (hardwood, hw), and grass (g). First, we used a precipitation technique to make polydispersed LNP suspensions with acetone and water as antisolvents. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images indicated that the LNP samples were spherical and, notably, that the surface of grass LNP appeared floccose compared to the other two LNP types. Using our custom-built drop Freezing Ice Nuclei Counter (FINC), we found that LNPs from softwood (LNPsw) were the most ice-active with a median ice nucleation temperature, T50, of −15.6 °C at a concentration of 0.2 mg/mL. 31P NMR suggested that LNPsw had the lowest number of hydroxyl groups, indicating that the functional groups present at the surface of the nanoparticles may be impacting the ice nucleation ability of LNPs. We then separated LNPsw by size with cascade centrifugation to create three distinct size bins of particles with mean diameters of 79, 154, and 279 nm. Nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) was used to quantify the size, surface area, and particle number of these size-resolved LNPsw. Despite their different sizes, all size-resolved LNPsw suspensions at 0.2 mg/mL were ice active at the same temperature, with T50 values ranging from −14.9 to −15.9 °C. Remarkably, solubilized lignin, which did not undergo the nanoprecipitation procedure, froze in the same temperature range. Thus, the conversion of solubilized lignin into nanoparticles did not improve the ice nucleation ability of softwood lignin. We reconcile these results with a proposed role of the aggregation of lignin, as nanoparticles or dissolved, which facilitates the ice nucleation of aqueous droplets of lignin. Overall, the chemical composition and the ability of nonproteinaceous organic matter to aggregate may govern its ice nucleating ability. These findings help us understand how BBOA nucleate ice and impacts the formation and phase of clouds in the atmosphere."

This relationship is mostly evident for particles in the ultrafine size range. Furthermore, epidemiological research has found that those who live near airports have increased risks of premature mortality, decreased lung function, and adverse birth outcomes. Previous exposure studies of airport emissions have been based in urban centers, making it difficult to selectively measure airport emissions without the contribution of other related sources. Our aim was to characterize the relationships between air pollutant particle measures (ultrafine particles [UFP], fine particulate matter [PM2.5], black carbon [BC]) and air traffic (landings and take-offs [LTO]) at the Ottawa International Airport [YOW]. A monitoring site was established in greenspace approximately 600 m east of YOW and away from roadways and urban development. Air pollutant particles were measured continuously from June 2022 to January 2023. Flight track data was used to derive hourly LTO counts. Analyses of source directionality showed that UFP concentrations were higher when downwind from the airport. Further, when wind speeds were less than 20 km/h, UFP and LTO showed similar diurnal trends. No evidence of these associations was evident for PM2.5 and BC. After selecting for airport wind directions and wind speeds less than 20 km/h, linear regression models showed each additional takeoff led to a 10–13% increase in the 50th to 99th UFP concentration percentiles.

Here, we investigate the Hg concentration and isotopic composition of loess‐paleosol sequences covering three glacial‐interglacial cycles (spanning 350–80 ka). Paleosol layers display higher THg, Δ199Hg, and Δ200Hg values than loess layers, meaning enhanced Hg(II) wet deposition during interglacials. Based on a Δ200Hg‐based mixing model, Hg(II) wet and Hg(0) dry depositions account for 42% and 58% of Hg input into the Chinese Loess Plateau during interglacials but 21% and 79% during glacials, respectively. This work highlights a strong climatic control on atmospheric Hg deposition at glacial‐interglacial time scales, and suggests that atmospheric Hg deposition will likely increase in middle latitudes without considering perturbations of anthropogenic emissions."

We lack a quantitative understanding of how much n $n$ affects ice‐loss projections, and its significance relative to other sources of uncertainty. Here, we test the effect of n=3 $n=3$ versus n=4 $n=4$ in a series of 300‐year forward simulations of the Amundsen Sea Embayment, West Antarctica. We find that in periods of rapid grounding line retreat, uncertainty in n $n$ leads to a larger spread in ice‐loss projections than the spread due to uncertainty in climate forcing. The spatial sensitivity of n $n$ is generally proportional to change in strain rates, so we expect regions undergoing more moderate dynamic change to be less sensitive to n $n$."

Northern Hemisphere (NH) midlatitude GW activity during these events shared similarities. Variations in mesospheric GW activity showed an evident correlation with the magnitude of zonal wind in the upper stratosphere. NH midlatitude GW activity at ∼ $\mathit{\sim }$87 km was reduced following the onset of SSWs, likely caused by wind filtering and wave saturation. The upward propagation of GWs was suppressed when the zonal wind reversed from eastward to westward in the upper stratosphere. In regions where the zonal wind weakened but remained eastward, the weakened GWs could be due to their refraction to shorter vertical wavelengths."

Cloud‐controlling factor (CCF) analysis is an approach used to observationally constrain cloud feedback, and subsequently the climate sensitivity. Although high clouds contribute significantly toward uncertainty, they have received comparatively little attention in CCF and other observational analyses. Here we use CCF analysis for the first time to constrain the high‐cloud radiative feedback, focusing on the cloud amount component owing to its dominant contribution to uncertainty in high‐cloud feedback. Globally, observations indicate larger decreases in high cloudiness than state‐of‐the‐art climate models suggest. In fact, half of the 16 models considered here predict radiative feedbacks inconsistent with observations, likely due to misrepresenting the stability iris mechanism. Despite the suggested strong high‐cloud amount decreases with warming, observations point toward a near‐neutral net high‐cloud amount radiative feedback, owing to almost canceling longwave and shortwave contributions."

Our results highlight the 45° obliquity between the strike of crustal thinning and extension direction, which is accommodated by two transfer zones during the formation of the Continent‐Ocean Transition (COT). This obliquity causes the margin to be segmented, which predates seafloor spreading. Along strike, we find a progressive eastward crustal thinning from 13 to 5 km, corresponding to a V‐shaped COT. This eastward variation is characterized by (a) an eastward increase of mantle exhumation due to detachment faulting, and (b) post‐rift magmatism emplaced onto serpentinized mantle in the west."

Through analysis of two climate model ensembles, we find that internal wind driven ocean circulation variability delays the time of emergence of SST signals nearly everywhere, but the delay is longest (>10 years) in dynamically active regions like the tropical oceans. We also find that internal wind driven ocean circulation variability is the dominant contributor to changes in the amplitude of internal SST variability over the historical period.

Core convection is strongly constrained by rotation while being turbulent. Given the difficulty in modeling these conditions, some key properties of core convection are still debated, including the dominant energy‐carrying lengthscale. Different regimes of rapidly rotating, unmagnetized, turbulent convection exist depending on the importance of viscous and inertial forces in the dynamics, and hence different theoretical predictions for the dominant flow lengthscale have been proposed. Here we study the transition from viscously dominated to inertia‐dominated regimes using numerical simulations in spherical and planar geometries. We find that the cross‐over occurs when the inertial lengthscale approximately equals the viscous lengthscale. This suggests that core convection in the absence of magnetic fields is dominated by the inertial scale, which is hundred times larger than the viscous scale."

There are many potential pathways and barriers to decarbonizing the diverse and fragmented international shipping sector, with numerous uncertainties. Here, we employ expert elicitation, gathering perspectives from 149 world‐leading experts in maritime shipping and decarbonization, to characterize uncertainties in shipping decarbonization pathways. These experts predict a 30%–40% (25th–75th percentile range) carbon intensity reduction by 2030 compared to 2008, meeting the International Maritime Organization's (IMO) target. By 2050, they anticipate an approximate 40%–75% cut in GHG emissions, falling short of the IMO's 2050 net‐zero GHG goal. Responding experts see decarbonization occurring through three types of measures: operational, technological, and alternative energy sources. In the short‐term, decarbonization is predicted to be dominated by operational measures, while in the long‐term, it will be dominated by alternative energy, although there is no consensus on which fuels will dominate. Technological upgrades are expected to play crucial supporting roles. The experts believe that differences in business models and governance may lead to different decarbonization pathways by ship segment. The experts' qualitative responses highlight: alternative energy systems, ship fleet turnover, spillover effects from other sectors, reducing industry pessimism, and the supply chain as critical leverage points that can propel shipping toward sustainable decarbonization pathways.

 A comprehensive differential diagnosis is a cornerstone of medical care that is often reached through an iterative process of interpretation that combines clinical history, physical examination, investigations and procedures. Interactive interfaces powered by large language models present new opportunities to assist and automate aspects of this process1. Here we introduce the Articulate Medical Intelligence Explorer (AMIE), a large language model that is optimized for diagnostic reasoning, and evaluate its ability to generate a differential diagnosis alone or as an aid to clinicians. Twenty clinicians evaluated 302 challenging, real-world medical cases sourced from published case reports. Each case report was read by two clinicians, who were randomized to one of two assistive conditions: assistance from search engines and standard medical resources; or assistance from AMIE in addition to these tools. All clinicians provided a baseline, unassisted differential diagnosis prior to using the respective assistive tools. AMIE exhibited standalone performance that exceeded that of unassisted clinicians (top-10 accuracy 59.1% versus 33.6%, P = 0.04). Comparing the two assisted study arms, the differential diagnosis quality score was higher for clinicians assisted by AMIE (top-10 accuracy 51.7%) compared with clinicians without its assistance (36.1%; McNemar’s test: 45.7, P < 0.01) and clinicians with search (44.4%; McNemar’s test: 4.75, P = 0.03). Further, clinicians assisted by AMIE arrived at more comprehensive differential lists than those without assistance from AMIE. Our study suggests that AMIE has potential to improve clinicians’ diagnostic reasoning and accuracy in challenging cases, meriting further real-world evaluation for its ability to empower physicians and widen patients’ access to specialist-level expertise. Diagnostic reasoning using an optimized large language model with a dataset comprising real-world medical cases exhibited improved differential diagnostic performance as an assistive tool for clinicians over search engines and standard medical resources."

 Neural circuit function is shaped both by the cell types that comprise the circuit and the connections between them1. Neural cell types have previously been defined by morphology2,3, electrophysiology4, transcriptomic expression5,6, connectivity7–9 or a combination of such modalities10–12. The Patch-seq technique enables the characterization of morphology, electrophysiology and transcriptomic properties from individual cells13–15. These properties were integrated to define 28 inhibitory, morpho-electric-transcriptomic (MET) cell types in mouse visual cortex16, which do not include synaptic connectivity. Conversely, large-scale electron microscopy (EM) enables morphological reconstruction and a near-complete description of a neuron’s local synaptic connectivity, but does not include transcriptomic or electrophysiological information. Here, we leveraged morphological information from Patch-seq to predict the transcriptomically defined cell subclass and/or MET-type of inhibitory neurons within a large-scale EM dataset. We further analysed Martinotti cells—a somatostatin (Sst)-positive17 morphological cell type18,19—which were classified successfully into Sst MET-types with distinct axon myelination and synaptic output connectivity patterns. We demonstrate that morphological features can be used to link cell types across experimental modalities, enabling further comparison of connectivity to gene expression and electrophysiology. We observe unique connectivity rules for predicted Sst cell types.

 Four-wave mixing is a nonlinear optical phenomenon that can be used for wideband low-noise optical amplification and wavelength conversion. It has been extensively investigated for applications in communications1, computing2, metrology3, imaging4 and quantum optics5. With its advantages of small footprint, large nonlinearity and dispersion-engineering capability, optical integrated waveguides are excellent candidates for realizing high-gain and large-bandwidth four-wave mixing for which anomalous dispersion is a key condition. Various waveguides based on, for example, silicon, aluminium gallium arsenide and nonlinear glass have been studied6–10, but suffer from considerable gain and bandwidth reductions, as conventional design approaches for anomalous dispersion result in multi-mode operation. We present a methodology for fabricating nonlinear waveguides with simultaneous single-mode operation and anomalous dispersion for ultra-broadband operation and high-efficiency four-wave mixing. Although we implemented this in silicon nitride waveguides, the design approach can be used with other platforms as well. By using higher-order dispersion, we achieved unprecedented amplification bandwidths of more than 300 nm in these ultra-low-loss integrated waveguides. Penalty-free all-optical wavelength conversion of 100 Gbit s−1 data in a single optical channel of over 200 nm was realized. These single-mode dispersion-engineered nonlinear waveguides could become practical building blocks in various nonlinear photonics applications.

 Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) binding proteins (dsRBPs) play crucial roles in various cellular processes, especially in the innate immune response. Comprehensive characterization of dsRBPs is essential to understand the intricate mechanisms for dsRNA sensing and response. Traditional methods have predominantly relied on affinity purification, favoring the isolation of strong dsRNA binders. Here, we adopt the proteome integral solubility alteration (PISA) workflow for characterizing dsRBPs, resulting in the observation of 18 known dsRBPs and the identification of 200 potential dsRBPs. Next, we focus on zinc finger protein 385 A (ZNF385A) and discover that its knockout activates the transcription of interferon-β in the absence of immunogenic stimuli. The knockout of ZNF385A elevates the level of endogenous dsRNAs, especially transcripts associated with retroelements, such as short interspersed nuclear element (SINE), long interspersed nuclear element (LINE), and long terminal repeat (LTR). Moreover, loss of ZNF385A enhances the bioactivity of 5-Aza-2’-deoxycytidine (5-AZA-CdR) and tumor-killing effect of NK cells. Our findings greatly expand the dsRBP reservoir and contribute to the understanding of cellular dsRNA homeostasis. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is key in immunity and cellular regulation.

 Rangeomorphs are among the oldest anatomically complex macroscopic fossil organisms and, originating prior to 574 Ma, they represent the earliest total-group eumetazoans. Rangeomorph morphogenesis is therefore significant for understanding the early diversification of eumetazoan bodyplans. However, previous analyses of rangeomorph development have focused on uniterminal forms (possessing only one frond), leaving biterminal and multiterminal rangeomorph bodyplans poorly understood. We describe a population of the biterminal rangeomorph Fractofusus andersoni from the Mistaken Point Ecological Reserve UNESCO World Heritage Site of Newfoundland, Canada, and construct a model of growth in F. andersoni that rationalises variation between Fractofusus, Charnia, Bradgatia and other rangeomorphs, providing a framework for explaining evolutionary transitions between the bodyplans of these members of the eumetazoan stem-group. Our results imply that complex developmental regulatory machinery was already being utilised during the late Ediacaran in the earliest-diverging eumetazoan taxa represented in the fossil record.

 The biotransformation of nanoparticles plays a crucial role in determining their biological fate and responses. Although a few engineering strategies (e.g., surface functionalization and shape control) have been employed to regulate the fate of nanoparticles, the genetic control of nanoparticle biotransformation remains an unexplored avenue. Herein, we utilized a CRISPR-based genome-scale knockout approach to identify genes involved in the biotransformation of rare earth oxide (REO) nanoparticles. We found that the biotransformation of REOs in lysosomes could be genetically controlled via SMPD1. Specifically, suppression of SMPD1 inhibited the transformation of La2O3 into sea urchin-shaped structures, thereby protecting against lysosomal damage, proinflammatory cytokine release, pyroptosis and RE-induced pneumoconiosis.

 The dynamic three-dimensional spatial conformations of chromosomes demonstrate complex structural variations across single cells, which plays pivotal roles in modulating single-cell specific transcription and epigenetics landscapes. The high rates of missing contacts in single-cell chromatin contact maps impose significant challenges to reconstruct high-resolution spatial chromatin configurations. We develop a data-driven algorithm, Tensor-FLAMINGO, based on a low-rank tensor completion strategy. Implemented on a diverse panel of single-cell chromatin datasets, Tensor-FLAMINGO generates 10kb- and 30kb-resolution spatial chromosomal architectures across individual cells. Tensor-FLAMINGO achieves superior accuracy in reconstructing 3D chromatin structures, recovering missing contacts, and delineating cell clusters. The unprecedented high-resolution characterization of single-cell genome folding enables expanded identification of single-cell specific long-range chromatin interactions, multi-way spatial hubs, and the mechanisms of disease-associated GWAS variants.

 The regulation of polymerisation and translocation of biomolecules is fundamental. Wzc, an integral cytoplasmic membrane tyrosine autokinase protein serves as the master regulator of the biosynthesis and export of many bacterial capsular polysaccharides and exopolysaccharides. Such polysaccharides play essential roles in infection, defence, and some are important industrial products. Wzc comprises a large periplasmic domain, two transmembrane helices and a C-terminal cytoplasmic kinase domain with a tyrosine-rich tail. Wzc regulates polymerisation functions through cycling the formation and dissociation of an octameric complex, driven by changes in the phosphorylation status of the tyrosine-rich tail. E. coli Wzc serves a model for a wider family of polysaccharide co-polymerases. Here, we determine structures of intermediate states with different extents of phosphorylation. Structural and computational data reveal the pre-ordering of the tyrosine-rich tail, the molecular basis underlying the unidirectionality of phosphorylation events, and the underlying structural dynamics on how phosphorylation status is transmitted.

 Conjugated bile acids (BAs) are multi-functional detergents in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract produced by the liver enzyme bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase (BAAT) and by the microbiome from the acyltransferase activity of bile salt hydrolase (BSH). Humans with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) have an enrichment in both host and microbially conjugated BAs (MCBAs), but their impacts on GI inflammation are not well understood. We investigated the role of host-conjugated BAs in a mouse model of colitis using a BAAT knockout background. Baat−/− KO mice have severe phenotypes in the colitis model that were rescued by supplementation with taurocholate (TCA). Gene expression and histology showed that this rescue was due to an improved epithelial barrier integrity and goblet cell function. However, metabolomics also showed that TCA supplementation resulted in extensive metabolism to secondary BAs. We therefore investigated the BSH activity of diverse gut bacteria on a panel of conjugated BAs and found broad hydrolytic capacity depending on the bacterium and the amino acid conjugate. The complexity of this microbial BA hydrolysis led to the exploration of bsh genes in metagenomic data from human IBD patients. Certain bsh sequences were enriched in people with Crohn’s disease particularly that from Ruminococcus gnavus. This study shows that both host and microbially conjugated BAs may provide benefits to those with IBD, but this is dictated by a delicate balance between BA conjugation/deconjugation based on the bsh genes present.

Here we report, high alpha diversity, beta diversity differences and high abundance of Bacteroides is associated with positive vaccine take and shedding following RV3-BB administered in the neonatal schedule, but not with IgA seroconversion, or in the infant schedule. Higher alpha diversity was associated with shedding after three doses of RV3-BB in the neonatal schedule compared to non-shedders, or the placebo group. High abundance of Streptococcus and Staphylococcus is associated with no shedding in the neonatal schedule group.

Incorporating with our computational lithography (CL) algorithm, we have demonstrated self-aligned overlay of multiple material patterns to yield binary up to quinary superlattices, with a critical dimension and overlay accuracy on the order of 50 and 2 nm, respectively. The process is expected to substantially expand the boundary of materials combination for high-throughput fabrication of complex superstructures of translational symmetry on arbitrary substrates, enabling emerging nanoimaging, sensing, catalysis, and optoelectronic devices.

 Climate change is altering both the duration and the rate of carbon uptake in plants, thereby affecting terrestrial gross primary productivity (GPP). However, little is known about the relative strengths of these processes or underlying mechanisms. Here, using satellite and carbon-flux data, we show that the duration and mean daily rate of carbon uptake (GPPrate) have both increased in recent decades, enhancing total GPP with a rate of ~0.56% per year during the growing season across the Northern Hemisphere. Notably, the mean daily GPPrate, driven primarily by rising CO2 concentrations and temperatures, contributed ~65% to the changes in total GPP during the growing season over time, with higher contributions in early season (~83%) compared with late season (~55%). These findings highlight the importance of vegetation physiology in driving temporal changes in terrestrial GPP and suggest that the asymmetric changes in productivity across seasons will exacerbate under ongoing climate change.

 Antarctic basal melt is crucial for the future evolution of the Antarctic ice sheet and ocean circulation. However, few Earth system models explicitly simulate ice-shelf cavities. Here, using an Earth system model with interactive Antarctic ice-shelf cavities, we show that regional hydrography and topography determine a cavity tipping point. The Filchner–Ronne ice-shelf cavity will encounter such a tipping point with abrupt warm-water intrusion, rapid basal melt increase and massive freshwater release in response to increasing CO2 levels within this century. Conversely, the Ross Ice Shelf shows a more gradual response. Our results also suggest that previous ice-sheet modelling overestimated future ice-shelf melt, highlighting the need for comprehensive Earth system models with interactive ice-sheet dynamics and cavities for better climate projections.

10.1038/s41612-025-01026-8,True,npj Climate and Atmospheric Science,该研究论文探讨了人为气溶胶排放增加与亚洲夏季风反气旋（ASMA）减弱之间的关系。研究发现，南亚和东亚人为气溶胶排放的增加以及中亚气溶胶排放的减少导致了欧亚大陆对流层中低纬度地区经向温度梯度减小，中纬度地区经向温度梯度增大，从而导致ASMA减弱。研究结果基于卫星观测和数值模拟，表明ASMA的减弱可能会影响亚洲夏季风地区UTLS中CO和水汽的空间分布。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,"['Asian Summer Monsoon Anticyclone', 'Anthropogenic Aerosol Emissions', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Satellite Observations', 'Atmospheric Composition', 'CO', 'Water Vapor', 'UTLS (Upper Troposphere/Lower Stratosphere)']",Kai Qie;Wenshou Tian;Jianchun Bian;Fei Xie;Dan Li,Weakened Asian summer monsoon anticyclone related to increased anthropogenic aerosol emissions in recent decades,"Weakened Asian summer monsoon anticyclone related to increased anthropogenic aerosol emissions in recent decades 
 The Asian summer monsoon anticyclone (ASMA) traps pollutants from South and East Asia elevated by deep convection, which profoundly influences the atmospheric composition and hence stratospheric chemical processes. Here, we identified a significant weakening of the ASMA in the layer of 70–200 hPa during 1958–2020 and found that the change in anthropogenic aerosol emissions was the dominant external forcing responsible for this weakening trend. Significant increases in anthropogenic aerosol emissions over South and East Asia and decreased aerosol emissions over Central Asia led to a decreased meridional temperature gradient at low-latitudes and an increased meridional temperature gradient at mid-latitudes in the troposphere over the Eurasian continent, resulting in a weakened ASMA. The results based on satellite observations and numerical simulations indicated that the weakened ASMA may affect the spatial distribution of CO and water vapor in the UTLS over Asian summer monsoon region."

 The Antarctic landscape is one of the most stable environments on the Earth, at least since approximately 14 million years ago when most glaciers in continental Antarctica changed from temperate to cold-based, and previous extensive fluvial activity disappeared. Here, we detected a large landscape change on a coastal glacier in continental Antarctica (Boulder Clay Glacier) that occurred in the Medieval Warm Period. Such change consists in a glacial unconformity marked by a continuous sediment layer and an erosion channel on the past glacier surface. This channel, more than 4 kilometers long, represents a local deepening of a glacial unconformity that cuts the underlying glacial strata and was clearly imaged and mapped by Ground Penetrating Radar data. Four boreholes were allowed to calibrate the sediment layer so identified because it was observed in all boreholes at depths between 1.85 and 3.07 m. Moreover, the occurrence at a depth of 11.11 meters of mosses suitable for the dating through radiocarbon dating provided the age of 1050 calibrated years before the present, implying that the erosion event occurred during the Medieval Warm Period between 900 and 989 before the present.

 Fisheries’ effects on marine life have been widely acknowledged for decades, but only recently have we considered their impact on marine nutrient cycles. Through the removal of marine biomass, fisheries represent a unique and historically novel pathway for nutrients to be extracted from the sea. Here, we examined the magnitude of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus extraction by industrial fisheries through large spatiotemporal scales and broad ecological contexts. Between 1960 and 2018, industrial fisheries removed approximately 431 million tonnes of carbon, 110 million tonnes of nitrogen, and 23 million tonnes of phosphorus. Nutrient extractions occurred most intensely in highly productive regions within Exclusive Economic Zones. Additionally, >53% of all nutrient extractions occurred through the removal of mid-level trophic groups and pelagic species. Our findings indicate that fisheries can remove substantial amounts of nutrients each year and warrant further studies that consider the ecosystem-level impacts of nutrient reductions.

 Plastic has become an integral part of our lives. Addressing the global environmental concerns of plastics requires a comprehensive analysis along the whole supply chain. Here, we provide a global trade-linked material flow analysis of plastics for the year 2022. Globally, 436.66 million tonnes (Mt) of plastics were traded in 2022, with final products alone accounting for 111 Mt. Our findings suggest that plastics are subject to geographical concentration, with feedstocks concentrated in oil-resource rich countries and processing in countries with large manufacturing capacity. Furthermore, there is a significant shift in waste disposal: incineration is emerging as a prominent waste disposal method (34%), landfill is decreasing substantially (40%), while the global recycling rate remained stagnant (9%). Income disparities among countries diminish in the context of plastic waste imports, reshaping the global plastics trade patterns. Uncovering the complex plastic supply chain is crucial for reducing pollution and promoting sustainable plastic management.

 The Caspian Sea is the world’s largest landlocked waterbody, providing habitat for hundreds of endemic and migratory species, along with ecosystem services that sustain millions of people. Global warming is projected to drive declines in water levels of up to 21 m by 2100. Using geospatial analyses, we assessed the impact of sea level decline on habitats, protected areas, and human infrastructure. We show that a water level decline of just 5–10 m will critically disrupt key ecosystems (including habitats for endemic Caspian seals and sturgeon), reduce existing marine protected area coverage by up to 94%, and render billions of dollars of civil and industrial infrastructure obsolete. Replacing traditional static conservation planning with a pre-emptive, dynamic approach that allows protected areas to track shifting ecosystems, is recommended to help endemic Caspian Sea biodiversity adapt to these changes, and to avoid conflicts with mitigation efforts directed at protecting human activities.

 Identifying the effectiveness of anti-leakage policies across competitiveness, demand, and energy channels is crucial for unilateral climate policy design. Here we combine a global equilibrium model and channel decomposition approach to unravel the effectiveness of anti-leakage policies—free allocation system, carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), and climate clubs—within the European Union Emissions Trading System. Free allocation (excluding power sector) and indirect emission cost aids modestly reduce carbon leakage across all channels. CBAM achieves negative leakage in competitiveness and demand channels, but increases leakage in the energy channel. Voluntary climate clubs without penalties, mainly mitigate leakage among member countries, but are less effective for non-members in the demand channel. The Buchanan club with imposing penalties on non-members, achieves the negative leakage, suggesting its potential to fully resolve leakage. However, these policies are less effective in the energy channel, potentially undermining efforts in other channels.

 Diurnal variability in sea surface temperature (SST) significantly influences ocean–atmosphere thermal interactions. Conventional numerical methods for reconstructing hourly SST are limited by high computational demands and difficulties in accommodating real-time atmospheric and oceanic conditions. Therefore, this study introduces the Physics-Assisted Reconstruction Adversarial Network (PARAN), a novel deep-learning framework that reconstructs high-resolution (2 km), hourly SST using geostationary satellite data. By integrating numerical model knowledge and leveraging generative adversarial network architectures, PARAN achieves enhanced reconstruction performance. We applied the PARAN framework to the Northwest Pacific region, generating a continuous, hourly subskin SST layer from January 2019 to December 2021. The network was validated against high-resolution satellite data and in situ buoy observations, demonstrating substantial accuracy improvements over existing high-resolution numerical models (GLO12v4 and HYCOM).

 Tire and road wear particles (TRWP) are an important component of non-exhaust emissions from road traffic. They are internal mixtures of tire material, road wear, brake wear, and soil minerals. In contrast to tire material analysed by bulk analytical techniques, there is little literature on the air concentrations and deposition rates of TRWP. The main purpose of our study was to determine deposition rates and air concentrations of TRWP at a motorway in Germany. TRWP were collected with passive samplers and analysed by scanning electron microscopy. Number deposition rates varied between approximately 100 particles cm−2 day−1 at 3.5 m distance and 30 particles cm−2 day−1 at 30.5 m distance from the road, and mass deposition rates between 7.8 mg m−2 day−1 and 2.8 mg m−2 day−1, respectively. Air concentrations of TRWP calculated from the mass deposition rates varied between approximately 3.8 μg/m3 (3.5 m distance) and 0.95 μg/m3 (30.5 m distance). The influence of potential particle misclassification, density of TRWP, and volume approximation on the deposition rates and air concentrations is small. Air concentrations of TRWP observed in this study are reasonably consistent with the results of previous electron microscopy studies, but are significantly higher than the values used in risk assessment. This discrepancy clearly shows that further exposure measurements are required. The input of organic additives such as benzothiazole and N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine (6PPD) as well as carbon, sulfur and zinc through deposition in road soils should be taken into account when assessing the environmental impact of TRWP."

 Atmospheric deposition significantly influences nutrient and chemical inputs to ecosystems, playing a crucial role in water quality and environmental management. This study utilizes long-term monitoring data spanning 43 years to evaluate changes in deposition for Dorset (a representative rural/remote area) and 27 years for Simcoe (representing a mixed-use landscape including agricultural, urban, natural and industrial areas) located along a north-south transect in south-central Ontario, east of Georgian Bay. Analysis focused on the annual deposition trends of 21 chemicals in Dorset and 12 chemicals in Simcoe, comparing changes within and between the two regions. Many consistent patterns emerged in both regions, revealing decreasing trends in nitrogen, chloride, sulphate and calcium deposition, and no significant trend in total phosphorus deposition. Metals and silica deposition, which were only measured at Dorset, also significantly declined. Notably, the magnitude and rate of these trends varied between Dorset and Simcoe. Simcoe exhibited higher deposition levels and more rapid/larger trends, attributed to its proximity to urbanization, agriculture, shipping, and industries. The varying contribution of chemical deposition to catchment export was evaluated for a small stream close to the deposition study site in Dorset, based on a ratio of export to deposition. This comparative analysis provides valuable insights into the spatiotemporal changes in atmospheric deposition, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of regional biogeochemical dynamics."

 This study examines how the Arctic warming during rapid sea ice decline changes over Barents-Kara Seas (BKS) on the synoptic time scale in winter. We divide the satellite record 1979–2024 into two time periods: 1979–2002 (P1) and 2003–2024 (P2), with a focus on the difference between P1 and P2. A rapid sea ice loss event is defined, when the sea ice tendency index falls below the 5th percentile of the corresponding P1/P2 time series for at least three consecutive days. Composite analysis shows that the negative center of sea ice concentration anomaly for rapid sea ice loss events in P2 shifts more northward compared to P1, consistent with the retreat of Arctic sea ice edge due to global warming. Climate change influences the position and structure of atmospheric anticyclonic anomaly over BKS associated with rapid sea ice loss, which makes the maximum adiabatic cooling in the upper troposphere shift to mid-troposphere and enhances the horizontal temperature advection, particularly in the meridional direction near the surface. Consequently, the positive atmospheric temperature anomaly intensifies, with the maximum at 800 hPa shift to the surface, despite enhanced diabatic cooling in the lower troposphere over BKS. This study underscores the significance of enhanced warm horizontal temperature advection with bottom amplified on the surface warming during rapid sea ice decline in the recent decades. As a result, the positive skin temperature anomaly is also magnified, which is due to increased downward longwave radiation resulting from increased atmospheric temperature and moisture over BKS."

 Based on vertically pointing Ka-band MMCR observation in 2020–2021, we investigate the vertical structure and diurnal and seasonal variations of cirrus clouds at a midlatitude monsoon site in central China. Statistical analysis shows that the cirrus clouds occur mostly at 7–15 km with the reflectivity of −42—7 dBZ in summer, and at 5–12 km with the reflectivity of −47— −2 dBZ in winter. From spring to winter, the maximum cirrus occurrence frequency (COF) arises at about −36, −34, −37 and −37 dBZ in the reflectivity domain, at 10.23, 12.00, 10.41, and 8.79 km in the spatial dimension, and at −46, −52, −39 and −43 °C in the temperature domain, respectively. In both the spatial and temperature domains, the COF distribution is approximately consistent with the Gaussian distribution. The seasonal mean ice water content (ice effective radius) is mainly distributed in 1×10‐3-7×10‐3gm−3 (34–46 μm). There is an obvious diurnal change in the cirrus activities. In summer, the COF is relatively small from 5:00 to 12:00, and reaches the maximum at about 20:00, while in autumn, the cirrus clouds are rare between 4:00 and 14:00, and have a significant COF from 19:00 to 24:00. The COF reaches the maximum of 20.03 % in July in 2020 but only 16.16 % in June in 2021. In 2020, the monthly mean cloud base and top heights show a first increase and then decrease, whereas, their evolution exhibits large fluctuations in 2021. The COF has a correlation coefficient of 0.61 with oceanic Niño index (ONI), and the difference of cirrus clouds between 2020 and 2021 is closely associated with the ONI evolution."

In this work, we report that dysfunctional mitochondrial quality control engages a retrograde (mitonuclear) signaling program that impairs cellular identity and maturity in β cells, hepatocytes, and brown adipocytes. Targeted deficiency throughout the mitochondrial quality control pathway, including genome integrity, dynamics, or turnover, impaired the oxidative phosphorylation machinery, activating the mitochondrial integrated stress response, eliciting chromatin remodeling, and promoting cellular immaturity rather than apoptosis to yield metabolic dysfunction. Pharmacologic blockade of the integrated stress response in vivo restored β cell identity after the loss of mitochondrial quality control. Targeting mitochondrial retrograde signaling may therefore be promising in the treatment or prevention of metabolic disorders."

Although translation- and transcription-related genes often cluster near the origin of replication, the extent of positional biases across gene families remains unclear. We hypothesized that natural selection broadly favors specific chromosomal positions to optimize growth rate–dependent expression. Analyzing 910 bacterial species and proteomics data fromEscherichia coliandBacillus subtilis, we found that about two-thirds of bacterial gene families are positionally biased. Natural selection drives genes mainly toward the origin or terminus of replication, with the strongest selection in fast-growing species. Our findings reveal chromosomal positioning as a fundamental mechanism for coordinating gene expression with growth rate, highlighting evolutionary constraints on bacterial genome architecture."

Using laboratory- and field-based experiments across multiple years in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar;n= 730), we show that the globally detected anxiolytic pollutant clobazam accumulates in the brain of exposed fish and influences river-to-sea migration success. Clobazam exposure increased the speed with which fish passed through two hydropower dams along their migration route, resulting in more clobazam-exposed fish reaching the sea compared with controls. We argue that such effects may arise from altered shoaling behavior in fish exposed to clobazam. Drug-induced behavioral changes are expected to have wide-ranging consequences for the ecology and evolution of wild populations."

How activated T cells receive the paracrine signals required for their differentiation once they have disengaged from DCs and resumed their migration has been unclear. We identified a distinct priming phase that favors CD8 T cells expressing receptors with high affinity for antigen. CXCR3 expression by CD8 T cells was required for their hours-long reengagement with DCs in specific subfollicular niches in lymph nodes. CD4 T cells paused briefly at the sites of CD8 T cell and DC interactions and provided Interleukin-2 (IL-2) before moving to another DC.

Larger birth canals were linked to slower walking pace and reduced back pain but increased hip osteoarthritis risk, whereas narrower birth canals were associated with reduced pelvic floor disorder risk but increased obstructed labor risk. Lastly, genetic correlation between birth canal and head widths provides evidence of coevolution between the human pelvis and brain, partially mitigating the dilemma."

First, condensin disassembles interphase chromatin loop organization by evicting or displacing extrusive cohesin. Second, condensin bypasses cohesive cohesins, thereby maintaining sister chromatid cohesion as sisters separate. Studies of mitotic chromosomes formed by cohesin, condensin II, and condensin I alone or in combination lead to refined models of mitotic chromosome conformation. In these models, loops are consecutive and not overlapping, implying that condensins stall upon encountering each other. The dynamics of Hi-C interactions and chromosome morphology reveal that during prophase, loops are extruded in vivo at ∼1 to 3 kilobases per second by condensins as they form a disordered discontinuous helical scaffold within individual chromatids."

Incomplete penetrance ofGBA1variants suggests that additional genes contribute to PD and DLB manifestation.

Loss of COMMD3 increased the release of lysosomal proteins through extracellular vesicles, leading to their impaired delivery to endolysosomes and consequent lysosomal dysfunction.

Patients with cachexia experience extreme fatigue, apathy, and clinical depression, yet the biological mechanisms underlying these behavioral symptoms and their relationship to the disease remain unclear. In a mouse cancer model, cachexia specifically induced increased effort-sensitivity, apathy-like symptoms through a cytokine-sensing brainstem-to-basal ganglia circuit. This neural circuit detects elevated interleukin-6 (IL-6) at cachexia onset and translates inflammatory signals into decreased mesolimbic dopamine, thereby increasing effort sensitivity. We alleviated these apathy-like symptoms by targeting key circuit nodes: administering an anti–IL-6 antibody treatment, ablating cytokine sensing in the brainstem, and optogenetically or pharmacologically boosting mesolimbic dopamine. Our findings uncovered a central neural circuit that senses systemic inflammation and orchestrates behavioral changes, providing mechanistic insights into the connection between chronic inflammation and depressive symptoms."

The inactive conformation of the VPS15 pseudokinase stabilizes the inactive conformation, sequestering itsN-myristate in the N-lobe of the pseudokinase. Upon activation, the myristate is liberated such that the VPS34 lipid kinase catalyzes phosphatidylinositol-3 phosphate production on membranes. The VPS15 pseudokinase domain binds tightly to guanosine triphosphate and stabilizes a web of interactions to autoinhibit the cytosolic complex and promote activation upon membrane binding. These findings show in atomistic detail how the VPS34 lipid kinase is activated in the context of a complete PI3K complex."
