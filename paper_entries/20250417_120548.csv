The blue-water dependence index (BDI), which reflects the fraction of blue water in total crop water demand of a certain location, is a crucial indicator for managing freshwater resources effectively, ensuring sustainable food production systems and adapting agricultural practices to climate change. The knowledge of BDI for SA croplands at fine spatial scales is limited. Here we present a comprehensive modeling framework for fine-scale BDI assessment using an evapotranspiration-based approach to calculate crop water demand. A novel hierarchical decision tree approach was employed to identify major crop rotation systems, forming the basis for estimating regional crop water demand. We produced annual crop rotation maps at 250 m spatial resolution for 18 years (2003–2020) with an overall accuracy of 78.60%. Our results based on the national-scale analysis reveal that croplands in India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh have an averaged BDI value of 0.32, 0.65, and 0.39, respectively. Notably, cotton and sugarcane crops have the highest BDI (⩾0.42) in SA. Future climate data under different scenarios indicate that the BDI in tropical croplands is expected to decrease, while arid to semi-arid croplands will require more irrigation water to support optimal crop growth. In light of the future variability of BDI, our research further implies a few candidate strategies for climate change mitigation in SA that include enhancing water management infrastructures, developing climate-resistant crop varieties, and relocating crop cultivation areas with transboundary cooperation."
10.5194/acp-25-4313-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了酰基过氧自由基（APR）与单萜烯的氧化反应机理，这些反应对大气环境中的空气质量和气候变化具有重要影响。研究发现，这些反应可能导致更多高分子量含氧化合物的产生，从而增加二次有机气溶胶的产量。虽然论文没有直接涉及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它对理解大气成分的形成和演变，以及改进气候模型具有重要意义，因此与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测和大气成分分析）间接相关。,"['atmospheric composition', 'secondary organic aerosol', 'air quality', 'climate modeling', 'monoterpenes oxidation']",Dominika Pasik;Thomas Golin Almeida;Emelda Ahongshangbam;Siddharth Iyer;Nanna Myllys,Monoterpene oxidation pathways initiated by acyl peroxy radical addition,"We used quantum chemistry methods to investigate the oxidation mechanisms of acyl peroxy radicals (APRs) with various monoterpenes. Our findings reveal unique oxidation pathways for different monoterpenes, leading to either chain-terminating products or highly reactive intermediates that can contribute to particle formation in the atmosphere. This research highlights APRs as potentially significant but underexplored atmospheric oxidants that may influence future approaches to modelling climate. 
 Monoterpenes are released into the atmosphere in significant quantities, where they undergo various oxidation reactions. Despite extensive studies in this area, there are still gaps that need to be addressed to fully understand the oxidation processes occurring in the atmosphere. Recent findings suggest that reactions between alkenes and acyl peroxy radicals (APRs) can be competitive under atmospheric conditions. In this study, we investigate the oxidation reactions of seven monoterpenes with the CH3C(O)OO⋅ radical and subsequent diverse reactions, including accretion, alkyl radical rearrangements, H-shift, and β-scission reactions. The accretion reaction leads to the release of excess energy, which is sufficient to open small secondary rings in the alkyl radical structures. This reaction is most significant for sabinene (31 %) and α-thujene (18 %). A competing reaction is O2 addition, which the majority of alkyl radicals undergo, subsequently leading to the formation of peroxy radicals. These then react further, forming alkoxy radicals that can subsequently undergo β-scission reactions. Our calculations show that for β-pinene, camphene, and sabinene, β-scission rearrangements result in radicals capable of undergoing further propagation of the oxidative chain, while for limonene, α-pinene, and α-thujene, scissions leading to closed-shell products that terminate the oxidative chain are preferred. The results indicate that if reactions of monoterpenes with APRs are indeed competitive under atmospheric conditions, their oxidation would lead to more oxygenated compounds with a higher molar mass, potentially contributing to secondary organic aerosol yields. Moreover, this study highlights the significance of stereochemistry in controlling the oxidation of monoterpenes initiated by APRs."

Bowman,Predictions of failed satellite retrieval of air quality  using machine learning,"The large fleet of Earth observation satellites in orbit currently generate huge volumes of data, requiring significant computational resources to process these data in a timely manner. We present a method for predicting poor-quality measurements using machine learning. We find that machine learning methods can accurately predict poor-quality measurements and remove them from the processing chain, saving time and computational resources. 
 The growing fleet of Earth observation (EO) satellites is capturing unprecedented quantities of information about the concentration and distribution of trace gases in the Earth's atmosphere. Depending on the instrument and algorithm, the yield of good remote soundings can be a few percent owing to interferences such as clouds, non-linearities in the retrieval algorithm, and systematic errors in the radiative transfer algorithm, leading to inefficient use of computational resources. In this study, we investigate machine learning (ML) techniques to predict failures in the trace gas retrieval process based upon the input satellite radiances alone, allowing for efficient production of good-quality data. We apply this technique to ozone and other retrievals using measurements from multiple satellites: the Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership Cross-Track Infrared Sounder (Suomi NPP CrIS) and joint retrievals from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Retrievals are performed using the MUlti-SpEctra, MUlti-SpEcies, Multi-SEnsors (MUSES) algorithm. With this tool, we can identify 80 % of ozone retrieval failures using the MUSES algorithm at a cost of 20 % false positives from CrIS. For AIRS-OMI, 98 % of ozone retrieval failures are identified at a cost of 2 % false positives. The ML tool is simple to generate and takes <0.1 s to assess each measured spectrum. The results suggest that this tool can be applied to data from many EO satellites and can reduce the processing load for current and future instruments."

 Geochemical data from ancient marine sediments are crucial for studying palaeo-environments, palaeo-climates, and elemental cycles. With increased accessibility to geochemical data, many databases have emerged. However, there remains a need for a more comprehensive database that focuses on deep-time marine sediment records.

The median of the produced dataset is available for public use and can be found on Zenodo. 
 High-resolution gridded precipitation data is scarce, especially at time intervals shorter than daily.

This paper introduces VISIT-SIF, a biogeochemical model developed based on the Vegetation Integrative Simulator for Trace gases (VISIT) to represent satellite-observed SIF. Our simulations reproduced the global distribution and seasonal variations in observed SIF. VISIT-SIF helps to improve photosynthetic processes through a combination of biogeochemical modeling and observed SIF. 
 Satellite retrievals of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) can provide opportunities to improve our understanding of terrestrial ecosystem dynamics and the carbon cycle at the global scale. Here, we present a new biogeochemical process-based carbon and nitrogen cycle model for representing SIF retrievals (VISIT-SIF version 1.0: Vegetation Integrative SImulator for Trace gases and SIF) acquired by the Greenhouse gases Observing SATellite (GOSAT) with an hourly time step and a spatial resolution of approximately 0.31 × 0.31°. The implementation of radiation transfer models (RTMs) helps to address the interaction of chlorophyll fluorescence with vegetation and atmosphere. However, the computation of RTMs becomes more time-consuming, which can make it impractical in applications of satellite observations with larger data volumes. This study resolves this issue by parameterizing the radiative transfer processes and the geometric relationships. This approach enables the ease of implementation of VISIT-SIF for simulating satellite SIF retrievals even for the satellites having off-nadir observation angles. With an initial 7 years of data (2009–2015), our model simulations showed a consistent global mean value of 0.51 ± 0.39, with GOSAT SIF retrievals of 0.46 ± 0.42 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1; the root mean squared error was 0.29 mW m−2 sr−1 nm−1. We also found that the mean seasonal variability in the simulated SIFs was mostly consistent with the GOSAT SIF retrievals at the subcontinental scale. However, the simulated results indicated less sensitivity to water stress in the late dry season in arid and semiarid regions relative to that of the GOSAT SIF retrievals, which is consistent with the findings of previous studies using multiple biogeochemical process-based models. This comparison suggested that there is a critical need to improve our knowledge of SIF variability and biophysical processes in such regions."

Russell,Multiphase Buffering: A Mechanistic Regulator of Aerosol Sulfate Formation and Its Dominant Pathways,"Sulfate formation in the aerosol aqueous phase represents a pH-sensitive atmospheric chemical process, with the formation pathways significantly influenced by the fluctuations in aerosol acidity. Buffer capacity, stemming from conjugate acid–base pairs, can resist pH changes in aerosol multiphase systems under external perturbations. However, the regulating role of multiphase buffering in pH-dependent aqueous sulfate formation mechanisms remains unexplored. Here, we propose that multiphase buffering can stabilize aerosol pH and further regulate dominant sulfate formation pathways. In this work, we delve into the instantaneous buffer capacity β and sulfate formation pathways based on field observation and theoretical calculation and further introduce the total buffer capacity α in the aerosol multiphase system to quantify the buffer-constrained pH change after the external acid/base variation during the entire buffering process. The NH4+/NH3 agent (average β 30.8 mol kg–1) shows a superior buffering effect in stabilizing aerosol pH and regulating sulfate formation pathway transition compared with the HNO3/NO3– agent (average β 15.1 mol kg–1). Geos-Chem simulation and machine learning results also validate the buffer capacity as a pivotal factor in sulfate formation. In addition to reactants, the buffer agents and acid/base can also be factors of concern for the sulfate formation mechanism. The diverse sensitivities to acid/base variation and the region-specific responses to pH change can provide insight into regulating acid and base emission measures, modulating regional aerosol acidity, and understanding pH-related atmospheric chemical processes."

Hudson and Paul G. Tratnyek,Electrochemical Characterization of Pyrogenic Carbons: Implications for Degradation of Groundwater Contaminants with Carbon-Based Amendments,"Pyrogenic carbons (PCs) are important mediators of biogeochemical redox reactions and contribute to contaminant degradation in some remediation methods. Contaminant degradation by electron transfer from PC is influenced by its electron conductivity and storage capacity, and atom transfer reactions involving atomic hydrogen, but resolving their contributions is difficult. In this study, we developed a method to modify working electrodes with agarose-stabilized thin films of PCs and used them to characterize PC reactivity using 2,4,6-trinitrotoluene (TNT) as a model contaminant and several electrochemical methods. Chronoamperometry showed that TNT reduction rates increase with increasing PC temperature, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy showed that this is because the heterogeneous electron transfer rate constants (k0) are inversely correlated to resistivity (Rp) of the PC films. As a result, PCs like biochars, which have higher charge transfer resistance (Rct), give lower TNT reduction rates, whereas lower Rct PCs like activated carbons give faster TNT reduction. Current from reduction of H2O/H+ to H2 (HER) was significant only for low Rp PC-films on Pt working electrodes. The reactive intermediates involved in HER react preferentially with quinonoid moieties on the PC, thereby competing with and limiting TNT reduction at low overpotentials (<ca. −0.6 V). Overall, contaminant reduction on PCs is more favorable by electron transfer than H atom mediated reactions under the conditions of this study."

Among urban stressors, pesticide-driven chemical pollution represents a critical, yet under-recognized, global threat. Quantifying the causes and consequences of pesticides on biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation is vital for ecological risk assessment and management, offering insights to promote sustainable societal development. This study evaluated anthropogenic stressors and macroinvertebrate communities at 42 sites across two major drainages in Beijing using chemical analysis and environmental DNA (eDNA), focusing on macroinvertebrate responses to pesticide exposure in the context of multiple anthropogenic stressors. Pesticides significantly impacted the α- and β-functional diversity of macroinvertebrates, accounting for 18.46 and 14.6% of the total observed variation, respectively, underscoring the role of functional groups in pesticide risk assessment. Land use and flow quantity directly influenced pesticide levels, which in turn affected macroinvertebrate functional diversity, while basic water quality had a less pronounced effect. These results provide empirical evidence of pesticide pollution’s impact on macroinvertebrate functional diversity at the watershed scale under field conditions in a highly urbanized area.

Community exposure risks were notable up to 220 m downwind from WCFs, marking the maximum extent of pathogen dispersion. Our analysis suggests that approximately 6.3% of the megacity’s area (equivalent to 400 km2) is within potential risk zones influenced by WCF emissions.

The predicted amenable compounds in the positive and negative modes of electrospray ionization accounted for about 41% and 23% of the approximate chemical space when the same database was used for comparison, suggesting a great potential for NTS within the LC-HRMS platform."

Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) is powerful in source attribution of primary OA (POA); however, it often struggles to differentiate sources of oxygenated OA (OOA) due to their similar chemical profiles. In this study, a support vector regression machine learning (ML) model was developed to enhance the OOA source apportionment in Dublin from 2016 to 2023. Rolling PMF analysis identified four POA factors and differentiated OOA into less- and more-oxidized  (LO-OOA and MO-OOA), highlighting the significant role of the OOA (47–74% of total OA). The ML model further distinguished locally produced OOA (LO-OOAlocal and MO-OOAlocal) from transboundary transport OOA and exhibited robust performance across different pollution scenarios. The relative importance analysis revealed that LO-OOAlocal was more impacted by fossil fuel emissions like hydrocarbon-like OA (20%) and coal (14%), whereas MO-OOAlocal was most influenced by LO-OOA (17%), providing insights into their sources and formation mechanisms. During a mixed pollution episode, the results show that despite the significant contribution of transboundary transport, local heating emissions were more critical sources of OA, with local OA accounting for 68% of total OA and reaching 78% during heating hours. These findings highlight the ongoing need to reduce local emissions to achieve cleaner air in Dublin. The ML model’s ability to quantitatively separate local and transboundary OOA offers invaluable insights for future air quality regulations."

However, the connection between optical properties and toxicity of combustion particles remains a matter of little concern. In this study, combustion particles were collected from 11 primary sources, including biomass burning, coal combustion, and vehicle exhaust. The extractable organic matter (EOM) in bituminous coal combustion particles shows the highest light-absorption, fluorescence properties, and toxicity among samples. Parallel factor (PARAFAC) analysis combined excitation–emission matrix (EEM) spectroscopy resolved 4 types of basic chromophore components in EOM. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) analysis further resolved ∼800 molecules, predominantly aromatics (84% ± 4.6%), which showed positive correlations with the light-absorption, fluorescence properties and toxicity of EOM (p < 0.05). Aromatics are inferred to be the intrinsic link between the optical properties and toxicity of EOM in combustion particles. Additionally, the benzene poly(carboxylic acid)s (BPCAs) method, which could identify and quantify fused benzene rings in EOM, further indicates the high condensation degree of aromatics is closely correlated with the light-absorption, fluorescence properties of EOM. However, the toxicity of EOM may depend on the bay or fjord region of aromatics. These findings provide valuable insights into the light-absorption, fluorescence properties and toxicity of EOM in combustion particles."

However, the generation mechanism of banded hiss remains unclear. Here we present a representative event of banded hiss co‐existing in both the plasmaspheric plume structure and the plasmasphere. The wave Poynting flux measurements and linear instability analysis suggest that banded hiss can be generated in the equatorial plume region. The ray tracing simulations further show that the plume structure enables banded hiss to propagate along the plasma density crest to higher latitudes, followed by the penetration into the plasmasphere. Our data analysis and modeling efforts provide a plausible mechanism for the generation of banded hiss, and also highlight the significant role of plume structure in the generation and propagation of magnetospheric whistler‐mode waves."

A signature of climate oscillations in topography is mismatch (discordance) in discharge‐normalized channel steepness between adjacent hydrologically connected streams.

 Somatic DNMT3A R882 codon mutations drive the most common form of clonal haematopoiesis (CH) and are associated with increased acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) risk1,2. Preventing expansion of DNMT3A-R882-mutant haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs) may therefore avert progression to AML. To identify DNMT3A-R882-mutant-specific vulnerabilities, we conducted a genome-wide CRISPR screen on primary mouse Dnmt3aR882H/+ HSPCs. Amongst the 640 vulnerability genes identified, many were involved in mitochondrial metabolism and metabolic flux analysis confirmed enhanced oxidative phosphorylation usage in Dnmt3aR882H/+ vs Dnmt3a+/+ (WT) HSPCs. We selected citrate/malate transporter Slc25a1 and complex I component Ndufb11, for which pharmacological inhibitors are available, for downstream studies. In vivo administration of SLC25A1 inhibitor CTPI2 and complex I inhibitors IACS-010759 and metformin, suppressed post-transplantation clonal expansion of Dnmt3aR882H/+, but not WT, LT-HSC. The effect of metformin was recapitulated using a primary human DNMT3A-R882 CH sample. Notably, analysis of 412,234 UK Biobank (UKB) participants revealed that individuals taking metformin had markedly lower prevalence of DNMT3A-R882-mutant CH, after controlling for potential confounders including glycated haemoglobin, diabetes and body mass index.

 Potatoes were first brought to Europe in the sixteenth century1,2. Two hundred years later, one of the species had become one of the most important food sources across the entire continent and, later, even the entire world3. However, its highly heterozygous, autotetraploid genome has complicated its improvement since then4–7. Here we present the pan-genome of European potatoes generated from phased genome assemblies of ten historical potato cultivars, which includes approximately 85% of all haplotypes segregating in Europe. Sequence diversity between the haplotypes was extremely high (for example, 20× higher than in humans), owing to numerous introgressions from wild potato species. By contrast, haplotype diversity was very low, in agreement with the population bottlenecks caused by domestication and transition to Europe. To illustrate a practical application of the pan-genome, we converted it into a haplotype graph and used it to generate phased, megabase-scale pseudo-genome assemblies of commercial potatoes (including the famous French fries potato ‘Russet Burbank’) using cost-efficient short reads only. In summary, we present a nearly complete pan-genome of autotetraploid European potato, we describe extraordinarily high sequence diversity in a domesticated crop, and we outline how this resource might be used to accelerate genomics-assisted breeding and research.

 Clonal haematopoiesis arises when a haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) acquires a mutation that confers a competitive advantage over wild-type HSCs, resulting in its clonal expansion. Individuals with clonal haematopoiesis are at increased risk of developing haematologic neoplasms and other age-related inflammatory illnesses1–4. Suppressing the expansion of mutant HSCs may prevent these outcomes; however, such interventions have not yet been identified. The most common clonal haematopoiesis driver mutations are in the DNMT3A gene, with arginine 882 (R882) being a mutation hotspot1–3,5–7. Here we show that mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) carrying the Dnmt3aR878H/+ mutation, equivalent to human DNMT3AR882H/+, have increased mitochondrial respiration compared with wild-type cells and are dependent on this metabolic reprogramming for their competitive advantage. Treatment with metformin, an anti-diabetic drug that inhibits mitochondrial respiration8, reduced the competitive advantage of Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSCs. Through a multi-omics approach, we found that metformin acts by enhancing methylation potential in Dnmt3aR878H/+ HSPCs and reversing the aberrant DNA CpG methylation and histone H3 K27 trimethylation profiles in these cells. Metformin also reduced the competitive advantage of human DNMT3AR882H HSPCs generated by prime editing. Our findings provide preclinical rationale for investigating metformin as a preventive intervention against DNMT3A R882 mutation-driven clonal haematopoiesis in humans. Dnmt3a mutations in mouse haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells equivalent to R882 mutations in human cause increased mitochondrial respiration, suggesting that this is a mechanism of clonal haematopoiesis and a potential therapeutic target."

 Wurtzite ferroelectrics have transformative potential for next-generation microelectronics. A comprehensive understanding of their ferroelectric properties and domain energetics is crucial for tailoring their ferroelectric characteristics and exploiting their functional properties in practical devices. Despite burgeoning interest, the exact configurations and electronic structures of domain walls in wurtzite ferroelectrics remain elusive. Here we explain the atomic configurations and electronic properties of electric-field-induced domain walls in ferroelectric ScGaN. By combining transmission electron microscopy and theoretical calculations, a charged domain wall with a buckled two-dimensional hexagonal phase is revealed. Density functional theory calculations confirm that such domain-wall structures further give rise to unprecedented mid-gap states within the forbidden band. Quantitative analysis unveils a universal charge-compensation mechanism stabilizing antipolar domain walls in ferroelectric materials, in which the polarization discontinuity at the 180° domain wall is compensated by the unbonded valence electrons. Furthermore, the reconfigurable conductivity of these domain walls is experimentally demonstrated, showcasing their potential for ultrascaled device applications.

 Distinct hepatocyte subpopulations are spatially segregated along the portal–central axis and are critical to understanding metabolic homeostasis and injury in the liver1. Although several bioactive molecules, including ascorbate and bilirubin, have been described as having a role in directing zonal fates, zonal liver architecture has not yet been replicated in vitro2,3. Here, to evaluate hepatic zonal polarity, we developed a self-assembling zone-specific liver organoid by co-culturing ascorbate- and bilirubin-enriched hepatic progenitors derived from human induced pluripotent stem cells. We found that preconditioned hepatocyte-like cells exhibited zone-specific functions associated with the urea cycle, glutathione synthesis and glutamate synthesis. Single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of these zonally patterned organoids identifies a hepatoblast differentiation trajectory that dictates periportal, interzonal and pericentral human hepatocytes. Epigenetic and transcriptomic analysis showed that zonal identity is orchestrated by ascorbate- or bilirubin-dependent binding of EP300 to TET1 or HIF1α. Transplantation of the self-assembled zonally patterned human organoids improved survival of immunodeficient rats who underwent bile duct ligation by ameliorating the hyperammonaemia and hyperbilirubinaemia. Overall, this multi-zonal organoid system serves as an in vitro human model to better recapitulate hepatic architecture relevant to liver development and disease.

We captured alternate assemblies that include heterozygous information missing in the primary assemblies, and identified a total of 69,531 pan-genes, with 28,907 core genes and 13,728 wild-rice-specific genes. We observed a higher abundance and a significantly greater diversity of resistance-gene analogues in wild rice than in cultivars. Our analysis indicates that two cultivated subpopulations, intro-indica and basmati, were generated through gene flows among cultivars in South Asia. We also provide strong evidence to support the theory that the initial domestication of all Asian cultivated rice occurred only once. Furthermore, we captured 855,122 differentiated single-nucleotide polymorphisms and 13,853 differentiated presence–absence variations between indica and japonica, which could be traced to the divergence of their respective ancestors and the existence of a larger genetic bottleneck in japonica. This study provides reference resources for enhancing rice breeding, and enriches our understanding of the origins and domestication process of rice. A pangenome of wild and cultivated rice accessions captures the entire set of non-redundant genes and diversity in rice, and provides insights into the pathways involved in the evolution of rice."

 Methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) is the enzyme responsible for nearly all biologically generated methane1. Its active site comprises coenzyme F430, a porphyrin-based cofactor with a central nickel ion that is active exclusively in the Ni(I) state2,3. How methanogenic archaea perform the reductive activation of F430 represents a major gap in our understanding of one of the most ancient bioenergetic systems in nature. Here we purified and characterized the MCR activation complex from Methanococcus maripaludis. McrC, a small subunit encoded in the mcr operon, co-purifies with the methanogenic marker proteins Mmp7, Mmp17, Mmp3 and the A2 component. We demonstrated that this complex can activate MCR in vitro in a strictly ATP-dependent manner, enabling the formation of methane. In addition, we determined the cryo-electron microscopy structure of the MCR activation complex exhibiting different functional states with local resolutions reaching 1.8–2.1 Å. Our data revealed three complex iron–sulfur clusters that formed an electron transfer pathway towards F430. Topology and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy analyses indicate that these clusters are similar to the [8Fe-9S-C] cluster, a maturation intermediate of the catalytic cofactor in nitrogenase. Altogether, our findings offer insights into the activation mechanism of MCR and prospects on the early evolution of nitrogenase.

 Sensitive methods for detection of cell-free RNA (cfRNA) could facilitate non-invasive gene expression profiling and monitoring of diseases1–6. Here we describe RARE-seq (random priming and affinity capture of cfRNA fragments for enrichment analysis by sequencing), a method optimized for cfRNA analysis. We demonstrate that platelet contamination can substantially confound cfRNA analyses and develop an approach to overcome it. In analytical validations, we find RARE-seq to be approximately 50-fold more sensitive for detecting tumour-derived cfRNA than whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), with a limit of detection of 0.05%. To explore clinical utility, we profiled 437 plasma samples from 369 individuals with cancer or non-malignant conditions and controls. Detection of non-small-cell lung cancer expression signatures in cfRNA increased with stage (6 out of 20 (30%) in stage I; 5 out of 8 (63%) in stage II; 10 out of 15 (67%) in stage III; 80 out of 96 (83% sensitivity) in stage IV at 95% specificity) and RARE-seq was more sensitive than tumour-naive circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) analysis. In patients with EGFR-mutant non-small-cell lung cancer who developed resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors, we detected both histological transformation and mutation-based resistance mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the potential utility of RARE-seq for determination of tissue of origin, assessing benign pulmonary conditions and tracking response to mRNA vaccines. These results highlight the potential value of ultrasensitive cfRNA analysis and provide proof of concept for diverse clinical applications.

 The axion is a hypothetical fundamental particle that is conjectured to correspond to the coherent oscillation of the θ field in quantum chromodynamics1,2. Its existence would solve multiple fundamental questions, including the strong CP problem of quantum chromodynamics and dark matter, but the axion has never been detected. Electrodynamics of condensed-matter systems can also give rise to a similar θ, so far studied as a static, quantized value to characterize the topology of materials3–5. Coherent oscillation of θ in condensed matter has been proposed to lead to physics directly analogous to the high-energy axion particle—the dynamical axion quasiparticle (DAQ)6–23. Here we report the observation of the DAQ in MnBi2Te4. By combining a two-dimensional electronic device with ultrafast pump–probe optics, we observe a coherent oscillation of θ at about 44 gigahertz, which is uniquely induced by its out-of-phase antiferromagnetic magnon. This represents direct evidence for the presence of the DAQ, which in two-dimensional MnBi2Te4 is found to arise from the magnon-induced coherent modulation of the Berry curvature. The DAQ also has implications in light–matter interaction and coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics24, as it might lead to axion polaritons and electric control of ultrafast spin polarization6,15–20. Finally, the DAQ could be used to detect axion particles21–23. We estimate the detection frequency range and sensitivity in the millielectronvolt regime, which has so far been poorly explored.

 The pursuit of non-volatile memory with program speeds below one nanosecond, beyond the capabilities of non-volatile flash and high-speed volatile static random-access memory, remains a longstanding challenge in the field of memory technology1. Utilizing fundamental physics innovation enabled by advanced materials, series of emerging memories2–5 are being developed to overcome the speed bottleneck of non-volatile memory. As the most extensively applied non-volatile memory, the speed of flash is limited by the low efficiency of the electric-field-assisted program, with reported speeds6–10 much slower than sub-one nanosecond. Here we report a two-dimensional Dirac graphene-channel flash memory based on a two-dimensional-enhanced hot-carrier-injection mechanism, supporting both electron and hole injection. The Dirac channel flash shows a program speed of 400 picoseconds, non-volatile storage and robust endurance over 5.5 × 106 cycles. Our results confirm that the thin-body channel can optimize the horizontal electric-field (Ey) distribution, and the improved Ey-assisted program efficiency increases the injection current to 60.4 pA μm−1 at |VDS| = 3.7 V. We also find that the two-dimensional semiconductor tungsten diselenide has two-dimensional-enhanced hot-hole injection, but with different injection behaviour. This work demonstrates that the speed of non-volatile flash memory can exceed that of the fastest volatile static random-access memory with the same channel length.

 The stability of hazardous volcanic systems is strongly influenced by the uppermost magma storage depth and volatile exsolution1–3. Despite abundant evidence for an upper crustal magma reservoir beneath Yellowstone caldera4–7, its depth and the properties at its top have not been well constrained. New controlled-source seismic imaging illuminates a sharp reflective cap of the magma reservoir approximately 3.8 km beneath the northeastern caldera. Magma ascent to such low pressure is expected to drive volatile exsolution and potentially localized accumulation of bubbles near the top of the reservoir8,9, but this process typically remains hidden in contemporary volcanic systems. P-wave and P-to-S-wave reflections from the sharp top of the Yellowstone magma reservoir indicate that a mixture of supercritical fluid and magma fills the pore space at the cap of the approximately 3–8-km-deep low-shear-velocity layer imaged by seismic tomography6,7. The results are consistent with partial retention of bubbles exsolved from an upper crustal reservoir with ongoing magma supply from a volatile-enriched mantle source. Bubble accumulation can eventually lead to reservoir instability2,8, but the bubble volume fraction seismically estimated at the top of the reservoir today is lower than typical estimates of pre-eruptive conditions for rhyolites1,10,11, and measurements of the hydrothermal system document high fluxes of magmatic volatiles escaping to the surface12–15. We infer that the magma reservoir is in a stable state of efficient bubble ascent into the hydrothermal system on the basis of estimates that it is a crystal-rich (less than 30% porosity) reservoir for which dynamic modelling favours channelized bubble escape that prevents instability8.

 Despite the continuing progress in integrated optical frequency comb technology1, compact sources of short, bright pulses in the mid-infrared wavelength range from 3 to 12 μm so far remain beyond reach. The state-of-the-art ultrafast pulse emitters in the mid-infrared are complex, bulky and inefficient systems based on the downconversion of near-infrared or visible pulsed laser sources. Here we show a purely DC-driven semiconductor laser chip that generates 1-ps solitons at the centre wavelength of 8.3 μm at GHz repetition rates. The soliton generation scheme is akin to that of passive nonlinear Kerr resonators2. It relies on a fast bistability in active nonlinear laser resonators, unlike traditional passive mode-locking, which relies on saturable absorbers3, or active mode-locking by gain modulation in semiconductor lasers4. Monolithic integration of all components—drive laser, active ring resonator, coupler and pump filter—enables turnkey generation of bright solitons that remain robust for hours of continuous operation without active stabilization. Such devices can be readily produced at industrial laser foundries using standard fabrication protocols.

 Parkinson’s disease is caused by the loss of dopamine neurons, causing motor symptoms. Initial cell therapies using fetal tissues showed promise but had complications and ethical concerns1–5. Pluripotent stem (PS) cells emerged as a promising alternative for developing safe and effective treatments6. In this phase I/II trial at Kyoto University Hospital, seven patients (ages 50–69) received bilateral transplantation of dopaminergic progenitors derived from induced PS (iPS) cells. Primary outcomes focused on safety and adverse events, while secondary outcomes assessed motor symptom changes and dopamine production for 24 months. There were no serious adverse events, with 73 mild to moderate events. Patients’ anti-parkinsonian medication doses were maintained unless therapeutic adjustments were required, resulting in increased dyskinesia. Magnetic resonance imaging showed no graft overgrowth. Among six patients subjected to efficacy evaluation, four showed improvements in the Movement Disorder Society Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale part III OFF score, and five showed improvements in the ON scores. The average changes of all six patients were 9.5 (20.4%) and 4.3 points (35.7%) for the OFF and ON scores, respectively. Hoehn–Yahr stages improved in four patients.

 During classical non-homologous end joining (cNHEJ), DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) encapsulates free DNA ends, forming a recruitment platform for downstream end-joining factors including ligase 4 (LIG4)1. DNA-PK can also bind telomeres and regulate their resection2–4, but does not initiate cNHEJ at this position. How the end-joining process is regulated in this context-specific manner is currently unclear. Here we show that the shelterin components TRF2 and RAP1 form a complex with DNA-PK that directly represses its end-joining function at telomeres. Biochemical experiments and cryo-electron microscopy reveal that when bound to TRF2, RAP1 establishes a network of interactions with KU and DNA that prevents DNA-PK from recruiting LIG4. In mouse and human cells, RAP1 is redundant with the Apollo nuclease in repressing cNHEJ at chromosome ends, demonstrating that the inhibition of DNA-PK prevents telomere fusions in parallel with overhang-dependent mechanisms. Our experiments show that the end-joining function of DNA-PK is directly and specifically repressed at telomeres, establishing a molecular mechanism for how individual linear chromosomes are maintained in mammalian cells.

 The interplay between nontrivial band topology and layered antiferromagnetism in MnBi2Te4 has opened a new avenue for exploring topological phases of matter1–4. The quantum anomalous Hall effect5 and axion insulator state6 have been observed in odd and even number layers of MnBi2Te4, and the quantum metric nonlinear Hall effect7,8 has been shown to exist in this topological antiferromagnet. The rich and complex antiferromagnetic spin dynamics in MnBi2Te4 is expected to generate new quantum anomalous Hall phenomena that are absent in conventional ferromagnetic topological insulators, but experimental observations are still unknown. Here we fabricate a device of 7-septuple-layer MnBi2Te4 covered with an AlOx capping layer, which enables the investigation of antiferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall effect over wide parameter spaces. By tuning the gate voltage and perpendicular magnetic field, we uncover a cascade of quantum phase transitions that can be attributed to the influence of complex spin configurations on edge state transport. Furthermore, we find that an in-plane magnetic field enhances both the coercive field and the exchange gap of the surface state, in contrast to that in the ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall state. Combined with numerical simulations, we propose that these peculiar features arise from the spin flip and flop transitions that are inherent to a van der Waals antiferromagnet.

 Impaired differentiation is a hallmark of myeloid malignancies1,2. Therapies that enable cells to circumvent the differentiation block, such as all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and arsenic trioxide (ATO), are by and large curative in acute promyelocytic leukaemia3, but whether ‘differentiation therapy’ is a generalizable therapeutic approach for acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) and beyond remains incompletely understood. Here we demonstrate that simultaneous inhibition of the histone demethylase LSD1 (LSD1i) and the WNT pathway antagonist GSK3 kinase4 (GSK3i) robustly promotes therapeutic differentiation of established AML cell lines and primary human AML cells, as well as reducing tumour burden and significantly extending survival in a patient-derived xenograft mouse model. Mechanistically, this combination promotes differentiation by activating genes in the type I interferon pathway via inducing expression of transcription factors such as IRF7 (LSD1i) and the co-activator β-catenin (GSK3i), and their selective co-occupancy at targets such as STAT1, which is necessary for combination-induced differentiation. Combination treatment also suppresses the canonical, pro-oncogenic WNT pathway and cell cycle genes. Analysis of datasets from patients with AML suggests a correlation between the combination-induced transcription signature and better prognosis, highlighting clinical potential of this strategy. Collectively, this combination strategy rewires transcriptional programs to suppress stemness and to promote differentiation, which may have important therapeutic implications for AML and WNT-driven cancers beyond AML.

 The formation of accessible chromatin around DNA double-strand breaks is essential for their efficient repair1. Although the linker histone H1 is known to facilitate higher-order chromatin compaction2,3, the mechanisms by which H1 modifications regulate chromatin relaxation in response to DNA damage are unclear. Here we show that CTP synthase 1 (CTPS1)-catalysed deamidation of H1 asparagine residues 76 and 77 triggers the sequential acetylation of lysine 75 following DNA damage, and this dual modification of H1 is associated with chromatin opening. Mechanistically, the histone acetyltransferase p300 showed a preference for deamidated H1 as a substrate, establishing H1 deamidation as a prerequisite for subsequent acetylation. Moreover, high expression of CTPS1 was associated with resistance to cancer radiotherapy, in both mouse xenograft models and clinical cohorts.

 Despite the widespread use of mRNA vaccines against COVID-19, little is known about the metabolism of therapeutic RNAs. Here we use nanopore sequencing1–3 to analyse individual therapeutic mRNA molecules, focusing on their poly(A) tails. We show that the Moderna mRNA-1273 vaccine4 has a poly(A) tail of around 100 nucleotides, followed by an mΨCmΨAG sequence. In cell lines, mRNA-1273 undergoes rapid degradation initiated by mΨCmΨAG removal, followed by CCR4–NOT-mediated deadenylation. However, in medically relevant preclinical models, particularly in macrophages, mRNA-1273 poly(A) tails are extended to up to 200 nucleotides by the TENT5A poly(A) polymerase5–7, which is induced by the vaccine. Re-adenylation, which stabilizes target mRNAs, is consistently observed in synthetic mRNAs that encode proteins targeted to the endoplasmic reticulum, such as ovalbumin or antigens from Zika virus8 or the malaria parasite9. The extent of re-adenylation varies: the BioNTech–Pfizer BNT162b2 vaccine10 shows less potent re-adenylation than mRNA-1273, which correlates with a smaller proportion of membrane-associated BNT162b2. This highlights the crucial role of spatial accessibility to ER-resident TENT5A in determining re-adenylation efficiency. In vivo, TENT5A is expressed in immune cells that take up mRNA vaccine, and TENT5A deficiency reduces specific immunoglobulin production for mRNA vaccines after immunization in mice. Overall, our findings reveal a principle for enhancing the efficacy of therapeutic mRNAs, paving the way for improvement. Upon intramuscular administration, COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are primarily taken up by macrophages, in which the cellular machinery extends their poly(A) tails, thereby increasing mRNA stability and translation, providing an explanation for the efficacy of these vaccines."

 The rapid advent of high-throughput omics technologies has created an exponential growth in biological data, often outpacing our ability to derive molecular insights. Large-language models have shown a way out of this data deluge in natural language processing by integrating massive datasets into a joint model with manifold downstream use cases. Here we envision developing multimodal foundation models, pretrained on diverse omics datasets, including genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, proteomics, metabolomics and spatial profiling. These models are expected to exhibit unprecedented potential for characterizing the molecular states of cells across a broad continuum, thereby facilitating the creation of holistic maps of cells, genes and tissues. Context-specific transfer learning of the foundation models can empower diverse applications from novel cell-type recognition, biomarker discovery and gene regulation inference, to in silico perturbations.

 Proliferating hepatocytes often undergo ductal metaplasia to balance the energy trade-off between cellular functions and replication, hindering the expansion of human adult hepatocytes with functional competency1. Here we demonstrate that the combined activation of Wnt and STAT3 signalling enables long-term self-renewal of human adult hepatocyte organoids. YAP activation facilitates hepatocyte proliferation but commits it towards the biliary duct lineage. By contrast, STAT3 activation by oncostatin M induces hepatocyte proliferation while counteracting ductal metaplasia and maintaining the hepatic identity. Xenotransplanted hepatocyte organoids repopulate the recipient mouse liver and reconstitute the metabolic zonation structure. Upon niche factor removal and hormone supplementation, hepatocyte organoids form cord-like structures with bile canalicular networks and exhibit major liver metabolic functions comparable to those of in vivo hepatocytes. Hepatocyte organoids are amenable to gene editing, prompting functional modelling of inherent metabolic liver diseases. The new culture system offers a promising avenue for developing therapeutic strategies against human liver diseases.

 Protein misfolding diseases, including α1-antitrypsin deficiency (AATD), pose substantial health challenges, with their cellular progression still poorly understood1–3. We use spatial proteomics by mass spectrometry and machine learning to map AATD in human liver tissue. Combining Deep Visual Proteomics (DVP) with single-cell analysis4,5, we probe intact patient biopsies to resolve molecular events during hepatocyte stress in pseudotime across fibrosis stages. We achieve proteome depth of up to 4,300 proteins from one-third of a single cell in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue. This dataset reveals a potentially clinically actionable peroxisomal upregulation that precedes the canonical unfolded protein response. Our single-cell proteomics data show α1-antitrypsin accumulation is largely cell-intrinsic, with minimal stress propagation between hepatocytes. We integrated proteomic data with artificial intelligence-guided image-based phenotyping across several disease stages, revealing a late-stage hepatocyte phenotype characterized by globular protein aggregates and distinct proteomic signatures, notably including elevated TNFSF10 (also known as TRAIL) amounts. This phenotype may represent a critical disease progression stage. Our study offers new insights into AATD pathogenesis and introduces a powerful methodology for high-resolution, in situ proteomic analysis of complex tissues. This approach holds potential to unravel molecular mechanisms in various protein misfolding disorders, setting a new standard for understanding disease progression at the single-cell level in human tissue.

 Ocean submesoscale (1–100 km) processes and their substantial impact on Earth’s climate system have been increasingly emphasized in recent decades by high-resolution numerical models and regional observations1–11. However, the dynamics and energy associated with these processes, including submesoscale eddies and nonlinear internal waves, have never been observed from a global perspective.

 DNA sequence-specific transcription factors (TFs) modulate transcription and chromatin architecture, acting from regulatory sites in enhancers and promoters of eukaryotic genes1,2. How multiple TFs cooperate to regulate individual genes is still unclear. In yeast, most TFs are thought to regulate transcription via binding to upstream activating sequences, which are situated within a few hundred base pairs upstream of the regulated gene3. Although this model has been validated for individual TFs and specific genes, it has not been tested in a systematic way. Here we integrated information on the binding and expression targets for the near-complete set of yeast TFs and show that, contrary to expectations, there are few TFs with dedicated activator or repressor roles, and that most TFs have a dual function. Although nearly all protein-coding genes are regulated by one or more TFs, our analysis revealed limited overlap between TF binding and gene regulation. Rapid depletion of many TFs also revealed many regulatory targets that were distant from detectable TF binding sites, suggesting unexpected regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a comprehensive survey of TF functions and offers insights into interactions between the set of TFs expressed in a single cell type and how they contribute to the complex programme of gene regulation.

 Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurodegenerative condition with a considerable health and economic burden1. It is characterized by the loss of midbrain dopaminergic neurons and a diminished response to symptomatic medical or surgical therapy as the disease progresses2. Cell therapy aims to replenish lost dopaminergic neurons and their striatal projections by intrastriatal grafting. Here, we report the results of an open-label phase I clinical trial (NCT04802733) of an investigational cryopreserved, off-the-shelf dopaminergic neuron progenitor cell product (bemdaneprocel) derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cells and grafted bilaterally into the putamen of patients with Parkinson’s disease. Twelve patients were enrolled sequentially in two cohorts—a low-dose (0.9 million cells, n = 5) and a high-dose (2.7 million cells, n = 7) cohort—and all of the participants received one year of immunosuppression. The trial achieved its primary objectives of safety and tolerability one year after transplantation, with no adverse events related to the cell product. At 18 months after grafting, putaminal 18Fluoro-DOPA positron emission tomography uptake increased, indicating graft survival.

 Structural disorder within materials gives rise to fascinating phenomena, attributed to the intricate interplay of their thermodynamic and electrochemical properties1,2. Oxygen-redox (OR) electrochemistry offers a breakthrough in capacity limits, while inducing structural disorder with reduced electrochemical reversibility3–5. The conventional explanation for the thermal expansion of solids relies on the Grüneisen relationship, linking the expansion coefficient to the anharmonicity of the crystal lattice6. However, this paradigm may not be applicable to OR materials due to the unexplored dynamic disorder–order transition in such systems7,8. Here we reveal the presence of negative thermal expansion with a large coefficient value of −14.4(2) × 10−6 °C−1 in OR active materials, attributing this to thermally driven disorder–order transitions. The modulation of OR behaviour not only enables precise control over the thermal expansion coefficient of materials, but also establishes a pragmatic framework for the design of functional materials with zero thermal expansion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the reinstatement of structural disorder within the material can also be accomplished through the electrochemical driving force. By adjusting the cut-off voltages, evaluation of the discharge voltage change indicates a potential for nearly 100% structure recovery. This finding offers a pathway for restoring OR active materials to their pristine state through operando electrochemical processes, presenting a new mitigation strategy to address the persistent challenge of voltage decay. Using operando electrochemical processes, we found a way to restore oxygen-redox active materials exhibiting structural and voltage decay to their pristine state, providing a framework for the design of functional materials with zero thermal expansion."

 A growing body of evidence suggests that molecular oxygen (O2) accumulated in some shallow marine environments beneath the effectively anoxic Archaean atmosphere 4.0 to 2.5 billion years (Ga) ago. Yet, the temporal and spatial distribution of these oxygen oases is not well known. Here we use thallium (Tl) isotope ratios, which are sensitive to manganese oxide burial, to place constraints on the timing and tempo of marine oxygen oases between about 2.65 Ga and 2.50 Ga. Lower-than-crustal authigenic 205Tl/203Tl ratios are common in shales from the approximately 2.65 Ga Jeerinah Formation (Western Australia) and the 2.50 Ga Klein Naute Formation (South Africa). Particularly low 205Tl/203Tl ratios are found at 2.50 Ga, coincident with a pronounced ‘whiff’ of O2. These data can be explained by widespread seafloor manganese oxide burial, a scenario that requires persistent O2 penetration into marine sediments beneath regionally extensive marine oxygen oases. By contrast, 205Tl/203Tl ratios from the 2.60–2.52 Ga Nauga Formation (South Africa) do not deviate from crustal values, suggesting an intervening period of muted seafloor Mn oxide burial. Our data suggest that O2 accumulated over greater spatial extents and to greater depths than previously thought at about 2.65 Ga and that marine oxygenation was spatially and temporally dynamic well before the Great Oxidation Event began at about 2.4 Ga.

 Earth’s first rise in atmospheric oxygen between about 2.43 billion and 2.1 billion years ago fundamentally transformed the atmosphere and oceans, setting the foundation for the evolution of complex life. However, geochemical evidence reveals intermittent oceanic oxygen oases before the rise of atmospheric oxygen, although the mechanisms that drove the production and accumulation of oxygen remain poorly constrained. Here we present redox-sensitive trace metal and iron speciation data, and phosphorus phase partitioning results, for a 2.93-billion-year-old drill core from the Red Lake area, Canada, to reconstruct oceanic phosphorus cycling and links to oxygen production in the dominantly anoxic, iron-rich Archaean ocean. Our data document one of the earliest known intervals of surface water oxygen accumulation, predating the first accumulation of atmospheric oxygen by about 500 Ma. These intervals were preceded by ferruginous intervals and intervals of enhanced sulfide availability, which led to pulsed increases in oceanic phosphorus bioavailability via anoxic recycling from sediments. Enhanced phosphorus bioavailability would have helped stimulate photosynthetic primary productivity and organic carbon burial, probably exerting a major control on the episodic development of oxygen oases in the late Archaean ocean. This, in turn, led to a critical transitional phase in the development of an oxygenated surface environment. Periods with enhanced iron and sulfide availability that promoted recycling of bioavailable phosphorus from sediments contributed to episodic development of oxygen oases in the Archaean ocean, according to analysis of trace metals, phosphorus and iron from 2.9-billion-year-old sediments."

 In diverse Phytophthora-plant pathosystems, Phytophthora secretes XLP1 (PsXEG1-Like Protein), a non-enzymatic paralog that functions as a decoy to protect XEG1 (Xyloglucan-specific Endoglucanase) from host inhibitors. Here, we show that the genus-specific selection pressures on the XEG1/XLP1 gene pair are crucial for host adaptation and are closely linked to Phytophthora host range. Our findings reveal that the XEG1/XLP1 gene pair originated within Phytophthora and subsequently evolved into genus-specific genes, undergoing functional divergence driven by preferential selection. Positive selection sites within the XEG1/XLP1 gene pair in Phytophthora contribute to this functional divergence and are associated with the host range variability of Phytophthora as evidenced by multivariate statistical analyses. Furthermore, mutations at key selection sites in Phytophthora sojae and Phytophthora capsici significantly impair their pathogenicity, with P. capsici exhibiting almost no colonization expansion on tobacco and pea. Notably, natural Phytophthora populations harbor mutations at the positive selection sites, indicating ongoing evolutionary pressures on the XEG1/XLP1 gene pair.

 Biogenesis of mitoribosomes requires dedicated chaperones, RNA-modifying enzymes, and GTPases, and defects in mitoribosome assembly lead to severe mitochondriopathies in humans. Here, we characterize late-step assembly states of the small mitoribosomal subunit (mtSSU) by combining genetic perturbation and mutagenesis analysis with biochemical and structural approaches. Isolation of native mtSSU biogenesis intermediates via a FLAG-tagged variant of the GTPase MTG3 reveals three distinct assembly states, which show how factors cooperate to mature the 12S rRNA. In addition, we observe four distinct primed initiation mtSSU states with an incompletely matured rRNA, suggesting that biogenesis and translation initiation are not mutually exclusive processes but can occur simultaneously. Together, these results provide insights into mtSSU biogenesis and suggest a functional coupling between ribosome biogenesis and translation initiation in human mitochondria.

Here authors found that a neural circuit from the medial preoptic area to the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray mediates context-dependent pain hypersensitivity in male, but not female, mice, which requires activation of testosterone signaling. 
 The neural mechanisms underlying sex-specific pain, in which males and females exhibit distinct responses to pain, remain poorly understood. Here we show that in a mouse model of male-specific pain hypersensitivity response to pain conditioning environments (contextual pain hypersensitivity model), elevated free-testosterone leads to hyperactivity of glutamatergic neurons in the medial preoptic area (GlumPOA) through activation of androgen receptor signaling, which in turn induces contextual pain hypersensitivity in male mice. Although not observed in naïve female mice, this pain phenotype could be induced in females via chronic administration of testosterone propionate. In addition, GlumPOA neurons send excitatory inputs to GABAergic neurons in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (GABAvlPAG) that are required for contextual pain hypersensitivity. Our study thus demonstrates that testosterone/androgen receptor signaling enhances GlumPOA → GABAvlPAG pathway activity, which drives a male-specific contextual pain hypersensitivity, providing insight into the basis of sexually dimorphic pain response. Neural mechanisms underlying sex-dependent conditioned pain hypersensitivity are not fully understood.

 The discovery of the kagome metal CsV3Sb5 has generated significant interest in its complex physical properties, particularly its superconducting behavior under different pressures, though its nature remains debated. Here, we performed low-temperature, high-pressure 121/123Sb nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) measurements to explore the superconducting pairing symmetry in CsV3Sb5. At ambient pressure, we found that the spin-lattice relaxation rate 1/T1 exhibits a kink at T ~ 0.4 Tc within the superconducting state and follows a T3 variation as temperature further decreases. This suggests the presence of two superconducting gaps with line nodes in the smaller one. As pressure increases beyond Pc ~ 1.85 GPa, where the charge-density wave phase is completely suppressed, 1/T1 shows no Hebel-Slichter peak just below Tc, and decreases rapidly, even faster than T5, indicating that the gap is fully opened for pressures above Pc. In this high pressure region, the angular dependence of the in-plane upper critical magnetic field Hc2 breaks the C6 rotational symmetry. We propose the s + id pairing at P > Pc which explains both the 1/T1 and Hc2 behaviors. Our findings indicate that CsV3Sb5 is an unconventional superconductor and its superconducting state is even more exotic at high pressures. The authors study CsV3Sb5 by nuclear quadrupole resonance.

 Global warming intensifies extreme heat events, threatening crop reproduction by impairing pollen development, germination, and tube growth. However, the mechanisms underlying pollen heat responses remain elusive. The actin cytoskeleton and actin-binding proteins (ABPs) are crucial in these processes, yet their roles under heat stress are poorly understood. Here, we identify a mutant, pollen germination sensitive to LatB (pgsl1), via forward genetic screening. PGSL1 encodes a heat-stable, plant-specific ABP that binds and stabilizes actin filaments (F-actin), preventing heat-induced denaturation. High temperatures reduce F-actin content but promote bundling in pollen tubes. Notably, pgsl1 mutants exhibit decreased F-actin abundance and bundling under heat stress compared to wild-type plants. These findings highlight PGSL1 as a key regulator of actin dynamics, essential for pollen heat tolerance, offering potential strategies to enhance crop resilience in a warming climate.

 The structure-performance relationship for single atom catalysts has remained unclear due to the averaged coordination information obtained from most single-atom catalysts.

By tuning interactions via continuous dialysis, researchers uncovered new crystal types, including a previously unknown open-framework structure. 
 Crystallization stands as a prime example of self-assembly. Elementary building blocks converge, seemingly adhering to an intricate blueprint, orchestrating order from chaos. While classical theories describe crystallization as a monomer-by-monomer addition, non-classical pathways introduce complexity. Using microscopic charged particles as monomers, we uncover the mechanisms governing the formation of ionic colloidal crystals. Our findings reveal a two-step process, wherein metastable amorphous blobs condense from the gas phase, before evolving into small binary crystals. These small crystals then grow into large faceted structures via three simultaneous processes: addition of free monomers from bulk, capture and absorption of surrounding blobs, and oriented attachment of other crystals. These complex crystallization pathways occur both in bulk and on surfaces across a range of particle sizes and interaction strengths, resulting in a diverse array of crystal types and morphologies. Harnessing our ability to tune the interaction potential through small changes in salt concentration, we developed a continuous dialysis approach that allows fine control over the interaction strength in both time and space. This method enables us to discover and characterize various crystal structures in a single experiment, including a previously unreported low-density hollow structure and the heteroepitaxial formation of composite crystal structures.

These negative heat content anomalies played a crucial role in sustaining cold sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) into the third year. In contrast, the 2020–2023 event, which lacked significant negative heat content anomalies, was characterized by persistent equatorial easterly wind anomalies induced by extratropical forcing from the Southern Hemisphere. The EPM successfully captures these differences, with tropical ocean-atmosphere coupling being the dominant factor in predictability for 1998–2001, especially during the second year, whereas extratropical forcing played a key role in improving forecasts for 2020–2023. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating extratropical influences to enhance the prediction skill of multi-year La Niña events, especially those with atypical tropical precursors."

 Hot–wet compound events, the sequential occurrence of humid hot days followed by extreme rainfall, can cause catastrophic consequences, often exceeding the impacts of the isolated occurrence of each event. The urban-coastal microclimate is confounded by complex interactions of land–sea breeze circulations, urban effects of convection and rainfall, and horizontal advection of moisture, which can favor the hot–wet compound occurrence. We present the first observational assessment (1951–2022) of summertime hot–wet compound events across global coastal megacities. We find a significant (P < 0.001) increase in the frequency of hot–wet compound events in both hemispheres: on average, ~3 events in the 1950s to 43 events in the 2020s. Cities with upward trends in the frequency of hot–wet compound events are situated < 30 km from coasts, with cities in the southern hemisphere showing faster hot-to-wet transition times (<3 days) than cities in the northern hemisphere. Further, 26 out of 29 sites show increased extreme precipitation, reaching 153%, when humid heat amplitude rises from the 50th to 90th percentiles. Understanding hot–wet compound interactions over the world’s coasts is highly relevant for climate change impact assessment and informing climate adaptation."

 Individuals experience varying levels of social vulnerability to power grid outages caused by disasters. Neglecting social vulnerability in energy resilience strategies can lead to uneven recovery, which has become a major concern in the U.S. However, few studies consider environmental and infrastructural factors in their social vulnerability analysis. Here we introduce a conceptual Power Outage-Risk integrated Social Vulnerability Index (PO-RSVI) to assess vulnerability of small residential communities to prolonged outages. The proposed index comprises dimensions of prolonged outage susceptibility, community coping capacity, and community accessibility, each with indicators evaluating social hardship during power outages. Additionally, an extensive analysis investigates the relationship between PO-RSVI and willingness to pay for emergency power supplies during such event. Through an extensive analysis of three Texas communities using survey and online datasets, PO-RSVI effectively highlights disparities missed by conventional assessments and provides valuable insights for policymakers and energy resilience planners.

 The year 2023 shattered numerous heat records both globally and regionally. We here focus on the drivers of the unprecedented warm sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies which started in the North Atlantic Ocean in early summer and persisted later on. Evidence is provided that 2023 should be interpreted as an extreme event in a warmer world because of superimposed internal variability on top of human forcing, which altogether, made the 2023 event all-time high due to extreme air-sea surface fluxes in the subtropics and eastern basin. The effect of internal variability has been considerably boosted by the long-term ocean stratification increase due to combined anthropogenically-driven ocean warming and multidecadal variability. The 2023 event would have been impossible to occur without anthropogenically-driven climate change but at the current warmer background climate state, it is assessed as a decadal-type event when considering the full North Atlantic ocean and a centennial event in the subtropics and eastern basin.

 Inorganic mercury (iHg) is an anthropogenic pollutant that forms monomethylmercury, a neurotoxicant affecting human health through seafood consumption. Despite iHg emissions reductions, the impact on oceanic concentrations remains unclear due to limited long-term data. Here, we present a four-year weekly time series of oceanic iHg concentrations at Scripps Pier in La Jolla, California, capturing interannual and seasonal variability. Interannual variability is driven by wet season precipitation, with wet years exhibiting sevenfold higher iHg concentration variance than dry years, potentially linking to El Niño-Southern Oscillation. Seasonally, precipitation and wave dynamics influence iHg inputs, with wet seasons driven by precipitation and runoff and dry seasons by upwelling. These parameters informed a model built to reconstruct a 20-year record of iHg concentrations, suggesting a long-term decline of 0.005 pM yr−1 due to climate-driven effects alone. This study highlights challenges in detecting long-term trends and emphasizes the need for sustained monitoring of oceanic iHg.

Few studies to date have investigated drivers of this recovery and its impacts on human societies at the national scale. Here we assessed the range expansion of six large terrestrial mammal species over 40 years—sika deer, wild boar, Japanese serow, Japanese macaque, Asiatic black bear, and brown bear—by comparing newly occupied and unoccupied areas using distribution data in Japan. We found evidence that increased agricultural abandonment and decreased snowfall drove these range expansions.

 As the world’s largest wheat producer, China’s stable wheat production is crucial for global food security. However, climate change has increased yield variability, while excessive water and nitrogen (N) inputs threaten resource sustainability and environmental health. Here, we explored the possibility of yield gap reduction through efficient agronomic practices.

 Frequent multispectral observations of sufficient spatial detail from well-calibrated spaceborne sensors are needed for large-scale terrestrial monitoring. To meet this demand, the NASA Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) project was initiated in early 2010s to produce comparable 30-m surface reflectance from the US Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI) and the European Copernicus Sentinel-2A MultiSpectral Instrument (MSI), and currently from two OLI and two MSI sensors, by applying atmospheric correction to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) reflectance, masking out clouds and cloud shadows, normalizing bi-directional reflectance view angle effects, adjusting for sensor bandpass differences with the OLI as the reference, and providing the harmonized data in a common grid. Several versions of HLS dataset have been produced in the last few years. The recent improvements on almost all the harmonization algorithms had prompted a production of a new HLS dataset, tagged Version 2.0, which was completed in the summer of 2023 and for the first time takes on a global coverage (except for Antarctica). The HLS V2.0 data record starts in April 2013, two months after Landsat 8 launch. For 2022, the first whole year two Landsat and two Sentinel-2 satellites were available, HLS provides a global median of 66 cloud-free observations over land, substantially more than from a single sensor. This paper describes the HLS algorithm improvements and assesses the harmonization efficacy by examining how the reflectance difference between contemporaneous Landsat and Sentinel-2 observations was successively reduced by each harmonization step. The assessment was conducted on 545 pairs of globally distributed same-day Landsat/Sentinel-2 images from 2021 to 2022. Compared to the TOA data, the HLS atmospheric correction slightly increased the reflectance relative difference between Landsat and Sentinel-2 for most of the spectral bands, especially for the two blue bands and the green bands. The subsequent bi-directional reflectance view angle effect normalization effectively reduced the between-sensor reflectance difference present in the atmospherically corrected data for all the spectral bands, and notably to a level below the TOA differences for the red, near-infrared (NIR), and the two shortwave infrared (SWIR) bands. The bandpass adjustment only had a modest effect on reducing the between-sensor reflectance difference. In the final HLS products, the same-day reflectance difference between Landsat and Sentinel-2 was below 4.2% for the red, NIR, and the two SWIR bands, all smaller than the difference in the TOA data. However, the between-sensor differences for the two blue and the green bands remain slightly higher than in TOA data, and this reflects the difficulty in accurately correcting for atmospheric effects in the shorter wavelength visible bands. The data consistency evaluation on a suite of commonly used vegetation indices (VI) calculated from the HLS V2.0 reflectance data showed that the between-sensor VI difference is below 4.5% for most of the indices. These results suggest that the harmonization is robust and the HLS V2.0 data are adequate for quantitative terrestrial applications."

 Landslides stand as a prevalent geological risk in mountainous areas, presenting substantial danger to human habitation. The slip surface (SSF), volume, type and evolution of landslides constitute crucial information from which to understand landslide mechanisms and assess landslide risk. However, current methods for obtaining this information, relying primarily on field surveys, are usually time-consuming, labor-intensive and costly, and are more applicable to individual landslides than large-scale landslide groups. To tackle these challenges, we present a novel method utilizing multi-orbit Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data to deduce the SSF, volume and type of active landslides. In this method, the SSF of landslides over a wide area is determined from three-dimensional deformation fields by assuming that the most authentic direction of the landslide movement aligns parallel to the SSF, on the basis of which the volume and type of active landslides can also be inferred. This approach was utilized with landslide groups in Gongjue County (LGGC), situated in the eastern Tibetan Plateau, which pose grave peril to community members and critical construction along the upstream/downstream of the Jinsha River. Firstly, SAR images were gathered and interferometrically processed from four separate platforms, spanning the period from July 2007 to August 2022. Then, three-dimensional displacement time series were inverted based on Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) observations and a topography-constrained model, from which the SSF, volume and type were determined using our proposed method. Finally, the Tikhonov regularization method was applied to reconstruct 15-year displacement time series along the sliding surface, and potential driving factors of landslide motion were identified. Results indicate that 53 landslides were detected in the LGGC region, of which ∼70 % were active and complex landslides with maximum cumulative displacement along the sliding surface reaching 1.5 m over the past ∼15 years. In addition, the deepest SSF of these landslides was found to reach 114 m, with volumes ranging from 1.66 × 105 m3 to 1.72 × 108 m3. Independent in-situ measurements validate the reliability of the SSF obtained in this study. More particularly, we found that the 2018 failure of the Baige landslide (approximately 50 km from LGCC) had caused persistent acceleration to those wading landslides, highlighting the prolonged impact of external factors on landslide evolution. These insights provide a deeper understanding of landslide dynamics and mechanisms, which is crucial when implementing early warning systems and forecasting future failure events."

 Precision management of soil organic carbon (SOC) is crucial for regulating the global carbon cycle and ensuring food security. Currently, SOC prediction remains challenging due to unresolved moisture disturbances, underutilized multimodal remote sensing data, and uncertain model transferability. To address these challenges, a new paradigm integrating moisture elimination with advanced hybrid deep learning has been developed. Firstly, this research employs optimal cluster analysis based on soil moisture spatial characteristics, followed by the application of the Kubelka-Munk radiative transfer model to construct a moisture elimination strategy (MES). Next, a hybrid deep learning model, Multimodal Transformer Mechanism-Convolutional Neural Network-Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory (MT-CNN-ConvLSTM, MCCL), is constructed to enhance predictive accuracy and generalizability. The MCCL model was compared to other machine learning and deep learning models, including LSTM, Random Forest (RF), CNN, Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and partial least squares regression (PLSR). Results indicate that (1) the proposed paradigm achieves optimal SOC content prediction accuracy in humid regions, with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.58 g kg−1, a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.76, a ratio of performance to interquartile distance (RPIQ) of 2.26, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.73 g kg−1. The model shows better performance in semi-humid regions, yielding an RMSE of 3.12 g kg−1, R2 of 0.77, RPIQ of 2.27, and MAE of 4.71 g kg−1, indicating significant spatial transferability. (2) Under MES, multiple models showed improved R2 using PLSR as the baseline: e.g., MCCL (41.4 %), LSTM (28.3 %), RF (17.2 %), CNN (14.1 %), ANN (8.1 %), and SVM (7.1 %). (3) The MES approach reduces RMSE by 1.06 g kg−1 and MAE by 1.58 g kg−1, while increasing R2 by 18.75 %, and RPIQ by 0.82. Using the KM radiative transfer model without cluster partitioning decreases RMSE and MAE by 0.58 g kg−1 and 0.23 g kg−1, while increasing R2 and RPIQ by 7.1 % and 0.3, respectively. Specifying the soil moisture gradient in the spectral correction process is crucial. The novel MES-MCCL paradigm proposed in this study is robust and provides promising insights into soil moisture masking’s spectral characterization and the potential of multimodal remote sensing for SOC monitoring."

 Closure studies on the total OH reactivity (OHR) are essential for validating comprehensive measurements of reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in various atmospheric environments. Nonetheless, discrepancies persist between measured OHR and calculated OHR in many field observations, primarily due to the presence of unknown VOCs and their reaction rate constants with OH radicals. This study optimized the method for calculating the rate constant (kOH) between isomers by categorization. The missing OH reactivity was reevaluated in an urban and a regional environment based on molecular formula. A notable missing OH reactivity was found during the rush hours in the morning and evening at the urban site, whereas the measured OHR agreed well with the calculated OHR at the regional site. Our analysis revealed that the oxidation products of VOCs significantly contributed to the OHR in highly-oxidizing atmospheres. After adding oxygenated VOCs, a negative correlation between missing OH reactivity and OH exposure was obtained. Finally, we determined the mean kOH values for unknown VOCs to be 9.0 × 10−11 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 at the urban site, respectively.

It was found that IVOCPAHs exhibited the highest reactivity among the four categories and might contribute more significantly to SOA. For some n-alkanes and PAHs, Dodecane (n-C12), Heptadecane (n-C17), and Acenaphthene (ACE) were more reactive species. Using the PMF model and accounting for the photochemical loss of IVOCs, four sources of IVOCs were identified: gasoline exhaust, biomass/coal combustion, diesel-related emissions, and other sources (industrial sources and fireworks emissions). Biomass/coal combustion dominated (54.6 % and 58.1 %, observed and initial) in HEB, while industrial sources were predominant in ZB (63 % and 62.7 %), and fireworks were the main source in ZK (67.5 % and 68.2 %). Our results highlight that biomass/coal combustion, industrial sources and vehicle emissions remain the primary control objects. We also suggest that there is a need to strengthen the emission control strategy for PAHs in IVOCs."

 This study evaluates personal exposure to volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in 50 workers from small-scale dry-cleaning facilities using optimized ePTFE passive samplers, analyzing 13 VOCs. At mean exposure levels, significant non-carcinogenic risks were identified for trichloroethylene (TCE), while carcinogenic risks were confirmed for five compounds: styrene, benzene, ethylbenzene, dichloroethene (DCE), and perchloroethylene (PCE). Workers most frequently reported health changes (48 %), followed by specific symptoms such as dry skin (24 %), fatigue (22 %), skin irritation (20 %), and eye fatigue (20 %), all of which were associated with exposure to different VOCs in the workplace. These findings highlight the need for continuous monitoring and guidelines regarding working hours, particularly in small-scale workplaces.

 Challenges persist in accurately predicting tropical cyclone (TC) intensification and intensity change, owing to restricted understanding of the mechanisms involved. Here the relationship between TC asymmetry (TCA) of outer-core wind field and intensification over the North Atlantic is investigated using best-track and satellite-based wind analysis data from 2000 to 2021. The results suggest a negative correlation between TCA and the upper limit of intensification rate (IR), except in nearly symmetric TCs. TC records are categorized into groups of low, medium, and high asymmetry based on the distribution of TCA. The 24-h evolution of TCA and its variation preceding intensification onset reveal significant differences between TCs with low-to-medium and high asymmetry. TCs with low-to-medium asymmetry tend to exhibit axisymmetrization of the wind field under smaller vertical wind shear (VWS). In contrast, highly asymmetric TCs display sharp increases in wind speed on the downshear-left side of greater-magnitude VWS vector, which can reduce vortex tilt and fortifies TC's resilience against VWS. Furthermore, TCs with higher TCA encounter greater challenges during their intensification stage, especially those with lower lifetime maximum intensity (LMI). TCA reflects the worsening disorganization of convection or the expansion of the inner-core wind field, rendering weaker TCs more susceptible to the effects of VWS. These findings underscore the nuanced relationship between TCA and TC intensification, demonstrating that TCA can serve as an additional indicator to improve the accuracy of TC intensity predictions, while also providing novel insights into the mechanisms driving TC intensification."

 We characterized optical properties (absorption, scattering, and backscattering coefficients, Ångström exponents, single scattering albedo) of aerosols during dust events at an urban site in El Paso, Texas using in-situ, real-time measurements. Simultaneous measurements of particulate matter (PM10, PM2.5) and wind data from an adjacent Texas Commission on Environmental Quality Continuous Ambient Monitoring Station are used in this study. Data from both sites was obtained at 5-min resolution. Twenty-seven dust events (15 synoptic, 12 mesoscale) occurred during 24 days from April–June 2021. HYSPLIT and STILT back-trajectories indicated many dust events (∼46 %) originated from the west-southwest (favoring transport across dust source areas in the Chihuahuan Desert). Mean absorption Ångström exponent values of El Paso dust (1.19 and 1.15 for synoptic and mesoscale events) were lower than published values for “pure” dust at other locations (generally accepted as greater than 2). Single scattering albedo values averaged 0.94 during synoptic and mesoscale dust events, confirming the scattering nature of mineral dust in the region. PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations averaged 191 and 41 μg/m3 during dust event periods versus 28 and 8.7 μg/m3 during non-event (background) periods. Absorption / scattering Ångström exponent ratios of dust event aerosols were representative of large particles-black carbon mixture rather than a “pure” dust, suggesting mixing with urban aerosols, while many observations during non-event periods fall into the large particles-black carbon mixture and large particles-low absorption categories, suggesting that dust is a constant key component of the aerosols in El Paso. The 5-min time resolution revealed the evolution of complex aerosol events (e.g., brown carbon followed by dust, multiple dust events within one day, fireworks, advection of low-absorption gypsum dust from White Sands.

 South China is one of the most active regions for thunderstorms in China, yet, research on the charge structure of thunderstorms in this area remains limited. This study utilized lightning data from the Guangdong Lightning Mapping Array and radar observations to examine the charge structure of a thunderstorm that occurred in South China on June 16, 2021. The thunderstorm's charge structure underwent transitions from a dipole in the early stage, a tripole during its mature stage, and back to a dipole in the dissipation period. The heights of the two charge regions in the initial dipolar charge structure increased rapidly. Throughout the storm, the lower positive charge region in the tripolar charge structure was involved in 11.8% of the total 1075 recorded flashes. The average distances between the high-density charge cores of the three charge regions were 2.8 km and 2.6 km from top to bottom. As the storm entered its dissipation stage, the upper positive charge region descended significantly more slowly than the larger particles, as indicated by the continuous decrease in radar reflectivity in this region. The dominant hydrometeors in the upper positive, middle negative, and lower positive charge regions were dry aggregated snow, graupel, and larger-size graupel, respectively, occupying approximately 81%, 67%, and 70% of the total volume in each region. Over the course of the three stages—when the lower positive charge region was initially uninvolved in discharges, became involved, and then ceased participation—the primary microphysical processes in the precipitation beneath the convective core were collisional breakup, size sorting, and collision-coalescence, respectively."

 Aerosols have a profound impact on the hydrological cycle, energy equilibrium, and ecological stability of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (TP) region. Reanalysis datasets provide comprehensive aerosol information for this area regardless of weather conditions, yet their accuracy and applicability remain to be verified. The aerosol types, aerosol optical depth (AOD) and three-dimensional spatial distribution of dust aerosol from MERRA-2 (Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2) and CAMS (Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service) aerosol reanalysis dataset are compared with the data from the CALIPSO (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) spaceborne lidar during the period spanning 2007 to 2011 across the TP. Both MERRA-2 and CAMS can accurately characterize the predominant aerosol type in the TP as dust. MERRA-2 demonstrated a superior capability in capturing individual aerosol occurrence event. Concerning dust AOD (DAOD), the correlation coefficient between monthly averaged DAOD of MERRA-2 (CAMS) and CALIPSO is 0.78 (0.90), with absolute deviations of 0.06 (0.05). Both MERRA-2 and CAMS can follow the annual variability with the peaks in spring and the troughs in winter. Spatially, MERRA-2 overestimated DAOD by 0.26 in the northwestern TP and the southern Indo-Gangetic Plain, while underestimated by −0.05 in the remaining regions. On the other hand, CAMS overestimated DAOD by 0.17 in the Taklimakan Desert, the Qaidam Basin in the northern TP, and the Thar Desert in southwestern TP, but underestimated by −0.10 elsewhere across the TP. Vertically, the annual averaged dust extinction coefficient decreased with increasing altitude among the CALIPSO, MERRA-2 and CAMS datasets. The dust extinction coefficient displayed a seasonal variation with higher values in spring and summer and lower values in autumn and winter. Compared with CALIPSO data, both MERRA-2 and CAMS tend to underestimate dust mass concentration near the surface layer, with CAMS exhibiting more pronounced underestimation, particularly in spring and summer. In the context of the dust emission over the TP, MERRA-2 demonstrates superior performance compared to CAMS in the Taklimakan and the Thar Desert, while CAMS exhibits a greater efficacy than MERRA-2 in anthropogenic aerosol emission sources such as the Indus Gangetic Plain. Furthermore, regarding atmospheric circulation and aerosol transport, the vertical distribution of dust in MERRA-2 aligns more closely with actual observations obtained from CALIPSO."

 Obtaining accurate grid precipitation data on the Tibetan Plateau (TP) has always been a challenge. Previous studies have shown that reanalysis data or corrected remote sensing precipitation products are important means of obtaining regional precipitation. Extensive evaluation studies have been conducted on the performance of these products on the TP based on observational data from the China Meteorological Administration (CMA). However, these gridded precipitation products incorporate a significant amount of CMA observational data during their production process, which undermines the objectivity of evaluation results when using the same data. In this study, 47 stations outside the CMA network were selected to evaluate the performance of two newly developed reanalysis precipitation datasets, the meteorological forcing dataset for the Third Pole region (TPMFD) and the CMA global land surface reanalysis product (CRA/Land), on the TP. Their performance was also compared with that of the IMERG Final Run V07, which has been corrected with rain gauge data. The results obtained showed that: (1) The spatial patterns of annual precipitation on the TP revealed by CRA/Land and GPM IMERG were consistent during 2001–2020. However, the TPMFD recorded higher annual precipitation, resulting in a spatial pattern that differed from both CRA/Land and IMERG. All three gridded precipitation products indicate an increasing trend in precipitation on the TP during the 2001–2020. (2) The evaluation results indicate that at the annual scale and cold season, TPMFD overestimates precipitation, while IMERG underestimates precipitation, with the CRA/Land precipitation data showing the highest accuracy. During the warm season, TPMFD also overestimated precipitation, while the accuracy of CRA/Land and IMERG is comparable. Overall, among these three datasets, the CRA/Land precipitation data demonstrates the highest accuracy on the TP. (3) TPMFD incorporates a substantial amount of observational data and applies a daily-scale correction scheme to address the precipitation observation errors. However, previous evaluation results have shown that the precipitation corrected by this scheme tend to be higher than the “true values”, which is a possible reason for the overestimation of precipitation by the TPMFD on the TP."

 The late summer (July and August) extreme high-temperature days (EHTDs) in Eastern China (24°–32°N, 115°–123°E) exhibit a significant increase around 1999/2000. Further investigation indicates that this shift aligns with the transition of the Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV) from a cold phase to a warm phase in the late 1990s. Before 1999, the relationship between the AMV and EHTDs is relatively weak and not significant. However, after 1999, this connection strengthens: During 2000–2022, warm sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) in the North Atlantic could induce an anomalous atmospheric wave train that propagates across the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere, resulting in a quasi-barotropic anticyclone and subsidence anomalies over Eastern China. This, in turn, leads to reduced cloud cover, allowing more downward net short-wave radiation (SWR) to reach the surface, warming Eastern China. Simultaneously, enhanced net long-wave radiation (LWR) and net sensible heat flux (SHF) further heat the overlying atmosphere. These processes trigger multiple years of increased EHTDs, raise the overall EHTDs average during the period, and lead to their decadal increase. The Community Earth System Model (CESM) Atlantic pacemaker experiments confirm that the warm North Atlantic forces anomalous high-pressure and anticyclonic circulation over Eastern China. Additionally, a case study from 2022 further supports the critical role of North Atlantic SSTA in driving the variation of EHTDs in Eastern China."

 Satellite precipitation products (SPPs) provide valuable information for hydrological modelling. This paper presents an evaluation of the hydrological utility of in total six Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) products. Specifically, as to the IMERG V06 and V07, both the near-real-time products, i.e., Early and Late, and the post-real-time product, i.e., Final, are evaluated at the daily timescale. Based on the GR4J hydrological model, three numerical experiments respectively focusing on the accuracy of precipitation estimation, the usefulness in streamflow simulation and the effectiveness in flood simulation are devised. Through a case study of 20 catchments across 5 climate zones in Australia from 2000 to 2021, the results highlight that the IMERG V07 products generally outperform the IMERG V06 products in the hydrological utility. For the accuracy of precipitation estimation, the relative bias (rBias) at the point scale of the IMERG V07 products tends to be lower than that of the IMERG V06 products. The median rBias is respectively −31.17% and −16.61% for the IMERG V06 and V07 Early products, is respectively −29.11% and −12.77% for the IMERG V06 and V07 Late products and is respectively −7.83% and −7.46% for the IMERG V06 and V07 Final products. There are evident improvements in streamflow simulation from the IMERG V06 products to the IMERG V07 products, with the median Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) increasing from 0.32 to 0.40 under the Early products, from 0.33 to 0.41 under the Late products and from 0.59 to 0.61 under the Final products. Regarding flood simulation, the percent bias in the flow duration curve high-segment volume (FHV) is reduced from the IMERG V06 products to the IMERG V07 products, with the median FHV increasing from −61.52% to −39.29% for the Early products, from −59.28% to −35.18% for the Late products and from −38.85% to −30.64% for the Final products.

Upon radiation, YTHDF1 is phosphorylated at serine-182 in an ataxia telangiectasia and Rad3-related–dependent manner.

Increased interleukin-6 level transcriptionally activates the USP24 expression, which leads to PD-1 stabilization. Furthermore, USP24 deficiency reduces PD-1 levels in CD8+T cells and attenuatesEgfrL858R-driven lung tumorigenesis inUsp24C1695Acatalytic deficient mice. Targeting PD-1 stability with the USP24-specific inhibitor USP24-i-101 boosts cytotoxic T cell activity, restrains lung tumor growth, and achieves superior therapeutic effects when combined with anti-CTLA4 immunotherapy. Clinically, patients with lung cancer exhibiting high USP24 expression in tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells display exhausted features and show unfavorable responses to immunotherapy. Our findings dissect the mechanism for regulating enhanced PD-1 stability in tumor-infiltrating CD8+T cells and reveal USP24 as a potential target of antitumor immunotherapy."

However, it remains unclear whether such differences exist in chemotherapy-induced neuropathic pain. Here, we conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical case data and found that peripheral sensory disorders occurred earlier in females than in males following bortezomib (BTZ) treatment in patients with multiple myeloma. BTZ treatment led to an early elevation of intercellular adhesion molecule–1, which triggered the infiltration of peripheral monocytes into the perivascular region of the spinal cord in female mice. The CC-chemokine ligand 1 released by infiltrating macrophages directly activated neurons or indirectly activated neurons by enhancing the astrocyte activity, ultimately leading to the earlier onset of BTZ-induced neuropathic pain in females. Together, clarifying the mechanism underlying the earlier onset of BTZ-induced neuropathic pain will contribute to the precise treatment of multiple myeloma in females."

MetR significantly improved neuromuscular function, metabolic health, lung function, and frailty. In addition, we confirmed improved neuromuscular function from dietary MetR in 5XFAD mice, whose weight was not affected by MetR. We did not observe benefits with TDP inhibition.

This leaves ssDNA unprotected and susceptible to breakage, a phenomenon known as replication catastrophe. However, the mechanism by which unprotected ssDNA breaks remains unclear. Here, we reveal that APOBEC3B is the key enzyme targeting unprotected ssDNA at replication forks, initiating a reaction cascade that induces fork collapse and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) hyperactivation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that uracils generated by APOBEC3B at replication forks are removed by UNG2, resulting in abasic sites that are subsequently cleaved by APE1 endonuclease. Moreover, we show that APE1-mediated DNA cleavage is the critical enzymatic step for PARP1 hyperactivation in cells, regardless of how abasic sites are generated on DNA. Last, we demonstrate that APOBEC3B-induced PARP1 trapping and DNA double-strand breaks drive cell sensitivity to ATR inhibition, creating a context of synthetic lethality when coupled with PARP inhibitors."

Drug screening identified cytarabine (Ara-C) as highly effective in inhibiting proliferation in H3 K27M cell models, recently established patient-derived cells, and patient-derived xenograft models. Mechanistically, Ara-C can suppress tumor growth through DNA damage, cell-cycle arrest, and apoptosis. An investigator-initiated clinical trial involving four patients showed benefits in three cases. In addition, a subset of cells exhibited senescence and senescence-associated secretory phenotype post–Ara-C treatment, accompanied by several immune checkpoint ligands’ up-regulation and more immune cell infiltration. Combining Ara-C with dual Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and TIGIT blockade emerged as a promising strategy to disrupt immune evasion by senescent cells, enhancing antitumor responses.

By modulating the phase of the excitation pulses, the ultrafast ET dynamics was found to change from 100 to 300 fs due to the different wave packets prepared by chirped pulses. We further found that the coherent control through the modulated wave packets can propagate into the subsequent back ET reactions resulting in the dynamics varying from 500 to 800 fs. This successful demonstration of coherent controlled ET reactions paves the way to control a variety of complex ET processes in chemical and biological systems."

We show that obese mice maintained under hypoxia exhibit a delayed but distinct decrease in blood glucose with improved insulin sensitivity, which is independent of changes in body weight. This effect of hypoxia is mediated by erythropoiesis and is a direct result of the rising hematocrit, which could be due to erythrocytes acting as carriers of glucose units in the blood. Glucose lowering by the red cell mass is evidenced by a prompt decrease in glycemia in mice receiving a blood transfusion. Furthermore, life under hypoxia as well as treatment with erythropoietin reduce glycemia also in mice expressing the erythropoietin receptor exclusively in hematopoietic cells, which contrasts with previous assumptions attributing metabolic actions of erythropoietin to direct action on nonhematopoietic tissues.

While neonates receive maternal protection, they can also independently combat pathogens, although the mechanisms remain unknown. Using the sugar glider (Petaurus breviceps) as a model, we investigated immunological defense strategies of marsupial neonates. Cathelicidins—a family of antimicrobial peptides expanded in the genomes of marsupials—are highly expressed in developing neutrophils. Sugar glider cathelicidins reside in two genomic clusters, and their coordinated expression is achieved by enhancer sharing within clusters and long-range physical interactions between clusters. Functionally, cathelicidins modulate immune responses and have potent antibacterial effects, sufficient to provide protection in a mouse model of sepsis. Evolutionarily, cathelicidins have a complex history, with marsupials and monotremes uniquely retaining both clusters among tetrapods. Thus, cathelicidins are critical mediators of marsupial immunity, and their evolution may reflect the life history–specific immunological needs of these animals."

Here, we propose a method for the simultaneous determination of mobility and lifetime using only one technique: transient photoluminescence spectroscopy. By measuring and simulating the decay of the photoluminescence intensity and the redshift of the photoluminescence peak as a function of time after the laser pulse, we extract the mobility, lifetime, and diffusion length of halide perovskite films.

During this year, each donor received three doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. Notwithstanding these vaccinations, the concentrations of the most abundant IgG1 clones remained constant. Given the 2- to 3-week half-life of IgG1 molecules in blood, our data suggest that these clones are associated with long-term immunity and do not undergo somatic hypermutation which would imply short-lived plasma cells.

To address this outstanding problem, we developed a technique to map the crystal orientations of these sulfates in situ at two stratigraphically similar locations in the Shenandoah formation, allowing us to constrain the burial depth and paleoenvironment at the time of their precipitation. Our crystal orientation mapping results and outcrop-scale fracture analyses reveal two different generations of Ca-sulfates: one likely precipitated in the shallow subsurface and a second one that formed at a burial depth below 80 meters.

Here, we explore earlier immune checkpoints, focusing on patients with contactin-associated protein-like 2 (CASPR2)–autoantibody encephalitis. In both disease and health, high (~0.5%) frequencies of unmutated CASPR2-reactive naïve B cells were identified. By contrast, CASPR2-reactive memory B cells were exclusive to patients, and their B cell receptors demonstrated affinity-enhancing somatic mutations with pathogenic effects in neuronal cultures and mice. The unmutated, precursor memory B cell receptors showed a distinctive balance between strong CASPR2 reactivity and very limited binding across the remaining human proteome.

Likewise, major volcanic eruptions cause a multiyear period of westward positioning, leading to distinct regional moisture gradients. Our record highlights important changes in flank behavior, which has important implications for water resource management in a warming world."

Liemohn;Natalia Ganjushkina;Austin Brenner;Ilya Usoskin;Mikhail Balikhin;Daniel T. Welling,"Wandering of the auroral oval 41,000 years ago","In the recent geological past, Earth’s magnetic field reduced to ~10% of the modern values and the magnetic poles shifted away from the geographic poles, causing the Laschamps geomagnetic excursion, about 41 millennia ago. The excursion lasted ~2000 years, with dipole strength reduction and tilting spanning 300 years. During this period, the geomagnetic field’s multipolarity resembled outer planets, causing rapid magnetospheric changes. To our knowledge, this study presents the first space plasma analysis of the excursion, linking the geomagnetic field, magnetospheric system, and upper atmosphere in sequence using feedback channels for distinct temporal epochs. A three-dimensional reconstruction of Earth’s geospace system shows that these shifts affected auroral regions and open magnetic field lines, causing them to expand and wander toward lower latitudes. These changes likely altered the upper atmosphere’s composition and influenced anthropological progress during that era. Looking through a modern lens, such an event would disrupt contemporary technology, including communications and satellite infrastructure."

However, the use of FPs in time-lapse imaging is frequently constrained by issues such as oligomerization or limited photostability. Here, we report the engineering of novel cyan, green, yellow, and red FPs that exhibit improved photostability and aggregation properties while retaining high in vivo brightness. We first derived superfolder green fluorescent protein into mChartreuse, a brighter, more photostable, and monomeric fluorophore. mChartreuse was further derived into cyan and yellow variants with enhanced photostability and dispersibility. We also report a mutation that eliminates residual oligomerization in red FPs derived fromDiscosomasp., such as mCherry or mApple. Incorporation of this mutation in mApple among other substitutions yielded mLychee, a bright and photostable monomeric red FP. These novel FPs advance fluorescence time-lapse analysis in bacteria, and their spectral properties match current imaging standards, ensuring seamless integration into existing research workflows."

Voth,Kinetic implications of IP6 anion binding on the molecular switch of HIV-1 capsid assembly,"HIV-1 capsid (CA) proteins self-assemble into a fullerene-shaped CA, enabling cellular transport and nuclear entry of the viral genome. A structural switch comprising the Thr-Val-Gly- Gly (TVGG) motif either assumes a disordered coil or a 310helix conformation to regulate hexamer or pentamer assembly, respectively. The cellular polyanion inositol hexakisphosphate (IP6) binds to a positively charged pore of CA capsomers rich in arginine and lysine residues mediated by electrostatic interactions. Both IP6binding and TVGG coil-to-helix transition are essential for pentamer formation. However, the connection between IP6binding and TVGG conformational switch remains unclear. Using extensive atomistic simulations, we show that IP6imparts structural order at the central ring, which results in multiple kinetically controlled events leading to the coil-to-helix conformational change of the TVGG motif. IP6facilitates the helix-to-coil transition by allowing the formation of intermediate conformations. Our results suggest a key kinetic role of IP6in HIV-1 pentamer formation."

Here, we use a coupled land-ocean-atmosphere model to simulate global plastic and microplastic dispersal for different OECD policy scenarios toward 2060. We establish a global plastic budget for the year 2015, with revised estimates of the total marine plastic pool of 263 teragrams (Tg, million tons), and land to sea plastic transport of 14 Tg per year, implying four to nine times larger leakage than OECD estimates. Model simulation of two ambitious policy scenarios show a peak in land to sea transport of total plastics of 23 Tg per year around 2045 and a decrease thereafter. Environmental concentrations of small microplastics remain high after 2060 due to continuous fragmentation of legacy mismanaged waste on land and indicate the need for remediation of legacy terrestrial plastic waste in policy instruments."

Murphy,Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia mutation reduces endothelial TDP-43 and causes blood-brain barrier defects,"Mutations in theTARDBPgene encoding TDP-43 protein are linked to loss of function in neurons and familial frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). We recently identified reduced nuclear TDP-43 in capillary endothelial cells (ECs) of donors with ALS-FTD. Because blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability increases in ALS-FTD, we postulated that reduced nuclear TDP-43 in ECs might contribute. Here, we show that nuclear TDP-43 is reduced in ECs of mice with an ALS-FTD–associated mutation in TDP-43 (TardbpG348C) and that this leads to cell-autonomous loss of junctional complexes and BBB integrity. Targeted excision of TDP-43 in brain ECs recapitulates BBB defects and loss of junctional complexes and ultimately leads to fibrin deposition, gliosis, phospho-Tau accumulation, and impaired memory and social interaction. Transcriptional changes in TDP-43–deficient ECs resemble diseased brain ECs. These data show that nuclear loss of TDP-43 in brain ECs disrupts the BBB and causes hallmarks of FTD."

Here, we report the discovery of a neural circuit required for the modulation of reproductive behavior by food sensing. A mutation that electrically silences the AVK interneurons uncouples egg laying from detection of environmental food cues. We find that AVK activity inhibits egg laying, and AVKs themselves are inhibited by dopamine released from food-sensing neurons. AVKs express a large number of structurally and functionally diverse neuropeptides. Coordination of food-sensing and reproductive behavior requires a subset of AVK neuropeptides that converge on a small ensemble of premotor neurons that coexpress their cognate receptors. Modulation ofC. elegansreproductive behavior, therefore, requires a cascade of neuromodulatory signals that uses disinhibition and combinatorial neuropeptide signals to activate reproductive behavior when food is sensed."
