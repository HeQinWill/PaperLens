Zhang;Hanqing Guo;Zhien Wang,Thermodynamics-guided machine learning model for predicting convective boundary layer height and its multi-site applicability,"We developed a new machine learning approach to estimate the height of the mixing layer in the lower atmosphere, which is important for predicting weather and air quality. By using daily temperature and heat patterns, the model learns how the atmosphere changes throughout the day. It gives accurate results across different locations and seasons, helping improve future climate and weather forecasts through better understanding of surface–atmosphere interactions. 
 Accurate estimation of convective boundary layer height (CBLH) is vital for weather, climate, and air quality modeling. Machine learning (ML) shows promise in CBLH prediction, but input parameter selection often lacks physical grounding, limiting generalizability. This study introduces a novel ML framework for CBLH prediction, integrating thermodynamic constraints and the diurnal CBLH cycle as an implicit physical guide. Boundary layer growth is modeled as driven by surface heat fluxes and atmospheric heat absorption represented with the low tropospheric stability, using the diurnal cycle as input and output. TPOT and AutoKeras are employed to select optimal models, validated against Doppler lidar-derived CBLH data, achieving an R2 of 0.84 across untrained years. Comparisons of eddy covariance (ECOR) and energy balance Bowen ratio (EBBR) flux measurements show the same prediction capability. Models trained on the ARM SGP C1 site with ECOR data and tested at E37 and E39 yield R2 values of 0.79 and 0.81, respectively, demonstrating their adaptability. The ML model trained with all sites' data slightly enhances the performance compared with ML models trained over single-site data. The interquartile range for predicted CBLH is consistently narrower than that for DL-derived CBLH, reflecting lower variability in predicted CBLH compared to DL-derived CBLH, which is influenced by additional factors, which are not well represented with the model inputs. The model's generalizability across multiple sites at the ARM SGP site demonstrates its potential for transfer to greater distances, offering a scalable approach for enhancing boundary layer parameterization in atmospheric models."

Using multiple instruments and models, aerosol particles were linked to wildfires, volcanic eruptions, and anthropogenic pollution. The aerosol consisted of spherical, fine-mode, weakly absorbing particles, which significantly reduced direct solar radiation. This combined approach improves understanding of Arctic aerosol events and climate processes. 
 In the summer of 2019, the Arctic region registered exceptionally high aerosol optical depth (AOD) values over Svalbard, linked to intense biomass burning (BB) and volcanic activity across the Northern Hemisphere. This study presents a comprehensive, multi-instrumental analysis of the aerosol conditions in and around Ny-Ålesund (Spitsbergen, Norway), combining data from ground-based sun-photometry, in-situ observations, active remote sensing (ground-based and on satellite), and atmospheric dispersion modelling (FLEXPART). Despite high AOD was observed during all the period, three different aerosol events are identified in the atmospheric column (6–10 July, 25–28 July, and 6–17 August). In contrast, in-situ surface stations only recorded significant aerosol load during 5–9 July, 30 August, and 12 September, suggesting that most of the aerosol particles remained above the boundary layer. Lidar and photometric observations revealed the presence of spherical, weakly absorbing Accumulation-mode particles (with effective radii between 0.1 and 0.2 µm) in both the troposphere and stratosphere, with persistent layers extending above 10 km. Simulations carried out with FLEXPART correlate well with the measurements, attributing the observed aerosol events to multiple sources, including Siberian and North American wildfires, the Raikoke (Russia) volcanic eruption, and anthropogenic pollution. While the simulations show a contribution from volcanic aerosols, the contribution from biomass-burning aerosols in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere were likely more significant under the atmospheric conditions of summer 2019. Overall, the aerosol radiative impact during this long-lasting event was substantial, with a mean reduction in direct solar radiation of approximately −74 W m−2 during July and August. This work shows how the use of dispersion modelling together with multiple observation sources allows to achieve a more complete description of the atmospheric aerosol events and contributes to a better understanding of the overall picture."

Miller;Robert Spirig;Zhaolong Wu;Yunpei Chu;Xia Li;Ulrike Lohmann;Jan Henneberger,Inferring the controlling factors of ice aggregation from targeted cloud seeding experiments,"Ice crystals in clouds aggregate, shaping snow and rain, yet rates are hard to measure. Using cloud seeding, we sampled crystals downwind after known times. A deep-learning algorithm quantified aggregation by counting crystal components. Initial ice concentration was the main driver, confirmed by causal analysis, physics, and machine learning, though weaker than theory predicts. Temperature, size, and shape also mattered, while turbulence was negligible. 
 Ice aggregation in clouds plays a crucial role in cloud development and precipitation formation. Despite the significance of ice aggregation, direct in situ quantification of aggregation rates in natural clouds has been challenging due to the difficulty of tracking ice crystals. Here, we present in situ measurements of ice aggregation rates in persistent supercooled stratiform clouds. Using novel glaciogenic seeding experiments (CLOUDLAB), ice crystals are nucleated upwind and subsequently measured downwind after a known advection time in cloud, allowing us to estimate their age. A deep-learning-based detection algorithm (IceDetectNet) counts the individual monomers of aggregates to derive the initial ice crystal number concentration (ICNCt0). We considered several factors that may influence ice aggregation, including ICNCt0, temperature, ice crystal size, aspect ratio, and turbulence. Among these, ICNCt0 was found to be the dominant factor controlling aggregation rates by three independent approaches: causal inference, a physical equation, and machine learning models. We report, however, a subquadratic dependence of the aggregation rate on ICNCt0 (mean exponent ∼ 0.92; 95 % CI: 0.88–0.97), in contrast to theoretical expectations (quadratic dependence). One possible explanation is that aggregation may also involve smaller ice crystals, but this remains hypothetical. To predict aggregation rates, we evaluated 11 machine learning models and a physically based formulation. CatBoost achieved the best statistical performance, while the physical model proved more robust in sensitivity tests. These findings provide new insights into the microphysical and environmental controls of ice aggregation and establish a robust methodological foundation for studying aggregation processes in natural clouds."

This study examines interannual and decadal changes in springtime dust emissions and quantifies the role of environmental factors and extratropical cyclones. Using multi-source datasets, a dust emission model, and cyclone tracking algorithms, we find that strong winds, particularly those linked to cyclones, are key drivers of these changes. 
 Dust activities across East Asia and North America have shown decadal variations, mediating radiation budget, air quality, and human health, especially during their peak months of April and May. Using satellite and ground measurements, as along with simulations from a dust emission model, we demonstrate an increase of 12.7 % and 23.4 % in April dust emissions across East Asia and North America, respectively, during the past four decades, in contrast to a 16.5 % and 2.5 % decrease during the last two decades. Meanwhile, both regions show a steady increase in May dust emissions by 5.7 % and 16.3 %, respectively, since the 1980s. Sensitivity experiments attribute both regions' decadal variations in dust emission primarily to surface wind speed changes; whereas vegetation exerts minimum influence on the regional dust emission variations. Furthermore, these decadal variations in dust initiating wind could largely be attributed to regime shifts in extratropical cyclone (EC), including their duration and intensity. Specifically, ECs are responsible for 60 %–70 % of the April–May total dust emissions in East Asia and 30 %–40 % of that in North America; meanwhile, ECs explain a larger portion of the decadal variations in April dust emission from East Asia (up to ∼80 %), compared with May and from North America. These results highlight the changing frequency and duration of strong winds, especially those associated with EC, and their role in shaping the decadal variations of mid-latitude dust emissions."

It can distinguish coarse dust, fine dust, and non-dust aerosols. Tests with real data from regions affected by desert dust show the method works well. This helps improve understanding of how particles are distributed in the atmosphere, which is important for air quality and climate studies. 
 Lidar-based algorithms for aerosol-type separation have the potential to improve air-quality assessments, estimates of aerosol direct and indirect radiative forcing, and the detailed characterization of their vertical distribution. In this study, we present an easy-to-apply algorithm that employs lidar-derived particle linear depolarization ratios measured at two wavelengths to separate up to three aerosol-type-specific particle backscatter fractions. These fractions are estimated under the assumptions that the depolarization ratios of each aerosol type in the mixture differ, and that both the depolarization ratios and the backscatter-related Ångström exponents at two wavelengths for each aerosol type are known. The mathematical relationship between particle linear depolarization ratios at two wavelengths for an aerosol mixture has been derived and expressed as a system of equations. These equations define the region of the observational space that can be meaningfully populated, with boundaries determined by the depolarization ratios and backscatter-related Ångström exponents of the pure aerosol types. Data collected in the Arabian Peninsula confirmed the predicted region of the observational space. The proposed algorithm is applied to synthetic dust mixtures as well as to atmospheric lidar observations of Arabian dust, Asian dust, Saharan dust and their mixtures, with the goal of decomposing coarse-mode dust, fine-mode dust, and low-depolarizing non-dust aerosols. We also discuss the impact of uncertainties in the prior optical properties of the pure aerosol types, along with the effects of observational uncertainties and biases. Overall, the method enhances the potential of dual-wavelength depolarization measurements for improving our understanding of the vertical distribution of coarse and fine dust."

Donovan;Gerd-Jan van Zadelhoff;Angela Benedetti;Holger Baars;Athena Augusta Floutsi;Nikos Benas;Martin Stengel;Christian Retscher;Edward Malina;Vassilis Amiridis,Derivation and validation of a refined dust product from Aeolus (L2A+),"The Aeolus satellite's lidar system had limitations in detecting certain atmospheric layers and distinguishing between aerosol and cloud types. To improve accuracy, a new dust detection product was developed. By combining data from various sources and validating it with ground-based measurements, this enhanced product performs better than the original. It helps improve dust transport models and weather predictions, making it a valuable tool for atmospheric monitoring and forecasting. 
 Originally designed as a wind lidar without depolarization measurement capability, ALADIN (Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument) detects only the co-polar component of the backscattered signal, limiting the accuracy of optical products in the presence of depolarizing atmospheric layers. The absence of the cross-polar component also prohibits ALADIN's ability to distinguish between different aerosol and cloud types, in its retrievals. To address these limitations, an enhanced Aeolus aerosol product (L2A+), with a focus on dust, has been developed in the present study to support aerosol data assimilation in dust transport models and improve Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP). The L2A+ product is generated through a series of processing steps that integrate multi-sensor satellite retrievals for cloud screening and aerosol layer characterization, CAMS reanalysis outputs to classify aerosol types, distinguish dust from non-dust fractions, and provide the missing depolarization ratio values required for the Polarization Lidar Photometer Networking (POLIPHON) technique, along with ground-based lidar measurements used for performance assessment. Both the primary (L2A) and enhanced (L2A+) Aeolus pure-dust backscatter coefficient profiles at 355 nm are retrieved using four different algorithms: the Standard Correct Algorithm (SCA), the Standard Correct Algorithm with middle-bin vertical scaling (SCA-MB), the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and AEL-PRO. These products are validated against ground-based reference observations obtained from the eVe and PollyXT lidar systems, operated as part of the ASKOS/JATAC experimental campaign in Mindelo, Cabo Verde. The approach is detailed on the basis of an indicative Aeolus overpass in the proximity of Mindelo on 3 September 2021, discussing ALADIN's sources of underestimation in terms of L2A backscatter coefficient at 355 nm profiles in the presence of desert dust particles across all four retrieval algorithms and the induced improvements achieved by accounting for the missing cross-polar component. A statistical evaluation of all Aeolus overpasses during the entire ASKOS/JATAC campaign in the Cabo Verde/Mindelo region confirms the enhanced performance of the upgraded L2A+ product compared to the original L2A product. This improvement is evident in both Aeolus-eVe and Aeolus-PollyXT comparisons across all retrieval algorithms and is marked by higher correlation coefficients and regression slopes along with lower biases and RMSE scores. Specifically, among the algorithms, the AEL-PRO and MLE L2A+ products show significant improvements in alignment with eVe lidar observations. The correlation coefficients increased from 0.59 to 0.67 for MLE and from 0.55 to 0.67 for AEL-PRO, while biases decreased from −0.99 to −0.85 Mm-1sr-1 for MLE and from −0.79 to −0.58 Mm-1sr-1 for AEL-PRO. They also achieve lower RMSE values (1.17 Mm-1sr-1 for MLE and 0.94 Mm-1sr-1 for AEL-PRO) and better regression slopes, increasing from 0.28 to 0.34 (MLE) and 0.27 to 0.39 (AEL-PRO). Similarly, L2A+ adjustments reduce biases and improve correlation coefficients, and regression slopes in Aeolus-PollyXT comparisons, among all four retrieval algorithms. Particularly, the AEL-PRO algorithm shows the strongest improvement in correlation, slope, and error metrics. All these advancements establish the enhanced L2A+ dust product as a strong candidate for aerosol data assimilation, supporting improved dust transport modeling and further enhancing Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP)."

However, its accuracy required to be further improved from middle stratosphere above. We developed a quality control scheme and evaluate the Fengyun bending angles’ quality. The new quality control scheme are useful in rejecting outliers and products’ quality have been well understood. The results are promising in improving the performance of Fengyun data in NWP and climate applications. 
 This study systematically evaluated the quality of ionosphere-corrected bending angles from Fengyun3 (FY3) D/E satellites (equipped with GPS and BDS receivers) using ERA5 data as references and MetOp products as comparisons. The quality of subsequent retrieved optimized bending angles, refractivity, and temperature were also analysed.  Ionosphere-corrected bending angle were assessed via two approaches: outlier detection across 10–80 km and bias/noise quantification. Overall quality evaluation showed that FY3 ionosphere-corrected bending angles were consistent with MetOp below 40 km. Above 40 km, FY3 bending angles exhibited larger errors than MetOp. In outlier detection, MetOp had less than 5 % bad profiles, followed by FY3D (<10 %), while FY3E (GPS/BDS) had about 20 % bad profiles. FY3E-GPS bending angles are prone to have large outliers in the height range of 35–50 km. For bias and noise quantification, the daily mean biases and noise levels of FY3 satellites were higher than those of MetOp. Specifically, FY3E-GPS showed notable large daily mean biases of about −0.4 µrad and most of these biases are in setting RO events. FY3D and FY3E-BDS ranked second, with biases of approximately −0.1 µrad. MetOp had the smallest biases, at around −0.05 µrad.  Regarding noises, FY3D, FY3E-GPS exhibited comparable noise levels, at roughly 2.5 µrad; FY3E-BDS had lower noises of 1.5 µrad. MetOp noises are smallest at about 1.0 µrad. Due to the larger biases and noises at high altitudes, FY3's optimized bending angles were strongly corrected by background bending angles. Refractivity and temperature were also influenced by the strong correction of optimized bending angle. In summary, FY3 ionosphere-bending angles show high quality below 40 km.  However, at high altitudes, further efforts are required for improving FY3 data's utility in numerical weather prediction and climate studies, especially for stratospheric applications."

Unbiased estimates of both realised warming and anthropogenic warming are possible that approximate a 20-year retrospective mean. Our resulting estimates of 1.40 [1.23–1.58] °C (realised) and 1.34 [1.18–1.50] °C (anthropogenic) as at end of 2024 highlight the urgency of immediate, far-reaching and sustained climate mitigation actions if we are to meet the long term temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. 
 Parties to the 2015 Paris Agreement agreed to limit the long-term increase in global average temperature to well below 2 °C and pursue efforts to keep temperatures below 1.5 °C relative to pre-industrial levels. As the world is fast approaching the 1.5 °C warming level on a sustained basis, and with 2024 likely the first year that was over 1.5 °C warmer than 1850-1900, there is ever increasing interest in how we will know whether and when 1.5 °C warming since pre-industrial has been reached or exceeded with respect to a long-term average. This paper represents a comprehensive community methodological overview, building on the IPCC 6th assessment. It explains why there is no straightforward answer and proposes clear and reasoned ways forward. Existing challenges are as follows. Firstly, the Paris Agreement text contains definitional ambiguities around 'pre-industrial', 'global average temperature', whether the assessment should be on realised or long-term human-induced warming, and over what time frame the long-term temperature goal applies. Then, there are intrinsic limitations of observational records which get more uncertain further back in time due to data sparsity and measurement heterogeneity. Finally, in a non-stationary climate, multidecadal mean indicators of global temperature change will either lag behind the change or must rely on expected future temperature changes (based on extrapolation, initialized predictions, or scenario-based and constrained projections). Our analysis shows that knowing 'whether we are there yet' is a multifaceted and inherently probabilistic problem that includes information on the definition of a specific level of global warming, temperature changes over multiple timescales, and also potentially includes unpacking the attribution of human-caused changes from observed variations. Given the policy relevance of understanding where the world stands relative to 1.5 °C, or any other level of global warming since pre-industrial, there are a number of practical steps which could be taken to increase specificity in answering this critical question in a timely manner, and inform future monitoring and assessment activities. This paper reviews a broad range of approaches, identifies the most pragmatic, robust and transparent, and clarifies requirements for use in real time including how to handle and represent remaining uncertainties. We show that it is possible by combining lines of evidence and several methodologies to estimate the present long-term warming level without delay in a manner that is robust both in retrospective validation of crossing past warming levels and, critically, to divergent warming futures including potential wildcard impacts of large volcanoes which can mask underlying warming for several years. Results are benchmarked against historical exceedances of 0.5 °C and 1 °C warming. Long-term warming as assessed using the approaches developed herein and data up to and including 2024 stands at 1.40 [1.23–1.58] °C, and underlying human-caused warming stands at 1.34 [1.18–1.50] °C. In IPCC quantified likelihood language this means that it was unlikely that long-term realised warming had exceeded 1.5 °C by the end of 2024 and very unlikely that human-induced warming had exceeded 1.5 °C."

Flushing (ca. 16 L/min for 5 min) and showering (ca. 7 L/min for 8 min) both temporarily reduced bacterial concentrations by removing accumulated planktonic biomass. However, total bacteria rebounded within 1–4 days after a flush or shower, regardless of the presence of chloramines (1 mg/L Cl2). In the absence of chloramines, Legionella spp. ssrA gene concentrations increased over 3–10 days following flushing or showering, whereas chloramines suppressed Legionella spp. for >10 days despite completely decaying within hours of water use. Without chloramines, hot-water flushing at 49 or 60 °C provided little additional control of Legionella spp. as compared to cold-water flushing. V. vermiformis concentrations decreased temporarily following water use, independent of disinfectant or temperature. Flushing was more effective than showering at removing Legionella spp. from biofilms, while pipe material had limited influence in this pilot-scale system. Overall, the results demonstrate organism-specific recovery dynamics and highlight the role of chloramines in prolonging the suppression of Legionella in premise plumbing."

In this study, paired samples of indoor dust, bulk air, hand wipes, silicone wristbands, and urine were collected from 109 adults residing in urban homes from South China in 2023. First, seven urinary biomarkers, including hydroxylated and carboxylated metabolites of C10–C14  benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (BACs), were identified using a combined in silico and in vitro workflow. Then, 23 QACs, including 6 C8–C18 BACs, 6 dialkyldimethylammonium compounds (C8–C18 DADMACs), 6 alkyltrimethylammonium compounds (C8–C18 ATMACs), and 5 emerging QACs, were ubiquitously detected in various environmental matrices, including dust (median ∑QAC concentrations of 39.6 μg/g), bulk air (130 pg/m3), hand wipes (1420 ng for two hands), and silicone wristbands (225 ng/g), respectively. A significantly positive correlation was observed between the logarithmically transformed masses of QACs detected in silicone wristbands and those from dust, bulk air, and hand wipes (r: 0.564, p < 0.01). Moreover, urinary hydroxylated and carboxylated C10- and C12-BACs were significantly correlated with corresponding parent compounds in wristbands (r: 0.481–0.607, p < 0.01). Finally, back calculation from urinary exposure biomarkers revealed that ingestion of surface residues was the dominant exposure route for C10-, C12-, and C14-BACs, accounting for 3.7%, 49.6%, and 18% of total exposure, respectively. The findings from this study propose suitable urinary exposure biomarkers and silicone wristbands as useful indicators for accurate internal and external exposure assessment, respectively, and highlight the importance of ingestion of surface residues as a major exposure route."

Waste management represents the weakest link in the PFAS life cycle, as landfilling sustains long-term secondary releases, suboptimal thermal treatments can re-emit or transform PFAS, and open burning generates additional emissions, with these pressures amplified in low- and middle-income countries. Against this backdrop, this Feature examines how structural weaknesses in waste management perpetuate planetary-boundary transgression and outlines governance and policy solutions to realign PFAS control with a safe operating space. Drawing on lessons from the Basel and Stockholm Conventions, we outline a governance approach centered on class-based regulation, application of the essential-use concept with time-bounded derogations, and strict enforcement of BAT/BEP for remaining uses.

Here, we reveal that ·OH is a pivotal biogeochemical agent whose function is governed by a “dual-coupling oxidative model”. External coupling is demonstrated by salinity acting as a master variable, driving a significant increase in ·OH production potential. This salinity-driven gradient of oxidative pressure then interacts with the internal coupling─the functional duality of ·OH─to produce divergent GHG dynamics. For CO2, net promotion (contributing an average of 9.38 ± 3.92%) resulted from a trade-off where direct abiotic mineralization overcame the suppression of C-degradation enzymes. In contrast, ·OH acted as a net suppressant of CH4 emission, an effect predominantly driven by biotic responses. For N2O, an apparent promotion (contributing 4.36 ± 4.39%) resulted from a powerful indirect effect via suppression of its sink enzyme, which overwhelmed a direct chemical inhibitory path. Ultimately, the magnitude of the ·OH effect on GHG fluxes was codetermined by initial abiotic (23–41%) and biotic (14–29%) conditions. Our model provides a new framework for understanding abiotic–biotic interactions and predicting blue carbon ecosystem responses to global change like seawater intrusion."

Tobias;Michael von Domaros,Modeling Diffusion and Permeation Across the Stratum Corneum Lipid Barrier,"Human skin oils are a major sink for ozone in densely occupied indoor environments. Understanding how the resulting volatile and semivolatile organic oxidation products influence indoor air chemistry requires accurate representations not only of their emission into indoor air but also of their transport across the outermost skin barrier, the stratum corneum. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the passive permeation of acetone, 6-methyl-5-hepten-2-one, and water, two representative products of skin-oil oxidation and a reference compound, through a model stratum corneum lipid membrane. We determine position-dependent diffusivities using two complementary analyses based on the same set of simulations and evaluate their accuracy through  propagator analysis. The two approaches provide upper and lower bounds for the true diffusivity, which, when combined with previously reported free-energy profiles, yield permeabilities relevant for modeling macroscopic skin transport. Our results show that permeation is governed primarily by energetic barriers rather than by molecular mobility and that the predicted transport coefficients vary by about 1 order of magnitude depending on the chosen diffusivity estimator. These findings provide molecular-level constraints for parameters used in indoor air chemistry models and establish a transferable framework for linking atomistic transport mechanisms to large-scale simulations of human exposure to indoor air quality."

In our study, emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and ultrafine particles (UFPs) were measured during the air frying of 12 different dishes within a ca. 0.15 m3 Perspex chamber. Pollutant emissions varied significantly depending on the food type, with rates in the ranges of 17.8–184.0 μg min–1 for total cooking VOCs, 24.6–37.9 μg min–1 for NOx, and 0.1–17.4 × 1012 # min–1 for UFPs, primarily due to Maillard reactions and lipid thermal decomposition. While pollutant concentrations and ozone formation potentials were elevated within the chamber, scaling to the volume of a small kitchen indicated substantially lower levels compared to conventional frying methods. Notably, only high-fat foods produced UFP concentrations comparable to those of deep frying. No NOx emissions were found during blank (empty appliance) runs, and NOx was only detectable while cooking certain types of foods. However, residues accumulating within inaccessible areas of the air fryer following over 70 uses led to increases of 23% in VOC and 236% in UFP concentrations while not cooking food."

However, its effectiveness may be compromised by the ubiquitous presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB) in these media. Here, we combined metagenomic sequencing, quantitative PCR analysis, plate culture, and Sanger sequencing to examine the effects of steam cooking on the profiles of antibiotic resistance in cooked fish, tap water, and indoor air in real cooking environments (i.e., a canteen and a home kitchen) and a laboratory chamber. We found that while steam cooking eliminated over 92.0% of bacteria and ARGs in both tap water and fish, it significantly increased the absolute abundance of bacteria and ARGs in indoor fine particulate matter (PM2.5) across all settings. Tap water was identified as the primary contributor to the increase, transferring 14.6% of bacteria and 33.2% of ARGs into indoor PM2.5 during steam cooking. This process also elevated the relative abundance of certain putative human pathogens in indoor PM2.5, containing ARGs and heat shock proteins and mainly originating from tap water. To test if these transferred ARGs hosts were viable, we conducted  plate culture experiments and identified a viable heat-resistant ARB, Bacillus cereus, transferred from water to indoor PM2.5 via water vapor. Our results highlight the cross-medium transport of ARB and ARGs via steam cooking and underscore the potential microbial safety issues to cooking personnel through inhalational exposure."

No research has reported their exposure burden in pregnant women, nor is there epidemiological evidence of associations with newborn size. In this study, we recruited 947 mother-infant pairs from China. A morning spot urine sample was collected to measure the concentration of five nitro-PAHs exposure biomarkers using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. Three of five measured amino-PAHs were detected in over 50% of the population, and the concentration was 0.044, 0.268, and 0.103 ng/mg creatinine for 1-AP, 2-AF, and 9-APhe, respectively. Using generalized linear regression, we found per ln unit increase in the concentration of 1-AP which was significantly associated with reduced newborn weight Z-Score (−0.12 [−0.20, −0.03]), length Z-Score (−0.11 [−0.17, −0.05]), and weight-for-length Z-Score (−0.09 [−0.16, −0.01]), respectively. The mixture effect model showed a negative association between mixed nitro-PAHs exposure and length Z-Score and weight Z-Score, with 1-AP being the dominant contributor to the effect. To explore how maternal nitro-PAHs exert impact on the developing fetus, the potential mediating role of placental 8-hydroxy-2′-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG), a classical biomarker of DNA oxidative damage, was measured in a subset of samples (n = 201). We revealed that urinary 1-AP and 2-AF were positively correlated with placental 8-OHdG content. Mediation analysis showed that placental 8-OHdG mediated the associations of gestational 1-AP and 2-AF exposure with neonatal weight Z-Score, with a proportion of mediation of 31.38 and 18.77%, respectively. These results provide preliminary evidence that gestational nitro-PAHs exposure may be a risk factor for reduced newborn size, and placental DNA oxidative damage potentially mediates the effect."

This study assessed firefighter’s ambient (nondietary) exposure to PFASs using silicone wristbands. Twenty-three firefighters from North Carolina wore a new wristband during each 9-day work period for approximately 4 months. While wearing the wristbands, each firefighter reported on fire calls using an App installed on their phones. Wristbands, and blood plasma samples collected at study completion, were analyzed for PFASs. PFASs were detected in all blood samples and were dominated by TFA, PFOA, PFOS, PFPrA and PFHxS. Several PFASs levels were positively associated with age and years as a firefighter. Analytes commonly detected in wristbands were MeFBSE, MeFOSE, PFHxA, PFUnA, 6:2 diPAP, 8:2 diPAP, and 6:2/8:2 diPAP. Wristband MeFBSE levels were associated with the number of fires and duration of time spent at a fire. MeFOSE levels on wristbands were also significantly and positively correlated with plasma N-MeFOSAA, similar to a previous study in a nonfirefighter cohort. Overall, these findings suggest that silicone wristbands can detect some occupational PFASs exposures among firefighters and highlights the potential for specific PFASs compounds to be associated with firefighting activities."

We conducted a nationwide cohort study of 6.1 million singleton births, based on the National Free Prepregnancy Checkups Project across 29 provinces in China, 2014–2020. We observed that interquartile range increases in particulate matter with diameters ≤2.5 and ≤10 μm, nitrogen dioxide, and sulfur dioxide during 12 weeks before conception through pregnancy were associated with increased risks of PTB, with the hazard ratios of 1.25 (95% confidence intervals [CI]: 1.24, 1.25), 1.13 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.14), 1.10 (95% CI: 1.09, 1.10), and 1.24 (95% CI: 1.24, 1.25), respectively.

However, the mechanistic basis for this pathogen’s resistance evolution remains elusive. Our study demonstrates that a minimally dormant or the early stages of viable but non-culturable (VBNC) state of bacteria is critical to chlorine tolerance development, representing an initial stage of resistance acquisition. Prolonged low-dose chlorination (12 h exposure to 2 mg/L chloramine-T) induced VBNC transformation in L. pneumophila, with a resuscitation lag time ∼10-fold longer than that of parallel nonchlorinated but starved bacteria. Upon resuscitation, secondary chlorination (3 or 12 h) of stationary-phase cells maintained growth rates similar to those of untreated cells, but with significantly shortened lag times (to ∼26 and ∼41 h, vs ∼40 and ∼47 h for single-chlorinated groups, with p < 0.01 for the 3 h treatment). Flow cytometry showed that rechlorinated groups had a higher proportion of active cells and a lower proportion of death-analogous cells than single-chlorinated counterparts, indicating the emergence of a chlorine-tolerant subpopulation. These findings directly link the VBNC state to bacterial resistance evolution, underscoring the urgent need to investigate dormant bacteria to control antimicrobial resistance spread in water systems."

Previous studies have suggested that evolving tremor properties may relate to changes in the stress conditions of the plumbing system. However, a strong causative link has remained elusive. At Etna volcano, we observe subtle changes in the frequency of stable spectral lines recorded during broadband tremor over 8 months in 2020. Comparison with seismic velocity changes computed using passive seismic interferometry reveals a remarkable correlation between relative frequency (df/f) $(df/f)$ and seismic velocity (dv/v) $(dv/v)$ changes. The most significant of these changes are interpreted to result from a shear‐wave velocity decrease in response to local seismicity. We argue that these observations are best explained by resonance within near‐surface structures. These findings demonstrate that monitoring frequency shifts of stable spectral lines produced during tremor can provide meaningful insights into subsurface properties."

The 100 years of simulations show a robust modulation of tropical cyclogenesis by KWs in all basins. Tropical cyclogenesis preferentially occurs after the peak KW precipitation by 1 day in the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific, mainly due to the enhanced column relative humidity and horizontal vorticity by the KWs. This study demonstrates that large‐ensemble data generated from deep‐learning climate emulators can help strengthen relationships difficult to detect in observations alone. While we focus on tropical cyclogenesis, this approach may also benefit other types of weather or climate variability."

Sugarcane is burned in Florida to facilitate the harvesting process, with the majority of these fires occurring in the Everglades Agricultural Area (EAA), where there is only one regulatory air quality monitor. During the 2022–2023 sugarcane burning season (October–May), we used public low‐cost PurpleAir sensors, regulatory monitors, and 29 PurpleAir sensors deployed for this study to quantify PM2.5 from agricultural fires. We found satellite imagery is of limited use for detecting smoke from agricultural fires in Florida due to the cloud cover, overnight smoke, and the fires being small and short‐lived. For these reasons, surface measurements are critical for capturing increases in PM2.5 from smoke, and we used multiple smoke‐identification criteria. During the study period, median 24‐hour PM2.5 concentrations increased by 2.3–6.9 μg m−3 on smoke‐impacted days compared to unimpacted days, with smoke observed on 4%–28% of the campaign days (ranges from the different smoke‐identification criteria). Further, short‐term PM2.5 increases were observed over 40 μg m−3 during smoke events. We contrast the region near the EAA with large populations of low‐income and minoritized groups to the more affluent coastal region. The inland region experienced more smoke‐impacted monitor days than the Florida east coast region, and there was a higher study‐average smoke PM2.5 concentration in the inland area. These findings highlight the need to increase air quality monitoring near the EAA."

 Integrated circuits for communications play an enabling role when it comes to outer-space exploration thanks to their small footprint and low weight1–3. However, owing to the severe irradiation effects of space energetic particles, the implementation of radiation-tolerant electronic circuits remains a challenge4–6. Here we report the observation of the space radiation effect on a satellite-based device and find that atomically thin materials are expected to accumulate minimal radiation-induced damage in principle. Accordingly, on the basis of a 4-inch wafer-scale monolayer 2D MoS2 process, we implement an atomic-layer transistor-based radiation-tolerant radio frequency (RF, 12–18 GHz) system with both transmitters and receivers for spaceborne communication. For on-orbit experiments, the 2D communication system was successfully launched to the approximately 517 km low Earth orbit. Notably, the system maintains a bit error rate (BER) of less than 10−8 in the transmitted data after 9 months of on-orbit operation, indicating substantial radiation tolerance and long stability. The lifespan of the 2D communication system is predicted to be about 271 years even on the geosynchronous orbit with a much harsher radiation environment. This work showcases the unique prospects of 2D electronics for spaceborne applications.

 The invention of the laser transformed optics by providing intense, coherent light in the visible region, but extending this concept to X-rays has been hindered by a lack of suitable gain media and mirrors. Current hard X-ray free-electron laser (XFEL) facilities1–5 overcome this by amplifying shot noise from a high-peak-current electron bunch via self-amplified spontaneous emission6 in a single pass through long undulators, delivering very high brightness but with a noisy, multi-spiked temporal and spectral profile. Cavity-based XFELs (CBXFELs)7–9 were proposed to close this gap by recirculating spectrally filtered X-ray pulses in a Bragg-reflecting cavity synchronized to a high-repetition-rate electron beam. Here we show lasing with multi-pass gain at 6.952 keV in a 132.8-m round-trip diamond-based Bragg cavity10 at the European XFEL, matched to the 2.23-MHz bunch spacing of the superconducting accelerator5. Under stringent length and angular stability requirements, a ring-up in the cavity across successive bunches was observed, producing spectrally pure, microjoule-level pulses. This establishes the feasibility of CBXFELs in an accelerator environment and validates diamond Bragg optics for X-ray resonators. The demonstrated spectral purity opens a path to next-generation X-ray science, which demands highly coherent, stable sources.

Studying their progenitors, protoclusters, sheds light on the earliest stages of cluster formation. However, detecting protoclusters is demanding: their member galaxies are loosely bound and the emerging hot intracluster medium (ICM) may only be in the initial stages of virialization2–4.

The detection of extended, shock-heated gas indicates that substantial ICM heating can occur in massive halos as early as z ≈ 5.7. Also, given the limited survey volume, the discovery of such a massive cluster is statistically unlikely10, implying that the formation of the large-scale structure must have occurred more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than standard cosmological models predict. Discovery of a protocluster at z = 5.68, merely one billion years after the Big Bang, suggests that large-scale structure must have formed more rapidly in some regions of the early universe than previously thought."

 Vacuum ultraviolet (VUV, 100–200 nm) light sources are crucial for advanced spectroscopy, quantum research and semiconductor lithography1–3. Compared with conventional large-scale VUV generation technologies4–7, second-harmonic generation (SHG) through nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals8–10 is the simplest and most efficient method. However, the scarcity of suitable NLO crystals has constrained the production of VUV light through SHG: existing materials fail to meet phase-matching requirements, suffer from low conversion efficiency or have severe growth limitations11–19. In this study, we report the development of the fluorooxoborate crystal NH4B4O6F (abbreviated as ABF) as a promising material for VUV light generation. VUV devices with specific phase-matching angles were constructed, achieving a record 158.9-nm light through phase-matching SHG and a maximum nanosecond pulse energy of 4.8 mJ at 177.3 nm with a conversion efficiency of 5.9%. The enhanced NLO performance is attributed to optimized arrangements of fluorine-based units creating asymmetric sublattices. This work provides further material in the NLO field, with potential for applications in compact, high-power VUV lasers using ABF.

 Three-dimensional atomic structure is routinely determined for periodic crystals. However, extending such analysis to amorphous materials remains a substantial challenge, despite the scientific and technological importance1,2. In this context, a recent report describing the three-dimensional structure determination of an amorphous solid using atomic-resolution electron tomography (AET) is truly remarkable3. If validated, such an analysis would be groundbreaking. Here we address this issue and investigate whether and when AET can identify all or most atoms in an amorphous nanoparticle. By simulating AET, we reveal limitations on the structural and chemical information AET can determine from noisy electron images. For monoatomic nanoparticles, the structure can be determined with an atomic-position accuracy of tens of picometres under stringent fluence, sampling and projection requirements. For multi-element amorphous nanoparticles, chemical identification resolution is determined by noise and experimental sampling. Heavier atoms are more easily resolved than lighter ones, and large chemical analysis uncertainties emerge when atomic peak and background intensities overlap. Using these insights, we delineate nanoparticle size, composition, electron fluence and image sampling requirements for AET. The results serve as a benchmark for future experiment design and demonstrate a viable approach for amorphous structure determination validation using AET. A simulation approach is used to ascertain the limitations on the structural and chemical information that atomic-resolution electron tomography can determine from noisy electron images."

 Galaxy clusters, the Universe’s largest halo structures, are filled with an X-ray-emitting gas with a temperature between 10 million and 100 million degrees. Their evolution is shaped by energetic processes such as feedback from supermassive black holes (SMBHs) and mergers with other cosmic structures1–3. The imprints of these processes on gas kinematics remain largely unknown, restricting our understanding of energy conversion within clusters4. High-resolution spectral mapping with the X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM) observatory5 offers a way forward6,7. Here we present XRISM kinematic measurements of the Perseus cluster, radially covering the extent of its cool core. We find direct evidence for at least two dominant drivers of gas motions operating on distinct physical scales: a small-scale driver in the inner approximately 60 kpc, probably associated with the SMBH feedback; and a large-scale driver in the outer core, powered by mergers. This finding suggests that, during the active phase, SMBH feedback drives gas motions, which, if fully dissipated into heat, could have a substantial role in offsetting radiative cooling losses in the Perseus core. Our study underscores the necessity of kinematic mapping observations of extended sources to robustly characterize the velocity fields and their role in the evolution of massive halos. It further offers a kinematic diagnostic for SMBH feedback models. Kinematic measurements of the Perseus galaxy cluster reveal two drivers of gas motions: a small-scale driver in the inner core associated with black-hole feedback and a large-scale driver in the outer core powered by mergers."

 Hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs) with high global warming potential are regulated under the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. While China began freezing production and consumption of HFCs in 2024, there are discrepancies among previous activity-based bottom-up emissions estimates and lack of observation-based inverse modelling emissions estimates of China’s HFC emissions since 2017. Here we use atmospheric observations across China and inverse modelling to reveal distinct emissions trends of nine HFCs from 2011 to 2021 in China. Our top-down emissions estimates reveal an overestimation of HFC emissions post-2017 by an average of 117.2 Tg CO2-equivalent per year, by China’s national official bottom-up emissions inventories. Also, we find that while eastern China is the largest emitter of HFCs in China (37.4% CO2-equivalent), non-eastern China contributed to national emissions (62.6%). Lastly, we show that non-Annex I countries (mostly developing countries under the UN climate framework) excluding China accounted for 61.3% of the global HFC emissions growth during 2011–2020, far surpassing contributions from Annex I countries (23.9%) and China (14.8%).

 Navigational contrail avoidance presents an opportunity for rapid reduction in aviation-attributable warming. Here, we use the Aviation Climate and Air Quality Impacts model to evaluate the global temperature changes associated with contrail avoidance towards 2050. If no avoidance is adopted, aviation is projected to contribute 0.040 K of CO2 warming and 0.054 K of contrail warming by 2050. The combined warming from aviation CO2 and contrails is 19% of the difference between current temperatures and the +2 °C limit above pre-Industrial levels, i.e. 19% of our remaining temperature budget. An avoidance strategy phased in over 2035-2045 may recover 9% of this budget, but a 10-year delay may reduce this to 2%. The warming due to additional CO2 emitted during avoidance is two orders of magnitude lower than the expected contrail warming reduction. For every year of delay, the world will be on average 0.003 K hotter in 2050. The most significant climate risk associated with contrail avoidance is therefore inaction. This study shows that contrail avoidance can recover 9% of the global temperature budget by 2050. For every year of delay, the recoverable warming will diminish by 0.6%.

Optimizing technology mixes is now shown to limit the supply-constrained energy transition metals to only copper, lithium, and vanadium, though economy-wide resource sobriety remains urgent. 
 A successful energy transition is crucial for mitigating climate change but may be hindered by bottlenecks in the availability of critical metals. The energy transition scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change overlook such risks, proposing energy and transport pathways deemed unrealistic by past studies. Yet by relying on fixed market shares, those studies ignore the market’s ability to shift towards a (sub)technological mix requiring fewer supply-constrained metals. Here, for the most stringent decarbonization scenarios, we show that an optimized technology mix trims the list of metals constrained by mining capacities from 13 to copper, lithium and vanadium only. Key levers include substituting silver and gallium in solar technologies, prioritizing gearbox wind turbines and induction-motor electric vehicles without permanent magnets, and replacing part of the grid’s copper with aluminium. Sixteen other metals remain under pressure, but because over 90% of their demand stems from sectors outside the energy transition, our results underscore the need for economy-wide metallic sobriety. Metals shortage threatens climate goals by affecting adoption of key technologies for the energy transition. Optimizing technology mixes is now shown to limit the supply-constrained energy transition metals to only copper, lithium, and vanadium, though economy-wide resource sobriety remains urgent."

 In contrast to global warming trends, much of Eurasia experienced a winter cooling trend over 1990–2014. Some studies have proposed a causal link between this regional cooling, particularly strong over Siberia, to coincident reductions in Arctic sea-ice extent. However, free-running historical climate models overwhelmingly simulate a forced Eurasian warming signal, leading other studies to suggest that internal variability explains the observed cooling. Here, we use retrospective seasonal climate predictions to highlight a robust dynamical link between Siberian cooling and upstream north-east Atlantic atmospheric circulation changes. Examining the interannual predictability of these circulation patterns, we find spuriously weak but skilful model signals. When these weak dynamical signals are corrected, stronger low-frequency variability in downstream Siberian temperature also emerges, with half of the observed 1990–2014 cooling simulated. Our results suggest that Eurasian decadal climate variability is at least partly driven by a predictable atmospheric circulation response to slowly evolving boundary conditions."

 Global climate models project that the South Pacific will be a hotspot for some of the largest atmospheric river (AR) changes. Thus, there is an urgent need to review both historical trends and updated high-resolution climate projections tailored to this region. Here we show that significant trends in AR frequency from reanalysis are mostly still constrained to the ocean (~45–60°S). For landfalling ARs, trends in synoptic-scale features are not yet considered robust, whereas percentile-based moisture transports show stronger increases over parts of southern New Zealand and Tasmania. Furthermore, high-resolution downscaled climate projections indicate that landfalling AR trends should become much more widespread and robustly detectable (5 of 6 models) in the next 10–20 years, first appearing across regions of southern New Zealand during spring and winter. Even under a moderate emissions scenario, projections indicate that the frequency of extreme landfalling ARs could double before mid-century, carrying significant societal impacts."

 It remains uncertain whether precipitation oxygen isotopes (δ18O) reliably capture East Asian Meiyu monsoon variability. Analyzing daily δ18O across the Yangtze-Huai River Basin from 28-34°N, we reveal a distinct spatial dichotomy. In the middle and northern Meiyu regions, δ18O robustly tracks Meiyu precipitation. Conversely, the southern Meiyu margin is decoupled from Meiyu variability, primarily reflecting upstream convection processes further south. We identify the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) as the central driver, creating a dynamic dipole: its northwestward extension enhances moisture transport and deep convection along its northwestern flank (driving isotopic depletion in the northern Meiyu region), while imposing subsidence and convective inhibition under its body (suppressing isotopic depletion in the southern Meiyu region). Importantly, these mechanisms persist on interannual timescales. Consequently, while northern δ18O records effectively capture Meiyu variability, southern records reflect distinct vertical constraints, necessitating spatially differentiated paleoclimate interpretations."

 The bioavailability of iron from different sources to phytoplankton, driving substantial carbon dioxide uptake of the large blooms downstream of South Georgia Island, remains unknown. Although geochemical characterization suggests that iron from glacial meltwater and groundwater is bioavailable, phytoplankton iron uptake measurements are lacking. In this study, additional to assessing iron chemical speciation and weathering processes, iron-55 uptake by a natural phytoplankton community was quantified in seawater sampled from low and high chlorophyll waters around South Georgia, to which iron from nearshore sources (glacial meltwater and groundwater) was added. Iron bioavailability depended on the chemistry of the fertilized seawater and the chemical composition of the source itself. Aggregation of dissolved organic matter in high chlorophyll water scavenged dissolved iron, making it unavailable to phytoplankton. In low chlorophyll water, as opposed to iron from groundwater, iron from glacial meltwater was bioavailable to phytoplankton and would increase carbon dioxide fixation by 80-100%.

 Climate models are increasingly used to inform water availability projections at regional scales. However, the models’ own runoff sensitivities—the change in runoff per unit change of precipitation or temperature—are often biased, which can degrade their projections of runoff change. Specifically, models tend to underestimate the runoff decline in response to a temperature increase. Here, we conduct a comprehensive analysis with multiple observational datasets, two climate model generations, and large ensemble sampling of internal climate variability to assess these biases and to constrain future runoff projections across major river basins globally. For basins that can be robustly constrained by available observations, the constraint indicates stronger runoff declines than raw model projections. The constrained projections thus indicate more severe impacts of climate change on water resources than indicated by direct climate model output.

 Accurate quantification of carbon dioxide emissions is crucial for addressing climate change. However, traditional top-down CO2 estimates are limited by sparse satellite observations and coarse temporal resolution. Although NO2 data from polar-orbiting satellites can help constrain CO2 emissions, temporal mismatch with OCO-3 measurements introduce additional uncertainty. To address this, we estimate hourly CO2 emissions by combining OCO-3 XCO2 observations with high temporal resolution NO2 data from the GEMS instrument onboard the GEO-KOMPSAT-2B satellite. We developed an algorithm based on a Gaussian plume model and wind rotation techniques to estimate CO2 emissions and NOx/CO2 emission ratios from near-synchronous NO2/CO2 observations. Hourly CO2 emissions were further derived using GEMS-based NOx emissions estimated via the flux divergence method. A total of 59 power plant cases across six Asian countries were identified. For these cases, the estimated CO2 emissions exhibit distinct diurnal, seasonal, and interannual emission variability, primarily driven by heating demand, decarbonization measures, and pandemic-related industrial slowdowns. These top-down estimates, constrained by GEMS NO2 data, show strong consistency with bottom-up inventories (R = 0.89), supporting the validity of our optimization approach. Furthermore, comparisons with daytime mean estimates suggest that CO2 emission estimates constrained by polar-orbiting satellite observations can exhibit biases of approximately 60% relative to GEO-based approaches, underscoring the importance for high-temporal-resolution measurements. This study highlights the value of integrating geostationary NO2 and CO2 observations to capture the diurnal dynamics of power plant emissions and improve the accuracy of top-down CO2 emission monitoring."

 Timely crop mapping is crucial for field management, policy formulation, phenological monitoring, and yield forecasting. However, acquiring sufficient labeled samples in the current year presents a formidable challenge for in-season mapping. Previously proposed solutions mainly include classifier transfer and sample transfer strategies. The classifier transfer strategy trains classifiers with historical samples associated with historical-year features and then transfers the trained historical sample classifiers (HSC) to classify remote sensing data in the current year; the sample transfer strategy generates trusted samples associated with current-year remote sensing features by predicting labels of the current-year sample based on some prior knowledge (e.g., crop rotation pattern) and then trains trusted sample classifiers (TSC) for current-year classification. However, the performance of the classifier-transfer strategy may degrade when there is large interannual feature variation, while the performance of the sample-transfer strategy depends on the reliability of the generated trusted samples. This study proposes a novel approach that integrates the above two strategies for in-season mapping through a sample weighting technique. Firstly, two sample sets, trusted samples and classified samples associated with current-year features, are generated by crop rotation prediction and HSC, respectively. Subsequently, based on an independent assumption between the rotational prediction errors and the current-year remote sensing features, the optimal weights of these two sample sets are derived based on the Bayesian principle. Finally, an optimal weighted sample classifier (OWSC) is trained using the weighted samples for in-season classification. To illustrate the robustness of the proposed OWSC, we compared it with different methods combined with various classification models across four regions with different interannual feature variation and crop rotation stability. Results demonstrated that OWSC maintained its advantages across various regions and different available lengths of historical crop-type sequences. Owing to its independence from specific classifiers, the proposed sample weighting method can be seamlessly applied to any classification model and thus continues to benefit from advances in classification algorithms. Additionally, sensitivity experiments regarding the uncertainty in trusted samples and historical crop-type sequences showed that OWSC performed stably across different scenarios. Therefore, OWSC provides a promising solution for in-season crop mapping without current-year samples."

 Eucalyptus plantations, characterized by uniform stand structure and relatively sparse foliage, are highly susceptible to typhoon damage, which poses substantial economic risks to forestry operations and undermines regional ecosystem stability in southern China. This study focuses on windthrown eucalyptus forests in Shangsi and Bobai Counties, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, following Typhoons Ma-on and TALIM . We developed a specialized UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) based deep learning dataset and proposed a novel segmentation model, GIBN-Net, which incorporates an asymmetric global attention module to enhance feature extraction. Evaluation results, including ablation and comparative experiments, show that GIBN-Net outperforms mainstream models, achieving optimal accuracy (OA: 0.9405, Precision: 0.8879, Recall: 0.9105, IoU: 0.8248, F1-Score: 0.8722). The study also revealed that tailored preprocessing strategies significantly improved boundary detection, while simple stacking of the UAV-derived DSM with RGB imagery led to a decrease in model accuracy. This research is the first to develop a dedicated dataset and an optimized deep learning model for typhoon-damaged eucalyptus detection in southern China. The GIBN-Net model is capable of detecting wind damage in eucalyptus forests more accurately and efficiently in complex forest environments. The dedicated dataset, combined with spatial context information, improves boundary accuracy and facilitates faster damage mapping. This study enables rapid, large-scale, and automated assessment of typhoon-induced damage in eucalyptus plantations, thereby providing actionable insights for insurance claim verification, post-disaster resource allocation, and ecological restoration planning. Therefore, it can serve as a timely and effective decision-support tool for forestry management and disaster response."

 Nocturnal atmospheric oxidizing capacity plays a pivotal role in nitrogen oxide (NOx) transformation, ozone (O3) lifetime regulation, and particulate matter pollution control, with the nitrate radical (NO3) serving as the central species in nighttime oxidation processes. The spatiotemporal characteristics of nocturnal NO3 production rate (PNO3) and its influencing factors are investigated in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD) region based on ground-level observations and meteorological data from 2017 to 2024. The results demonstrated that the YRD region exhibited an overall declining trend in concentrations of NO2, O3, Ox and PNO3 under policy-driven emission reductions. However, NO2 and PNO3 concentrations experienced a temporary rebound during the 2020 pandemic period, while O3 levels showed a significant increase in 2022, revealing the nonlinear response of nocturnal oxidizing capacity to both policy interventions and pandemic restrictions.

 Droplet evaporation is a fundamental process with broad implications for cloud microphysics and atmospheric chemistry. Solutes introduce non-ideal behaviour that alters the droplet's microphysical properties and reconfigures its evaporation dynamics, yet their influence remains insufficiently quantified. Using an optical tweezers system, we investigated the evaporation of droplets containing non-volatile solutes. The results reveal distinct stagewise variation in evaporation rate, driven by a gradual transition in the dominant microphysical mechanism from vapour diffusion across the gas–liquid interface to bulk-phase diffusion within the droplet. Once bulk-phase diffusion becomes dominant, the evaporation rate decreases significantly and the overall evaporation time increases, indicating that classical evaporation theory underestimates droplet lifetime by neglecting internal mass transport. A new radius–time relationship that better aligns with experimental observations is proposed and highlights the decisive role of solutes in both the initial conditions and the dynamic evolution of droplet evaporation. These findings advance our understanding of the microphysical evolution of droplet evaporation, providing a physical basis for improving the parameterisation of aerosol–cloud interactions and droplet lifetime in atmospheric models."

It also leverages additional aerosol composition data to identify and attribute P levels to natural and anthropogenic sources through receptor modeling. Total sugars concentrations had a median of 205 ng m−3 and varied from 12.6 to 3391 ng m−3, with primary sugars, sugar alcohols and anhydro saccharides contributing 22 %, 19 % and 59 %, respectively. The median total P (TP) concentration was 21.0 ng m−3 (2.64–179 ng m−3) during the study period. On average, sugars contributed 2.6 % to organic carbon and 4.9 % to water soluble organic carbon.

 Understanding the past climate variability of Greenland is vital for contextualizing its current and future changes, a purpose for which centennial-scale reanalyses provide critical support. However, the performance of centennial-scale reanalyses over Greenland remains an open question, as previous assessments have primarily focused on the post-1979 period. Therefore, we evaluated the performance on different climate variables of the Twentieth Century Reanalysis version 3 (20CR v3; 1806–2015) and the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts fifth generation reanalysis (ERA5; 1940–2015) over Greenland, based on in-situ observations and ice core records. For 2-m temperature (T2m), both reanalyses exhibited small cold biases in summer, though with a failure to capture variation patterns during this season. 20CR v3 showed dry biases in summer and wet biases in winter, while ERA5 consistently overestimated precipitation among all the seasons. Significant dry bias (<−2.5 mm) of 20CR v3 was found at southeastern coastal sites. We concluded that the elevation bias induced by the coarse resolution of 20CR v3 was one of the primary reasons for its cold and dry biases along the margin of the ice sheet. Notably, unlike ERA5, 20CR v3 failed to reproduce the observed increasing precipitation trend from 1940 to 2015 (−1.9 mm/dec vs 4.9 mm/dec, p > 0.05). Although 20CR v3 performed slightly inferior than ERA5, their consistent patterns, coupled with 20CR v3's robust performance, support the reliability of 20CR v3 for centennial-scale climate studies in Greenland."

 Atmospheric river (AR) landfalls profoundly impact Antarctic snowfall accumulation, surface melting and ice shelf calving/collapse. However, comprehensive case studies are still required to better understand AR changes and their underlying mechanisms. Here, we use ERA5 reanalysis and Community Earth System Model version 2 (CESM2) ensembles to examine the spatial distribution and long-term trends of Antarctic ARs during 1979–2022, and also investigate the mechanisms behind it by distinguishing between dynamic and thermodynamic effects. Reanalysis shows a strong increase in annual AR frequency over Dronning Maud Land (DML) in Antarctica during 1979–2022, predominantly driven by dynamical processes. Sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the South Pacific Convergence Zone (SPCZ) strongly modulate AR intensification over DML by enhancing convection and exciting a Rossby wave train, which deepens the Weddell Sea cyclone anomaly and amplifies downstream high-pressure ridges. Fingerprinting experiments with the 50-member CESM2 ensemble confirm the pivotal role of internal Pacific variability in reproducing observed AR trends. These results highlight the importance of accurately representing SPCZ SST variability for understanding the mechanisms driving Antarctic AR changes."

Here, we introduce a universal statistical framework for targeted mode transport (TMT) that circumvents this limitation and validate it on various platforms including microwave networks, two-dimensional chaotic cavities, and three-dimensional reverberation chambers. TMT quantifies the efficiency of transferring energy between specified input and output channels in multimode wave-chaotic systems. We develop a diagrammatic theory that predicts the eigenvalue distribution of the TMT operator and identifies the macroscopic parameters—coupling strength, absorption, and channel control—that govern performance. The theory provides explicit bounds for optimal TMT wavefronts and captures phenomena like statistical transmission gaps and reflectionless states.

While CDR seems promising, the associated uncertainties are not well known. One unexplored aspect is whether the uncertainties in CDR and transient climate response to cumulative CO2 emissions (TCRE) are coupled to any degree, e.g. some CDR methods could have lower carbon removal potential if TCRE are high. In this paper, we quantify the coupled uncertainties between TCRE and the CDR of ocean alkalinity enhancement (OAE) and reforestation. To do so, we used a perturbed parameter ensemble with the University of Victoria Earth system climate model. These results were fed to train Kernel Flows-based model emulators, which in turn were used, together with observational data, to carry out Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations to characterize Bayesian posterior distributions. It turns out that OAE results in slow but steady CDR, with temperature reduction nearly linearly related to the amount of carbon removed. CDR with OAE is also only weakly dependent on uncertain climate system parameters and TCRE, indicating that OAE is a reliable CDR method with respect to the coupled uncertainties between its removal potential and TCRE. CDR of reforestation slows down after 50 years, and its temperature reduction from biogeochemical effects is offset by the warming biogeophysical effects, as reforesting pastures lowers albedo. Moreover, CDR by reforestation shows a strong dependency on uncertain climate system parameters and negatively correlates with TCRE, implying that it is less reliable as a CDR method. We argue that CDR potential, timescale of CDR, and uncertainty coupling between TCRE and CDR should all be considered when designing robust climate change mitigation portfolios."

Testing showed our approach works well to track how pollution spreads in urban areas. By combining observations with prior knowledge, we improved the accuracy of emission estimates. Applying this method in Paris, we found emissions were 9 % lower than expected and dropped significantly during COVID-19 lockdowns. Our method offers a reliable way to monitor pollution and support environmental policies. 
 We present a comprehensive quantification of daily NOx emissions from Paris using an inverse analysis of tropospheric NO2 columns measured by the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) over a 5-year period (May 2018–August 2023). Our analysis leverages a superposition column model that captures the relationship between the increase in NO2 with distance over an urban source region to underlying NOx emissions, accounting for chemical transformations and wind in the urban boundary layer. To evaluate the robustness of the superposition column model, we tested it against high-resolution (300 m) Large Eddy Simulations (LES) using MicroHH, a computational fluid dynamics model, with atmospheric chemistry, confirming that the model’s simplifying assumptions introduce uncertainties below 10 %. Building on this foundation, we develop a new Bayesian inversion method that incorporates prior knowledge on NOx emissions and lifetimes and accounts for model and prior uncertainties. Compared to a previous look-up table approach, which relied on least-squares minimization without prior constraints, the Bayesian method demonstrated superior performance. In controlled tests, it reproduced known NOx emissions within 5 %. Applying Bayesian inversion to TROPOMI data in Paris, we observed a significant reduction in NOx emissions from 44 mol s−1 in 2018 to 32 mol s−1 in 2023, representing a 27 % decrease. This decline exceeds the 12 % reduction predicted by the TNO-MACC-III bottom-up inventory, indicating limited accuracy of current inventories. Seasonal analysis revealed higher posterior emissions in winter, possibly highlighting the role of residential heating or vehicle cold starts, which may be underrepresented in bottom-up estimates. Our improved Bayesian framework delivers accurate NOx emission estimates that align well with independent data sets. This approach provides a valuable tool for monitoring urban NOx emissions and assessing the efficacy of air quality policies."

 Gravitational separation of gas species in the stratosphere is caused mainly by molecular diffusion and is a powerful tool to diagnose stratospheric transport processes. Previous studies have shown that isotopic and elemental ratios of major atmospheric components decrease with increasing altitude in proportion to the differences of their mass numbers. However, there have been no reports of the vertical changes of Kr, Xe, and Ne in the stratosphere. Here we report the results of the first study of the vertical changes of Kr, Xe, and Ne in the stratosphere based on high-precision analyses. Our goal was to reveal the vertical distributions of noble gases and to clarify the mechanisms governing their separations.  Noble gases were measured for the stratospheric air collected by balloon-borne cryogenic air samplers over Japan. We found that the isotopic and elemental ratios of all noble gases decreased and increased with increasing altitude for heavy and light noble gases, respectively. Vertical distributions normalized for the mass number differences indicated that the larger the mass number, the smaller the separation of both the isotopic and elemental ratios. The implication was that kinetic fractionation occurred in the stratosphere because of the differences of molecular diffusivities. We performed model simulations and were able to reproduce the kinetic fractionations for heavier noble gases. Results of model simulations suggested that the kinetic fractionations of noble gases were usable as a new tool to diagnose stratospheric transport processes. In the modern atmosphere, it is difficult to detect the long-term change of the stratospheric circulation from noble gases, except for Ar/N2 ratio, in the troposphere. However, it was suggested that changes in the stratospheric circulation during glacial and interglacial cycles may have affected the noble gas elemental ratios in ice core samples."

This has implications for the Arctic energy balance, underscoring the importance of further investigating these clouds to understand the trajectory of future Arctic climate. 
 Marine cold air outbreaks (CAOs) frequently occur in the Arctic when cold air moves over the relatively warm ocean, resulting in large turbulent fluxes, instability and cloud formation. Given the high frequency of CAOs during the Arctic winter, the associated clouds have a large impact on the region's radiative balance. Due to Arctic warming, the prevalence of CAOs and their clouds may change, impacting the Arctic radiative balance and potentially amplifying or mitigating local and global warming.To better understand how CAO clouds respond to Arctic warming, this study has developed a phenomenological CAO cloud classification tool that utilizes machine learning methods to identify closed and open cell clouds in CAOs from MODIS satellite imagery. This new approach achieves better performance in identifying CAO clouds compared to the marine cold air outbreak index calculated using MERRA-2 reanalysis, with accuracies of 85.4 % and 78.0 %, respectively. The new approach has revealed frequent CAO cloud formation in regions of high sea surface temperatures, with occurrence maxima along the Norwegian coast and the Northern Atlantic region south of Iceland. Furthermore, the approach reveals trends in CAO cloud cover that suggest a shortening of the CAO season, characterized by an approximate 10 %, increase in cloud coverage during winter and a nearly 20 % decrease during the shoulder months over the past 25 years. These trends suggest a positive radiative feedback during winter in response to climate change, underscoring the importance of further investigating these clouds to understand the trajectory of future Arctic climate."

 Atmospheric ice-nucleating particles (INPs) significantly influence cloud microphysics and aerosol-cloud interactions. Understanding INPs in mountain regions is important for predicting impacts on regional clouds and precipitation. In this study, we conducted comprehensive measurements of immersion-freezing INPs at Mt.

The average number concentration of INPs active at −20 °C was 2 L−1, with distinct seasonal variation characterized by high summer concentrations and low winter concentrations. Aerosol sources were resolved, and INP concentrations were correlated with a coarse dust aerosol type, which dominates PM10 in this region. Calculating IN active surface site densities (ns) further supporting the primary contribution from coarse dust to INPs. Treatment with H2O2 indicated substantial contributions (91 % on average) from organic INPs across all activation temperatures, suggesting that supermicron organic-containing soil dust dominates the INPs in this region. Heat-labile INPs, likely biological in origin, were identified as dominant at >-15 °C through heat treatment of samples and showed significantly lower contributions in winter (∼ 96 % reduction). Parameterizations based on ns for the INPs observed in this mountainous region were developed, which effectively reproduced measured INP concentrations, particularly when accounting for seasonal differences. This study provides the first long-term, comprehensive characterization of INPs for the Upper Colorado River Basin region and offers a parameterization potentially useful for predicting INPs in other remote continental regions."

Despite extensive research on Fe dissolution, the understanding of the mechanism of the Fe acidification process remains highly controversial. Here, we revealed significant differences in Fe acid dissolution between the upper mixing layer and the ground-level of a megacity. The results showed that air masses with elevated n[SO42-] / n[NO3-] ratios (5.4 ± 3.7) yielded more enhanced iron solubility (%FeS, 8.7 ± 2.4 %) in the upper mixing layer after atmospheric aging compared to those (1.6 ± 0.7 and 3.3 ± 0.4 %, respectively) at the ground-level near source regions of acidic gases. Further analysis suggested that Fe dissolution is primarily driven by sulfuric acid in the upper mixing layer different from nitric acid at the ground-level, attributing to the aging processes of acidic species during long-range transport. %FeS also exhibits a clear size dependence: sulfuric-acid dominates in submicron aerosols (Dp < 1 µm), leading to elevated %FeS (3.5 ± 3.9 %), whereas alkaline mineral dust in supermicron particles (Dp > 1 µm) neutralizes nitric acid and suppresses Fe dissolution (1.8 ± 2.2 %). This finding highlighted that sulfuric acid dominates Fe acidification process in the upper layer and submicron particles, but the contribution of nitric acid to Fe dissolution at the ground-level is equally important. Our study provides new data sets for testing atmospheric model's capability to simulate dissolved Fe concentration and deposition and will help to improve the accuracy of Fe solubility predictions."

The algorithms estimate layer identifiers such as (1) aerosol or cloud layers, (2) particle optical properties at 355 nm, (3) particle type identifiers, and (4) planetary boundary layer height. We demonstrated the algorithm performance using the simulated ATLID L1 data and found the algorithm’s capability to provide valuable insights into the global distribution of aerosols and clouds. 
 The Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) is a joint Japanese-European satellite observation mission for understanding the interaction between cloud, aerosol, and radiation processes and improving the accuracy of climate change predictions. The EarthCARE satellite was equipped with four sensors, a 355 nm high-spectral-resolution lidar with depolarization measurement capability (ATLID) as well as a cloud profiling radar, a multi-spectral imager, and a broadband radiometer, to observe the global distribution of clouds, aerosols, and radiation. In this study, we have developed algorithms to produce ATLID Level 2 aerosol products using ATLID Level 1 data. The algorithms estimated the following four products: (1) Layer identifiers such as aerosols, clouds, clear-skies, or surfaces were estimated by the combined use of vertically variable criteria and spatial continuity methods developed for the CALIOP (Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation) analysis. (2) Aerosol optical properties such as extinction coefficient, backscatter coefficient, depolarization ratio, and lidar ratio at 355 nm were optimized to ATLID L1 data by the method of maximum likelihood. (3) Six aerosol types, namely smoke, pollution, marine, pristine, dusty-mixture, and dust were identified based on a two-dimensional diagram of the lidar ratio and depolarization ratio at 355 nm developed by cluster-analysis using the AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) dataset with ground-based lidar data. (4) The planetary boundary layer height was determined using the improved wavelet covariance transform method for the ATLID analysis. The performance of various algorithms was evaluated using pseudo ATLID Level 1 data generated by Joint-Simulator (Joint Simulator for Satellite Sensors), which incorporates aerosol and cloud distributions simulated by numerical models. Results from applying the algorithms to the pseudo ATLID Level 1 data with realistic signal noise added for aerosol or cloud predominant cases revealed: (1) misidentification of aerosol and cloud layers was relatively low, approximately 10 %; (2) the retrieval errors of aerosol optical properties were 0.08×10-7±1.12×10-7m-1sr-1 (2±34 % in relative error) for backscatter coefficient and 0.01±0.07 (4±27 % in relative error) for depolarization ratio; (3) aerosol type classification was generally performed well. These results indicate that the algorithm's capability to provide valuable insights into the global distribution of aerosols and clouds, facilitating assessments of their climate impact through atmospheric radiation processes."

We developed a mid-cost sensor network for Munich, deployed on 17 rooftops. Temperature-stabilized enclosures and automated 2-point calibration ensured reliable performance, assessed by side-by-side comparison with a Picarro reference. In 1.5 years, the network collected 90 million measurements and resolved urban-rural gradients and seasonal diurnal patterns, capturing spatial CO2 variability at city scale. 
 Urban areas are major contributors to anthropogenic CO2 emissions, yet detailed monitoring remains a challenge due to the cost and operational constraints of traditional sensor networks. As a scalable alternative, we established the ACROPOLIS (Autonomous and Calibrated Rooftop Observatory for MetroPOLItan Sensing) network in the Munich metropolitan area, using mid-cost sensors to enable dense, city-scale observation. This work outlines the development of the hardware and software of the system, its performance and the first 1.5 years of operation, during which more than 90 million CO2 measurements were collected in urban, suburban and rural environments.The primary goal was to evaluate whether mid-cost Vaisala GMP343 sensors, when combined with manufacturer internal corrections and environmental stabilization, can reliably measure CO2 concentrations with sufficient accuracy to resolve urban gradients. We implemented a fully automated 2-point calibration procedure using synthetic dry reference gases and conducted a multi-week side-by-side comparison with a high-precision Picarro reference instrument to assess sensor performance.Our results show that, despite inter-sensor variability in temperature sensitivity, the hourly aggregated mean root mean square error (RMSE) of all sensors is 1.16 ppm with a range of 0.57 to 2.58 ppm. For the specific sensor housed in our second-generation enclosure with PID-controlled heating, the performance improved from 0.9 to 0.6 ppm RMSE. Analysis of spatial and temporal patterns reveal distinct seasonal cycles, urban–rural concentration gradients, and nighttime accumulation events, consistent with expected biogenic and anthropogenic activity, and atmospheric transport mechanisms.We conclude that mid-cost urban networks can provide scientifically valuable, spatially highly resolved greenhouse gas observations when supported by appropriate calibration and stabilization techniques. The open-source design and demonstrated performance of the ACROPOLIS network establish a blueprint for future deployments in other cities seeking to advance emissions monitoring and urban climate policy."

The collection provides monthly estimates for major agricultural regions and helps describe how irrigation varies across locations, seasons, and years. It offers a foundation for improving how irrigation is quantified, compared across methods, and integrated into large-scale hydrological and climate studies. 
 Irrigation water use (IWU) is the largest direct human intervention in the terrestrial water cycle, yet it remains poorly characterized at the spatial and temporal scales required for climate research. We present a long-term archive of monthly IWU estimates at 0.25° spatial resolution for four major irrigated regions — the contiguous United States (CONUS), India, the Murray–Darling Basin in Australia, and the Ebro Basin in Spain — spanning up to two decades depending on input data availability. The datasets are derived using three distinct approaches: (i) a Soil Moisture (SM)–based Delta method that infers irrigation from discrepancies between satellite and model SM and evapotranspiration, (ii) an SM–based inversion of the soil water balance constrained by satellite SM, and (iii) a model–observation integration scheme combining a land surface model with satellite-based irrigated-area maps. Across regions, these approaches yield up to six SM-based Delta products, five SM-based Inversion products, and one Model–observation integration product. Validation against available irrigation records shows that several method–input combinations reproduce the order of magnitude of annual state-level irrigation volumes in the CONUS, with typical errors for the best-performing datasets of about 4–5 km3 yr−1 in root mean square deviation and 1–2 km3 yr−1 in bias. In the Murray–Darling and Ebro basins, the products capture the main features of the seasonal irrigation cycle, with variations in spatial patterns, magnitude, and timing across methods. In India, where no observational records are available, the datasets reproduce the expected agricultural seasons while exhibiting a wider inter-method spread. This coordinated dataset collection, produced with multiple Earth Observation-based approaches and harmonized inputs across regions, provides long-term, spatially explicit IWU estimates and a basis for better quantifying and representing irrigation in large-scale hydrological and climate studies.

BuRNN outperforms existing process-based fire models, which improves our capabilities of modelling past and future burned areas. 
 Fires play an important role in the Earth system but remain complex phenomena that are challenging to model numerically. Here, we present the first version of BuRNN, a data-driven model simulating burned area on a global 0.5° × 0.5° grid with a monthly time resolution. We trained Long Short-Term Memory networks to predict satellite-based burned area (GFED5) from a range of climatic, vegetation and socio-economic parameters. We employed a region-based cross-validation strategy to account for the high spatial autocorrelation in our data. BuRNN outperforms the process-based fire models participating in ISIMIP3a on a global scale across a wide range of metrics. Regionally, BuRNN outperforms almost all models across a set of benchmarking metrics in all regions. Through explainable AI we unravel the difference in regional drivers of burned area in our models, showing that the presence/absence of bare ground and C4 grasses along with the fire weather index have the largest effects on our predictions of burned area. Lastly, we used BuRNN to reconstruct global burned area for 1901–2019 and compare the simulations against independent long-term historical fire observation databases in five countries and the EU. Our approach highlights the potential of machine learning to improve burned area simulations and our understanding of past fire behaviour."

We tested each method using case studies and statistics of sea breeze occurrences, finding that a method that identifies atmospheric moisture fronts performs well. Some potential errors are demonstrated due to detection of other frontal systems, but this method could be useful for robustly analyzing sea breezes from models. 
 The sea breeze is a mesoscale atmospheric circulation that has implications for human activity and wind energy availability in coastal areas. Sea breezes have been studied in many regions throughout the world, with analyses usually identifying them at individual coastal sites based on local characteristics. Therefore, there is currently a lack of robust and generalizable identification methods, resulting in difficulties analyzing sea breeze characteristics over large regions. Here, software is developed that applies three, physically-based diagnostics for sea breeze identification to atmospheric model datasets. The diagnostics are tested across the coastline of Australia over a 6-month period. These diagnostics identify sea breezes based on either a front or circulation, with additional filtering applied to each diagnostic to reduce mis-classifications. The diagnostics are tested on four different model datasets, ranging from 2.2 km to around 25 km horizontal grid spacing, to explore the impact of spatial resolution on sea breeze identification methods. Based on a range of individual cases, as well as statistics of sea breeze occurrences, we suggest that a method based on moisture frontogenesis may potentially be suitable for sea breeze identification from model data. However, results for individual sea breeze cases indicate that there are difficulties associated with separating the sea breeze from other coastal fronts and circulations. These results have applications for quantifying the effect of sea breezes on human activities, such as for coastal wind energy and the modulation of the urban heat island."

Early high-level detections, from poorly selective high-performance liquid chromatography-fluorescence detection (HPLC–FLD) methods, have never been repeated using modern, selective tandem mass spectrometry methods. We developed a hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC–MS/MS) method for total BMAA analysis, using an improved solid-phase extraction sample cleanup to reduce suppression. We identified oxidative degradation products of BMAA, formed during strong acid hydrolysis, due to residual nitrate in culture media and implemented a dewatering step to resolve this problem. The method was validated using Spirulina powder, environmental, and two cultured cyanobacterial samples, achieving a reporting limit of 0.3 mg/kg in dry cyanobacterial samples. The validated method was then applied to an additional 30 cyanobacteria cultures from Aotearoa New Zealand. BMAA was only detected in one strain, Planktothrix sp. CAWBG-35, at 2.3 mg/kg. These results indicate that BMAA is not produced at the high levels originally reported (e.g., g/kg) in freshwater cyanobacteria and suggest that BMAA production is not widespread among freshwater cyanobacteria from Aotearoa New Zealand. These results have broad implications for future risk-based environmental and public health monitoring."

However, sources from end users─particularly household natural gas stoves─remain undercharacterized. To address this gap, we measured methane emissions from 62 household stoves in China. The average emission factor reached 0.20 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.18, 0.22) kg of methane per stove per year, with 63% of emissions originating from incomplete combustion during stove operation. The measured emission rates during high-power use were positively correlated with both stove age and historical usage frequency. Nationally, household stoves are projected to emit 66 (95% CI: 59, 74) Gg of methane annually by 2025. The opening of the burner stove inlet valve (SIV) is the primary cause of methane emissions from stoves when they are turned off. Closing the SIV during inactive periods could lower emissions by one-third, avoiding up to 0.13 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.18) Tg of methane emissions between 2026 and 2030. These results help to refine the emission profile of household stoves and highlight practical mitigation strategies for methane reduction."

While TFA forms in the atmosphere and deposition is its primary loss process, the relative contributions of wet and dry deposition require observational constraints. Here, we present a record of TFA in total, wet, and dry deposition in Toronto, Canada, between 2018 and 2024. Samples were collected using custom-built total and automated wet deposition samplers. All total (n = 103) and wet (n = 98) deposition samples contained TFA, with concentrations ranging from 0.07–4.55 μg L–1 and 0.09–3.19 μg L–1, respectively. Seasonal variation showed fluxes peaking in summer months, consistent with atmospheric oxidation of precursors as a major source. Fluxes in 2020 were statistically lower than other years by a factor of 2–5, coinciding with reduced anthropogenic activity during COVID-19 lockdowns. This suggests that TFA sources in Toronto are mainly driven by short-lived precursors. The median dry deposition flux (106 μg m–2 a–1) accounted for 0–94% (median 37%) of the total TFA deposition, higher and more variable than model estimates. These results provide the first field-based quantification of TFA in dry deposition, demonstrating that it is a significant and previously underrepresented removal pathway."

To quantify the efficacy of natural ventilation configurations, we conducted approximately two months of continuous monitoring in a modern UK one-bedroom apartment, comparing three ventilation scenarios during cooking: fully opened (all windows and internal doors open), door-opened only (internal doors open but windows closed), and fully closed (all windows and internal doors closed). Air quality sensors were calibrated against a reference instrument (Fidas 200E) both before and after the field deployment. During the study period, outdoor PM2.5 mass concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 31.0 μg m–3, averaging 6.3 μg m–3. Indoor concentrations were substantially higher than average outdoor levels, with the fully opened scenario yielding the lowest exposure at 14.9 μg m–3 in the living room/kitchen and 15.4 μg m–3 in the bedroom. Relative to the fully opened scenario, PM2.5 concentrations increased by 58.4% (living room/kitchen) and 55.8% (bedroom) under door-opened only conditions, and under fully closed conditions by 28.9% and 27.9%, respectively.

This endangers the functioning of ecosystems and their biodiversity and can have an adverse impact on plants. India is a global hotspot for nitrogen pollution. However, the impact of ensuing nitrogen deposition on Indian ecosystems has not yet been addressed. Here, using a chemical transport model with modern and future emission scenarios, we investigate the critical loads of nitrogen deposition on the national park ecosystems in India, spanning alpine and subalpine forests, desert, mangroves, tropical and subtropical deciduous forests, and evergreen forests. We find that nearly 80% of all of the national parks experience nitrogen deposition exceeding the critical load. Future climate change projections simulated using Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) scenarios indicate nitrogen deposition will increase further, with a median change of +17% to +30% across all ecosystems. This indicates an irreversible risk to native floral biodiversity, as ecosystems elsewhere have been unable to recover to native vegetation. Thus, urgent attention is needed to integrate atmospheric nitrogen deposition and ecosystem impacts into nitrogen management policies."

These impacts depend on BC concentration and mixing state with other aerosol components. However, in situ observations of BC over oceans remain scarce, and the influence of the marine environment on the evolution of BC mixing state is not well understood. Here, we present shipborne measurements aboard the research sailing yacht S/Y Eugen Seibold during 10 Atlantic Ocean cruises. The data set spans 1,120 of measurement hours from near‐coastal regions to remote ocean areas. In oceanic regions extending from tens to thousands of kilometers offshore, 1‐min averaged BC concentrations were typically around 100 ng m−3, suggesting a well‐mixed marine background. Despite the relatively small variability in BC mass concentrations, the mixing state of BC exhibits substantial differences between nearshore and remote oceanic regions. High number fractions (>50%) of BC particles without core‐shell morphologies, characterized by BC externally attached to non‐BC materials, were observed in near‐coastal regions and decreased to ∼20% in remote oceanic regions. In ship‐impacted regions, small freshly emitted BC particles tend to coagulate with other aerosol particles and forming non‐core‐shell attached structures, while high relative humidity (RH > 85%) tends to promote the formation of thick coatings. Our results provide new insights into climate‐relevant properties and underscore the importance of coagulation and hygroscopic processing for the mixing state of BC in the marine atmosphere."

While previous research has demonstrated the impacts of temperature on photosynthesis and BVOCs, the effects of humidity and the combined effects of temperature and humidity remain understudied. Here we discuss the discrete and synergistic impacts of temperature and humidity on ponderosa pine trees. We used a portable photosynthesis system coupled to a proton‐transfer‐reaction mass spectrometer to quantify leaf‐level changes in photosynthesis, stomatal conductance, and emissions as a function of both temperature and humidity. Results demonstrate that all BVOC emissions investigated increased with temperature, regardless of humidity, in agreement with literature. To our knowledge, we present the first direct observation of temperature‐dependent methyl vinyl ketone and methacrolein emissions from ponderosa pines. We find that elevated humidity enhances the baseline emissions of many BVOCs. Increasing relative humidity from 30% to 50% resulted in basal emission rates increasing between 1.7‐fold for sesquiterpenes and 2.9‐fold for 2‐methyl‐3‐buten‐2‐ol. Our results may help explain field observations where BVOC emissions are decoupled from temperature under some conditions, and we clearly illustrate the need for further investigations on BVOC humidity sensitivity over larger (e.g., ecosystem) scales and on other plant species to improve chemical transport model predictions."

Per year, the economic valuation of the health burden ranged from $550M (95% CI: $19M–$1.2B) to $4.4B (95% CI: $150M–$9.9B) for acute impacts and $6.4B (95% CI: $2.2B–$12.9B) to $52B (95% CI: $18B–$100B) for chronic impacts. Additionally, a long‐term average annual exposure for 2013–2023 was estimated using air quality modeling. From this, more than 80% of the population had an average seasonal wildfire‐PM2.5 exposure of at least 1.0 μg/m3 and there were 1,900 (95% CI: 980–2,800) attributable premature deaths and a total economic valuation of $18B (95% CI: $6.1B–$36B), per year. Evaluating and understanding the health impacts of wildfire‐PM2.5 is important given the sizable contribution of wildfire smoke to air pollution in Canada, as well as the anticipated increases in wildfire activity due to climate change."

 The mechanisms driving oxygen isotope variations in East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) precipitation (δ¹⁸Op) and their proxy archives remain controversial. Here, we use IsoGSM3—an isotope-enabled climate model with moisture-tagging capability and rigorously validated against observations, to show that the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the primary mode of interannual δ¹⁸Op variability across East Asia. ENSO’s imprint arises primarily through its modulation of upstream deep convection and rainout, altering the isotopic signature of moisture transported downstream into East Asia. It further strengthens the imprint of low-level monsoon circulation variability on δ¹⁸Op, producing larger-amplitude and more spatially extensive anomalies over the EASM domain. An additional pathway involves ENSO’s influence on the subtropical westerly jet, with El Niño events accentuating its southward displacement during the late and post-monsoon seasons, leading to positive δ¹⁸Op anomalies over the EASM domain. Despite these coherent dynamical influences, the ENSO-driven leading mode of interannual δ¹⁸Op variability captures only ~21% of the total variance, a signal that, though clearly discernible in the model and observations, can be potentially obscured in archives that integrate δ¹⁸Op over multiple years, making seasonal or annually resolved records essential for capturing its variability."

 Compound hazards, like simultaneous occurrence of unusually dry and hot (DH) weather, cause cascading socio-economic damages that surpass univariate hazards. In the context of agricultural production, DH events triggered by pressure and moisture flux anomalies are responsible for some of the most severe agricultural losses across the globe. Most analyses focus on characterizing compound events in individual regions, and the extent of spatial synchrony of DH events and their impacts on crop production has yet to be quantified. Here, using observation-based gridded precipitation and temperature data, we find that the frequency of widespread spatial synchrony–defined as five or more regions simultaneously experiencing DH events–has increased nearly ten-fold over the past four decades, while confined events are declining. This rapid synchronization, especially in recent decades, reflects a non-linear response to global warming. At global scale, substantially larger productivity losses are observed during widespread DH events as compared to the spatially confined DH events. Wheat cropland exhibits the strongest losses during synchronized DH events, followed by maize, with weaker effects for rice. The results highlight the importance of considering the growing occurrence of spatially widespread DH events in assessments of agricultural risk, alongside analyses of individual regional extremes.

 The Sentinel-1 satellite mission has been key to the achievement of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR)-based displacement rates that approach mm/yr precision, particularly in regions without significant vegetation and where long time series of observations exist. However, for more subtle displacement signals, separating the effects of surface processes from deformation due to deeper sources is still challenging. Here, we present a new method based on combinations of co-polarized (VV) and cross-polarized (VH) InSAR data. Cross-polarized data is typically noisier than the co-polarized data and are not widely used for InSAR. However, comparisons of co- and cross-polarized phase data can allow separation of the contributions from different processes. Signals due to deeper sources, such as slip along faults, should appear the same in both data types, while differences can be due to changes in surface characteristics. We examine full-resolution, unfiltered, VV and VH Sentinel-1 data covering Death Valley, California between January 2017 and March 2025. We find that displacement rates derived from VV and VH data differ by several mm/yr in some areas. We also show that rates based only on the VV imagery differ by a few mm/yr between subsets of pixels where the VV-VH differences are large or small, suggesting that VV-VH combinations can help researchers reliably identify pixels that are the least impacted by surface processes. While our work focuses on Death Valley, similar mm/yr-scale biases could impact endorheic basins around the world and influence analyses of interseismic motion, hazard estimates, and groundwater studies."

 This paper presents a novel algorithm for high-resolution soil moisture retrieval based on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry and closure phases. The proposed method efficiently processes long SAR time series with minimal computational cost, generating a soil moisture measurement for each acquisition.Soil moisture data were derived from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and validated across seven different test sites. Retrieval results were compared with modeled soil moisture data from land surface models, alternative remote-sensing products, and in situ measurements.The algorithm demonstrates strong correlations with modeled soil moisture, particularly in areas characterized by high interferometric coherence. However, performance was expectedly limited in regions with low interferometric coherence due to factors such as vegetation cover or snow cover.Looking ahead, this study identifies some relevant directions for future research, including the integration of backscatter information alongside phase data and the adaptation of the algorithm for SAR missions operating at different frequencies (e.g., L-band) or with very dense acquisition schedules (e.g., geosynchronous platforms).

 Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a critical determinant of wildfire ignition and spread. Accurate forecasting of LFMC dynamics, particularly at a two-week timescale, is essential for early wildfire danger assessment. While satellite remote sensing provides valuable current and historical observations, it lacks the ability to predict future LFMC dynamics. Meanwhile, although weather forecasts are relatively reliable over short timescales (up to two weeks), LFMC models based solely on meteorological inputs often fall short, particularly when predicting conditions at the species level. To address these limitations, this study introduces a species-specific approach that integrates MODIS-derived LFMC data into the biophysical process-based MEDFATE model to optimize LFMC simulations and enable short-term forecasting based on daily weather projections. A global sensitivity analysis was conducted to identify key input parameters for different tree species within MEDFATE. These parameters guided the development of a cost function that quantifies discrepancies between model-simulated and field-measured LFMC, enabling species-specific model calibration. To enhance model optimization, the global optimal DEoptim algorithm was combined with four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4D-Var) to integrate MODIS-derived LFMC estimates into MEDFATE. Using weather projections, the optimized MEDFATE model produced LFMC forecasts at about a two-week timescale. Time-series measurements of LFMC dynamics for Quercus faginea, Quercus ilex, and Pinus halepensis in Spain, Pinus ponderosa in the USA, and Eucalyptus species in Australia demonstrated that model calibration improved daily LFMC estimates (R2 increased from 0.22 to 0.31; RMSE reduced from 18.71% to 16.04%). Further incorporation of MODIS-derived LFMC data significantly enhanced accuracy (R2 = 0.56; RMSE = 9.75%). Validation across seven wildfire events in Spain, Australia, and the USA confirmed the effectiveness and operational relevance of the approach for early fire warning. These findings underscore the potential of integrating satellite remote sensing and meteorological data into biophysical process-based models to improve tree species-specific LFMC prediction and support proactive fire management."

 Cloud cover in optical remote sensing imagery severely limits its effectiveness for downstream applications. Compared with cloud removal methods that rely on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data or single cloud‐free references, multi-temporal imagery provides richer, more stable and more reliable auxiliary information. However, existing methods often exploit only limited temporal observations and fail to fully capture the deep synergistic relationships among spatial, spectral, and temporal features, leading to reconstruction results that suffer from detail loss and spectral distortion in cloud-contaminated regions. To address this issue, we propose TSSMamba, a temporal–spectral–spatial state space model for multi-temporal cloud removal. The framework jointly models temporal dynamics, spectral responses and spatial structures of cloud-obscured imagery. A dual-stream architecture is designed to separately learn temporal–spectral and temporal–spatial dependencies, while a cross-dimensional fusion module strengthens interactions between the two streams and improves spatial coherence and spectral consistency in the restored images. Experiments on three public cloud removal datasets demonstrate that TSSMamba significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both quantitative metrics and visual quality. On the STGAN Dataset, Sen2_MTC and SEN12MS-CR-TS, TSSMamba achieves PSNR gains of 0.98, 0.59, and 1.11 dB and SSIM improvements of 0.0123, 0.0130, and 0.0115, respectively, over MSC-GAN, thereby confirming its superior cloud removal capability.

 Gas flaring (GF) releases large amounts of greenhouse gases and pollutants, severely affecting global climate change and regional environmental quality. Quantifying global GF activities is essential to implement emission mitigation polices. Existing methods struggle with detecting weak GF activities under complex daytime background conditions. This study proposes a method combining the spectral index and machine learning methods, to detect onshore GF sites (GFs) using the images from the Multispectral Instrument (MSI) onboard Sentinel-2 satellites. First, the Thermal Anomaly Index (TAI, calculated in the near-infrared and short-wave infrared bands) and TAI increment (ΔTAI) are applied to detect thermal anomalies from MSI images, in which ΔTAI enhances the spatial-contextual background contrast. Then, nine flare-specific features are selected to further identify the GFs from the thermal anomalies using a random forest model. Finally, the detected GFs were validated worldwide, achieving an overall user accuracy of 93.34% and a producer accuracy of 95.31%. This approach enhances the sensitivity to weak flares and effectively addresses the interferences from other heat sources and highly reflective buildings, providing a universal solution for GFs detection in complex onshore scenes."

 Methoxyphenols, as emitted abundantly from biomass burning, are important precursors of brown carbon (BrC) in the atmosphere. However, the effects of environmental factors on their gas-phase oxidation by nitrate radicals (NO3), the dominant nighttime oxidant, remain poorly understood. In this study, the reaction of vanillin, a proxy for methoxyphenols, with NO3 was investigated in a smog chamber under six environmental conditions, varied by pre-existing seed particles levels and relative humidity (RH). The NO3-driven oxidation under different environmental conditions consistently produced secondary BrC, with nitrogen-containing species identified as the dominant reaction products. Both seed level and RH were found to be critical environmental controls; higher seed concentrations promoted secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation and increased mass absorption coefficient (MAC) under dry conditions but suppressed them under humid conditions. Furthermore, variations in seed concentration and RH guided the reaction pathways to distinct product distributions. Our findings also revealed that humid conditions may enhance the concentration of low-molecular-weight species regardless of seed levels. Overall, this work reveals how environmental conditions modulate secondary BrC formation from methoxyphenols oxidation with NO3, providing critical constraints for atmospheric models of aerosol optical properties."

 Understanding the impact of aerosols on heavy precipitation is crucial for improving predictions and management of atmospheric processes. Heavy convective precipitation often occurs within a few hours, making the investigation of aerosol influences on daily precipitation variability particularly important. In this study, heavy rainfall events in southwestern Iran were identified using ERA5 data alongside aerosol measurements from two satellite sources and the EAC4 reanalysis dataset. These datasets enabled analysis of aerosol optical depth (AOD), differentiation of aerosol types, and assessment of additional aerosol-related indices in the region. Two indices were used to classify clean and polluted conditions at macro- and micro-scales: AOD as a large-scale indicator, and cloud droplet number concentration (CDNC) as a small-scale indicator. The 25th and 75th percentiles of these indices over all rainy days were used as thresholds for clean and polluted conditions. Four aerosol types common in southwestern Iran were examined: black carbon (BC) and dust as radiatively absorbing aerosols, and sulfate and sea salt as non-absorbing aerosols. Analysis revealed three key features of daily heavy precipitation variability associated with aerosol types. Under polluted conditions defined by AOD, precipitation onset and peak occurred earlier, but event duration was shorter. In contrast, under polluted conditions defined by CDNC, precipitation started earlier but peaked later, with a longer duration. Furthermore, absorbing aerosols were associated with earlier onset and delayed peaks, whereas non-absorbing aerosols corresponded to delayed onset and extended precipitation duration. These findings highlight the distinct roles of aerosol types in modulating heavy rainfall characteristics."

 Under the trend of global warming, the Arctic region has experienced increasing warming and accelerating melting of sea ice, resulting in the opening of Arctic shipping routes with significant navigational potential. However, intense water vapor releases and a cold underlying surface can lead to frequent occurrences of sea fog and low clouds over the Arctic ice surfaces. Conducting detection of sea fog and low clouds is therefore highly important for ensuring the safety of Arctic shipping routes. In this study, a satellite detection algorithm for summer daytime sea fog and low clouds in ice floe fields of the Arctic has been proposed using the time series remote sensing data from the Moderate-Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and the AdaBoost method. Methodologically, three spectral indices, the normalized difference sea-water index (NDSWI), the sea-ice recognition index (SIRI), and the mid-high-cloud recognition index (MHCRI), are first constructed by analyzing the variations in reflection spectra for sea fog and low clouds, sea ice, sea water, and mid-high clouds. Additionally, three texture features, namely, the homogeneity, contrast, and entropy, of the brightness temperature at 11.030 μm (BT11.030 μm) are calculated using the gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM). Subsequently, a strong learner classification model of the AdaBoost ensemble learning algorithm was built by adopting the samples of the spectral indices and texture features above and the weak learner of the decision. Finally, the residual mid-high clouds are removed through the threshold at BT11.030 μm. Verification indicated that the probability of detection (POD), false alarm rate (FAR), and critical success index (CSI) values were 84.44%, 9.45%, and 77.52%, respectively. This research supports the accurate detection of sea fog and low clouds in the Arctic, thereby ensuring safe navigation of Arctic shipping routes."

In August 2019, the first AirCore observations over the northern TP were conducted, providing high-resolution vertical profiles of CH4, CO and N2O from the surface up to 22 km. Instrument and campaign details are described. Notably, enhanced concentrations of CH4 and CO were observed at 13–14 km when the observation site was located within the ASM anticyclone, indicating that the primary influence of deep convection occurs at this altitude. Back-trajectory analyses indicate that these enhanced layers originated from northern India, the Bay of Bengal, and southern China. On average, CH4 and CO concentrations inside the anticyclone were 30.2 ppb and 52.5 ppb higher, respectively, than those outside. N2O concentrations remain relatively constant throughout the troposphere but show a sharp decline approximately 2 km above the tropopause, indicating the onset of significant stratospheric influence and a weakening of ASM anticyclone confinement at this altitude.

Emulators are often calibrated on idealised abrupt CO2 quadrupling experiments from CMIP6, particularly the global surface temperature response over time to an imposed radiative forcing. Such CMIP6 experiments tend to be run for 150 years, which is not sufficient to reveal the full equilibrium response to an imposed climate forcing. Here we show that, when longer experiments are available for emulator calibration, the long-term climate warming projections increase, particularly for 2100, by up to 0.70 (0.42–0.93, 25th to 75th percentile) °C in the median under a high emissions scenario; peak global warming in a high overshoot scenario is higher by 0.24 °C (0.14–0.31 °C). Corresponding long-term thermosteric sea level rise (SLR) is consequently higher, by 0.45 (0.22–0.52, 25th to 75th percentile) m in 2500. This result, consistent across calibrations from 17 ESMs, has implications for climate change mitigation strategies, as it is likely that even more stringent emissions reductions would be required to limit long-term warming and SLR than previously thought."

However, in recent decades, unusually wet conditions have persisted into autumn, creating unprecedented extremes. Using multidecadal observations, reanalysis datasets, and Polar Amplification Model Intercomparison Project (PAMIP) simulations, we show that Arctic warming significantly postpones the retreat of the AfroA-SM. This delay shifts the northernmost summer monsoon boundary by 5.6°–12° and accounts for 33%–69% of September precipitation across North Africa, South Asia, the Tibetan Plateau, and East Asia. The mechanism is anchored in a northward displacement of the subtropical jet stream, which is driven by reduced meridional temperature gradients resulting from sea‐ice loss and Arctic amplification. The resulting Eurasian anticyclone weakens the tropospheric dipole of the polar vortex, promoting negative North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO)-like anomalies and a pronounced Eurasian wave train. These reinforce the northward shift of the subtropical high and enhance warm‐moisture advection into northernmost margin summer monsoon belts.

Typhoon Hinnamnor (2022), which originated in the northwestern Pacific and weakened over the East Sea, demonstrates this interaction. While previous studies have explored typhoon intensification due to underlying MHWs, the formation of MHWs following a typhoon’s passage remains less understood. Post-typhoon MHWs can form due to local ocean heat uptake by anomalously cold sea surface temperatures overlying an anomalously warmer subsurface. This study provides the first detailed analysis of MHW formation on the west side of a typhoon path, off Korea’s east coast, approximately one week after the typhoon, using data from a fixed surface mooring. The results indicate that near-inertial internal gravity waves, influenced by sub-inertial background conditions, prevented the onset of the MHW during the week following the typhoon’s passage, despite favorable conditions such as coastal downwelling, increased surface net heat flux, and higher upper-ocean heat content."

Sunshine Duration observations reveal the paradox of dimming event under strictest lockdown policies in February 2020 over Beijing. Modern-era retrospective analysis for research and applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) reanalysis shows Rs decreased abruptly by 12.89 W·m−2 in February 2020 compared to 2015–2019 (pre-pandemic), which is confirmed by Himiwari-8 satellite retrieved Rs. Through multi-parameter attribution analysis, Shapley additive explanations indicated that an anomalous increase in aerosol optical depth contributed 31.700% to Rs attenuation, primarily driven by chemical formation of secondary organic aerosols that offset benefits from reduced primary emissions. Simultaneously, modified cloud physical properties collectively accounted for 38.02% to Rs attenuation. Specifically, doubled low cloud cover accounted for 23.89% while increased low cloud optical thickness contributed 13.52%. Further compounding these effects, weakened boundary layer dynamics exerted synergistic impacts: boundary layer height (BLH) compression (168.93 m) contributed 14.92% and reduced wind speed (0.63 m·s−1) contributed 9.51%, jointly promoting near-surface aerosol accumulation through suppressed pollutant diffusion. Additionally, elevated surface temperature (+1.36 °C) exacerbated Rs attenuation by facilitating aerosol nucleation and cloud condensation nucleus formation. Collectively, these findings challenge the assumption that emission reduction invariably improves Rs, ultimately confirming nonlinear climatic effects from coupled aerosol-cloud-Rs interactions under abrupt anthropogenic disturbances."

Vegetation water content (VWC) has been proposed as a holistic indicator of entire plant water status and ecosystem functioning. However, few studies have explored its relationships with ecological and environmental factors, especially in data-scarce regions like Patagonia. In this study, we used the SMAP dataset to analyzed VWC patterns across vegetation types, landscapes, and climate anomalies over the 2015–2016 to 2024–2025 growing seasons in Southern Patagonia, covering Santa Cruz and Tierra del Fuego provinces. The results show that VWC varies significantly among vegetation types. Forests and shrublands generally had higher VWC than grasslands. Among them, Nothofagus betuloides and evergreen mixed forests (NB) exhibited the highest VWC, with grasslands and dry shrublands being at the lowest level. Distinct seasonal VWC dynamics emerged along landscape gradients: a bell-shaped pattern in humid areas and an inverted bell-shaped pattern in arid ecosystems, primarily driven by winter snowmelt recharge and subsequent summer water stress. VWC responded differentially to El Niño-Southern Oscillation and Southern Annular Mode phases, with El Niño and La Niña exerting contrasting effects by province. To bridge science and application, we propose incorporating these metrics into adaptive management, specifically for: (i) defining conservation-priority zones for harvesting in water-limited forests, (ii) implementing dynamic fire risk thresholds based on seasonal depletion patterns, and (iii) adjusting silvopastoral stocking rates according to inter-annual VWC trends. These findings demonstrate that VWC is a robust indicator for guiding sustainable ecosystem management and conservation planning in Southern Patagonia."

Conversely, projected decreases in the amplitude may act to suppress flood hazards in some regions, partially offsetting the impact of sea level rise. Simulations of the sea level seasonal cycle by the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models suggest changes up to ±30% are projected under a high emission scenario. We demonstrate that a currently unaccounted increase of 5–10 cm in the sea level seasonal cycle will increase the frequency of extremes from once in 20 years to once in 10 years. However, the sea level seasonal cycle amplitudes in CMIP6 models are underestimated compared to seasonal variability observed by satellite altimetry for almost all coastlines, suggesting that future changes might be underestimated, leading to a large impact on extreme sea levels in coastal areas. Including the changes in the future sea level seasonal cycle will advance future projections of sea level extremes and contribute to the crucial decisions about adaptation in coastal areas."

This poses a major challenge for Cyprus to comply with the stricter PM10 limits set by the new EU air quality directive. 
 Long-term daily PM2.5 and PM10 chemical speciation data was collected continuously from 2015 to 2023 at an urban traffic and regional background site in Cyprus, offering a unique opportunity to quantify the influence and trends of (i) local emissions on urban PM concentration levels and sources, and (ii) regional PM emissions over the Eastern Mediterranean basin.Despite a statistically significant drop in PM2.5 and PM10 at both sites over the last 19 years (2005–2023), concentration levels remain high with no further significant improvements observed over the last 9 years; making PM concentration levels well above the new EU annual limits. To refine this analysis, long-term trends (2015–2023) were explored for individual PM chemical species and sources derived by PMF source apportionment. A decreasing trend in traffic-related PM10 of 35 % was observed at the traffic site, suggesting the effectiveness of the gradual shift of the vehicle fleet towards the latest EURO-standard vehicles. On the other hand, this reduction in tailpipe traffic emissions was completely offset by an increase of uncontrolled urban emissions, such as road dust re-suspension and biomass burning from domestic heating, calling for the rapid implementation of abatement measures.Based on cluster analysis of air mass origins, the Middle East region was identified as a major hotspot of PM10 over the Eastern Mediterranean; with both high concentration levels of dust from the Arabian desert and substantial anthropogenic pollution with continuously increasing trends in biomass burning and sulfate-rich emissions from fossil fuel combustion over the past decade."

 Saharan dust (SD) can be transported over long distances by large-scale atmospheric circulation. SD events (SDE) occur 30 to 150 times each year at the high-altitude station of the Jungfraujoch (JFJ) in the Swiss Alps. The SD detection method, applied since 2001, is based on the inversion of the single scattering albedo wavelength dependence caused by the higher coarse-mode fraction and the chemical composition of dust. Here, the reproducibility of the SD detection by different types of nephelometers and absorption photometers is first investigated and is then compared to detections based on the observed concentration of coarse-mode aerosol, source sensitivities simulated with FLEXPART as well as to the dust index provided by the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service. The difference in SD detection is stronger for various nephelometer types than for various absorption photometers. Each detection method has advantages and weakness and no one can be considered as reference. The climatology of the 23-year time series of dust hours and dust mass at the JFJ shows that the temporal influence of dust is strongest from February to June, and in October and November, whereas the dust mass is higher in spring than in fall. The SDEs detected by a high coarse-mode particle concentration have different sources and pathways to Europe than the ones detected by the optical method. The inhomogeneity in the SD time series and the high inter-annual variability restrain the evaluation of long-term trends."

We established a localized plant species-specific BVOC emission rate library using a developed statistical approach, based on local measurements. The usage of library can improve the emission model performance by better catching the spatial variations of emissions. 
 Precise quantification of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions is essential for effective control of ozone and secondary organic aerosol pollution. However, the lack of a localized and detailed plant species–specific emission rate library poses significant challenges to accurate emission estimates in China. Additionally, large uncertainty exists in the representative emission rates used in inventory compilation. Here, a statistical approach for classifying emission intensity and assigning representative emission rates with higher accuracy was developed from our measurements and local field observations. Furthermore, a localized plant species–specific BVOC emission rate library for China covering 599 plant species was established. Critically, different reliability levels were assigned to each emission rate according to the measurement technique.  Emission simulations were conducted to evaluate the implications of the developed library. Comparison with formaldehyde vertical column density observations showed that our localized library improved the model performance in capturing the spatial variations of isoprene emissions. The newly estimated BVOC emissions were 27.70 Tg, 18 % higher than estimates based on the global library. Updating the localized emission rates reduced underestimation in southern and overestimation in northeast and western China."

Using satellite data and a new tracking method, it maps fractions of sea ice from first- to sixth-year and includes uncertainty estimates. The dataset shows a decline in older ice and more first-year ice, it agrees well with buoy data, and supports Arctic monitoring, climate research, navigation, and model evaluation. 
 We present LM-SIAge, a new Climate Data Record (CDR) of Arctic sea ice age spanning the period from 1991 through 2024. The dataset is based on a novel Lagrangian advection scheme applied to a triangular mesh, which conserves sea ice age fractions and reduces numerical diffusion compared to the previous Eulerian approach. LM-SIAge is derived from satellite observations of sea ice concentration and drift, and represents fractional age classes per grid cell. The record captures the spatial and temporal evolution of first- to sixth-year ice, including uncertainty estimates that account for both sea ice concentration and drift uncertainties.We compare LM-SIAge with existing products from NSIDC and C3S, finding consistent large-scale trends – such as the decline of older ice – but also identifying systematic differences. Trend analysis confirms a significant reduction in sea ice age and a general increase in the area of first-year ice. Validation with ice drifting buoys indicates good consistency (LM-SIAge does not underestimate max age of the buoys in 98.3 % of cases), with most discrepancies occurring near the ice edge. The NSIDC product does not underestimate the age in 96.4 % of cases.The LM-SIAge dataset improves the observational basis for Arctic monitoring and contributes to the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Essential Climate Variables.

Murray,GloPINE dataset: model-ready measurements of INP concentrations using PINE instruments,"Ice formation in sub-zero clouds is influenced by airborne particles called ice-nucleating particles (INPs), whose concentrations vary substantially over short time and spatial scales. To assess the role of INPs in our climate, a comprehensive and consistent global dataset is essential. Our GloPINE model-ready dataset is a major step in this direction, comprising 36,000 measurements made using a single instrument design (PINE) over 70,000 hours of operation at 20 northern hemisphere sites. 
 Ice-nucleating particles (INPs) are a subset of aerosol particles that facilitate the freezing of supercooled cloud droplets heterogeneously and influence the radiative properties of supercooled clouds. The role of INPs in the Earth system remains unquantified in part due to poorly constrained representations of their spatial distributions and properties in global and regional models. In this study, we present a quality-controlled dataset, called GloPINE, comprising 70,000 hours of INP concentrations measured using Portable Ice Nucleation Experiment (PINE) instruments that use an expansion chamber to make automated long-term (months to years) and high temporal resolution (< 10 mins). We collate measurements from 20 recent ground-based PINE field campaigns in the Northern Hemisphere conducted between January 2018 and December 2023, totalling more than 400,000 expansions performed under conditions relevant for mixed-phase clouds. In the GloPINE dataset, we subset and average the PINE measurements across synoptically relevant time intervals of 6 h and 2 K temperature bins, providing 36,000 INP measurements. Combining PINE expansions over these intervals enhances counting statistics at higher freezing temperatures, decreases the lower limit of measurable INP concentrations, and provides an INP dataset readily applicable to model simulation data and meteorological reanalysis products. The frequency and duration of measurements combined with the lack of instrument or methodological variability provides a means to robustly evaluate and constrain global models on a scale that has not previously been possible."

The resulting 30-meter resolution map is rigorously validated and expands usable coastal data by nearly 150 %. This product provides an essential foundation for planning against sea-level rise and coastal erosion, offering a scalable blueprint for other countries worldwide. 
 Beaches provide essential ecological functions and support socio-economic resilience, yet accurate mapping is hindered by systematic limitations in global Digital Elevation Models (DEMs). A critical challenge remains in the intertidal zone, where frequent tidal inundation creates extensive data voids, disrupting the continuity of coastal topography. To bridge this fundamental data gap, we present NZ-BeachTopo30 which is a national-scale and full-coverage 30 m beach topography dataset for New Zealand constructed by fusing ICESat-2 photon-counting altimetry with Sentinel-2 multispectral time series. Using DeltaDTM as a high-precision baseline for the stable backshore, we trained an XGBoost model on ICESat-2 control points and Sentinel-2 spectral-geometric features to reconstruct the missing intertidal topography specifically. SHAP analysis was further employed to interpret the physical driving mechanisms of these predictors. Validation against airborne Lidar confirmed that the dataset accurately recovers elevations in previously void zones with an RMSE of 0.94 m. By integrating these predictions with the DeltaDTM baseline, the final national-scale product achieves robust accuracy with an R² of 0.75 and an RMSE of 1.17 m. This targeted integration significantly expanded valid topographic coverage by 145.8 % from 79.9 km² to 196.5 km². It delivers the first spatially continuous and full-coverage beach topography dataset for New Zealand. This product distinguishes itself by seamlessly bridging the critical intertidal gap that disconnects land and sea in existing global datasets. Given the global availability of ICESat-2 and Sentinel-2, NZ-BeachTopo30 offers a scalable solution for worldwide applications and provides a robust foundation for inundation modeling and coastal management."

This allows us to capture the inherent uncertainty of wildfire dynamics. Our model produces ensembles of forecasts that reflect physically meaningful distributions of where fire might go next. 
 We propose a stochastic framework for wildfire spread prediction using deep generative diffusion models with ensemble sampling. In contrast to traditional deterministic approaches that struggle to capture the inherent uncertainty and variability of wildfire dynamics, our method generates probabilistic forecasts by sampling multiple plausible future scenarios conditioned on the same initial state. As a proof-of-concept, the model is trained on synthetic wildfire data generated by a probabilistic cellular automata simulator conditioned on canopy cover, vegetation density, and terrain slope for two real fires, namely the Chimney Fire in 2016 and the Ferguson Fire in 2018, both in California. To assess predictive performance and uncertainty representation under an identical neural network architecture, we compare a conventional supervised regression training paradigm against a conditional diffusion framework that employs ensemble sampling, and evaluate both approaches on independent ensemble test datasets. Across independent ensemble test sets, the diffusion surrogate consistently outperforms the deterministic baseline. It delivers lower errors in standard accuracy metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), exhibits higher spatial coherence as reflected by improved structural similarity index measure (SSIM) values, and generates samples of superior distributional quality according to the Fréchet inception distance (FID). Moreover, the diffusion-based model shows stronger probabilistic capability, as evidenced by higher scores in the hit rate (HR) metric, which we introduce as an uncertainty-aware verification measure. These results demonstrate that diffusion-based ensemble modelling provides a more flexible and effective approach for wildfire forecasting and, by capturing the distributional characteristics of future fire states, supports the generation of fire susceptibility maps that convey probabilistic risk information useful for assessment and operational planning in fire-prone environments."

However, traditional SDIE systems face a trade-off between evaporation performance and salt resistance. Herein, we demonstrate that a novel functional group-mediated and nanoconfinement-engineered hydrogel composed of MXene and ionic covalent organic frameworks (iCOFs) effectively regulates both evaporation performance and salt resistance. The iCOFs with a high density of hydrophilic functional groups and nanoconfinement effect are found to simultaneously induce the disruption of hydrogen bonding networks and enhance cluster evaporation, achieving reduced evaporation enthalpy. The increased functional groups also facilitate both ion reverse diffusion and the Donnan effect, which effectively alleviates salt crystallization during long-term seawater desalination. This strategy leads to a 56% enhancement in evaporation rate (2.91 kg m–2 h–1 under 1 sun) of the optimized hydrogel. The evaporation performance remains stable in highly concentrated (20 wt %) saline and also during a 60 h continuous operation in seawater. In addition, functional group-mediated MXene/iCOFs hydrogels with a nanoconfinement effect exhibit a 99.99% removal rate for various water pollutants, including heavy metal ions, antibiotics, and dyes, while maintaining stable performance under extreme temperature conditions.

Although bulk measurements routinely show sharp PM2.5 spikes during Diwali, direct microscopic evidence linking specific aerosol types to these concurrent sources remains limited. Here, we combined transmission electron microscopy (TEM) with bulk chemical analysis to identify particle types and track their physicochemical evolution throughout the Diwali period. Before Diwali, aerosols were dominated by potassium (K)-rich particles (25%), carbonaceous particles (primary organic aerosol (POA) and soot, 29%), and their internal mixtures (K–POA/soot, 37%), with frequent spherical POA (i.e., tar balls), indicating a strong biomass-burning influence. During Diwali, particle populations shifted abruptly to a pyrotechnic signature of fireworks, characterized by abundant Al2O3 monomers (30–300 nm) and their agglomerates, either as bare (36–40%) or uniformly coated by K2SO4 (Al2O3–K, 46–47%). After Diwali, ultrafine Al2O3 particles (<100 nm) persisted and underwent coagulation with aged biomass-burning particles, forming distinctive Al2O3–K–POA/soot internal mixtures. Therefore, Al2O3 nanoparticles can serve as a tracer of fireworks and were further internally mixed with carbonaceous particles derived from biomass burning during severe haze events of Diwali. These metal-containing particles warrant particular attention because of their potential toxicity and adverse respiratory health effects in the densely populated megacity."

However, predicting the impact of emission reductions on tropospheric chemistry remains challenging, as NOx influences oxidant concentrations and aerosol formation. Stable oxygen isotopes (Δ17O and δ18O) of atmospheric nitrate (pNO3) serve as powerful observational constraints for the understanding of oxidation processes. Here, we quantified Δ17O and δ18O in pNO3 from a unique 10-year aerosol record in the northeastern US to constrain chemistry changes over a time of large reductions in NOx (2005–2015). We observed a significant decreasing trend in δ18O(pNO3) (−0.32‰yr–1), which reflects a shift in oxidation chemistry driven by emission reductions. Air quality modeling indicated that the decrease in δ18O(pNO3) between 2005 and 2015 was primarily driven by enhanced nighttime NO oxidation by ozone, with a relative reduction in N2O5 hydrolysis and increased NO2 + OH, leading to more efficient nitrate formation in the recent past. This explains the continued elevated wintertime nitrate that plagues air quality in the eastern US despite significant NOx decreases. The isotopic constraint on oxidizing chemistry greatly enhances our ability to test and predict the effectiveness of emissions reductions on oxidation chemistry."

Our model demonstrated robust performance in estimating global soil HONO emissions (R2 = 0.91).

Then, the GEOS-Chem model simulations suggested that the contribution of soil HONO emission to the global average concentrations of PM2.5, sulfate (SO42–), nitrate (NO3–), ammonium (NH4+), black carbon (BC), and organic aerosol (OA) reached 0.015 (0.3% (range: 0–6%) accounting for all-source concentration), 0.003 (0.6% (0–7%)), 0.008 (3.4% (0–52%)), 0.002 (1% (0–26%)), ∼0, and 0.002 (0.6% (0–4%)) μg/m3 in 2015, respectively. Notably, exposure to soil HONO-driven PM2.5 was associated with an estimated 113,137 global mortalities. As anthropogenic emissions continue to decline in the future, targeted measures to mitigate soil HONO emissions will become increasingly critical to reducing their adverse effects on air pollution and public health."

The circulation of cold CO2 significantly lowers reservoir temperature and alters rock wettability, which threatens the long-term security of CO2 sequestration by weakening the capillary sealing capacity of caprock. To address this concern, we investigate the mechanisms by which cooling-induced wettability alteration affects the capillary sealing capacity of CPG caprock and quantitatively evaluate the associated leakage risks. First, we propose a temperature-saturation dependent capillary pressure (TSPC) model to quantify the impact of temperature variations on caprock capillary sealing capacity. Subsequently, the TSPC model is integrated into our in-house numerical reservoir simulator to quantitatively assess CO2 leakage for a field-scale CPG operation. Simulation results show that temperature reduction during CPG operation decreases capillary pressure by 45%–87%, which substantially undermines the ability of the caprock to prevent CO2 upward breakthrough. The decline in capillary pressure weakens the sealing capacity and leads to nearly 50,000 tons of CO2 leakage in a representative CPG reservoir simulation. The above results demonstrate a previously unrecognized CO2 leakage mechanism in CPG systems caused by cooling-induced wettability alteration. In addition, we propose practical mitigation strategies to address this leakage risk and enhance the long-term security of CO2 sequestration after CPG operations."

A prevailing assumption is that these reagents selectively target radicals without interacting with triplet excited-state contaminants generated under UV irradiation. Here, we challenge this assumption by demonstrating that triplet-state contaminants can directly interact with commonly used probes and scavengers, revealing an overlooked transformation pathway that biases radical identification and mechanistic interpretation. Using naproxen as a model compound, we show that seven representative reagents (isopropanol, p-benzoquinone, furfuryl alcohol, tert-butanol, methanol, ethanol, and HCO3–) efficiently quench triplet-state naproxen, with bimolecular rate constants ranging from 1.0 × 106 to 7.1 × 108 M–1 s–1. The quenching process followed saturation kinetics and can be well described by the Hanes–Woolf model. Transient absorption spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations reveal feasible electron transfer and proton-coupled electron transfer pathways. Further, in a UV/H2O2 system, we found that isopropanol promotes naproxen degradation with triplet-state interactions, leading to significant underestimation of •OH contribution. These results highlight a critical interference pathway in AOPs  and underscore the need for caution when using probes and scavengers for kinetic and mechanistic evaluations."

Targeted approaches with LC-HRMS/MS often cover less than 30% of PFAS across various matrices and hence  nontargeted strategies are necessary to enhance identification coverage. We expanded FluoroMatch Suite, a nontargeted PFAS data-processing software, to leverage full-scan (MS1) data for highly accurate formula prediction and Kaufmann analysis. Software features include Kaufmann analysis with isoline cutoffs determined using kernel density based on an EPA PFAS data set and an 11-step formula prediction algorithm. Application of the FluoroMatch Suite with the MS1 extension to AFFF contaminated soil revealed 179 PFAS-confirmed features. Kauffman 95% isoline cutoffs captured 94% of the confirmed PFAS and removed 96% of features assigned as likely non-PFAS. The PFAS-formula prediction introduced in this manuscript had a false positive rate of 26% and a false negative rate (no predicted formula) of 30%. Using a novel homologous series voting algorithm, where the predominant subclass from formula prediction were used to predict all formulas for the homologous series, we achieved a 0% false positive rate and 6% false negative rate in formula prediction. The novel nontargeted algorithms developed in this study proved to be highly accurate and by leveraging MS1 data enhances the capacity to identify unknown PFAS in complex environmental matrices."

This study investigated the effects of NO (0, 50, 100 ppm) in simulated flue gas (15% CO2) on Chlorella sp., examining intracellular/extracellular NO dynamics, antioxidant response, key enzyme activity (nitrate reductase), and growth-photosynthesis coupling. Under optimized aeration (25 mL min–1, 3 h), 50 ppm of NO optimally elevated intracellular (0.62–1.30 nmol L–1) and extracellular (2.56–3.90 nmol L–1) NO levels, mitigating oxidative stress while stimulating nitrate reductase activity. This concentration maximally promoted cell proliferation (152.7% increase in algal density) and photosynthetic quantum yield (9.7% higher Fv/Fm). Consequently, the CO2 removal rate increased by approximately 43%, coupled with a NO removal efficiency of 33.1%. These findings suggest that, under controlled experimental conditions that exclude SO2 and other components of real flue gas, moderate supplementation of NO can enhance microalgal carbon fixation and reduce nitrogen oxide emissions by improving photosynthetic efficiency and biomass accumulation. This presents a promising strategy for integrated flue gas bioremediation."

This study directly addresses the resulting uncertainties in UAV flight measurements by employing the fire dynamics simulation (FDS) in large eddy simulation (LES) mode, leveraging mean wind data derived from LiDAR data sets. The FDS model was validated with in situ CH4 concentration data collected by uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) during controlled release experiments. Our analysis of 10 extensively sampled plumes shows that FDS accurately reproduces the magnitude and spatiotemporal variations of the observed plumes for sufficiently large pipes (diameter >0.6 cm). We found that factors such as gas exit velocity, obstacles, and terrain topography significantly affect the near-field dynamics of the plumes. To a lesser extent, the temperature of the gas influences plume behavior at higher mass flow rates. We highlight the added value of high-resolution LES modeling to understand CH4 plume dynamics captured by various sensors, aiming to improve current emission quantification methods."

However, quantitatively tracing the contribution and transport mechanisms of this Cd in soil–crop systems remains challenging. By integrating a two-year continuous field open-top chamber (OTC) and greenhouse experiments with stable isotope analysis, we elucidated the biogeochemistry of dry and wet atmospheric Cd deposition in agroecosystems. Newly deposited Cd undergoes rapid aging in soils, with its bioavailability being dependent on deposition type. The isotopic signature of soil bioavailable Cd is primarily governed by dry deposition, a pattern mirrored in crop edible parts regardless of deposition type for both root and foliar exposure pathways, indicating that the isotopic characteristics of bioavailable Cd in wet and dry deposition are congruent with its mitigation in the environment. Applying an isotope mixing model optimized with greenhouse-derived fractionation factors, we quantified that atmospheric deposition contributed 29–65% to the soil bioavailable Cd pool. Foliar uptake of atmospheric Cd contributed over 50% to rice grains and pak choi shoots, exceeding the root uptake of soil legacy Cd. This work establishes Cd isotopes as a robust tool for distinguishing Cd pathways and sources, offering a refined approach for quantitative source apportionment in agroecosystems."

This study pioneers the investigation of electron, proton, and oxygen atomic ion scattering induced by local MS waves through quasi‐linear diffusion theory. The kinetic dispersion relations of local MS waves have been applied to compute diffusion coefficients. The results demonstrate that local MS waves can efficiently scatter suprathermal electrons via Landau resonance, especially for thermal electrons propagating at large pitch angles. For ion scattering, hot protons with small pitch angles undergo effective scattering through cyclotron resonance, while oxygen atomic ions at tens of eVs are scattered through high‐order cyclotron resonance.

Here, we conduct RCE simulations coupled to 2‐ and 20‐m slab ocean models in a 3D channel domain to assess the influence of interactive sea surface temperatures (SST) on self‐aggregation. Our results support previous findings that simulations coupled to shallower slab oceans experience delayed self‐aggregation onset compared to simulations coupled to deeper slab oceans. More notably, we find distinct aggregated states in the simulations. The 20‐m simulation reaches a relatively unchanging state after day 60, whereas the 2‐m simulation continuously evolves. Low cloud‐SST feedbacks drive initial increased variability in the 2‐m simulation by spurring the expansion of a dominant dry region. Later, SST gradients arising from differential shortwave heating within the dry region promote low‐level moistening and convective initiation.

Using observations from the Cassini spacecraft, we identify zigzag‐shaped microsignatures and reproduce their morphology through test‐particle simulations based on this scenario. The inferred radial velocities at low L $L$‐shells (L∼5 $L\sim 5$) are on the order of 1 km/s, suggesting significant braking of injection flux tubes and consistent with the observed decline in their occurrence inside L∼7 $L\sim 7$.

Resolving convection induces an increase in friction velocity and a decrease in soil moisture, and thus enhances Sahelian dust emissions. These changes are due to improved representation of mesoscale convective systems associated with African Easterly Waves. These results demonstrate that high‐resolution modeling with resolved convection can improve understanding of the global dust cycle and how dust emissions are affected by a changing climate."

Two key processes control the heat transport: baroclinic instability driven by surface buoyancy contrasts and convective instability driven by heating from the core. However, global ocean simulations cannot accurately resolve convection under realistic icy moon conditions and instead often use Earth‐based convective parameterizations, which capture only vertical convective mixing and cannot represent rotation‐aligned slantwise convection on icy moons. We use high‐resolution convection‐resolving simulations to investigate ocean heat transport by slantwise convection in a parameter regime relevant to icy moons, isolated from baroclinic instability. Total heat transport follows the Coriolis–Inertial–Archimedean scaling with an added latitude dependence. The vertical transport increases with latitude, and the meridional transport is poleward. These results indicate that slantwise convection redistributes heat toward the poles, favoring a poleward‐thinning ice shell, qualitatively consistent with Enceladus's observed ice thickness distribution."

We find that forced precipitation trends are generally consistent across models, while atmospheric internal variability significantly influences regional patterns. Additionally, a few model members can reasonably well reproduce the observed pattern of precipitation trends. We highlight some regional wetting and drying are likely driven by forcings rather than the atmospheric internal variability.

The Arbitrary Linear Plasma Solver (ALPS) is a tool for calculating such responses through numerical integration of arbitrary gyrotropic VDFs, rather than using analytical models, for example bi‐Maxwellians, for the VDF. We consider dispersion relations for beam‐driven instabilities, proton‐cyclotron waves, and kinetic Alfven waves, derived using example VDFs from Parker Solar Probe/SPANi measurements during Encounters 22 and 23. The same kinds of waves are supported, but non‐Maxwellian structures drive significant changes in the amount of energy absorbed by the charged particles or released into the waves, altering expected heating rates from these waves in the inner heliosphere."

However, existing understanding of this process remains limited. For example, most current deposition models assume complete deposition or describe the collection process through empirical models, making it difficult to accurately predict the concentration distribution of dust particles within the near‐surface collection layer. In this study, the effects of turbulence around obstacles are considered to improve an existing numerical model for simulating aerosol particle deposition in rough surface environments. The modified numerical model is validated through wind tunnel experiments. Subsequently, the particle collection process on an isolated cylindrical obstacle placed on the ground is investigated using numerical simulations. The effects of different wind conditions, particle properties, and obstacle sizes on the collection process are analyzed. Finally, a fitted relationship between the Stokes number and collection efficiency is proposed. The results show that inertial impaction and interception jointly dominate particle deposition on the windward side of the isolated obstacle, while turbulence‐induced impaction governs deposition on the leeward side. Therefore, parameters that affect particle inertia and the turbulent flow around the obstacle have a more significant impact on the particle deposition process. The simulation results agree well with existing experimental data and exhibit lower data dispersion, demonstrating that the numerical model developed in this study can effectively describe the collection of particles by near‐surface obstacles. This provides a solid basis for improving atmospheric particle deposition models."

Jacobson,Impacts of Transport Uncertainty on CO2 Over North America: Insights From Assessments of Two Global Models With Aircraft and Tower Measurements,"Accurate representation of CO2 transport is important for reliable flux inversions with global inversion systems. Previous studies have revealed systematic discrepancies between two widely used global transport models, GEOS‐Chem and TM5, in simulated CO2 distributions at mid‐latitudes. However, the causes of these discrepancies and potential transport biases in the models remain unclear without constraints of intensive measurements. Here, we drive GEOS‐Chem and TM5 with identical surface CO2 fluxes and perform simulations with and without parameterized convection. By comparing the simulated spatial‐temporal distributions of [CO2] to intensive aircraft and tower measurements collected by the Atmospheric Carbon Transport (ACT)‐America project and NOAA's airborne profiling and tower networks across four seasons, we identify potential transport biases in both models over North America. Model discrepancies in vertical transport produce seasonal‐mean planetary boundary layer (PBL)–free‐troposphere [CO2] differences of up to ∼4 ppm and PBL height differences of ∼100–400 m. In summer, GEOS‐Chem underestimates transport through moist convection but overestimates PBL mixing depth, whereas TM5 exhibits more realistic total vertical mixing (moist convection and PBL depth). In spring and winter, TM5 underestimates PBL mixing while potentially overestimating mixing through moist convection, whereas GEOS‐Chem more accurately represents vertical mixing. These transport biases are likely to contribute to discrepancies in the meridional gradient of zonal‐mean [CO2] and propagate into differences in posterior flux estimates from the OCO‐2 Model Intercomparison Project inversions using the two transport models over North America. Expanded vertically resolved [CO2] measurements beyond North America can further advance the current understanding of transport uncertainties at larger spatial scales."

The Indian Ocean dipole (IOD) and El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) govern regional droughts, floods, and heat waves. While IOD and ENSO typically synchronize (e.g., positive IOD with El Niño), several positive IODs (pIODs) occur independently or even cooccur with La Niña—events that defy conventional modes and trigger mismatches in forecasts. Current theories predominantly attribute this phase mismatch phenomenon to internal forcing within the Indian Ocean, lacking robust identification of external forcing mechanisms—a critical gap that undermines the reliability of predictive frameworks. Here, we show that active western North Pacific (WNP) tropical cyclones (TCs) induce maritime continent subsidence, triggering anomalous easterly winds and sea surface cooling in the eastern tropical Indian Ocean, thus generating independent pIODs. Our findings identify a critical external forcing mechanism for the ENSO‐IOD phase discrepancy, filling a pivotal knowledge gap in current theoretical frameworks. By quantifying TCs' role as synoptic‐scale triggers of interannual extremes, we provide a basis for disaster agencies to integrate real‐time TC activity into early warning systems."

Reflectance transects through clouds are compared between Inner Mongolia and Tropical Ocean. The reflectance shows varying degrees of shadowing–illumination effects, depending on transect direction. Perpendicular to the solar azimuth (cross‐sun direction), where shadowing–illumination effects are minimal, the reflectance follows a symmetric, bell‐shaped decrease from the cloud center to the cloud edge and into the transition zone or radiative halo. The peak reflectance is located slightly off‐center for larger clouds, which can be explained by the competition between radiative smoothing and sharpening. Reflectance steadily increases with cloud size in both regions; however, Inner Mongolia clouds are significantly brighter and have larger cloud top height variations for the same chord length (cloud diameter). The size and height of continental clouds also systematically increase with surface temperature, indicating more vigorous convection over warm, dry land characterized by high Bowen ratio. In the halo region, reflectance increases by 20%–25% above its clear‐sky value within one chord length of the cloud edge, the brightness enhancement showing little variation with cloud size. The chord‐length normalized size of the halo steadily decreases with cloud size, as the absolute halo size does not scale linearly with cloud size. This observation, consistent with large‐eddy simulations of the moist buffer around shallow cumulus, suggests that the processes responsible for halo formation have size‐independent length scales."

A comprehensive evaluation over a 27‐day period (23 August –18 September 2015) is performed to quantify the PBLH Observation minus Forecast bias and Root Mean Square Deviation across data types. Although radiosonde, GNSS‐RO, and GRWP PBLH are assessed using consistent model definitions, lidar‐based PBLH is compared using inconsistent ones due to current model limitations. The results underscore the importance of using physically and instrumentally consistent model PBLH with corresponding PBLH observations. They further demonstrate that robust quality control and thinning procedures tailored to each observation type are critical, particularly when model definition and PBLH observations are inconsistent. The results also highlight notable discrepancies among two space‐based lidar PBLH data sets, especially over the ocean, which the implementation of corresponding lidar‐based model PBLH and advanced PBLH retrieval algorithms are expected to reduce. The developed framework enables a robust evaluation of current and future PBLH data sets and serves as a foundation for an effective assimilation strategy."

 Elevated methane concentrations are observed in the shallow water column above subsea permafrost on the East Siberian Arctic Shelf, including the inner Laptev Sea. The subsea source of this methane is poorly understood, yet crucial for predicting future methane emissions. Here, we combine analyses of dissolved methane concentrations, triple-isotopic fingerprinting, and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo statistics to constrain the source of high-concentration methane sampled during four expeditions, 2016-2020. In contrast to earlier findings of predominantly thermogenic methane release in the outer Laptev Sea, our results for the major methane release region of the inner Laptev Sea suggest that old microbial methane (radiocarbon age >48000 y BP) is being released from preformed methane pools stored within the subsea permafrost system. This observation reveals that several sources contribute to the elevated methane on the shelf and thus the necessity to consider a diversity of sources when estimating future methane release trajectories.

 The propagation speed of internal waves is a fundamental parameter for understanding their physical mechanisms, dynamic behavior, and environmental impact. However, traditional estimation methods are typically based on numerical simulations or sparse in-situ observations, which limit their accuracy and scalability, and results in a significant scarcity of available phase speed datasets. To overcome these challenges, we propose a physics-informed and data-driven model for estimating internal wave phase speed from satellite imagery. The proposed model incorporates three key innovations: (1) the integration of theoretical equations (KdV, BO, and eKdV equations) as physical constraints to ensure consistency with real-world ocean dynamics; (2) the adoption of an adaptive ensemble learning framework that fuses data-driven and physical-informed features to improve model robustness and prediction accuracy; and (3) the introduction of a transfer learning strategy to mitigate discrepancies between theoretical predictions and observational real-world internal wave results. Experimental results demonstrate that the model achieves superior performance across varying water depths, with an average RMSE of 0.04 m/s, MRE of 2.5%, and R2 of 98.8% on the testing set. Additionally, the model was applied to the South China Sea, revealing a distinct propagation pattern: average phase speed initially increased (from 2.427 m/s to 2.53 m/s), then decreased (to 1.464 m/s), and subsequently increased again (to 1.703 m/s) as internal waves propagated westward across the Dongsha Islands and Hainan Island. The model was further validated on a global scale, achieving an average percentage error of 4.95%, confirming its scalability and generalization capability. This study presents an efficient and automated approach for accurately retrieving internal wave phase speed."

 Quad-polarimetric (quad-pol) synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data provides crucial polarimetric information for post-disaster building damage assessment. However, most current spaceborne SAR platforms prioritize dual-polarization (dual-pol) mode, which ensures high temporal and spatial data availability but limits damage analysis accuracy due to the absence of some polarimetric information. Existing methods for reconstructing dual-pol to quad-pol SAR data often fail to ensure that the reconstructed data meets fundamental physical properties, while traditional building damage detection methods still struggle to accurately capture complex depolarization effects. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a diffusion model-based method for reconstructing dual-pol data to quad-pol data, applied to post-earthquake building damage analysis. The method introduces a Positive Semi-definite Constraint Module and a Plug-and-Play SVD Parameter Fine-tuning Module to ensure the physical validity and accuracy of the reconstructed data. Additionally, a Stokes vector-based Degree of Polarization frequency analysis method is proposed to enhance the description of depolarization information. A multi-dimensional polarimetric feature combination is constructed for grid-level building damage assessment. Experiments on Gaofen-3, ALOS-2/PALSAR-2, and Sentinel-1 data show that the proposed method performs optimally in complex scenarios, with all pixels meeting the positive semi-definite constraint. Compared to the original dual-pol SAR data, building damage assessment using the reconstructed quad-pol SAR data resulted in an F1 score improvement of 16.3% and 8.4% for detecting moderately and severely damaged buildings, respectively. This research provides crucial technical support for fully harnessing the potential of dual-pol SAR data in building damage assessment."

 The Earth is experiencing continuous anthropogenic and natural changes. Very high resolution (VHR) remote sensing imagery-based change detection provides an effective means to monitor these dynamics at fine spatial scales. Although deep learning has significantly advanced supervised change detection (CD), it heavily relies on large amounts of human-labeled samples. In real-world CD application scenarios, acquiring sufficient change samples is challenging due to the labor-intensive nature of pixel-level labeling. This challenge has motivated the development of unsupervised change detection (UCD). However, existing UCD methods still struggle in complex scenes with bi-temporal domain shifts caused by different imaging conditions. This is largely due to the absence of high-quality samples needed to guide CD-oriented optimization. To address this challenge, we propose DreamCD, a change-label-free framework that synthesizes change samples for UCD. DreamCD consists of: (1) a weakly conditional semantic diffusion model trained with pseudo-semantic masks, (2) a Content-Semantic-Style synthesis strategy that synthesizes realistic pre- and post-event image pairs of the application domain, and (3) an arbitrary contemporal deep change detector trained solely on synthetic samples. We further introduce LsSCD-Ex, a large-scale semantic change detection (SCD) dataset consistent with OpenEarthMap semantics, enabling evaluation of synthetic-sample-based SCD. Experiments on the SECOND and LsSCD-Ex datasets demonstrate that DreamCD achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) UCD performance, improving the average F1 score by 14.01% over existing methods for binary CD and outperforming the SOTA unsupervised SCD model, Changen2, by 2.15% in F1 and 3.63% in separated kappa coefficient (SCD metric). These results suggest that DreamCD provides a promising and extensible solution for CD in real-world remote sensing applications.

 The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) and El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) are important sources of interannual predictability in the tropical oceans. While the IOD and ENSO can exert significant impacts on global temperature and precipitation, their influence on near-surface wind speed (NSWS) in the Asian monsoon region remains unclear. This study explores how IOD and ENSO synergistically affect the NSWS variability over South and East Asia in autumn, a season characterized by peak IOD intensity and rapidly developing ENSO. The results indicate that IOD predominantly influences the NSWS variations in the tropical Indian Ocean and northern China, while ENSO has a stronger effect over southern China. Concurrent positive IOD and El Niño events generate high-pressure anomalies over the Bay of Bengal and the western Pacific, which induce easterly anomalies over the equatorial Indian Ocean and southwesterly anomalies over southern China, leading to significant NSWS reductions in both areas. In contrast, negative IOD and La Niña events produce low-pressure anomalies over the tropical oceans, resulting in an enhanced NSWS over the equatorial Indian Ocean and southern China. Furthermore, positive IOD events are suggested to weaken the NSWS in northern China by triggering northeastward-propagating Rossby waves, which induce barotropic anticyclonic circulation anomalies over northeastern China and southeasterly wind anomalies over northern China, causing declined NSWS in this area. These findings advance our understanding of the interannual variability in the NSWS across Asian monsoon region, providing valuable insights for interannual predictions of the regional wind climate and the renewable wind energy."

 Droughts are among society's most damaging climatic disasters, representing a complex phenomenon in which precipitation plays a central role. In poorly gauged regions, precipitation estimates from remote sensing have been widely employed. However, these data often exhibit bias and may not accurately depict the spatiotemporal variability of the rainfall processes. To address these problems, this study aims to propose a novel prediction model to enhance the reliability of rainfall estimates in poorly gauged regions by utilizing a Bayesian approach to blend multiple Satellite Precipitation Estimates (SPEs). CHIRPSv2, IMERG V06, and CMORPH were the selected SPEs for building the blending model, which was applied to estimate monthly rainfall data in the Doce River catchment and the mid-lower portion of the São Francisco River catchment, both in Brazil. Comparative analyses between rainfall gauging data and the SPEs, as well as the blending model, unveiled the enhanced performance of the new precipitation estimates, demonstrating consistently lower values for RMSE, NRMSE, and PBIAS in both study areas. We also assessed the ability of the SPEs and the blending model to capture drought conditions across different aggregation scales of the Standardized Precipitation Index (1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months). Regarding the number of drought months and magnitudes accurately identified, the blending model consistently achieved better performance from SPI-1 to SPI-9, but was outperformed at SPI-12 by different SPEs. Overall, despite its increased complexity, this approach can be effective for drought characterization in regions with sparse monitoring and further hydrological applications on a monthly scale."

Here, we combine environmental DNA metabarcoding, visual surveys, flow cytometry, and environmental measurements to examine the spatiotemporal dynamics of marine metazoans, protists, and prokaryotes across estuarine, transitional, and oceanic habitats in Hong Kong’s urbanized coastal waters. Using permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA), we demonstrate that environmental control over community composition weakens systematically at higher trophic levels. The variance explained by seasonal and spatial interaction was highest for prokaryotes (R2 = 0.76) and protists (0.59), but notably lower for benthic fauna (0.41) and bony fish (0.32). Co-occurrence network analysis revealed that oceanic habitats, dominated by heterotrophic prokaryotes, omnivorous fish, and hard corals, supported the most complex and stable multitrophic networks, with an average complexity of 0.54 compared to estuarine (0.23) and transitional habitats (0.29). Structural equation modeling further revealed habitat-specific drivers: temperature exerted the strongest direct effect in estuarine habitats (>0.44), while biotic interactions involving primary producers played a dominant role in oceanic habitats (direct effect >0.28). In contrast, transitional habitats lacked significant environmental or biotic drivers, indicating a system in flux where community dynamics are likely governed by complex variables beyond standard environmental or biotic regulation. These findings demonstrate the gradient-dependent interplay of environmental filtering and biotic regulation in shaping coastal ecosystem stability. Our results also highlight the value of an integrated eDNA-based framework for monitoring biodiversity and ecosystem change, providing insights for the management of urban marine environments under global change."

The identified sources included not only expected inputs such as agricultural activities but also a suite of previously obscured pathways, revealing contributions from consumer plastic packaging, long-range atmospheric deposition, and informal waste disposal. Critically, the model also decoupled distinct industrial processes by differentiating primary manufacturing emissions from secondary pollution caused by the degradation of industrial additives. These results prove that incorporating spatial constraints is a powerful strategy for resolving source ambiguity in heterogeneous media. The SC-PMF model thus offers significant methodological advancement for accurately tracing contaminant pathways and informing targeted pollution management."

Linden,Native Nitrate in Wastewater Enhances 222 nm UV Advanced Oxidation of Micropollutants,"222 nm irradiation, emitted from krypton chloride excimer (KrCl*) lamps, of waters containing nitrate has previously been demonstrated to lead to de facto advanced oxidation, due to the high absorbance and hydroxyl radical quantum yield of nitrate at 222 nm. Because nitrate is widespread in environmental waters, including nitrified wastewaters and wastewater-impacted surface water, this raises the possibility of UV advanced oxidation, which harnesses in situ nitrate for radical generation when KrCl* lamps are used as the UV source. In turn, this process is effective directly in wastewater effluent without the addition of chemicals. In this study, we compare UV222 treatment, without the addition of an external radical promoter, to UV254 with 10 mg/L hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) for the removal of 1,4-dioxane in three effluent waters containing nitrate at 2.1–8.9 mg-N/L. UV222 leads to 2.8–3.9 faster 1,4-dioxane degradation, on an incident fluence basis, resulting in an electrical consumption that is within 0.89–1.3 times that of UV254/H2O2, despite low-pressure mercury vapor lamps having at least 3.5× higher electrical efficiency than KrCl* lamps. When the cost of hydrogen peroxide dosing and quenching is considered, UV222 treatment leads to a projected cost savings of 12.4–21.8% compared to UV254/H2O2. Furthermore, despite the low UV transmittance (UVT) of these effluent waters at 222 nm (<30% UVT), UV222 treatment still leads to 1.5–3.2 times faster removal of NDMA compared to UV254, on an incident fluence basis, due to the enhanced photolysis of NDMA at 222 nm. Lastly, modeling results indicate that other reactive species generated by UV222 photolysis, such as CO3•– and NO2•, can contribute significantly to the degradation of micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and consumer products."

The January 2025 Palisades and Eaton Fires in Los Angeles County caused elevated levels of PM2.5 in the downwind cities. This study leverages a high-resolution network of crowdsourced PurpleAir sensors to evaluate indoor and outdoor PM2.5 levels before, during, and after the wildfire smoke events. We matched indoor–outdoor sensors and analyzed disparities in smoke exposure across communities with different CalEnviroScreen (CES) vulnerability scores, ventilation types, and home values. Results indicate that outdoor PM2.5 increased substantially during smoke days, with the highest CES-burdened communities experiencing the greatest ambient concentrations. Indoor PM2.5 also increased across all neighborhoods but indoor/outdoor (I/O) ratios declined during the smoke period, indicating partial indoor protection and likely occupant behavior changes. Infiltrated PM2.5 increased during the smoke period and varied across the CES groups. Building attributes showed limited predictive power. These findings highlight the interplay between behavioral actions and neighborhood factors in shaping wildfire smoke exposure and underscore the need for targeted interventions to improve indoor air quality in vulnerable communities."

However, their generation mechanism and environmental drivers remain poorly understood. Analysis of Van Allen Probes data reveals that low‐frequency chorus waves predominantly occur in the region of MLT range of 0–7 hr and L ∼ 6. These waves show a strong correlation with intense substorm activity and moderate magnetic storms, with the majority of waves clustering during storm‐time substorms. Their excitation mechanism is driven by the coexistence of isotropic low‐energy electrons (below 30 keV) and anisotropic high‐energy electrons (above 50 keV) during the storm's peak, along with concurrent geomagnetic field weakening due to enhanced ring currents."

This idealized framework provides a controlled climate background for isolating factors that govern predictability. Results show that storm intensity is less predictable than trajectory. Strong baroclinicity accelerates storm intensification and reduces its predictability, consistent with theory. Crucially, enhanced jet meanders further degrade forecast skill, revealing a synoptic source of uncertainty. Quantitatively, jet meandering over the storm center and eastern regions is associated with a doubling of the predicted uncertainty sensitivity in storm growth to the jet structure.

However, comparing convective structures across TCs is challenging because fixed‐radius metrics cannot adapt to TC size variations. We introduce the Outer‐to‐Inner Brightness‐temperature Ratio (TBR), a size‐adaptive metric quantifying the relative convective strength between the inner and outer region. Analysis of Northwest Pacific TCs (2001–2017) reveals TBR is strongly correlated with intensity (r ≈ 0.6), significantly higher than correlations considering only the inner (r = −0.34) or outer region convection (r = 0.24). TBR is also strongly linked to intensification, with the frequency of rapid intensification peaking within a narrow high‐TBR window (1.15–1.20). Furthermore, for the intensification stage, sustaining a high‐TBR state—a strong inner convection and quiescent outer region—is crucial for achieving a higher lifetime maximum intensity, a process linked to more efficient inward angular momentum transport. TBR provides a powerful tool linking size‐adaptive convection features to TC intensity and evolution."

While the ocean absorbs most excess heat, the atmosphere contributes only 1%–2% to the long‐term mean of EEI. However, our analysis of observational data demonstrates that variations in the atmosphere's energy content play a much larger role in interannual variations of EEI, especially in recent years. Including atmospheric energy uptake substantially improves agreement between observed variations in global net radiative flux at top‐of‐atmosphere (TOA) and ocean heat uptake interannually over 2005–2024. It also reconciles a delay between variability of these two quantities, with oceanic storage variability leading net TOA flux anomalies by ∼2 months. The phase shift can be explained by the atmosphere's important role in buffering and redistributing energy during El Niño – Southern Oscillation. The ability to robustly diagnose these relationships is owing to continuous efforts to monitor and improve estimates of the different EEI components."

Using four decades (1984–2023) of visibility‐based observational records, we examine regional and seasonal trends in dust storm frequency across the Sahel and the Sahara, capturing their distinct dust dynamics. Results reveal a significant decline in dust activity in both regions, most pronounced during pre‐monsoon (MAM) and monsoon (JJA) seasons in the Sahel, and during post‐monsoon (SON) and dry season (DJF) in the Sahara. Integrating surface observations with local meteorology (precipitation, surface wind speed, vegetation) and climate indices (AMO, NAO, MEI), we find the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) as the primary driver, with region‐specific effects: in the Sahel, AMO‐driven warming and rainfall increase vegetation, suppressing dust; in the Sahara, AMO intensifies the Saharan Heat Low (SHL) and elevates temperatures, modulating dust through atmospheric stability and wind patterns. Local meteorology further differentiates responses, with precipitation and Leaf Area Index (LAI) dominating dust variability in the Sahel, while SHL strength and surface winds are most influential in the Sahara. By explicitly separating the Sahel and Sahara and integrating multiple drivers, this study provides a more spatially resolved understanding of dust–climate link and suggests continued declines in North African dust storm activity under future warming. These findings offer critical constraints for improving dust emission projections in climate models."

In this study we run a large set of subseasonal hindcasts over 2004–2023 to evaluate two ML weather forecast models at the S2S time scale, SFNO‐HENS (Nvidia, fully ML) and NeuralGCM (Google Research, hybrid). Corresponding hindcasts from the European Centre for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) are used as a baseline for comparison to a physics‐based model. Because our focus is on predicting moisture transport over the Western United States between October and March, we evaluate the models' prediction skill for the Madden‐Julian Oscillation (MJO) and its associated teleconnections in the North Pacific. We find that both ML models are competitive with the ECWMF model, with comparable skill in predicting the North Pacific large‐scale circulation and the MJO at week 3 and beyond. Even though overall the mid‐latitude subseasonal prediction skill remains low, the ML models exhibit interesting behavior such as a realistic propagation of the MJO across the Maritime Continent and realistic teleconnections. A SFNO‐HENS sensitivity experiment with altered initial conditions in the tropics demonstrates the stability of the model, and it illustrates the capability of ML models to represent important physical processes of the atmosphere at the S2S time scale."

Here, simulations of Arctic mixed‐phase clouds by the Simple Cloud‐Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model (SCREAM) are assessed against large‐eddy simulations, satellite data, and ground‐based observations during the Cold‐Air Outbreaks in the Marine Boundary Layer Experiment field campaign. SCREAM simulates nearly completely frozen clouds, which is attributed largely to the unreasonably strong Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen (WBF) process that converts liquid to ice excessively and partly to the early over‐abundant ice production at cold temperatures from a temperature‐deterministic deposition ice nucleation scheme. Assuming no subgrid variation for the WBF process in the original formulation particularly conflicts with the instantaneous saturation adjustment assumption in the condensation scheme that assumes subgrid variability, leading to exaggerated WBF process rates. A proposed simple physically‐based improvement on the treatment of subgrid cloud overlap substantially increases supercooled liquid water content and notably improves cloud‐top phase partitioning, aligning better with observations. Improvement of supercooled liquid water content also converges with increasing horizontal resolution. The deposition ice nucleation scheme is found responsible for a falsely‐produced ice cloud aloft that is not observed, biasing the simulated cloud radiative effects and top‐of‐atmosphere radiative fluxes. This study identifies key deficiencies in cloud parameterizations that continue to challenge convection‐permitting models."

This study investigates the drivers of elevated H2O2 concentrations during autumn in Beijing using comprehensive field observations from October to November 2021. The averaged H2O2 concentration in the urban boundary layer of Beijing is 0.26 ± 0.03 ppb, peaking at 16:00.

The result showed the significant contributions of temperature (T) and photochemical processes to H2O2 production, while identifying key inhibitors such as nitrogen monoxide (NO). Additionally, we explore the role of H2O2 in sulfate formation during haze pollution episodes, finding that although H2O2‐mediated oxidation contributes to sulfate production, it is not the dominant pathway during the campaign. These findings underscore the complex interplay between meteorological factors, trace gases, and multiphase reactions in regulating H2O2 concentrations and cycling, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of atmospheric oxidation processes and offer guidance for mitigating air quality issues in urban boundary layer."

Human activities have been confirmed to contribute to the increased occurrence of droughts; however, the dependence of these impacts on the durations of drought, and whether they differ between drylands and humid regions, remains insufficiently understood. This study investigates the human influence on droughts of different durations using the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI), derived from multi‐source observations and four sets of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) multi‐model simulations. The results show that human activities cause an intensification of long‐term droughts, particularly in drylands. This is primarily attributed to rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, with both GHGs and aerosols exerting stronger impacts on droughts in drylands than in humid regions, though aerosols partly offset the intensifying effect. GHGs contribute to more extreme multi‐year droughts over drylands by amplifying temperature‐induced water demand, whereas aerosols reduce drought occurrence in drylands by enhancing precipitation, in contrast to their precipitation‐suppressing effects in humid areas in the past decades."

By means of machine learning models (Random Forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Long Short‐Term Memory (LSTM)) we identified dewpoint temperature, total evaporation, and human modification as dominant predictors of vegetation change, while soil water content and latent heat flux exhibited region‐specific impacts. Results indicate that 35.1% of grasslands remained stable, 32.1% improved, and 32.7% degraded, with degradation hotspots identified in the Tibetan Plateau, Ethiopian Highlands, Rocky Mountains, and Andes, while the Middle Eastern Mountain Ranges showed signs of improvement. Future projections using a hybrid XGBoost–LSTM model indicate limited global‐scale vegetation shifts by 2050 across SSP1‐2.6, SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5 scenarios. However, regional differences are notable: the Tibetan Plateau shows a substantial increase in vegetation cover, while the Andes, Rocky Mountains, and parts of East Africa exhibit slight changes.

Here, the authors show that even out-of plane symmetric metasurfaces can emit circularly polarized light, achieved by tuning an anisotropic continuum rather than breaking symmetry. 
 Manipulating emission polarization is crucial for advanced applications such as polarized fluorescence and lasing, thermal radiation control, stereochemistry and spintronics. Existing approaches for generating circularly polarized emission primarily rely on nanostructures with true chirality, where the far-field polarization at the Γ point is believed to require out-of-plane symmetry breaking. This raises a question: can an intrinsically achiral metasurface that preserves out-of-plane symmetry generate chiral emission? Here, we introduce the concept of anisotropic continuum, defined as a continuum state exhibiting distinct responses for orthogonal polarizations of incidence, as a new degree of freedom for intrinsically achiral metasurfaces. In such metasurfaces, chiral emission arises from manipulating the anisotropic continuum together with the metasurface’s in-plane perturbations. Degrees of circular polarization of 0.83 for upward emission and −0.9 for downward emission are achieved experimentally by integrating the fabricated silicon metasurface with fluorescent organic dyes. Our findings not only address a long-standing gap in the understanding of structural chirality, but also open new opportunities for high-performance applications in polarized fluorescence and thermal emission. Chiral light emission usually requires twisted or asymmetric nanostructures. Here, the authors show that even out-of plane symmetric metasurfaces can emit circularly polarized light, achieved by tuning an anisotropic continuum rather than breaking symmetry."

 Computer models are indispensable tools for understanding the Earth system. While high-resolution operational models have achieved many successes, they exhibit persistent biases, particularly in simulating extreme events and statistical distributions. In contrast, coarse-grained idealized models isolate fundamental processes and can be precisely calibrated to excel in characterizing specific dynamical and statistical features. However, different models remain siloed by disciplinary boundaries. By leveraging the complementary strengths of models of varying complexity, we develop an explainable AI framework for Earth system emulators. It bridges the model hierarchy through a reconfigured latent data assimilation technique, uniquely suited to exploit the sparse output from the idealized models. The resulting bridging model inherits the high resolution and comprehensive variables of operational models while achieving global accuracy enhancements through targeted improvements from idealized models. Crucially, the mechanism of AI provides a clear rationale for these advancements, moving beyond black-box correction to physically insightful understanding in a computationally efficient framework that enables effective physics-assisted digital twins and uncertainty quantification. We demonstrate its power by significantly correcting biases in CMIP6 simulations of El Niño spatiotemporal patterns, leveraging statistically accurate idealized models.

 Global heavy metal(loid) (HM) pollution in soils threatens food security and human health, yet HM mobility—governed by chemical fractions—remains poorly understood at large scales. Here we develop an eXtreme Gradient Boosting model for classifying soil HM dominant fractions using a globally compiled dataset of 9489 field observations. We show that organic carbon and pH positively affect high-mobility of HMs in soil. Using mercury as a case study, we identify both known and previously unreported high-mobility hotspots. The global map indicates that mercury has high mobility across 17.85% of global regions. Combining population and cropland distribution maps with model predictions shows that an estimated 15.1 million people and 100.9 million hectares of farmland are situated in high-mobility regions, with Asia being disproportionately impacted.

 Microvibrations degrade the geometric quality of optical Earth observation satellite imagery by introducing intra-scene spatial distortions, necessitating robust detection and compensation strategies. Like many optical Earth observation satellites, the Sustainable Development Goals Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1) faces similar challenges. To address this, this paper presented a novel microvibration detection and compensation framework based on line-by-line bundle adjustment for SDGSAT-1. By minimizing directionally weighted residuals of a modified rigorous imaging model—constructed from tie points (TPs) and virtual ground control points—the framework enabled high-temporal-resolution estimation of microvibrations, parameterized through the discrete attitude microvibration model, via least-squares optimization. A new sensitivity indicator was also proposed to evaluate the adequacy of the weighting scheme for microvibration detection during optimization and to guide the dynamic adjustment of TP weights. Applied to SDGSAT-1 data, the method successfully characterized microvibrations at 1.0 Hz in the along-track direction and 0.4 Hz in the cross-track direction for the first time. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed framework effectively suppressed microvibration-induced geometric distortions, consistently outperforming both raw imagery and classical approaches: it achieved a 33.16% reduction in RMSE compared to uncorrected data and improved cross-track precision by 27.82% over the conventional method. The impact of charge-coupled devices operating at heterogeneous imaging speeds was evaluated, with results showing no significant degradation in detection performance. These results validated the framework's effectiveness in enhancing geometric accuracy through robust microvibration modeling and compensation."

 Remote sensing (RS) soil moisture (SM) retrievals are frequently assimilated into land surface models (LSMs) to enhance their overall performance. However, uncertainty in LSM parameterization limits the capacity of current models to accurately capture the coupling strengths between SM and hydrological fluxes. This limitation reduces the effectiveness of SM data assimilation (DA) in improving estimates of key fluxes such as evapotranspiration (ET) and streamflow. Here, we introduce an improved SM DA framework with the optimization of LSM coupling strengths between SM and fluxes. Specifically, the SM DA framework is developed based on the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model. The model first calibrates the SM-ET and SM-runoff coupling strengths using RS data to enhance its physical consistency and representation of land surface processes. Subsequently, RS SM retrievals are assimilated into the calibrated VIC model using the Ensemble Kalman Filter to improve ET and streamflow simulations. Results indicate that the developed SM DA framework enhances DA efficiency, with SM correlation increasing from 0.45 to 0.49. It also enhances hydrological flux simulations, increasing ET correlation from 0.77 to 0.80 and improving the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency for streamflow from 0.21 to 0.71, relative to the default VIC scheme. These improvements are especially evident in (sub-)humid regions, where the VIC model's runoff generation mechanism – based on saturation-excess processes – is well suited to representing local hydrological processes. Overall, the calibration of coupling strengths within LSMs offers a promising pathway to enhance hydrological fluxes simulation through land DA."

 Recent and upcoming carbon satellites, such as the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-3 (OCO-3) and the Copernicus Anthropogenic Carbon Dioxide Monitoring Mission (CO2M), offer unprecedented opportunities for top-down estimation of urban CO2 emissions. Their observations, i.e., 80×80 km2 Snapshot Area Map (SAM) for OCO-3 and 250 km wide swath for CO2M, enable the detection of urban emissions in a single pass. However, accurately identifying urban plumes remains challenging due to their broad spatial extent, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial data gaps in quality-filtered XCO2 snapshots. To address these challenges, we propose a Transformer-based deep learning (DL) model for XCO2 interpolation and plume detection. Our approach uses masked pre-training on synthetic CO2M data to learn spatial dependencies and emission-related structures of XCO2 values before fine-tuning for plume detection tasks. Experimental results on synthetic datasets show that the model reconstructs XCO2 with mean absolute errors below the instrumental noise and achieves stable plume detection performance across noise levels. It improves XCO2 gap-filling accuracy especially under regional and swath-missing conditions and significantly outperforms test- and wind-based methods in plume region segmentation accuracy. We further validated the model using 110 SAMs from 39 cities observed by OCO-3, integrating it into a lightweight inversion workflow. The resulting top-down emission estimates show improved consistency with bottom-up inventories compared to baselines (R2 = 0.61, total relative deviation = −0.10), and the city-level aggregation reproduces the bottom-up emission rankings with a Pearson’s r of 0.90. These results confirm the transferability and practical utility of our approach across global cities. This study presents a promising approach for reconstructing and detecting urban emission signals from XCO2 snapshots, demonstrating clear potential to support the next-generation carbon monitoring satellites."

 Accurate Surface Soil Moisture (SSM) with high spatiotemporal resolution is essential for hydrological modeling and agricultural applications. The Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) provides quasi-global SSM with relatively high temporal resolution, while its coarse spatial resolution limits regional usability. This study proposed a novel approach to generate daily continuous quasi-global SSM at 500-m resolution by integrating CYGNSS observations with optical imagery, without relying on in-situ SSM inputs. The method includes: (1) reconstruction of daily Surface Reflectivity (SR) using the Previously-Observed Behavior Interpolation (POBI) algorithm and retrieval of 9-km SSM via a modified Reflectivity-Vegetation-Roughness (R-V-R) model; (2) constructing a direct relationship between SSM and optical reflectance using the enhanced OPtical TRApezoid Model (OPTRAM) as the foundational basis for subsequent downscaling process; (3) downscale coarse-resolution CYGNSS SSM using the Bayesian algorithm without requiring any in-situ SSM observations as inputs. The framework is applied over August 2019–2022 and validated against in-situ SSM from 194 International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) sites across diverse climate and land cover conditions. Results show improved spatial detail while maintaining accuracy, with a mean unbiased root-mean-square error (ubRMSE) of 0.061 cm3/cm3 and a positive GDOWN value of 0.017, indicating effective SSM downscaling. In addition, the proposed method outperforms both Linear and Random Forest models while maintaining robust performance. Overall, it offers a scalable solution for generating high-resolution, daily SSM products directly from satellite data."

 Remote sensing image change detection is critical for monitoring earth surface dynamics. Although deep learning has significantly improved change detection performance, traditional and existing deep super-resolution techniques for cross-resolution change detection often assume bi-temporal images share the same resolution, at least in the training phase. They also suffer from limitations including dependency on expensive high-resolution paired training data, suboptimal performance transfer from super-resolution to change detection accuracy, and heavy reliance on extensive pixel-level annotations. To address these limitations, we propose a novel dual pixel-level and subpatch-level network with cross-temporal super resolution (DPSNet) for change detection across spatial resolutions. Our method DPSNet, comprises two core components: 1) a Reference Image-Guided Generative Adversarial Network (RefIGM GAN) for cross-temporal super resolution; and 2) a Semi-supervised Dual-Path Network (SDNet) for pixel-level and subpatch-level change detection. A resource-efficient alternating optimization strategy is employed between RefIGM GAN and SDNet, creating a virtuous cycle in which super-resolution improves detection accuracy, and detection results optimize super-resolution reconstruction. Experiments were conducted on three datasets, i.e., CDD, SYSU, and HTCD, each characterized by distinct resolution variations. The CDD and SYSU datasets include bi-temporal images with 4 × and 8 × resolution differences, respectively, while the HTCD dataset contains both satellite and UAV imagery with inherent resolution disparities. The results demonstrate that by integrating reference-guided super resolution and semi-supervised learning, effective cross-resolution change detection can be achieved with only limited high-resolution data and pixel-level labels, showing great practical significance in scenarios where solely low-resolution historical images are available.

 Accurate in-season crop yield prediction is important for farm management, insurance planning, and food security decision making. Many studies have proposed different models and data sources, but their findings are difficult to compare because they focus on different crops, regions, spatial scales, prediction months, and evaluation metrics. This review presents a structured synthesis of in-season crop yield prediction studies and to identify key gaps that limit early and reliable prediction. We conducted a systematic literature review following a defined protocol. We searched multiple databases using targeted search strings, and screened studies using clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible studies focused on corn, soybean, or winter wheat, were published between 2014 and 2025, and predicted crop yield during the growing season. Review papers were excluded. This process identified 170 studies, of which 55 were retained for detailed analysis. For each selected study, we extracted information on modeling approach, input data sources, prediction lead time, spatial scale, and reported evaluation metrics. We synthesized results across three main model types, machine learning models, process-based crop models, and statistical models. This review addresses five research questions: (1) What modeling approaches are most commonly used for in-season crop yield prediction, and how do their predictive performances compare? (2) What input data sources and feature types are most frequently used, and how do they influence prediction accuracy? (3) What prediction lead times are most commonly used for major crops, and how does lead time affect model performance? (4) What are the main challenges and limitations in current in-season crop yield prediction studies? (5) What methodological and data-driven strategies can improve future in-season crop yield predictions? The reviewed literature shows that no single approach consistently outperforms others across all conditions. Model performance depends strongly on data quality, crop type, and regional conditions, with common limitations related to data gaps, cloud contamination in satellite imagery, and limited model interpretability."

 Multi-category synthetic aperture radar (SAR) ship detection is limited by heterogeneity in imaging mechanisms and severe class imbalance, yielding accurate localization but frequent misclassification. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Knowledge Fusion and Imbalance-Aware Network (KFIA-Net). Specifically, we first propose a Domain Knowledge Feature Extraction (DKFE) to extract and encode knowledge tokens from four priors. Second, a Knowledge Cross-Attention Fusion (KCAF) module is designed to perform interpretable and sparsely selectable channel modulation using cross-attention and FiLM decoding. Thirdly, we further design an Imbalance-Aware Loss Function (IALF) that combines prior calibration, minority category margin expansion, and knowledge-consistency weighting to reduce loss bias. Finally, systematic experiments and comparisons are conducted on three datasets: SRSDD-v1.0, FAIR-CSAR-v1.0, and NUDT-SARship-v1.0.

 Land subsidence is a growing geohazard that poses a significant threat to critical infrastructure, particularly in urban coastal cities. This study uses Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data from 2016 to 2024 to estimate angular distortion rates to assess infrastructure damage risk in New York City. We applied a probabilistic framework to evaluate multiple “what-if” scenarios and project long-term risks, providing actionable insights for resilience and mitigation planning. Results reveal persistent subsidence in low-elevation and reclaimed zones (∼-5 mm/yr) with localized uplift (∼+1.5 mm/yr), affecting major airports, subway segments, and highways. Fifty-year projections indicate high angular distortion probabilities (0.6–0.8), with economic exposure estimated at ∼$8.20 billion for ∼ 6.1 km of subway lines and ∼$10.54 billion for ∼ 7.8 km of highways exceeding –2 mm/yr. Despite their limited spatial extent, these segments represent a disproportionately large share of total exposure.

 Domestic cooking is a key contributor to poor indoor air quality (IAQ) and one of the most significant indoor sources of particulate matter, including ultrafine particles (UFPs). Since cooking forms an essential part of domestic life, cost-effective active abatement strategies are necessary to improve IAQ. Increasing the ventilation rate by natural or mechanical means will reduce cooking related UFP concentrations but can lead to domestic heat loss: this represents an IAQ and energy efficiency dichotomy. In this study a specialist test facility is used to explore this dichotomy during short-duration cooking activities replicated under different ventilation scenarios, both related to natural and mechanical ventilation in the kitchen, and the relationship between ventilation and airflow around the home more generally. We relate our results to the recently introduced World Health Organization (WHO) good practice statement on UFPs to determine good IAQ. Energy penalties associated with heat loss are calculated to determine which combinations of behavioural and technological interventions can best balance the competing demands of good IAQ and energy efficiency. It was seen that IAQ benefits were achieved at little detriment to energy efficiency. For natural ventilation, behavioural interventions such as opening windows for 20 min yielded significant IAQ benefits, reducing UFPs from peak values by 86 %. Similarly, 20 min of mechanical extract ventilation operation yielded IAQ benefits, reducing UFPs from peak values by 94 %. However, in all ventilation scenarios UFPs remained above the WHO good practice high threshold for ∼1 h. All mechanical extract ventilation scenarios resulted in lower energy penalties than for natural ventilation. Our experiments also show that airflow within the house is important to consider when looking at the IAQ and energy efficiency dichotomy. Whilst results are primarily concerned with managing IAQ and energy efficiency under domestic cooking scenarios, there are wider implications for balancing IAQ and energy efficiency, which have increasing importance in light of management of the COVID-19 and energy crises and future policy, such as the Future Homes Standard."

 There is a body of evidence on the risk to human health posed by the exposure to desert dust. However, results from epidemiological studies from different regions are inconsistent. Among possible causes of inconsistency is the scarcity of daily desert dust contributions to PM10 and PM2.5 levels recorded in populated areas in order to conduct rigorous epidemiological studies, but also the lack of robust and harmonized methodologies to deliver airborne desert-dust concentrations. This study evaluated the performance of the main statistical methods currently used by European countries to estimate the net load of desert dust on PM10 and PM2.5 levels during the occurrence of desert dust outbreaks. To this end, long-term data series (2010–2023) on PM10 and PM2.5 levels and composition obtained in a regional background (Montseny) and an urban background (Barcelona) monitoring site, in Northeast Spain, were used. The results identify the most appropriate method for determining the regional daily PM10 background concentration, excluding dust-days. This involves applying a moving 50th percentile with a 30-day time window to data from nearby regional background environments. Such PM10 background is essential for calculating the daily net dust contribution (PM10 net-dust). However, applying this procedure to data from urban or industrial environments causes an overestimation of PM10 net-dust values, which intensifies with higher local PM10 levels. On the other hand, in the case of low PM10 net-dust values(<3 μg m−3) the relative errors are so high that it is not advisable to use these estimates of natural PM contributions to assess compliance with air quality standards. For PM2.5, however, the mineral dust content is much lower than for PM10. Consequently, applying the same methodology results in significantly greater relative errors in the PM2.5 net-dust estimates. In this case, it is also advisable to use PM2.5 data series obtained in regional background environments. However, if nearby regional background data is not available, the method can be applied directly to the evaluated urban or industrial datasets, but excluding traffic and industrial hotspots for the calculation of the PMnet-dust. In conclusion, accurately quantifying PMnet-dust is a complex issue, and it is necessary to continue improving current methods and developing new methods that allow for the most accurate estimation possible of daily desert dust contributions, especially for the low concentration ranges and for finer PM size fractions. The methodologies reported here are applicable to all regions affected by desert dust."

 Aerosols, one of the principal atmospheric pollutants, are receiving significant attention from the scientific community due to their impact on human health and climate. Despite the carcinogenicity of PAHs, the contributions of their sources to the urban atmosphere remain unclear. The present study examines the molecular distribution and source indices of various non-polar organic compounds, including n-alkanes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), hopanes, and steranes, in PM10 samples collected in Daejeon, South Korea, from 15 April to 22 May 2013 using the thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (TD-GC/MS). The molecular distribution of n-alkanes was characterized by the predominance of C29, followed by C27. The total concentrations of n-alkanes exhibited strong positive correlations with elemental carbon (EC) and potassium ion (K+), indicating a significant contribution from fossil fuel combustion and biomass-burning sources. Among the PAHs, indeno[1,2,3-cd]pyrene (IcdP) and dibenzo[a,h]anthracene (DahA) were the most prevalent compounds. The dominant hopanoid hydrocarbon was 17a(H),21b(H)-hopane (30ab), while 17b(H),21a(H)-hopane (30ba) was least abundant. During the sampling period, sterane compounds exhibited a higher concentration of C27 compared to C29. Based on the diagnostic ratios and source-specific markers, the present study revealed that coal combustion, biomass burning, and vehicular emissions were predominant sources of PAHs during spring. Positive matrix factorisation (PMF) analysis showed that in Daejeon, total PAHs were mainly from biomass and coal combustion (74%), followed by vehicle emissions (14%) and natural gas combustion (12%). Further, an inverse relationship has been found between PAH concentrations and air temperature; i.e., higher levels of PAHs correspond to lower temperatures, which could have significant implications for air quality and public health. The findings of this study offer valuable insights into the sources of organic compounds, which are highly carcinogenic, and can inform policymakers in developing effective air quality monitoring and mitigation strategies."

 This study evaluates the performance and associated uncertainties in Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model-simulated drop size distribution (DSD) using three microphysics schemes—Thompson aerosol-aware (Thompson), WDM6, and Morrison—across 138 rainfall events in eastern and southern China. Ground-based disdrometer observations were used to assess model performance under varying rain rates, precipitation types, and regional climates. Unlike prior single-event evaluations, this multi-station, multi-scheme analysis provides a comprehensive assessment of model biases and spread in key precipitation relationships, including the normalized intercept parameter versus mass-weighted mean diameter (log10Nw–Dm), Dm versus rain rate (Dm–R), radar reflectivity versus rain rate (Z–R), and rainfall kinetic energy density versus rain rate (KEv–R). Results show that WRF simulations exhibited systematic overestimations of Dm and underestimations of log10Nw, which propagated to biases in Z and KEv, with deviations up to 25% and 50%, respectively, under high rain rates. Among the schemes, Morrison outperformed other schemes for stratiform rain, while Thompson better captured convective events. Regional variability further modulated performance: Changchun's frontal systems and Xiamen's maritime climate induced distinct microphysical biases. These findings offer novel insights into microphysics scheme behavior and its cascading impacts on radar-based rainfall retrievals and hydrological modeling. The results highlight the need for integrating observational datasets and applying region-specific calibrations to improve DSD simulations in data-scarce regions."

Previously, these currents have been explained as being caused by magnetospheric drivers. Here, we identify an alternative source for the currents, showing that the antisunward electric field could originate within Saturn's upper atmosphere. Because Saturn's auroral region is offset toward midnight, this also offsets sub‐corotating ions from Saturn's rotational pole, creating a differential flow with the surrounding thermosphere, with ions super‐rotating relative to the neutral atmosphere near noon and sub‐rotating relative to the neutral atmosphere near midnight. These ion motions generate antisunward ionospheric Pedersen currents that close via antisunward magnetospheric currents. The location of our sketch ion flows match with past measurements of magnetospheric ion flows, confirming the atmosphere as a potential driver, and suggesting the antisunward currents cannot explain Saturn's secondary midnight auroral arc."

A sounding‐to‐image variational autoencoder reproduces the diurnal circulation with one‐third the mean square error (MSE) of previous architectures. Jacobian‐based sensitivity analysis quantifies the influence of each sounding element: the model depends primarily on wind speed near 560 m, lower‐level wind direction, and time of day when estimating winds at 100 m, confirming physically consistent learning. The lean input also enables a transformer‐based architecture, which further reduces MSE and improves generalization, especially in rugged mountain.

However, anomalous dawn‐side SCs of opposite polarity were recently reported during the 10 May 2024, superstorm [Nilam et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.1029/2025GL117032]. This study examines SC responses to positive and negative pressure discontinuities on the May 10 and October 10 storms under similar storm phases and local times. Both events consistently revealed anomalous dawn‐side low latitude SCs opposite to those at other longitudes. We suggest the main impulse of the Disturbance Polar (DP) field extending equatorward as the most likely source. Under highly compressed background magnetosphere conditions, field‐aligned currents associated with DP fields can shift to lower L‐shells, producing such anomalous SCs at dawn‐side low latitudes. These findings provide new insights into dawn‐side magnetosphere–ionosphere coupling during intense storms."

Numerical modeling and satellite observations were used to examine the atmospheric and oceanic conditions leading to this extreme event. Sensitivity experiments show that warm SST anomalies enhanced moisture supply and intensified convection, producing larger and more intense convective storms. The warmer SSTs increased both moisture availability and storm intensity. The sensitivity model runs show higher precipitable water across much of the domain in the week preceding 16 April. Results indicate that, while atmospheric dynamics played a key role, SST‐driven moisture was the primary driver of the 16 April heavy precipitation. These findings underscore the role of ocean‐atmosphere interactions in driving extreme weather in arid regions."

However, the physical coupling between EEJ and Sq westward currents on the polar side of the vortex focus remains poorly understood. Here, we present observational evidence that there are significant correlations between EEJ variability and Sq westward currents variability in both morning and afternoon sectors, with correlation coefficients of −0.87 during March in the afternoon and −0.67 during May in the morning, respectively. The seasonal variations of the correlations exhibit a morning‐afternoon asymmetry. Specifically, the correlations in the afternoon are stronger during the hemispheric summer season, whereas in the morning correlations show a slightly semiannual variation that are stronger approximately during the equinoxes.

We compared stability between monoculture RB and diverse tropical rainforests (RF) using 37 years of satellite‐derived gross primary productivity across three metrics: long‐term temporal stability, resilience, and resistance to climate anomalies. Despite intensive management driving growth in RB, RF remained superior long‐term temporal stability and resilience, particularly at higher latitudes, likely reflecting their biodiversity and structural complexity. RB exhibited stronger resistance to temperature anomalies through intensive management but lower water resistance. Systematic trade‐offs emerged among stability dimensions, with environmental gradients modulating these differences, temperature amplified disparities while precipitation reduced them. These findings indicate that ongoing conversion of RF to RB threatens regional ecosystem stability, especially in marginal areas, underscoring the importance of forests conservation and sustainable plantation management."

Understanding historical trends in emissions and atmospheric concentrations is crucial for quantifying their impact. The first measurements of atmospheric CFCs were performed in‐situ by Lovelock in 1970. We have analyzed historical 1951 solar absorption infrared spectra, recorded at Jungfraujoch, to retrieve the CFC–12 $\text{CFC}\text{\mbox{--}}\,12$ surface mole fraction. We compare to routine solar absorption measurements starting at Jungfraujoch in 1986 and emission‐based forward models.

However, the impacts of precipitation characteristics on wet deposition SO42−, NO3− and NH4+ and its hysteresis to precursor emission controls remain inadequately quantified. Multiyear (2010–2024) rainwater chemistry, air pollutants, and meteorological parameters were monitored in Wuhan. Random forest models were applied to weather‐normalized sulfur and nitrogen wet deposition. Trend analysis using the normalized data revealed that 1‐unit reduction in precursor emissions declined 0.14–0.48‐unit sulfur and nitrogen wet deposition. This hysteresis was driven partly by enhanced wet scavenging associated with increased light rain frequency, as the scavenging ratios of atmospheric sulfur and nitrogen compounds increased by 1.9%–10.5% yr−1 from 2016 (2019) to 2024. Light rain with a rate ≤16.5, 17.3, and 6.8 mm d−1 most strongly influenced wet deposition trends of NH4+, NO3−, and SO42−, respectively, identified by the SHapley Additive exPlanations approach. The light rain frequency rose by 2.6%–3.7% yr−1 during 2010–2024, annually adding 0.036 kg N ha−1 yr−1 to nitrogen deposition since 2010 and 0.003 kg S ha−1 yr−1 to sulfur deposition since 2014.

Due to the approximate spectral invariance of scattering by clouds, this combination of measurements is sensitive to the mean number of scattering events experienced by visible radiation. Using a hierarchy of synthetic cloud fields ranging from idealized cloud geometries, stochastically generated cloud fields with idealized microphysics, and those produced by Large Eddy Simulations (LES), we demonstrate that the combination of visible reflectance and the mean number of scattering events skillfully predicts the in‐cloud mean of the optical depth at both 8 and 1 km resolution, with coefficients of determination exceeding 0.92 and 0.86, respectively. Further out‐of‐sample testing on LES cloud fields show that a multi‐linear regression trained on stochastically generated cloud fields reduces the relative root‐mean‐square error from 29% under the plane‐parallel homogeneous assumption to less than 14% at 6 km resolution. Biases in 1 km resolution retrievals of trade cumulus are reduced from −74% to −40%. Uncertainties from instrumentation and atmospheric correction add up to 20% additional uncertainty in cloud optical depth for the LES cloud fields. With this method, the PACE mission can provide the first global estimate of cloud optical depth that accounts for cloud heterogeneity."

The re‐initialization approach is used to constrain the background fields under the same parameterizations. The features analyzed here include mean spatial distribution, diurnal cycle, and evolution of every precipitation event. At coarser resolutions, MPAS‐A misrepresents precipitation duration, with excessive rainfall persistence due to overly strong instability and weak intensity. Finer resolutions (especially 3 km) markedly improve sub‐daily precipitation over the TP by resolving event durations, reducing the drizzle‐like overestimation of long‐duration rainfall at 60 km. These gains stem from sharper capture of onset‐time forcing peaks (surface heating and moisture convergence) and faster instability removal, together with a weaker, non‐linear dependence on moisture convergence and an enhanced representation of cessation. Overall, ∼10 km yields robust improvements with fewer artifacts, while 3 km offers the strongest sub‐daily benefits but demands additional high‐resolution observations for validation."

Between dark winter in late February/early March to completely sunlit conditions in May the δ13C of many organic acids increased: (a) oxalic acid (C2) from −23‰ to −5‰, (b) malonic acid (C3, a precursor of C2) from −28‰ to −17‰, and (c) glyoxylic acid (ωC2, −18‰ to −10‰), also a precursor of C2. In contrast, glyoxal, another precursor of oxalic acid and succinic acid, showed a wide variation from dark to light and no clear seasonal trend. Concentrations of C2, ωC2 and C3 declined when their δ13C increased in April to May. The enrichment of 13C occurred during the preferential breaking of 12C–12C over 12C–13C bond in oxalic and other acids as solar radiation increased during polar sunrise. Photochemically driven variations in the isotopic enrichment of 13C of C2 and related compounds that are a minor fraction of aerosol total carbon (TC), nevertheless they are the main source of variation in the δ13C values of TC during polar sunrise in the Arctic because the weakness of 12C–12C bond compared to 12C–13C bond is more pronounced for carboxylic acids than other species contributing to TC. This study on 13C signature of these species allows to gain information on their poorly known atmospheric budget in spite of the fact that they are ubiquitous in the atmosphere."

Currently, ethanolamine (MEA) is recognized as the most promising atmospheric organic amine for promoting the formation of MSA‐based clusters. Given the complexity of multi‐component aerosol nucleation mechanisms, it is essential to explore the potential of other gaseous substances participating in the MSA‐MEA‐driven NPF. Formic acid (FA), the most abundant organic acid in both the atmospheric gas phase and particulate phase, warrants urgent investigation regarding its potential role in aerosol nucleation. Herein, we investigate the enhancement potential of FA on MSA‐MEA‐driven NPF within the troposphere. The results indicate that the enhancing effect of FA emerges in the lower troposphere (T ≤ 278.15 K) when [FA] ≥ 1010 cm−3. The enhancement strength, RFA, increases with decreasing temperature and increasing FA concentration, reaching a factor of up to 21.54 at 258.15 K, and is most significant in regions with high MEA emissions. At 258.15 K, when [FA] ≥ 1011 cm−3, FA can directly promote the MSA‐MEA‐FA growth pathway, rather than merely acting as a catalyst for the MSA‐MEA pathway. Consequently, the ternary MSA‐MEA‐FA nucleation mechanism may play a crucial role in the NPF processes in cities with severe Industrial pollution, forested areas, industrial zones rich in volatile compounds, cold oceans, and polar regions."

The first mode exhibits a monopole pattern characterized by coherent AR enhancement, associated with a low‐level anomalous anticyclone and an intensified western North Pacific subtropical high (WNPSH). The anomalous anticyclone is maintained by the meridional wave train induced from the western tropical Pacific under the anomalous Indo‐West Pacific Walker circulation triggered by the negative sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) over the southern Indian Ocean (IO), which is closely linked to the IO Basin mode. The second mode presents a zonal dipole pattern featured by opposite AR anomalies, corresponding to a pair of low‐level anomalous cyclonic and anticyclonic circulations and the northeastward WNPSH retreat. The dipole circulation is mainly sustained by the meridional wave train excited from the Maritime Continent (MC) when cold tropical eastern Pacific SSTAs and warm MC SSTAs generate an anomalous Pacific Walker circulation, accompanied by the combined effect of a wave train from the mid‐latitudes. The second mode is significantly modulated by the Pacific Decadal Oscillation. Particularly, the dominant EA AR mode varied from the monopole to dipole modes around 1977/1978 due to changes in oceanic forcing from the Indian to the Pacific Ocean, leading to a shift in EA AR frequency from an increasing trend to a relatively stable state."

While precipitation has traditionally been considered the dominant driver, recent studies suggest an increasing influence of evaporative demand. However, it remains uncertain whether these findings represent individual regional cases or a boarder emerging global trend. To address this, we developed a systematic framework using a standardized precipitation evapotranspiration index (SPEI) variant experiment to attribute drought drivers across 292 major global basins. Our historical analysis (1970–2024) reveals a widespread global transition: 48.1% of the global basin area (6.43 × 107 km2) transitioned from precipitation‐dominated to evaporative demand‐dominated drought. This transition, accelerating after 2000, originated in arid continental interiors and expanded outwards, leaving precipitation‐dominated areas only one‐tenth the size of evaporative demand‐dominated ones. Future projections from bias‐corrected coupled model intercomparison project phase 6 models indicate this transition is largely irreversible, as over 80% of historically transitioned basins are projected to maintain evaporative demand‐dominated through 2100. Basins that have not yet transitioned are also projected to transition toward either evaporative demand‐dominated or precipitation and evaporative demand co‐dominated drought states. Under the shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP) 5‐8.5 scenario, the global area of evaporative demand‐dominated droughts is projected to be 17.6% larger by 2100 than under SSP1‐2.6 scenario. These findings highlight the urgent need for both climate mitigation to slow these transitions and proactive adaptation to address the new reality of drought driven by evaporative demand."

 Detecting solid waste dumps (SWDs) is crucial for a sustainable environment and public health. Deep learning methods have demonstrated significant potential in detecting SWDs from high-spatial resolution remote sensing images (RSIs). However, training a SWD detection model necessitates annotated data that encompasses diverse geographical distributions and styles. Following the conventional approach of manually labeling data prior to model training is both costly and time-consuming. In this study, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework for the detection of SWDs. An initial model is trained using public datasets of Dumpsites, solid waste aerial detection (SWAD), and AerialWaste to identify potential samples from extensive unlabeled RSIs, which are then validated by experts for data expansion and model reinforcement. Specifically, multi-view inference is introduced to enhance the applicability of the model for real-world SWD detection tasks by integrating inference results from multiple style-transformed images. Moreover, we utilize adaptive thresholds that are dynamically calculated from inference results in each round to select potential SWDs, all while maintaining a low computational cost. With the proposed framework, we construct the LHRS-SWD dataset for SWD detection, derived from a random sampling of over 70 countries and encompassing 3,377 SWDs. The effectiveness of our framework is validated through experiments on LHRS-SWD, with a 20.26% improvement in AP50 versus initial iteration."

 Accurate mapping of salt pond systems is crucial for coastal resource management and ecological conservation. However, existing spectral indices for salt pond detection are mostly derived empirically, limiting their ability to differentiate pond subtypes or generalize across diverse coastal environments. This study proposes a big data-driven framework for constructing novel spectral indices that enhance the fine-scale classification of salt ponds in the Bohai Rim region of China. By systematically generating and screening over 390,000 candidate indices derived from Sentinel-2 bands, four new indices were identified to effectively discriminate salt pond subtypes: the Non-Water Body Detection Index (NWBDI), Crystallization Pond Index (CPI), Red-Green Concentration Pond Index (RGCPI), and Evaporation Pond Discrimination Index (EPDI). To rigorously evaluate their performance, three Random Forest configurations were compared, including a baseline model with original spectral bands, an expert-index-enhanced model, and a model incorporating the proposed novel indices. Across the Bohai Rim region, the model with proposed new indices achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 81.14%, demonstrating clear advantages over both original spectral bands (OA of 72.93%) and expert-index approaches (OA of 76.64%). The resulting fine-scale map revealed a total salt pond area of 2,214.33 km2 in 2020 across the Bohai Rim, consistent with national statistics. Beyond improving classification accuracy, the data-driven index discovery revealed physically meaningful spectral relationships linked to salinity gradients and hydro-biogeochemical properties, marking a methodological shift from expert-driven hypothesis testing to automated, data-driven feature discovery. This study demonstrates that the data-driven approach can provide a transferable solution for constructing task-specific spectral indices and advancing large-scale environmental monitoring."

 This study leverages the multi-year and multi-seasonal airborne ACTIVATE dataset over the northwest Atlantic to determine the relative importance of sub- and supermicrometer nitrate concentrations in aerosol particles and factors influential for their 3-dimensional spatial distribution and seasonal differences. Simultaneously collected data with an Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (NO3,fine: <1 μm) and Particle-Into-Liquid Sampler (NO3,total: <5 μm) allowed for their difference (NO3,coarse) to be explored, representative of coarse nitrate. Seasonally, NO3,fine was most enhanced in winter months due to secondary ammonium nitrate formation coincident with favorable cold conditions. NO3,coarse was generally much higher in mass concentration than NO3,fine due to its association with coarse aerosol types, notably dust and sea salt. NO3,coarse was best correlated with non-sea salt calcium (i.e., dust) rather than sodium (i.e., sea salt), suggestive of how gaseous acids favor adsorption onto coarse surfaces that are alkaline. Consequently, NO3,coarse was higher farther offshore where air masses enriched with sea salt and dust were more prominent, whereas NO3,fine exhibited decreasing levels as a function of offshore distance (i.e., away from continental sources). These results emphasize the challenges of the vertical, spatial, and seasonal distribution of nitrate due to its varying formation pathways in fine and coarse modes."

Among the four model groups, NEX models achieve the highest skill in reproducing PRCPTOT over eastern China. However, CORDEX models outperform NEX models in simulating extreme precipitation events, with NEX models systematically underestimating extremes, indicating that dynamical downscaling is generally more effective than statistical downscaling for capturing extreme precipitation. Both CORDEX and NEX models successfully capture the timing and peak of the annual precipitation cycle over eastern China, despite notable inter-model discrepancies. These results provide a comprehensive reference for selecting appropriate models to project mean and extreme precipitation over eastern China."

We take advantage of long-duration balloon campaigns from 2019 and 2021 to assess errors in winds between 18 and 20 km in a weather forecast model. Large errors persist: one third of the time, the error is larger than 3.5 m per second. This has implications for research studies that calculate air mass trajectories in this transition region between the troposphere and the stratosphere. 
 Winds in the tropical lower stratosphere raise difficulties for numerical weather prediction models: without geostrophy, winds decouple from temperature and direct observations are scarce. The Strateole 2 project explores the tropical lower stratosphere using superpressure balloons that drift for up to three months between 18 and 21 km altitude. Wind is measured on all flights: eight in the first campaign (2019–2020) and seventeen in the second (2021–2022). These measurements are used to assess errors in the winds of the ERA5 reanalysis for latitudes between 18° S and 10° N. Two additional objectives of this study are to assess errors in modelled balloon trajectories, and to document the dispersion of air below the balloons, in order to facilitate the interpretation of observations made below the balloons. The comparison of measured and reanalyzed winds reveal significant errors, with standard deviations of 3.76 m s−1 for zonal and 3.24 m s−1 for meridional wind. Relative to a previous comparison in 2010, only a modest decrease of 20 % and 10 % is found. Trajectory calculations have very variable skill, with median errors after 24 h of 260 km, but a tenth of the errors larger than 600 km. Factors leading to large errors, such as  initial wind error and latitude are identified. Similarly, trajectory dispersion of air below the balloon is very variable, depending on the initial shear. The persistent errors highlight the need for regular obsevations of winds in the tropical lower stratosphere, and emphasize the need for caution when using trajectory calculations for process studies."

Multisatellite observations and reanalysis data are used to quantify land surface temperature responses to variability in aerosols and fire intensity. These responses display strong spatial heterogeneity, highlighting the interplay between fire, aerosol, and meteorological conditions. 
 The biophysical effects of agricultural residue burning, driven by the excessive release of energy and carbonaceous aerosols, remain poorly quantified at the global scale. Residue-based fires have the potential to modify regional climate by altering land surface temperature (LST), highlighting the need for investigation at regional scale. Here, an observation-driven assessment of spatial variations in LST due to concurrent release of energy and aerosols has been made over northwestern India using multiple satellite and reanalysis-based datasets. Year-specific fire pixel density was used to delineate an intensive fire zone characterized by medium-to-large residue-based fire. Geospatial analysis revealed positive association among FRP (fire radiative power), LST and AOD (aerosol optical depth). Over intensive fire zone, a space-for-time approach revealed significant increase in both ΔLST (0.57 °C; 95 % CI: 0.33–0.81 °C) and ΔAOD (0.13; 95 % CI: 0.08–0.17) due to fire. Random Forest non-linear model was employed to regress potential influence of FRP and AOD on LST having several other variables as confounding factors. FRP consistently emerged as the dominant predictor of LST, followed by planetary boundary layer height and aerosols. An increase in relative feature importance of FRP was noted during days having high fire intensity and positive association with LST. Geographically weighted regression further explained spatial heterogeneity in LST modulation by FRP.  Overall, this analysis provides the first empirical evidence that residue-based fire contributes to changes in land surface temperature. It further highlights that the magnitude of this perturbation is governed by interannual variations in fire intensity and influenced strongly by prevailing meteorological conditions."

 Recently introduced Columnar Vertical Profiles (CVPs) arrange polarimetric radar data collected via plan position indicator (PPI) scans in height vs. time format at a single location. A novel method for polarimetric radar data processing and visualization, path-CVP (pCVP), is introduced. It represents radar data in height vs. location format at the time of a completed radar volume scan. pCVP, an offspring of CVP, is a single-radar-volume time snapshot of the polarimetric radar data along an arbitrary or predefined path with high spatial resolution. Multiple examples from S-band WSR-88D radars in the NEXRAD network demonstrate the potential usage and advantages of the technique. Monitoring and quantifying instantaneous weather conditions with polarimetric radar along motorways, mountain overpasses, and aircraft paths during descent and ascent from the runway, as well as tornado location diagnostics, are potential benefits of the novel technique. However, the increasing distance from the radar and the size of the area used for CVP spatial averaging may need to be adjusted based on user needs."

 In April 2020, the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) Earth Resources Observation and Science (EROS) Center introduced a Level 2 provisional Aquatic Reflectance (AR) product for the Landsat 8 Operational Land Imager (OLI), marking the initial phase in developing a standardized global product for Landsat-derived surface water measurements. The goal of USGS EROS aquatic product research and development is to prepare for an operational processing architecture for Landsat Collection 3 in the late 2020s that will enable use of quality-controlled data for emerging Landsat aquatic science applications. To achieve this, we released a subset of the Landsat 8/9 provisional AR products (Crawford et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5066/P14MBBRM) and examined its general performance through the Science Algorithms to Operations (SATO) framework alongside quantitative assessment using community made inland water data records (GLObal Reflectance community dataset for Imaging and optical sensing of Aquatic environments, GLORIA) and radiometric coastal validation platforms (NASA's Ocean Color component of the Aerosol Robotic Network, AERONET-OC). Variability within the validation datasets indicate that the performance of the Landsat 8/9 provisional AR retrieval is highly context-dependent; errors are minimal in optically simple waters (e.g., clear to moderately turbid coastal waters) but increase considerably in optically complex waters where factors such as elevated levels of turbidity, chlorophyll (Chl a) concentrations, or colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM) dominate the water column. Additionally, this paper examines key algorithmic considerations for atmospheric correction, highlighting factors that influence accuracy, scalability, and computational efficiency necessary for collection processing in the operational Landsat Product Generation System (LPGS). This paper is intended to communicate with aquatic scientists, satellite oceanographers, and the broader Earth observation community on the origins, requirements, challenges, successes, and future objectives for operationalizing global AR data products for Landsat satellite missions."

The maps were created from a statistical combination of satellite altimetry, satellite gravimetry, and in situ Argo profiles of temperature/salinity to 2000 m depth. Data are mapped at long wavelengths to reduce contamination from mesoscale eddies. The data are intended for the study of sea level budgets and changes in ocean heat uptake. 
 Argo profiles of temperature/salinity (T/S) at specific times and locations from January 2003 through December 2023 are mapped into monthly maps of steric sea level (SSL), thermosteric sea level (TSL), and Ocean Heat Content (OHC) anomalies at long wavelengths (>1500 km) down to depths of 2000 m. The mapping uses a monthly satellite reference computed from the difference between satellite altimetry and gravimetry, so that in periods where there is not sufficient global Argo coverage (generally before 2007), the satellite estimate is used instead of a mean monthly climatology or zero, as other analysis centers use. Longwave mapping is done to reduce large errors introduced by poor sampling of mesoscale eddies by the Argo floats. We demonstrate that on global- and basin-scales, the longwave mapping does not substantially affect calculations of mean SSL, TSL, or OHC changes. Monthly standard error maps from the mapping are also provided. These maps are intended for users interested in understanding global- and basin-scale sea level budgets, as well as combining with deep ocean measurements to study ocean heat uptake.

Carracedo;Marta Álvarez;Herlé Mercier;Pascale Lherminier;Antón Velo,Two decades of pHT measurements along the  GO-SHIP A25 section in the North Atlantic,"Ocean acidification threatens marine ecosystems and the climate and is commonly assessed through ocean pH measurements. This study provides a new twenty-year dataset of pH measurements from the North Atlantic, derived from the correction and reevaluation of both historical and recent pH measurements affected by methodological bias. This revised dataset enables a more accurate reassessment of pH trends and carbon variables under novel and updated methodological standards. 
 The North Atlantic (NA) GO-SHIP (Global Ship-based Hydrographic Investigation Program) A25 OVIDE-BOCATS (Observatoire de la variabilité interannuele à décennale en Atlantique Nord – Biennial Observation of Carbon, Acidification, Transport and Sedimentation in the North Atlantic) section is a long-term repeat hydrographic transect extending from Portugal to Greenland. Since 2002, physical and biogeochemical measurements have been carried out biennially along the OVIDE-BOCATS section, contributing to a better understanding of water mass properties, mixing, circulation, carbon storage, and climate change impacts such as ocean acidification (OA) in the NA. In particular, the high-precision pH measurements on the total hydrogen ion scale (pHT) from the OVIDE-BOCATS program represent a key milestone in monitoring OA in this particularly climate sensitive region. The method used for pHT determination relies on adding meta-cresol purple (mCP) dye to the seawater sample and spectrophotometrically measuring its absorbances at specific wavelengths. The OVIDE-BOCATS program has used unpurified mCP dye, which impurities have been proven to bias pHT values. Here we quantified the bias induced by these impurities in pHT measurements. We found that measurements carried out using the unpurified mCP dye tend to be, on average, 0.011±0.002 pHT units higher than those obtained using the purified mCP dye, with this difference slightly decreasing at higher pHT values. Moreover, we tested independent methods to correct the effect of impurities in both the historical and recent OVIDE-BOCATS pHT data, demonstrating that the correction is consistent across methods. The long-term pHT dataset has been updated to include newly acquired data and absorbance measurements, and to standardize corrections for mCP dye impurities. This effort results in a twenty-year dataset of pHT corrected for mCP dye impurities, that demonstrates the possibility of a global effort to improve the reliability and coherency of spectrophotometric pHT measurements made with unpurified mCP dye. The corrections applied to our pHT dataset have negligible implications for the OA rates previously reported, but they do affect the depth of the aragonite saturation horizon, implying a shoaling of approximately 150 m. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17789895 (Pérez et al., 2025)."

 This article presents the next-generation of the Advanced Scatterometer (ASCAT) surface soil moisture (SSM) dataset, bringing the operational near real-time (NRT) product up to date with the historical offline data record. For years, the offline data record has benefited from successive algorithmic improvements while the NRT product has only received minor updates. This release now applies the latest soil moisture retrieval algorithm and consistent fixed-Earth grid to both data streams, creating a unified dataset and representing a major advancement for the ASCAT SSM NRT product. Furthermore, the standard 12.5 km sampling ASCAT SSM dataset is now complemented by a new high-resolution 6.25 km sampling ASCAT SSM product. This is achieved by customising the spatial resampling process of the ASCAT Level 1B full-resolution backscatter data. A new key development in the change detection algorithm for ASCAT SSM concerns the estimation of the dry and wet backscatter references. Specifically, a moving-window approach is now applied instead of the full time series to mitigate artificial trends caused by long-term land cover changes. Additionally, a new monthly subsurface scattering flag has been added to filter out unreliable SSM measurements where backscatter and soil moisture indicate an inverted relationship."

This dataset captures instantaneous mass changes and can reveal short-term dynamics that standard monthly data products do not provide. This enables prompt detection of rapid events such as flash droughts and floods and offers critical information to support improved monitoring of short-term water and mass variations. 
 We present the globally available dataset of Line-of-sight Gravity Differences (LGD) as a new data product to fill the long-standing gap of investigating sub-monthly surface mass change from the satellite gravimetry along-track perspective. The dataset is generated directly from Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Follow-on (GRACE-FO) Level-1B intersatellite ranging observations, positioned conceptually between Level-1B measurements and Level-2 monthly gravity field solutions. Provided as along-track time series, LGD delivers instantaneous, in situ gravity change at satellite altitude, thus ensuring the fidelity of measurements by avoiding the complex preprocessing, regularization, and filtering applied to monthly products. The LGD dataset enables monitoring of sub-monthly terrestrial water storage variability and provides accurate information on timing and magnitude of water mass changes. GRACE-FO’s ground track allows LGD retrievals every 5–6 days in most low and mid latitude regions, while the revisit interval becomes shorter toward higher latitudes. Our LGD data products also contain climatology in the form of along-track gravity variations. We demonstrate its potential through case studies, including along-track diagnosis of flash drought evolution in the southeastern United States and the characterization of sub-monthly hydrological extremes in global hotspots. Results show that the LGD dataset resolves the critical timing (onset, peak, and termination) of hydrological extremes, which is unattainable from monthly products. The LGD dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17766177 (Tang et al., 2025), which is expected to pave the way for advances in sub-monthly hydrological monitoring and can serve as a unique constraint for hydrological and geophysical models, opening new opportunities for Earth system sciences."

Both tracks produced early warnings, scientific consensus, and eventual multilateral environmental agreements (the Montreal Protocol and Stockholm Convention). In this Perspective, we synthesize the historical evidence, link it to the planetary-boundaries and limits-to-growth narratives, highlight why chemical regulation repeatedly failed to prevent widespread contamination, and propose a set of pragmatic policy instruments, including targeted premarket controls such as the application of the Safe and Sustainable by Design framework, class-based phase-outs to speed up the removal of hazardous substances from the market, and global burden sharing to better manage planetary-scale chemical problems."

During respiration, atmospheric aging of nanoparticles occurs first; nonetheless, the hazard of air-aged TMDCs and the effect of postbiotransformation in the microenvironment following inhalation remain unclear. By mimicking atmospheric conditions and respiratory media, we discovered that air-aged molybdenum disulfide (A-MoS2) and tungsten disulfide (A-WS2) underwent biotransformation in artificial nasal fluids and Gamble’s solution, increasing the hydrophobicity and roughness of the nanosheets. The oxidized products (31.7% in A-MoS2 and 44.5% in A-WS2) were partially converted to sulfidation-state species via thiol-mediated reduction. Both biotransformed and air-aged TMDCs were localized to macrophage lysosomes at approximate concentrations, whereas the lysosomal membrane damage and ferrous ion (Fe2+) release were more significant for biotransformed forms. Transcriptome and lipidomics analyses indicated that ferroprotein degradation and ferroportin1 inhibition also facilitated Fe2+ overload, along with glutathione peroxidase 4 inhibition, lipid acylation, and phospholipid biosynthesis activation, worsening lipid peroxidation (154.3–225.6%). Shapley Additive Explanations substantiated the reduction of oxidized species, 1T-phase stabilization, and increased hydrophobicity as major contributors to ferroptosis aggravation of biotransformed TMDCs.

However, the combined effects of NOx (NOx = NO2 + NO) and SO2 on SOA compositions under complex photochemical conditions remain mechanistically unresolved. Here, we investigated the individual roles of NO2/NO and their combined effects with SO2 on β-myrcene photooxidation. Our results showed that NO2 enhanced the SOA yield and the O:C ratio through oxidant amplification, whereas NO suppressed nucleation and oxidation states of products but facilitated particle size growth via organic nitrate partitioning. SO2 exhibited significant synergistic effects with both NO2 and NO, facilitating particle formation and growth processes. The newly built vacuum ultraviolet free electron laser photoionization aerosol mass spectrometer enabled the observation of a series of new compounds (i.e., organic peroxides, organic nitrate, and organosulfates) and identified new mechanisms of SOA formation. Notably, a novel compound with a molecular weight of 287 was characterized to be a nitrogen- and sulfur-containing species.

This study characterized chemical, particulate, and microbial emissions from small and big dogs. Big dogs emitted CO2, NH3, fungi, and bacteria at considerably higher rates than small dogs, whereas their emissions of 1–10 μm particles were similar. With ozone present, all dogs contributed to the formation of nanocluster aerosols (1–3 nm) and ozonized volatile organic compound (VOC) products, likely from human skin oil transfer through petting. With ozone present, nanocluster aerosols (1–3 nm) were observed during dog experiments, likely reflecting ozone reactions with human-derived skin lipids transferred onto dog fur. Relative to a seated adult, big dogs emitted less ozonized products, comparable CO2 and NH3, more >5 μm coarse particles (fewer 2–5 μm particles), 2–4× more bacteria and fungi, and showed compound-specific differences in VOCs: while some species exhibited a strongly elevated dog-to-human ratio (with one up to 15×), others were not pronounced when dogs were present.

We tested the hypothesis that the fluorinated polymers contained in top antireflective coatings (TARCs) can be transformed under oxidizing or reducing conditions to form PFASs measured in fab wastewater. Three TARCs were characterized using combustion ion chromatography and 19F and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to quantify total fluorine and characterize structural features of the fluorinated components. Transformation experiments were conducted under oxidizing and reducing conditions, and products were identified by means of 19F NMR, high-resolution mass spectrometry, and ion chromatography. Under oxidizing conditions, fluorinated components transformed to primarily produce perfluoroalkylcarboxylic acids (PFCAs) when the structure contained nonfluorinated carbon atoms. Under reducing conditions, more highly fluorinated polymers exhibited near-complete defluorination, whereas ultrashort side-chain fluorotelomer-based polymers were more resistant to transformation. Fluorine mass balances demonstrated that most fluorine was recovered as discovered transformation products or as unreacted fluorinated polymer under oxidizing and reducing conditions. These findings help explain the presence of PFCAs in fab wastewater and provide insights on structure-transformation relationships."

We analyze  a decade (2013–2023) of wintertime aerosol mass spectrometry data from urban Nanjing, eastern China, using a developed machine learning framework that disentangles anthropogenic emission-driven changes from meteorology-driven changes. The mean organic aerosol concentrations decreased from 24.6 to 16.5 μg m–3 during the period of 2013–2017. After accounting for meteorological influences, emission controls account for ∼94% of the observed decrease. However, the effectiveness of anthropogenic emission controls on the total organic aerosol was weakened by a factor of approximately 2–8 times in the subsequent emission control phases, particularly with more oxidized secondary organic aerosol showing a minimal further decrease. Machine learning-based attribution analysis reveals that reductions in fossil fuel combustion and traffic-related aromatic precursors explain, on average, ∼50–60% of the long-term variability in secondary organic aerosol, while the meteorological influence plays a minor role. These results provide observationally source-resolved evidence that current measures are reaching diminishing returns and that effective future controls must target overlooked precursors and secondary formation pathways."

Here, we monitored the air quality during the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games, held from July 28th to August 8th, 2022, with 323,000 spectators attending the athletics events, including during the opening and closing ceremonies at the (open air) Alexander Stadium in Birmingham, UK. Particulate (PM2.5 and PM10) concentrations in fan areas around the stadium peaked ahead of the athletics events and opening and closing ceremonies with PM2.5 concentrations up to 10 times higher than at nearby urban background monitoring stations. For a spectator attending a full day of events at Alexander Stadium, this would represent a 125% increase in their exposure to PM2.5 relative to the urban background. Nonrefractory particulate composition in these periods was dominated by organics. Four factors were identified from Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis of particle composition data recorded using a Quadrupole Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor (Q-ACSM): two representing cooking aerosol accounting for 71% of the total PM mass during the athletic sessions demonstrating that cooking sources were responsible for the majority of particulate pollution at the venue.

As the contributions of anthropogenic sources decrease and environmental stressors, such as wildfire, increase, forests are becoming increasingly important diffuse sources and sinks of atmospheric compounds. Indeed, forests impact several air quality programs, yet stressors are modifying these forest-compound interactions. To characterize how forests may impact current and future air quality, we reviewed studies on environmental stressors affecting forest interactions with key air pollutants regulated under the CAA. Long-term temperature trends and changes in precipitation, as well as disturbances such as wildfire, pest outbreaks and drought are among the stressors considered. Overall, increasing stressors on forests are generally worsening air quality. Indeed, the increase in wildfire is one of the main contributors to current declines in air quality. Other effects were bidirectional or there were information gaps, especially in predicting multistressor impacts. Forests are fundamental to life and environmental stressors are shifting their impact on air quality. As a result, it is imperative to understand the benefits and disbenefits of forests to better predict and manage future air quality."

A more comprehensive characterization of its chemical composition is needed for its management and health effects research. We improve estimates of total PM2.5 mass concentration and its chemical composition across North America by developing, optimizing, and applying convolutional neural networks (CNN) with information from satellite-, simulation-, and monitor-based sources to estimate the local bias in monthly geophysical a priori PM2.5 and component concentrations over 2000–2023. Significant long-term agreement is found with traditional 10-fold spatial cross-validation for total PM2.5 (R2 = 0.82), sulfate (R2 = 0.98), nitrate (R2 = 0.93), ammonium (R2 = 0.94), organic matter (R2 = 0.83), black carbon (R2 = 0.78), dust (R2 = 0.71), and seasalt (R2 = 0.37). We introduce Buffered Leave Isolated Sites and Clusters Out (BLISCO) spatial cross-validation to evaluate the model extrapolation ability over remote regions, and find that traditional spatial cross-validation may overestimate performance and underrepresent uncertainty due to the spatial autocorrelation of ground monitors. The use of geophysical information from a chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) significantly increases CNN performance in BLISCO cross-validation, for example, increasing R2 for NO3– (0.51 to 0.81) and NH4+ (0.27 to 0.67). We represent spatial uncertainty for PM2.5 and its components based on the statistical results of BLISCO cross-validation by integrating information from both the spatial distribution of ground observations and the variability in predictors space representation, and find that distance from monitor is a key predictor of uncertainty."

We find that some poorly predicted profiles nonetheless reproduce the original waveforms with high accuracy, indicating a nonuniqueness between atmospheric conditions and recorded waveforms. Unlike traditional physics‐based inversions that rely on array deployments, our ML model can analyze single‐channel data and, once trained, makes predictions within milliseconds. Given the performance on synthetic data, future tests should include real‐world data to further assess the benefits of ML‐based frameworks for infrasound analysis."

Based on reanalysis data and numerical experiments, this study investigates the potential influence of the summer northeastern Arctic Sea ice concentration (NEASIC) on the interannual variation of September CHDEs in the SC. Results demonstrate that positive NEASIC anomalies during summer trigger a quasi‐barotropic Rossby wave train, originating over the Greenland Sea, arching across the North Atlantic and the Mediterranean–Caspian region, and extending into East Asia. This wave dynamically drives a northward‐shifted and intensified East Asian subtropical jet and anomalous anticyclonic circulation over SC. The resulting subsidence induces moisture flux divergence, suppresses cloud cover, and enhances surface radiative forcing, explaining about 28.4% of the CHDEs variability per interquartile NEASIC increase. This mechanism enhances predictive frameworks for subtropical compound extremes, emphasizing the role of NEASIC in regional climate resilience strategies."

To investigate this, we applied Spectral Mixture Analysis to Landsat‐8 imagery using Google Earth Engine to quantify sediment coverage on ice from 2016 to 2025. We found that there was both spatial and temporal heterogeneity in surface sediment cover across Lake Fryxell, Lake Hoare, and Lake Bonney, with each lake showing consistent “hot spots” of sediment through time. Results show that higher surface sediment abundance was correlated with thinner lake ice across the study lakes. These findings show that small changes in ice surface reflectance exert a strong control on thickness independent of broader climatic conditions."

Both DL models generalize successfully to unseen climate conditions, broadly reproducing the frequency and spatial patterns of heatwave and coldwave events during 1900–1960 with skill comparable to HiRAM. An exception is over portions of North Asia and North America, where all models perform poorly during 1940–1960.

However, its direct and quantitative impact on controlling outer belt electron lifetimes has never been directly assessed. Using simultaneous observations of IBs from low‐altitude satellites and in situ electron fluxes from equatorial satellites, we report IBs intruding into the outer belt (reaching L ∼ 4.5), closely synchronized with sharp flux radial gradients near IBs, caused by significant electron loss outside IBs during a 4‐day storm recovery period. By combining observations with simulations, we provide the first direct and quantitative evidence that FLCS‐induced electron loss outside the IB dominantly controls the outer belt electron lifetimes. Our findings reveal that this simple yet fundamental physical process, which has been historically neglected in global radiation belt models, can explain the outer electron belt configuration."

Yet, such monitoring remains rare. We introduce an automated, globally applicable approach that detects and quantifies activation (erosion) and deactivation (vegetation colonization) by tracking multi‐year sustained AC directional shifts from Sentinel‐2 imagery. Applied to the Po River (Italy), this approach captures trajectories across different morphologies, distinguishing lateral mobility, widening, and narrowing from changes caused by stage‐dependent hydrological forcing. Results identify the exposed sediment‐to‐water ratio as a strong predictor of AC dynamicity, with sediment‐rich reaches showing greater instability and responsiveness to hydrological variations. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating sediment areas alongside the water channel improves understanding of river dynamics, with implications for river restoration and risk mitigation."

 Increased supply of the micronutrient iron promotes export production in the iron-limited Southern Ocean, thus acting as a dynamic sink of atmospheric CO2 that has amplified past climate variations. This mechanism is typically considered to be regulated by the amount and solubility of iron delivered by aeolian transport. Here we use sedimentological and geochemical tracers to investigate iron input and carbon uptake in the largest sector of the Southern Ocean Antarctic Zone. Our data show that millennial-scale variations in West Antarctic Ice Sheet dynamics controlled both the supply of particulate iron and lithogenic particle composition (affecting particle solubility) in the Pacific Antarctic Zone over the last 500,000 years. Rather than the total iron input, a higher abundance of chemically more pristine glaciomarine particles (high particle solubility) was critical for providing bioavailable iron, which enhanced export production. High lithogenic iron fluxes are characterized by chemically mature particles (low particle solubility), in particular during phases of pronounced ice loss in West Antarctica. The corresponding export production was low, indicating that this ‘ice-sheet–iron feedback’ is positive during these retreat phases. Accordingly, future West Antarctic Ice Sheet retreat is likely to decrease carbon uptake in the large Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean.

 The leaf-onset date is sensitive to climate warming. It is widely reported that the temperature sensitivity of the leaf-onset date (ST) of deciduous broadleaf forest (DBF) may decrease under dormancy-period warming. However, evidence of how boreal-DBF ST may generally change under dormancy-period warming is still lacking. Here, by analysing climate and satellite data, we find that, between 1982–1996 and 1998–2012, 74% of all 0.5° × 0.5° boreal-DBF-containing grid cells with a rise in boreal-DBF dormancy-period temperature exhibited an increase in boreal-DBF ST. We demonstrate that the observed general increase in boreal-DBF ST is largely attributable to a warming-related enhancement in dormancy-period chilling accumulation. Furthermore, we show that phenology models systematically underestimated the magnitude of the observed change in the mean boreal-DBF ST across all boreal-DBF-containing grid cells by a mean of 85%. This study has implications for improving phenology models and understanding the carbon cycle in boreal regions.

 Extreme heatwaves are intensifying under climate change, yet their prediction remains limited by inadequate representation of land–atmosphere (L–A) interactions. Most deep learning–based weather models rely solely on atmospheric variables, overlooking the influence of land surface conditions on heat extremes. Here, we present an L–A coupled prediction framework for Northern Hemisphere summer that incorporates multi-layer soil moisture (SM) and temperature into atmospheric forecasting. To better capture delayed land surface feedbacks, the model is trained with a multi-step loss. This approach improved the representation of L–A interactions across 1–7 day lead times. Using multi-step loss, the L–A coupled model achieved a 5.9–11.2% improvement in heatwave forecast accuracy relative to the atmosphere-only model, as measured by root mean squared error, whereas single-step loss achieved only 0.4–2.4% improvement. Skill gain was strongest at short leads (~ 3 day) when both SM and circulation predictability were high, and sustained through 7 days by L–A coupling driven by SM predictability. Case studies of recent heatwaves further demonstrated its ability to capture land surface drying and associated temperature extremes. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating L–A coupling with multi-step optimization for advancing data-driven heatwave prediction."

 Clouds significantly influence Earth’s radiative balance with complex changes in response to surface warming. The key drivers of the changes are the sea surface temperature (SST) pattern effect that reshapes cloud distributions, and the beta feedback that scales low-level fraction change to climatological amounts. Cloud radiative feedback remains the largest source of uncertainty in future climate projections, but current constraints are insufficient. Here, we demonstrate that the percentage change in tropical cloud fraction, driven by spatial patterns in SST increase, is linked to cloud height variations. We introduce a proportional warmer-get-higher paradigm and develop a pattern-based analytical framework, identifying three key factors governing cloud feedback: percentage cloud sensitivity to SST, climatological cloud cover, and SST warming patterns relative to the tropical mean. By leveraging recent observations to constrain these factors in two stages, we establish a process-oriented emergent constraint on projected cloud feedback in the 21st century. The first stage substitutes simulated cloud sensitivity and mean cloud cover to correct biases and reduce the spread by half. Then, the second stage attempts to further constrain the SST pattern effect, which explains 79% of the remaining spread in an attribution procedure. This percentage framework yields total, low, middle, and high cloud feedback of 0.49 ± 0.27, 0.33 ± 0.21, 0.09 ± 0.09, and 0.07 ± 0.06 W m-2 K-1 (90% confidence), respectively. It reduces intermodel uncertainty by 59% for cloud feedback and 33% for surface warming, resulting in a climate sensitivity of 4.08 ± 0.97 K."

 Fertilizer application has been recognized as the major driver of nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions in rivers. However, the intrinsic risk of N2O emissions in responding to nitrogen discharge (i.e., ratios between N2O emissions and dissolved inorganic nitrogen or fertilizer) may vary across rivers but remains unclear. Here we uncover the hidden yet substantial control of riverine N2O emissions by bedrock geology through field observations and global data analyses. We discover lower denitrification but higher N2O production rates in rivers with silicate-dominated bedrocks compared to those with carbonate-dominated bedrocks. On one hand, the larger sediment grain size found in the silicate-dominated rivers shortens porewater residence time for reaction, which diminishes the likelihood of complete denitrification (NO3−$$\to$$N2) but simultaneously increases the potential for N2O production through incomplete denitrification (NO3−$$\to$$N2O). Concurrently, lower sediment total organic carbon and water pH abate N2O reductase and enhance N2O production in silicate-dominated rivers. More importantly, the dissimilarities in N2O production due to bedrock geology are reflected in N₂O emissions risks. By developing a geological factor, we interpret the heterogeneous N2O emission risks in rivers globally. Hence, we highlight the geologically uneven urgency of improving fertilizer management to mitigate N2O emissions. Silicate-dominated rivers exhibit lower denitrification but higher N2O production than carbonate-dominated rivers due to coarser sediments, lower organic carbon, and reduced pH, according to global statistical analyses and field sampling in the Pearl River Basin."

 Mars almost certainly had a considerable amount of water in its past. Recent observations reveal that during southern summer, when the atmosphere is warmer and dustier, water vapor can reach high altitudes without condensing, leading to water loss to space. Here, by combining infrared, visible, and ultraviolet data from multiple Mars orbiters, we identify a new pathway for water loss, observed for the first time to our knowledge during the opposite season. Our findings show that a strong, localized, and short-lived dust storm in Martian Year 37 (August 2023) drove considerable vertical transport of water vapor in the northern summer season. Just days after the storm, enhanced water vapor concentrations were observed at altitudes over 40 km across northern high latitudes, followed by an increase in escaping hydrogen detected at the exobase. These results suggest that water loss on Mars can be triggered by strong local dust storms at any time of year. Observations compiled from several Mars observation missions suggest a significant but short-lived dust storm during the Northern hemisphere summer of Mars Year 37 drove substantial vertical transport of water vapor into the upper atmosphere."

 Atmospheric components are critical for maintaining the radiative balance of the Earth–atmosphere system.

The results show that under clear skies, the interannual variability of DR is highly consistent with that of aerosol optical depth (AOD) (r = 0.88), while under cloudy conditions DR is more closely associated with cloud properties such as cloud optical depth (COD) and cloud fraction (CF). Specifically, COD exhibits a positive correlation with DR under thin clouds but a negative correlation under thick clouds. Radiative effect analysis indicates that the aerosol diffuse radiative effect (ADRE) reaches 53 W m−2 under clear skies, decreases to 34 W m−2 under thin clouds, and further shifts to −7 W m−2 under thick clouds, reflecting the nonlinear response of aerosol forcing to different cloud backgrounds. With increasing COD, DR increases initially, then decreases, and eventually stabilizes. The cloud diffuse radiative effect (CDRE) decreases from 113 W m−2 under thin clouds to 82 W m−2 under thick clouds, revealing the shielding effect of cloud thickening on shortwave diffuse radiation. The diffuse radiative effect of water vapor (WVDRE) increases with cloud thickness, whereas that of the ozone diffuse radiative effect (ODRE) remains relatively small and stable. Feature importance analysis further shows that under clear skies, AOD accounts for the largest contribution (64%) to DR variability, with DR gradually increasing as AOD increases, followed by single scattering albedo (SSA) and the Ångström exponent (AE), while under cloudy conditions COD and CF dominate. This study highlights the regulatory role of atmospheric components in DR and provides valuable physical references for improving radiation parameterization and accurately assessing surface diffuse radiation under varying sky conditions."

Fires emit HCHO and its precursors and enhance secondary HCHO formation downwind, raising concerns about health impacts. However, the contribution of fire to ambient HCHO remains poorly quantified because ground-based monitoring is sparse and largely urban. Here, we present the first satellite-based quantification of fire-attributable HCHO enhancement and associated health risks across the contiguous U.S. from 2020–2023. We improve TROPOMI retrievals of HCHO columns to account for smoke aerosol effects, and evaluate the changes in column and surface HCHO under fire smoke using NOAA’s HMS smoke product. Annual mean HCHO shows a distinct increase under fire smoke, with vertical column density increased by 6%–16% and surface HCHO by 6%–11%. The spatial distribution of this enhancement aligns with major wildfire activities across California in 2020, the Pacific Northwest in 2021 and the Southern U.S. in 2022, and is most extensive in 2023, likely reflecting the combined influence of Canadian fire smoke intrusions, U.S. wildfires and elevated temperatures. Exposure at 2020–2023 levels translates to an estimated 275–482 excess lifetime cancer cases, indicating a non-negligible health burden from fire-related HCHO even in years of moderate fire activity."

Using ERA5 reanalysis data, the interdecadal changes of Rossby wave energy propagation (RWEP) pathways and their impacts are examined in the present work. The results demonstrate that the NH means of 500 hPa geopotential height anomalies vary with large interdecadal trends that keep in step with global warming, exhibiting a negative-to-positive phase transition from period I (1950/51–1996/97) to period II (1997/98–2024/25). Pronounced interdecadal eastward shifts occur systematically in interannual variabilities of apparent wave sources, which correspondingly result in large interdecadal changes of RWEP pathways in regions from the northeast Atlantic to Eurasia and from the northeast Pacific to North America. Significant interannual surface air temperature anomalies with extremes of around ±5 °C are induced by circulation variations in regions around these pathways, facilitating possible occurrences of climate extremes in Eurasia and North America with different spatial patterns between period II and period I."

Ozone changes were mainly influenced by stratospheric temperature and atmospheric circulation. A significant increase occurred at Marambio, and unusually warm conditions in September 2019 caused ozone to rise strongly over East Antarctica, improving understanding of how the ozone layer responds to environmental changes. 
 This study assesses trends in the total ozone column (TOC) and the atmospheric factors influencing ozone variability at three Antarctic stations (Marambio, Troll/Trollhaugen, and Concordia) from 2007 to 2023. Ground-based TOC measurements were used, supplemented by satellite observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA's Aura satellite. TOC trends were derived using a multiple linear regression model provided by the Long-term Ozone Trends and Uncertainties in the Stratosphere (LOTUS) project. The selected LOTUS model was able to explain 94 %–97 % of the TOC variability at all three stations. The regression analysis showed that ozone variability at these stations is mainly driven by the lower stratospheric temperature, eddy heat flux, and the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation. A statistically significant increasing trend was found at the Marambio station (3.43 ± 3.22 DU per decade), while statistically insignificant trends were detected at the other two stations. Using MERRA-2 reanalyses, the LOTUS model was applied to each grid point in the 40–90° S region, which effectively illustrates the spatial distribution of the impacts of individual predictors. It was found that warmer conditions in the Antarctic stratosphere in September 2019 caused TOC to be up to 100 DU higher than normal, especially over East Antarctica. The results improve understanding of regional TOC trends and how the Antarctic ozone layer responds to changes in ozone-depleting substances."

Chen;Liine Heikkinen;Claudia Marcolli,"Cloud droplet number enhancement from co-condensing NH3, HNO3, and organic vapours: boreal case study","Ubiquitous semi-volatile compounds can co-condense on aerosol particles with water vapour when relative humidity increases. Simulations of cloud formation at a boreal forest site with a cloud parcel model that accounts for non-ideal organic–inorganic interactions yield an enhancement of cloud droplet number concentration from co-condensing NH3, HNO3, and organics up to 44%, with strong sensitivities to volatility distributions, aerosol size distribution, and updraft velocity. 
 Semi-volatile compounds such as organics, nitrate, chloride, and ammonium are ubiquitous in atmospheric aerosols. Their gaseous precursors (organics, HNO3, HCl, NH3) co-condense with water vapour when ambient relative humidity (RH) increases, thus enhancing hygroscopic growth under sub-saturated conditions and facilitating activation as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) to cloud droplets. In this study, we investigate the co-condensation effect on CCN activation for inorganics, organics, and their combination in a boreal forest site in autumn with our cloud parcel model that includes non-ideality of organic-inorganic mixtures. The volatility distribution of organics is highly uncertain but critically important to estimate the co-condensation effect. We compare two distinct volatility basis sets (VBS) established from experimental and modelling data at 25 °C, which we amended with a volatility bin of saturation concentration C*=104 µg m−3, which proved to be highly relevant for CCN activation. The combined co-condensation of organics and inorganics increases CDNC by up to 44 % in simulations initialized with RH of 80 %, depending on VBS distribution and updraft velocity during the air parcel uplifts. Non-ideality of the system is relevant for considering the co-condensation effect realistically. For the ideal case, the maximum CDNC enhancement due to the combined co-condensation effect is 53 % while it is 44 % for the non-ideal case. The combined enhancement in CDNC of inorganic and organic species exceeds the sum of individual effects and should be further constrained in different environments in cloud parcel models as a basis for regional and global simulations."

The lower stratosphere tends to be too warm, too dry, and too quiescent in the model, and as a result, too few ice clouds are predicted to form there. These biases could affect radiative balance and circulation in other areas also, as significant upward transport of moisture and pollutants occurs during the Asian monsoon. 
 The structure of the tropical upper troposphere-lower stratosphere (UTLS) affects radiative balance, stability, and regional dynamics in important ways. Lack of reliable observational baselines poses a challenge to evaluating model representation of UTLS properties. Here, we use in-situ data, primarily from the StratoClim field campaign over the Asian Monsoon area, to assess the UTLS temperature, moisture, and ice clouds in the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) model at storm-resolving grid spacing. We also employ superpressure balloon data and updrafts of the POSIDON and ATTREX campaigns to evaluate the UTLS convective updrafts and gravity wave activity in ICON. Our simulations show the upper troposphere is too cold, while the lower stratosphere is too warm and excessively dry relative to observations. These thermodynamic biases coincide with overestimated cloud ice in the upper troposphere and underestimated cloud ice in the lower stratosphere. The mean convective updraft is underestimated by 80 % in the model, and the power spectral density for temperature fluctuations of frequencies greater than 10−3 s−1 is underestimated by orders of magnitude. Too weak dynamics exacerbate a lack of ice cloud above 100 hPa. Too weak and too infrequent convective overshoots or too rapid dissipation of upper-tropospheric ice clouds in the model are two possible explanatory mechanisms for these biases."

This first pole-to-pole study of marine air reveals a strong latitudinal divide, with higher concentrations in the polluted Northern Hemisphere. A key discovery is that air influenced by Antarctic sea ice is enriched in organic nitrogen, revealing a major natural source. Our new dataset improves climate models by clarifying how human emissions and natural processes shape the atmosphere. 
 Organic nitrogen (ON) is an important yet poorly constrained component of aerosol total nitrogen (TN), particularly over remote oceans. We quantified aerosol ON in 92 total suspended particulate samples collected across approximately 160° of latitude in the marine atmospheric boundary layer (MABL) during Chinese Antarctic and Arctic expeditions (2019–2024), using a newly developed method that simultaneously determines ON and inorganic nitrogen. A significant latitudinal gradient was observed, with significantly higher ON concentrations (expressed as N) in the Northern Hemisphere (83.3 ± 141.4 ng m−3) than in the Southern Hemisphere (15.4 ± 12.4 ng m−3). Regionally, coastal East Asia recorded the highest ON levels (164.6 ± 179.1 ng m−3) but a lower ON/TN ratio (21.1 ± 7.9 %), indicating strong terrestrial and anthropogenic influence. In contrast, the Arctic Ocean had lower ON concentrations (19.1 ± 19.0 ng m−3) but the highest ON/TN ratio (38.6 ± 12.4 %), suggesting dominant marine biogenic sources. The Southern Ocean showed the lowest ON concentration (12.0 ± 7.1 ng m−3) yet a relatively high ON/TN ratio (27.8 ± 11.0 %), also pointing to oceanic origins. Near Antarctica, samples influenced by sea-ice air masses displayed markedly elevated ON and ON/TN ratios. These increases were strongly correlated with sea ice concentration and chlorophyll a exposure, indicating enhanced biogenic emissions from sea-ice-associated ecosystems. This study offers the first direct ON measurements along a global MABL transect, revealing distinct latitudinal and regional patterns, and emphasizing the combined roles of continental inputs and marine sources. It also identifies sea-ice dynamics as a key factor influencing ON in Antarctic regions, providing crucial data for improving atmospheric and climate models."

Barnet,Mapping stratospheric nitric acid (HNO3) patterns in the extratropics with nadir-viewing infrared sounders – a retrieval perspective,"Once Aura is decommissioned, the multi-decadal microwave limb sounder (MLS) record of stratospheric HNO3 will end. This paper presents the retrieval of stratospheric HNO3 from nadir infrared sounders. We demonstrate the retrieval of stratospheric HNO3, independent of tropospheric signal and noise, that broadly reflects the variation captured by MLS. This novel retrieval approach improves upon the status quo and lays the foundation for validation studies and product roll-out in future. 
 With this paper, we aim to demonstrate how stratospheric HNO3 can be retrieved from nadir hyperspectral infrared (IR) measurements such that it is largely uncorrelated with tropospheric HNO3 and most other interfering signals. This is achieved by decomposing the set of HNO3 sensitive channels into orthogonal vectors that isolate the stratospheric HNO3 signal for use in the retrieval. Such a nadir-IR HNO3 product could add useful information to the monitoring of some stratospheric chemical processes affecting ozone in the extratropics, especially once the state-of-the-art Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on Aura is decommissioned in 2026. Nitric acid is typically used as indicator species for heterogeneous chemical processing inside the winter polar stratospheric vortices. The proposed stand-alone stratospheric HNO3 retrieval would be an improvement over the only other nadir-IR HNO3 product available today, namely FORLI (Fast Optimal Retrieval on Layers for IASI), which is a stratosphere + troposphere correlated profile retrieval affected by uncertainty in tropospheric water vapor at the time of measurement. We demonstrate the potential of this new stratospheric nadir-IR HNO3 retrieval strategy using the Community Long-term Infrared Microwave Combined Atmospheric Processing System (CLIMCAPS) as the retrieval framework with measurements from CrIS (Cross-track Infrared Sounder) on the Joint Polar Satellite System 1 (JPSS-1) during the Northern Hemisphere winter of 2019/2020.

Evaluated with a warm bubble case, LEX maintains high accuracy as the Cloud Model 1. With the hardware acceleration and better numerical stability, LEX can be quite faster. To report its differentiability, we further trained a deep learning-based parameterization scheme. The newly trained model can surpass the conventional scheme and get proper forecast results. 
 Large-eddy simulations (LES) are essential tools for studies on atmospheric turbulence and clouds and play critical roles in the development of turbulence and convection parameterizations. Current numerical weather models have approached kilometer-scale resolution as supercomputing facilities advance. However, this resolution range is in the so-called gray zone, where subgrid-scale (SGS) turbulence actively interacts with resolved motion and significantly influences the large-scale characteristics of simulated weather systems. Thus, a novel LES framework is required to enable the development of new SGS approaches for the gray zone. Here we used the Python library JAX to develop a new LES model. It is based on the generalized pseudo-incompressible equations formulated by Durran (2008). For a classic warm bubble case, the traditional Smagorinsky model fails to reproduce the correct structure evolution of the warm bubble, though it can modestly correct the rising speed in gray-zone resolution simulations. Utilizing the capability of JAX for automatic differentiation, we trained a deep learning-based SGS turbulence model for the same case. The trained deep learning SGS model, based on a simple autoencoder (AE), enables this physics-deep learning hybrid model to accurately simulate the expansion of the thermal bubble and the development of rotors surrounding the center of the bubble at a gray-zone resolution. The gray-zone simulation results are comparable to those of the benchmark LES resolution."

This study provides the first comprehensive assessment of QACs in assisted living facilities through the analysis of 19 QACs from three different QAC subgroups in indoor dust and air samples collected from three assisted living facilities in Indiana, United States (US), as well as in wristbands worn by the residents and staff of these facilities. The medians of the total QAC concentrations (∑QAC, the sum of 19 QAC concentrations) were 151,000 ng/g in dust, 3.17 ng/m3 in air, and 2,290 ng/g in wristbands. Benzylalkyldimethylammonium compounds (BACs) were the most abundant QAC group in all three matrices and contributed 58–87% to the ∑QAC concentrations. The QAC distribution patterns found in dust, air, and wristbands were similar to those reported for disinfecting products, suggesting these products could be an important indoor source in assisted living. QAC concentrations in wristbands worn by staff during their work shift were significantly higher than those in wristbands worn by residents (p < 0.05). In addition, the levels found in dust from assisted living were several times higher than those previously reported in US residential households. Concentrations of C12-, C14-, and C16-BACs in dust, air, and wristbands significantly and positively correlated, suggesting common sources in the indoor environment. Estimated daily intake (EDI) of QACs suggests that accidental dust ingestion is the predominant exposure route, accounting for approximately 62% of the total QAC intake. The elevated QAC concentrations in assisted living facilities are of concern for the residents and staff of these facilities because of the potential health risks associated with exposure to these chemicals, such as respiratory effects."

In this paper, we used satellite-derived data to assess outdoor PM2.5 concentrations at 1,593 prisons in the contiguous U.S. from 1998 to 2022. Across our study period, despite overall national decreases in PM2.5 concentrations and disparities, prisons on average experienced higher pollution than the nonincarcerated U.S. population. In 2022, over 500 prisons had spatially averaged concentrations higher than the population-weighted concentrations of their home states. We also found evidence that in 12 states, state and federal prison populations systematically had higher PM2.5 than the nonincarcerated populations in those states; similar findings were obtained for national analyses stratified by degree of urbanicity. In 2022, about 7% of prisons were above federal air quality standards, with over 50% of these prisons located in California. Collectively, the contributions of this study in finding health-relevant disparities in outdoor PM2.5 concentrations for prisons across several different metrics may highlight an urgent public health crisis that requires deeper inquiry and interventions from government officials.

Here, we characterize the molecular composition, summer–winter differences, and sources of gaseous OOMs in urban Beijing using an iodide chemical ionization mass spectrometer. Our results show that C4–C5 molecules, especially isoprene oxidation products, accounted for 48% of measured OOMs in summer, while CHO molecules and nitrophenols dominated in winter (∼60%). Most OOMs, particularly organic nitrates in the summer and organic acids in the winter, showed significant increases during polluted episodes. OOMs also increased significantly during summer heatwaves due to enhanced volatilization and precursor emissions. Source apportionment identified ten OOM factors, with isoprene-related factors contributing 43% of OOMs in summer, and nitrophenols and O4 organic acids prevailing in winter. The relationship between the OOMs and SOA indicated that more than half of summertime SOA is linked to isoprene-related oxidation, while nitrophenols and highly oxidized organic acids contributed most under elevated PM2.5 levels in winter. Emission controls during the 2022 Winter Olympic Games effectively reduced several OOMs groups, particularly organic acids, while increasing the formation of nitrogen-containing species. Overall, this work reveals the distinct summer–winter behavior of OOMs in Beijing and their varied roles in SOA formation under changing atmospheric and regulatory conditions."

Twenty outdoor environmental exposures from three domains, air pollutants, meteorological conditions, and geographical features were assessed. DS was measured using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale. An exposome-wide association study was used to explore associations and identify important environmental exposures related to DS, followed by eXtreme Gradient Boosting to rank their relative importance. Composite scores for three environmental domains were constructed to assess their joint impacts on DS. Exposure to PM2.5, PM10, temperature, wind speed, artificial light at night, and building density were significantly associated with increased odds of DS, while higher relative humidity, and higher greenness indicators (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index [NDVI], forest-shrub-grass coverage, and cropland coverage) were inversely associated. Among all exposures, building density showed the greatest contribution in the model ranking. Considering the joint impacts, unfavorable environmental profiles across all three domains were significantly associated with higher odds of DS, particularly among children with abnormal weight or higher metabolic risk. Importantly, population attributable fraction analysis indicates that improving environmental profiles could theoretically reduce 14.22–29.41% of DS cases, with geographical factors showing the largest theoretical contribution. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating environmental considerations into mental health strategies and support urban design and air quality improvements as tailored interventions for vulnerable populations to reduce the burden of DS."

Here, we prepared carboxymethyl-β-cyclodextrin (CMCD)-anchored WO3 that enabled visible-light-driven mineralization of acetaldehyde even under O2-free conditions. Anchoring CMCD on WO3 facilitated interfacial charge separation, enhancing the photocatalytic performance. Spectroscopic and electrochemical analyses revealed that loading CMCD on WO3 induced the formation of a charge-transfer complex via C–O–W bonding and extended the charge carrier lifetime by trapping electrons in CMCD. CMCD/WO3 sustained •OH generation under visible light (λ > 420 nm) and fully mineralized acetaldehyde even in the absence of O2. It also produced dioxygen from water oxidation in O2-free conditions, supplying O2 needed to fully mineralize VOCs to CO2, and it enabled an unconventional three-electron reduction of O2 to •OH. CMCD/WO3 exhibited a visible light degradation efficiency comparable to that of Pt-loaded WO3. In particular, CMCD/WO3 exhibited a higher carbon mass balance for acetaldehyde degradation than Pt/WO3, and this value remained nearly unchanged under both oxygen-rich and oxygen-free conditions. CMCD/WO3 also demonstrated long-term stability across repeated photocatalytic cycles with no decomposition of the CMCD structure. These findings highlight a supramolecular design strategy for developing an unconventional visible-light-active photocatalyst for indoor air purification, especially in enclosed or oxygen-depleted environments where conventional photocatalysts fail to operate."

In this study, the arsRhgcAB gene cluster from Pseudodesulfovibrio hydrargyri BerOc1, a well-known Hg-methylating bacterium, was heterologously expressed in the non-methylating sulfate reducer Oleidesulfovibrio alaskensis G20. The heterologous expression of the arsRhgcAB gene cluster conferred the ability to methylate mercury to O. alaskensis G20, supporting its sufficiency to induce CH3Hg production in a non-methylating sulfate-reducing host. Although CH3Hg production rates in the engineered O. alaskensis G20 strain were lower than those in P. hydrargyri BerOc1, both strains followed a saturation reaction trend. Additionally, the engineered O. alaskensis G20 strain exhibited lower demethylation rates than the wild-type one, with a saturable kinetic profile similar to that of P. hydrargyri BerOc1, indicating that a regulatory mechanism, likely mediated by ArsR, limits demethylation. The expression of arsRhgcAB not only enables iHg(II) methylation but also influences CH3Hg demethylation, unveiling regulated dynamics more complex  than previously recognized. Understanding these pathways is essential to better predict cellular Hg pools, elucidating the fate of mercury in anoxic ecosystems and ultimately developing microbially based strategies to mitigate CH3Hg production."

In the review, we synthesize recent developments in sampling and analytical methods, evaluate isotopic end-member values for various Nr sources, and examine fractionation behavior during transformation. We further provide a comparative overview of global patterns and long-term trends in Nr, drawing on ∼1700 isotopic data points from published studies covering major regions including East Asia, North America, and Europe, spanning 1956–2023. We find that isotopic end-member values for many Nr sources are now well constrained, providing a strong basis for source identification. However, wide variability remains for certain sources, such as soil and livestock emissions, indicating the need for further targeted investigation. In addition, isotopic differences are observed among different physical forms of the same compound (e.g., particulate versus aqueous), likely reflecting variations in isotopic fractionation during formation. These effects should therefore be explicitly considered in isotope-based source attribution. The compiled data reveal pronounced regional contrasts in Nr sources and formation pathways. For example, oxidized Nr [e.g., nitrate (NO3–)] in East Asia (δ15N-NO3–: +5.0 ± 5.6‰) shows stronger influence from combustion emissions compared with North America (−0.2 ± 4.9‰) and Europe (−1.0 ± 3.8‰). Interannual variability also differs: values in East Asia peaked around 2017 and have since declined, whereas North America exhibits a nearly opposite trend. Reduced Nr shows comparable regional and temporal variability. These patterns largely reflect differences in energy use, pollution control policies, and the pace of energy transitions. In addition, oxidized Nr formation exhibits a clear latitudinal gradient, with ozone becoming a more dominant oxidant at higher latitudes. This trend underscores differences in atmospheric oxidation capacity and provides observational constraints for previous model predictions. In summary, this review presents current methodologies, isotopic signatures, fractionation processes, and a comprehensive global Nr data set, demonstrating that isotope techniques are now an essential tool for tracing Nr and for advancing understanding and management of the global nitrogen cycle."

Abbatt,The Impacts of Wildfires on Indoor PM2.5 in Western Canada,"While current strategies for reducing wildfire PM2.5 exposure focus on remaining indoors, the detailed impacts of wildfires on indoor air quality remain unclear. Here, low-cost PM2.5 sensors were deployed in 21 residences across 4 locations commonly impacted by wildfires in western Canada. Surveys of the homes and the occupants’ activities were conducted, and wildfire influence was assessed using atmospheric back trajectories. Indoor and outdoor PM2.5 concentrations were monitored for a one-year period, which included Canada’s most severe wildfire season on record in 2023. During the wildfire season, daily average indoor PM2.5 levels were higher during wildfire episodes (7.1 μg m–3) than in the absence of fires (3.5 μg m–3), whereas the indoor-to-outdoor PM2.5 ratios (0.42 vs 0.48) and infiltration factors were lower (0.25 vs 0.28 on fire and nonfire days, respectively). Increases in indoor PM2.5 due to wildfires were comparable to the spread in PM2.5 values between clean homes and those with many indoor particle generating activities, such as cooking. Overall, Canadian homes protected against PM2.5 exposure during wildfire episodes on average, but the variability of indoor PM2.5 exposure in the absence of wildfires across different homes was comparable in magnitude to the increases in PM2.5 due to wildfires."

The thermal and photochemical ozonolysis of N-EC was investigated in terms of kinetics, products, mechanism, and environmental implications. O3 uptake was observed on various N-EC under dark conditions, with the average O3 uptake coefficient (γav) in the range of (0.32–1.21) × 10–5. Light generally promoted O3 uptake on N-EC, and the extent of enhancement was correlated to hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and singlet oxygen (1O2) derived from the photoexcited N-EC. However, light was found to suppress HONO production from the ozonolysis of nitenpyram (NPM), a representative N-EC. HONO can be generated from either the O3 attack or the electrophilic addition of •OH on the C═C–NO2 structure by the photochemical ozonolysis of NPM, but HONO production by the •OH attack was less efficient than that from the O3 attack. Our results indicate that the O3 uptake process on N-EC containing C═C–NO2 would contribute to the atmospheric HONO source in the range of 74–740 ppt h–1."

Using large‐ensemble climate simulations, we identify the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) as a potential driver of interdecadal changes in winter northern European precipitation. During the 1980–2014 IPO phase transition, internal variability induced a drying trend of −0.07 mm day−1 (35 years)−1, offsetting a concurrent externally forced wetting trend of +0.19 mm day−1 (35 years)−1. This influence arises from IPO‐related modulation of atmospheric circulation and moisture transport. The persistence of IPO–WNEP linkages into 2015–2050 suggests that internal variability may continue to shape near‐future hydroclimate. Accounting for IPO‐related influences reduces projection uncertainty by 30% historically and 20% in the near future. These results highlight the critical role of internal variability in long‐term European precipitation trends and emphasize its relevance for regional water resource planning."

In this study, we used multi‐source atmospheric water vapor isotope data sets, including satellite and ground‐based observations, to investigate the role of evapotranspired water vapor (EWV) during CHDE. We identified a vertical dipole pattern in water vapor isotopes, with depletion in the lower troposphere and enrichment in the middle troposphere. This pattern is primarily driven by vertically transported EWV, which can reach altitudes up to 500 hPa. More importantly, the upward transport of EWV plays a key role in the warming of the middle troposphere, creating a saddle‐shaped temperature structure of the troposphere. This suggests that enhancing the forecasting capability of numerical weather prediction models for extreme CHDE should involve an adequate consideration of the warming effect of vertically transported EWV within the model framework."

It has been thought that the migrating diurnal tide (DW1) plays a role in the initiation of this phase because DW1 peaks around this time and satellite observations have shown it to undergo wave breaking. The high‐resolution (HR) Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension successfully simulates the strong westward phase of the MSAO in contrast with its coarser resolution counterpart. In this work, we show that the wave breaking of DW1, between about 85 and 100 km, serves as the dominant westward acceleration mechanism. However, between about 80 and 85 km, diurnal wave broadening and DW1 nonlinearity is responsible for the westward acceleration. These results demonstrate the utility of HR whole atmosphere modeling, which explicitly resolves small‐scale gravity waves, in revealing multiscale wave dynamics."

However, the mechanisms and future trends of this enhancement remain inadequately understood. Analysis of multiple reanalysis data sets shows that during summer seasons of 1981–2020, approximately 45.6% of global lands exhibit a significant intensifying SM‐T coupling trend, with hotspots in Northeast Asia, Central Asia, and southwestern North America. Ridge regression reveals the drying SM (contribution: 50.2%) dominates the enhanced SM‐T coupling, followed by greening vegetation (28.3%) and decreasing cloud cover (21.5%). Furthermore, pre‐summer vegetation greening has the effect of intensifying the summer SM‐T coupling. Despite discrepancies in climate models' simulations of SM‐T coupling trend, the optimal multi‐model ensemble mean well reproduces SM‐T coupling's spatiotemporal characteristics. Based on this multi‐model ensemble mean, the enhancement of SM‐T coupling is attributed to anthropogenic forcings and projected to further intensify under future emission scenarios."

While the drivers of climatological ISMR onset are well discussed, the causes of delayed ISMR onset remain unclear. This study shows that the delay is primarily driven by anomalous high pressure over the Arabian Sea and anomalous low pressure over the Mascarene High, which weakens the regional Hadley circulation and, consequently, the low‐level moist southwesterly winds over the Arabian Sea. This weakening of southwesterlies directly delays the ISMR onset. When the ocean forces the atmosphere over the Arabian Sea, it alters the earlier delaying conditions and creates a favorable environment for the ISMR onset. The key novelty of this study is understanding the combined role of the Mascarene High, regional Hadley circulation, and Arabian Sea air–sea interactions in regulating delayed ISMR onset, offering new insights for improving ISMR onset prediction."

While deep learning models have demonstrated improved prediction skills, their performances are constrained by biases in climate models used for training and lack dynamic interpretability. Here we construct a novel hybrid model that integrates deep learning techniques into a dynamical model, enabling information exchanging during integration. Training on physical‐informed data, the model continuously adapts and improves forecasts, achieves unprecedented ENSO prediction skills, particularly in El Niño diversity and the spring predictability barrier. Moreover, as the hybrid model requires only a small volume of data by training on observations, it circumvents biases in climate models. Enhanced prediction skills arise primarily from improved representation of the leading feedbacks associated with ENSO. Our results suggest that training models with physical‐informed data is an effective approach for ENSO prediction."

These remote HC adjustments arise through both pure atmospheric and ocean‐atmosphere coupling mechanisms, yet their relative importance remains unclear. In this study, we integrate observations with climate model experiments to assess the roles of pure atmospheric and coupled ocean‐atmosphere pathways linking ENSO to the global HC adjustments. Results show that El Niño intensifies deep convection over the Pacific but suppresses convection over the Atlantic and Indian Oceans via the tropospheric temperature mechanism. Meanwhile, El Niño‐induced Atlantic and Indian Oceans warming enhances convection and regional HC. These two pathways exert opposing influences, with pure atmospheric pathway as the dominant driver. These findings establish a novel inter‐basin dynamical perspective for ENSO‐related tropical circulation adjustments and clarify the relative importance of different pathways, offering important implications for understanding ENSO‐induced global climate impacts."

SW2 shows a substantial response to both SPVs, though the Antarctic influence is weaker. During boreal winter, 50% of SW2 variability is linked to Arctic SPV strength, while 34% during austral spring is associated with Antarctic SPV. Classical tidal theory Hough modes (HMs) of SW2 point to a clear relationship between the HMs and Arctic SPV with the most significant change occurring in the first antisymmetric (2,3) HM. However, only the second symmetric (2,4) HM responds significantly to the Antarctic SPV. These distinctive differences in HMs arise from dynamic changes in the stratosphere and MLT. Stratospheric ozone contributes only 6%–10% to the (2,2) HM during weak state of Arctic SPV and shows no significant influence under Antarctic SPV variability. As such, HM variabilities are primarily caused by changes in background neutral winds during weak and strong Arctic and Antarctic SPVs rather than changes in stratospheric ozone heating. In addition, the zonal momentum budget of each HM of SW2 is analyzed. The classical term (Coriolis + pressure gradient forcing) exhibits the largest variations with the strength of the Arctic and Antarctic SPVs, followed by the advection term."

Methane observations from three in situ monitoring sites were assimilated into a Bayesian four‐dimensional variational inversion framework coupled with the Community Multiscale Air Quality model, employing prior emissions from the Open Methane Database (2024). Posterior results revealed increased emissions in the eastern region, particularly near gas infrastructure and wastewater facilities, suggesting that these sources may be underrepresented in prior inventories. In contrast, a consistent decline in methane emissions was observed across all months in the central‐western part of the domain, where coal mining and power generation are concentrated. This decline is likely linked to the predominance of brown coal in the region, which emits substantially less methane than black coal, a distinction not clearly captured in the study inventory, potentially leading to overestimated emissions. Additionally, the most significant reduction in the entire studied domain occurred in February 2019, with emissions decreasing by approximately 30% relative to prior estimates. Sensitivity analyses and comparisons with the Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research inventory support the robustness of these findings. While total emissions across data sets were broadly similar, differences in spatial distribution led to notable variations in posterior outcomes. These results highlight the importance of incorporating local knowledge into emission inventories and the need for more detailed classification of emission sources, particularly coal type, to improve methane emission estimates at regional scales."

 Global heat stress is intensifying under climate change, yet the relative roles of natural and anthropogenic forcing remain insufficiently quantified. Here, we show that global heat stress trend, assessed with the Universal Thermal Climate Index, increases markedly over the past four decades, with 52% of land area experiencing rises in mean heat stress intensity and 67% showing increases in extreme heat stress days. We find that anthropogenic climate change overwhelmingly dominates these trends, with the land area it dominates nearly twice as large as that dominated by natural climate change. Anthropogenic climate change also results in pronounced spatial inequality in heat stress trends across different economies, with low-income economies experiencing a growth rate two to three times higher than that of high-income economies. These findings demonstrate that human-induced climate change is amplifying global heat stress while deepening existing spatial inequalities, underscoring the urgency of equitable climate change adaptation.

 Understanding ocean freshwater variability is key to assessing the global water cycle and climate change, but changes in freshwater storage and transport remain unclear. Here we show that the South Indian Ocean—a vital conduit for interocean exchange—has experienced the strongest freshening in the Southern Hemisphere since the 1960s. This freshening drives a southward expansion of the Indo-Pacific freshwater pool into the South Indian Ocean, where freshwater has increased by 6.5 ± 0.5% per decade, as indicated by the shrinking 35.3 psu isohaline. Strengthened Indonesian Throughflow and intensified Subtropical Gyre inflow are the primary causes. In the upper ~200 m, freshening follows a new subtropical pathway rather than the usual tropical route. These changes arise from wind shifts linked to the Hadley cell’s poleward expansion and a stronger Indonesian Throughflow, both driven by warm-pool warming. Ongoing warming will further expand the freshwater pool and broaden the subtropical pathway, affecting climate, interocean exchange and marine ecosystems. Ocean salinity could change as the climate warms. Here the authors show that the South Indian Ocean has freshened most of the Southern Hemisphere oceans and highlight the mechanisms behind this freshening, as well as the implications for Indian Ocean stratification and structure."

 Despite numerous proxy-based reconstructions of climate since the Last Glacial Maximum, spatial hydroclimate variability in the Chinese monsoon region remains enigmatic. Here, we examine four stalagmites from northern China that collectively provide a continuous, highly resolved multi-proxy record over the past 25.5 ka. δ18O records capture large-scale variations in Asian summer monsoon (ASM) circulation, whereas trace element ratios and δ13C reflect regional precipitation variability; both follow precessional rhythms. Chinese stalagmite δ18O exhibits a zonal tripolar pattern, reflecting moisture sources and transport pathways. During Termination I, a meridional tripolar spatial precipitation pattern emerged, driven by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and mid-latitude westerlies dynamics.

 The complex nature of extratropical air-sea coupling has hampered a detailed physical understanding of how the atmosphere responds to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE) region. Departing from the conventional approach of examining the seasonal-mean response, this study focuses on how atmospheric latent heating structures in early winter are modulated by synoptic weather patterns, and how those weather patterns selectively respond to KOE SST anomalies. The results are based on high-resolution atmospheric model experiments (1/8 degree over the North Pacific, tapering to 1 degree over the rest of the globe). While three dominant synoptic weather patterns that enhance latent heating over the KOE region are identified, only one of them, corresponding to anticyclonic baroclinic wave, systematically responds to the imposed SST anomalies. Warm SST anomalies induce stronger updrafts, which enhance atmospheric latent heating and ultimately strengthen and anchor the anomalous anticyclone over the North Pacific. Because this anticyclonic baroclinic system occurs more frequently than other types of weather patterns and has the greatest sensitivity to KOE SST anomalies, it dominates the seasonal-mean atmospheric response. The results demonstrate that a synoptic view is needed for an improved understanding of the mechanisms governing the seasonal-mean atmospheric circulation response to KOE SST forcing."

Monteiro;Giang Tran;Matthew J. Gidden;Nadine Mengis,Carbon-climate feedback responses to spatial aerosol model implementation variations,"Carbon-climate feedback responses to spatial aerosol model implementation variations 
 Aerosols have played an important role in defining the climate over the historical period, due to their net cooling effect in the atmosphere. However, as their emissions are expected to decrease in upcoming decades, they will be associated with reduced cooling, i.e. future warming, of the planet. Despite their importance and high uncertainty associated with their radiative forcing, aerosols inclusion in simple climate models, impact models and carbon-based climate assessment metrics requires simplifications and assumptions. Typically, interactions between physical and biogeochemical processes are disregarded by such. By varying the spatial implementation of aerosols in an intermediate complexity model we explore the variability in Earth system responses under an ambitious mitigation scenario due to aerosols-radiation interactions. When aerosols are implemented disregarding their spatial distribution, surface air temperature is higher by almost 0.1 °C when compared to a regionally heterogeneous implementation, corresponding to an uncertainty of ca. 200 GtCO2 of remaining carbon budgets. The main processes driving these responses are the land surface temperature and its effect on soil respiration, as well as changed ocean heat fluxes due to differences in incoming shortwave radiation at the surface. The spatial distribution of aerosols triggers important climate-carbon feedbacks, which should be specifically considered when assessing climate evolution and simulated Earth system responses. Even if aerosol-cloud interactions aren’t explored, the results already indicate that aerosols should be deliberately accounted for in simple models and assessment tools, as their triggered feedbacks will be instrumental in defining pathways for temperature stabilisation and evaluating, for example, remaining carbon budgets."

 Since about 2000, the total mass of the Antarctic Ice Sheet has declined at a near-linear rate, increasing global sea levels. Since 2016, however, satellite gravimetry data reveal a slowdown in net Antarctic ice mass loss and a net mass gain since 2020, despite increases in dynamically-driven ice loss by discharge from outlet glaciers. Here we use a reanalysis and regional climate model to show that this reversal is primarily due to positive surface mass balance anomalies, which result from increased precipitation driven by enhanced atmospheric river activity, strengthened westerlies, and reduced sea ice extent. Atmospheric rivers have become more frequent and intense since 2020, particularly over the Antarctic Peninsula, Queen Maud Land, and Wilkes Land, resulting in strong regional positive mass balance anomalies. High-resolution regional climate model simulations with modified sea ice extent show that the effect of sea ice loss on enhancing precipitation through increased evaporation accounts for around 10% of the winter increase, but is overall minor compared to remote large-scale processes. Combined, these factors result in accumulation increases that currently offset the mass loss from accelerated ice discharge in Antarctica and point to processes important for future projections. The recent increase in Antarctic Ice Sheet mass is driven by enhanced precipitation from frequent atmospheric rivers, stronger westerlies, and reduced sea ice, which together offset ice loss from outlet glacier discharge, according to reanalysis and regional climate modelling."

 Fog formation over tropical forests remains poorly characterized, despite its potential role in bioaerosol dispersion and ecosystem processes. Here, we analyzed fog samples collected at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory using flow cytometry and culture-based techniques to characterize viable microbial communities. Microbial cell concentrations varied over an order of magnitude across 13 fog events, reaching up to 8 × 104 cells per ml of fog water. Flow cytometry consistently detected metabolically active cells, while culturing and mass spectrometry-based identification yielded eight viable bacterial species and seven fungal taxa. The bacteria Serratia marcescens, Ralstonia pickettii and Sphingomonas paucimobilis exhibited seasonal variations in prevalence. The fungal species identified were primarily mesophilic saprophytes and endophytes, commonly associated with soil and plant surfaces. Our findings indicate that fog harbors viable microbes, including Serratia marcescens and Ralstonia pickettii, which may imply a relevance of fog for microbial dispersal, colonization and nutrient cycling in the Amazon rainforest.

 Lakes affect regional climate by influencing heat and moisture exchange and near-surface wind. However, their global impact on the atmospheric boundary layer, a key layer of land–atmosphere interaction, remains unclear. Here, we combine satellite-based atmospheric profiles with the fifth generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis to assess the impacts of large inland lakes (area greater than 500 square kilometers). Lakes enhance heat (1.6 degrees Celsius) and moisture (0.4 grams per kilogram) transport toward surrounding land, shifting low-level instability center to within 25 kilograms of the shoreline and strengthening turbulent mixing and convective development. Consequently, atmospheric boundary layer height over these lake-adjacent lands increases by 0.3 to 0.6 kilometers, while it remains lower over lakes because of stronger stratification. The dominant processes of lake effects vary with season, latitude, elevation and lake size. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating lake–atmosphere coupling into weather and climate models.

 Building height stands as a vital vertical representation of urban morphology and is closely linked to the development of sustainable cities. However, accurately mapping building heights over a wide area at a fine scale remains challenging due to the high costs of field data acquisition, the loss of spatial details in large-scale mapping, and the underestimation of high-rise buildings. To tackle these challenges, this study develops a novel Tri-Modal Height Estimation Network (TMHEN) and a Cross-modal Adaptive Enhancer (CAE) module. Leveraging SDGSAT-1 Glimmer imagery, Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Imager (MSI) and Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, building height maps with 10-m resolution were derived. The nighttime light (NTL) imagery of SDGSAT-1 is introduced for the first time in building height estimation. Trained on building height data collected from 61 cities nationwide, our model achieves a satisfactory accuracy, with the root mean square error ranging from 2.05 m to 7.87 m and a mean absolute error from 0.67 m to 2.71 m. Our results exhibit notable consistency with the reference data and outperform existing state of the art products in capturing rich spatial details. The incorporation of high-resolution NTL data effectively mitigates the underestimation primarily caused by SAR backscatter, reducing residuals by 13.01% and 17.98% compared to models utilizing lower-resolution NTL data or no NTL data, respectively. The proposed TMHEN is applied to five major Chinese urban agglomerations, revealing the diversity of urban vertical forms and distinct development patterns. The high-resolution building height maps provide scientific insights to the evaluation of SDG 11 indicators towards a more comprehensive understanding of urbanization processes.

 Accurate and transferable crop monitoring from remote sensing remains challenging because vegetation signals are strongly affected by phenological asynchrony, climatic variability, and sensor-specific responses. Existing approaches rely on local calibrated relationships , limiting their effectiveness in data-sparse regions. This study investigates whether models calibrated on high-quality localized reference data can generalize to other regions by stabilizing sensor–biophysical relationships.The proposed methodology integrates two components (i) thermal time normalization based on growing degree days (GDD) to reduce phenology-driven variability, and (ii) physically motivated optical and optical–SAR fusion indices designed within this normalized framework to enhance the consistency of learned relationships across contrasting environments.The approach was evaluated through within-region cross-season, and cross-region experiments. Results show that GDD normalization improves performance relative to calendar-based approaches by up to 35%. In cross-season validation, fusion-based linear models achieved R2 > 0.60 for wheat and 0.65 in barley. Cross-region validation shows reduced but meaningful transferability, with both crops reaching R2 ≈ 0.45, and fusion reducing RMSE by ∼ 200 kg ha-1 compared to optical-only models. Machine-learning models did not improve generalization over simple parametric fits.These findings confirm that stabilizing phenological and multi-sensor relationships is critical for transferring models from data-rich to data-limited areas, providing a foundation for scalable, global agricultural monitoring."

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is crucial for Earth observation because it can acquire high-resolution images in all weather conditions. However, the presence of speckles—an inherent multiplicative noise caused by the coherent imaging process—severely degrades image quality and impairs the performance of subsequent interpretation tasks. To effectively capture both global contextual cues and fine-grained structural details in SAR image despeckling, we design a dual-branch Global-Local Collaborative Network (GLCNet) based on blind-spot convolution. GLCNet is trained in a self-supervised manner, requiring only original images for learning, making it well-suited for SAR data without ground truth. In the global branch, the SAR image is first decomposed into multiple frequency sub-bands through a Wavelet-Shuffle Downsampling (WSD), which decorrelates speckle components across scales and frequencies. A multi-scale blind-spot convolution is then applied to each sub-band in parallel, enabling the extraction of global textures without introducing speckle bias. In contrast, the local branch focuses on structure-aware restoration by jointly modeling frequency and spatial priors. By leveraging neighboring-pixel dependencies, this branch enhances local detail recovery and edge sharpness. Finally, an adaptive Detail-Guided Module (DGM) dynamically integrates complementary features from both branches, ensuring a harmonious balance between texture smoothness and structural fidelity. The proposed method is validated using various SAR sensors, including Sentinel-1, GF-3, TerraSAR-X, and Capella-X, demonstrating its superiority over traditional and deep learning approaches. Additionally, the application analysis confirms that the method enhances both the visual quality and analytical reliability of SAR images, making it a valuable preprocessing step for real-world scenarios.

 Real-world aerial image super-resolution (SR) remains particularly challenging because degradations in remote-sensing imagery involve random combinations of anisotropic blur, signal-dependent noise, and unknown downsampling kernels. Most existing SR methods either rely on simplified degradation assumptions or lack semantic perception of degradation, resulting in limited generalization to real-world conditions. To address these gaps, we propose a novel diffusion-based SR framework that integrates Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) and self-supervised contrastive learning for extracting degradation-insensitive representation. Specifically, we introduce a contrastive learning strategy into a ControlNet module, where the HR and LR counterparts of the same image are regarded as positive pairs, while representations from different images serve as negative pairs, enabling the network to learn degradation-insensitive structural features. To further enhance semantic awareness of degradation, an MLLM-generated change caption is incorporated into the diffusion process as textual guidance, allowing the model to explicitly perceive and reconstruct different degradation types. Moreover, a classifier-free guidance (CFG) distillation strategy compresses the original dual-branch diffusion model into a single lightweight network, substantially improving inference efficiency while maintaining high reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments conducted on various datasets have showcased the superior performance of our proposed model compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, our distillation algorithm achieves a twofold reduction in inference time compared to its non-distilled counterpart, making it more feasible for real-time and resource-limited applications."

 Monitoring global vegetation gross primary productivity (GPP) at an hourly scale is critical for understanding terrestrial carbon dynamics, while recent global GPP products often suffer from limitations in their temporal resolutions. Here, a light use efficiency (LUE) model, integrated with FLUXNET and reanalysis datasets as meteorological inputs, was employed to obtain GPP at both 1-hourly and 6-hourly resolutions. We developed a downscaling algorithm that partitions 6-hourly GPP into 1-hourly estimates by weighting the 6-hourly values according to the hourly cosine of the solar zenith angle and applying linear regression. The algorithm was then applied to global 6-hourly reanalysis-driven GPP maps during 2001–2020. Using GPP simulated from 1-hourly meteorological inputs and eddy covariance (EC) GPP as references, the 6-hourly resolution GPP before and after downscaling were evaluated by mean-absolute-deviation (MAD) and nash–sutcliffe-efficiency (NSE). At 150 sites, results showed that the 6-hourly FLUXNET-driven and reanalysis-driven GPP after downscaling exhibited a significantly stronger correlation (MAD = 0.03 gCm−2h−1, NSE = 0.95) with corresponding 1-hourly estimates than the 6-hourly GPP estimates before downscaling (MAD = 0.06 gCm−2h−1, NSE = 0.83). Compared to EC GPP, the 6-hourly GPP estimates after downscaling also achieved notable improvements, with a MAD lower by 0.02 gCm−2h−1 and an NSE higher by 0.09. At the global scale, the mean annual bias in total GPP summed from 6-hourly reanalysis-driven maps, decreased from 4.14 gCyr−1 before downscaling to 0.53 gCyr−1 after downscaling over the period 2001–2020, as compared with corresponding 1-hourly GPP maps. At the hourly scale, the mean relative error between the 6-hourly and corresponding 1-hourly GPP maps decreased from 32.40% before downscaling to 18.49% after downscaling. This downscaling algorithm effectively reduces biases in global GPP estimates, which could offer valuable insights into carbon modeling at finer temporal resolutions."

 Ozone (O3) exceedances of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) frequently occur during summer in New York City (NYC) and downwind coastal areas of Long Island Sound (LIS), driven by complex interactions among urban emissions, regional transport, land–sea breezes, and urban heat island effects. This study combines airborne, shipborne, and ground-based observations to examine spatiotemporal variations in mixing-layer height (MLH) and O3, using data from NASA's airborne lidar High Altitude Lidar Observatory (HALO), National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Langley's ozone lidar, a shipborne ceilometer, CCNY ground-based aerosol lidar, coherent Doppler wind lidar, and ground in situ samplers during the Long Island Sound Tropospheric Ozone Study (LISTOS). Compared with the NYC urban area, near-surface O3 at western and eastern LIS coastal sites was consistently higher, exceeding the NAAQS on August 28–29, 2018 despite low-level nitrogen dioxide (NO2). During morning-to-noon planetary boundary layer (PBL) growth, MLH reached 1.6–1.8 km over NYC but remained lower (0.8–1.0 km) over LIS and New Jersey suburbs. Comparisons of ground lidar and ceilometer data revealed a 1–2-h lag in MLH growth over coastal-marine areas relative to the NYC urban core, due to urban heat island effects (UHI). These results indicate that coastal O3 exceedances are linked to shallow MLH, urban plume transport, and sea-breeze circulations. Observations were used to evaluate NOAA North American Mesoscale (NAM)- EPA Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model forecasts of MLH and surface O3. While model performed well at the urban site, a timing bias in coastal peak O3 was identified, highlighting challenges in predicting coastal air quality."

 Both organic bases and oxidized organic molecules (OOMs) play crucial roles as precursors in new particle formation (NPF). The atmospheric oxidation products of aniline exhibit characteristics of both organic bases and OOMs. This study utilizes theoretical calculations to explore the atmospheric oxidation of aniline during both day and night, revealing the mechanisms of OOM formation and their role in nucleation. During the day, aniline oxidation initiated by hydroxyl radicals predominantly follows two pathways: the bicyclic peroxy radical and imine pathways. OOMs originating from these pathways readily associate with sulfuric acid to form stable clusters, contributing to the initial stages of particle nucleation. Intermolecular interactions reveal that the strong nucleation ability of OOMs results from the synergistic effect between basic and oxygen-containing functional groups in their molecular structures. At night, aniline oxidation is primarily driven by NO3 radicals. The nucleation potential of the resulting OOMs and organic nitrates (ONs) is significantly reduced due to their lower oxidation levels, fewer hydrogen-bonding sites and the inclusion of nitrate ester groups. In high-NOx environments, processes involving RO2 radicals and NO inhibit the generation of highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs), reducing their contribution to NPF. In low-NOx environments, NO promotes the generation of open-ring HOMs that readily cluster with sulfuric acid, thereby participating in nucleation. This study elucidates the oxidation mechanisms of aniline that lead to the formation of OOMs and ONs, as well as their initial clustering with sulfuric acid, offering deeper insight into how aromatic compounds and organic bases facilitate NPF."

 Anhydrides are widely used in industrial processes. Propionic anhydride (PA) and butyric anhydride (BA) are considered to be high production volume chemicals, with a total production in the order of thousands of tonnes. This study presents the rate coefficients for PA and BA with chlorine atoms for the first time: (3.8 ± 0.8) × 10−12 and (11 ± 2) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, respectively. The rate coefficients for the reactions of PA and BA with •OH radicals were estimated using Linear-Free-Energy-Relationships (LFER): 3.5 × 10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1 and 7.9 × 10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, respectively. From here, the calculated atmospheric lifetimes (33 and 15 days, for PA and BA, respectively) indicate that, once emitted, they could be transported by air masses having a regional impact.Moreover, the main photooxidation products, both in the presence and absence of NO2 were identified by infrared spectroscopy: CH3CH2C(O)OH, CH3CH2C(O)OC(O)C(O)CH3, CH3CH2C(O)OC(O)CH2C(O)H, CH3C(O)C(O)OONO2, CH3C(O)OONO2 and CO2 for PA; and CH3CH2CH2C(O)OH, CH3CH2CH2C(O)OC(O)CH2CH2C(O)H, CH3CH2CH2C(O)OC(O)CH2C(O)H, CH3CH2C(O)OONO2, CH3CH2C(O)C(O)OONO2 and CO2 for BA. Computational studies were used to support the experimental identification of the products.Atmospheric degradation of PA and BA produces carboxylic acids that can partition into the aqueous phase of clouds and fog, affecting atmospheric processes having environmental impacts. In addition, the degradation of PA and BA in regions polluted with nitrogen dioxide leads to the formation of peroxyacyl nitrates, which can be transported long distances from their source of production, polluting remote areas."

 Arctic aerosols play an important role in modulating high-latitude weather and climate. However, spatiotemporal aerosol distributions in the Arctic remain poorly quantified. Here, we present aerosol physicochemical properties observed during the Cold Air Outbreak Experiment in the Sub-Arctic Region (CAESAR) campaign. The airborne measurements covered a wide vertical range, from the near-surface to the free troposphere, across remote regions between Scandinavia and the coast of Greenland. A merged particle distribution product, spanning from 10 nm to 3 μm in diameter, was developed by combining a suite of five aerosol sensors. Number closure was achieved between the different instruments. Estimated aerosol concentration from the merged size distribution varied between ∼50 and ∼ 700 scm−3. Refractory black carbon mass concentrations (70–800 nm) varied between ∼0.9 and ∼ 80.4 ng sm−3. Aerosol mass concentration observations were compared to the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System composition forecast (GEOS-CF). The model concentrations correlated with the observations exhibit agreement with the spatial and temporal distribution of localized black carbon aerosol plumes. During Research Flight (RF) 09, the black carbon mass concentration model-vs-observation Pearson correlation coefficient r is 0.84. Observed fine particulate matter (PM2.5) were significantly larger than the model concentrations within the marine boundary layer (MBL). The high observed PM2.5 concentrations were due to coarse mode aerosol, suggesting that the model did not accurately capture sea-spray production. Over the study domain, the median normalized mean bias (NMB) was −2454% and the normalized mean root square error (NMRSE) was 35% for PM2.5; and 1372% (10,619%) and 90% (177%) for refractory black carbon within the marine boundary layer (free troposphere), respectively. The dataset and data/model intercomparison provide new constraints for understanding aerosol properties in the Arctic region."

 Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) intensity estimation can improve the effectiveness of numerical forecasts of TC intensity. The similarity between the TC categories and the significant differences within each category make this task highly challenging. In TC intensity estimation, the most discriminative features are in the center region of the TC. The limitations of existing methods are from their failure to effectively capture both local and global feature simultaneously. In this paper, a hybrid network is proposed in which Weight Aggregated Convolution adaptively adjusts kernel weights to capture local features, while linear attention is used to model global dependencies. In addition, a wavelet transform convolution layer is added to improve frequency domain sensitivity for more efficient feature extraction and comprehensive data understanding. The proposed WAWL-Net model effectively integrates local structural details and global contextual dependencies for TC intensity estimation, significantly improving the model's ability to accurately estimate the TC intensity with lower computational complexity. The effectiveness of our network was validated using multi-channel (IR, WV, PMW) channel data on the TCIR benchmark, where it achieved state-of-the-art performance."

 By combining geostationary satellite observations, cloud-to-ground (CG) lightning detections, and radar composite reflectivity (CR) mosaics, this study investigates the intensity, evolution, and distribution of CG lightning and CR associated with mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). A total of 551 MCSs are identified in central-eastern China during May–September of 2018–2021 using Fengyun-4 A satellite brightness temperature (BT) data and subsequently matched with CG lightning and CR mosaics. The geographical analysis of CG lightning associated with MCSs reveals that the highest occurrences are most frequent in the transition zone between the Poyang Lake Plain and the surrounding mountains. The proportion of negative-polarity flashes is relatively lower in MCS-related CG lightning than in total CG lightning. An overall negative correlation between BT and the peak current of CG lightning is observed with seasonal variations. The positive correlations detected in May and September may be attributed to the advection of ice particles from convective cores into adjacent stratiform regions, driven by stronger mid-to-upper-level winds. The peak occurrence of CG lightning precedes the maximum MCS extent by 0–2 h. As the MCS develops, the proportion of convective clouds decreases, while that of non-precipitating anvil increases, and the stratiform regions consistently account for 50%–60% of the total MCS extent, dominating throughout its lifespan. The stratiform region is predominantly located in the southern part of the MCS, whereas convective clouds are mainly situated in the northern part, possibly influenced by the Meiyu front."

 As an air pollutant and atmospheric oxidant, tropospheric ozone (O3) is also recognized as a significant greenhouse gas and a key radiatively active species in the atmosphere. In this study, we examine the impact of tropospheric ozone–radiation interactions, explicitly quantifying the effects of meteorological feedback (TrO3-Met) and photolysis feedback (TrO3-Phot) on near-surface O3 concentrations over eastern China in June by using the WRF-Chem model embedded with improved process analysis scheme. A ten-year averaged simulation from 2010 to 2019 is conducted to improve the representativeness of quantified contributions of TrO3-Met and TrO3-Phot. Results show that TrO3-Met increases O3 concentrations by an average of +0.1 μg·m−3 over eastern China, with more pronounced effects over the North China Plain (NCP, +0.4 μg·m−3), the Yangtze River Delta (YRD, +0.5 μg·m−3), and the Pearl River Delta (PRD +0.1 μg·m−3), and the enhanced vertical mixing from aloft to the lower level is the dominant process contributing to the elevated O3 levels. TrO3-Phot reduces daytime ozone photolysis rate (J[O1D]) by 34.5% and OH radical concentrations by 21.0%, resulting in 1.0% reduction (−1.0 μg·m−3) in surface O3 over eastern China, with more substantial reductions over the NCP (−7.8%), YRD (−6.4%), and PRD (−4.2%). The intensified chemical removal process is primarily responsible for the overall decline. Further analysis of O3-related gas-phase chemical reactions based on integrated reaction rate reveals that weakened HOx-driven oxidation increases the participation of tropospheric O3 in alternative oxidation pathways, resulting in a negative net O3 production rate, thereby explaining the reduction in surface O3 concentrations."

 Southwest China, characterized by complex topography and pronounced land surface heterogeneity, demands high-quality precipitation data for land surface processes monitoring and modeling. However, the quality of existing gridded precipitation products in this region remains unclear. Using high-density meteorological station observations from 525 national stations and 13,713 regional stations covering 2016–2020, this study comprehensively evaluates eight mainstream gridded precipitation products, including three satellite-based (GSMaP-Gauge, IMERG-Final, GSMaP-Mvk), two model-based (ERA5, ERA5-Land), and three merged (MSWEP, CMFD, GLDAS) products. Results suggest that: (1) none of the products possess satisfactory performance (KGE < 0) over the entire region, and the uncertainty in precipitation estimation—reflected by inter-product discrepancies—increases significantly (from ∼150 mm/y to ∼400 mm/y) with terrain complexity (from ∼25 m to ∼1000 m of sub-grid heterogeneity); (2) all products can reasonably capture seasonal variability but fail to characterize extremely heavy and light rainfall events, and model-based products exhibit relatively better precipitation detection capability (e.g., with POD >0.90 and CSI > 0.50 for ERA5 and ERA5-Land); (3) while most products exhibit relatively favorable consistency with observations from national stations, their performance is remarkably degraded over regional stations (e.g., monthly KGE values decrease from >0.50 to <0 for all products). Additional analyses reveal that model-based products (e.g., ERA5 and ERA5-Land) can better depict the spatial distribution of precipitation in complex and sparsely monitored regions, and the incorporation of gauge observations can further mitigate abovementioned uncertainties (e.g., with Bias <60 mm/y and RMSE <345 mm/y for GSMaP-Gauge and MSWEP)."

 Monsoon systems underpin the water, food, and economic security of over two-thirds of the global population, yet they are entering a state of instability as global temperatures have now surpassed +1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. This crossing of the 1.5 °C threshold raises a critical problem: Are monsoon onset, duration, and extreme rainfall already shifting in detectable, regionally differentiated ways? Using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 2020 framework, we screened 784 peer-reviewed studies (2000–2024) and synthesized 72 high-quality articles. A complementary global diagnostic using Climate Hazards Group InfraRed Precipitation with Stations (CHIRPS; 1981–2024) ensured uniform comparison across monsoon regions. Results reveal onset shifts of ±15 days, rainfall-intensity increases of +10–60%, and duration changes of ±15 days, with the strongest signals in South Asia, East Asia, the Western North Pacific, and Southeast Asia. Attribution using CMIP5/CMIP6, ERA5, TRMM, GPM, and IMERG identifies El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD), sea-surface temperature anomalies, and greenhouse-gas (GHG)–aerosol interactions as dominant drivers. Although seasonal totals often change modestly, clustering of extremes and lengthening dry spells markedly elevate compound flood–drought risk. This review establishes the first harmonized global baseline of observed monsoon change and highlights urgent needs for convection-permitting regional models, improved subseasonal prediction, expanded observational networks, and increased representation of African and South American monsoon systems."

However, LWP increases for non-precipitating thick clouds, opposite to satellite-based decreases, due to excessive precipitation, moist bias in cloud-top humidity, and cloud droplet number–LWP relations from internal cloud processes, rather than aerosol-cloud interaction. 
 Aerosol–cloud interactions (ACI) remain the largest source of uncertainty in model estimates of anthropogenic radiative forcing, primarily because of deficiencies in representing aerosol–cloud microphysical processes that lead to inconsistent cloud liquid water path (LWP) responses to aerosol perturbations between observations and models. To investigate this discrepancy, we conducted a series of large-eddy-scale simulations driven by realistic meteorology over the eastern North Atlantic, and evaluated LWP susceptibility, precipitation processes, and boundary layer thermodynamics using satellite and ground-based observations.Simulated LWP responses show a strong dependence on cloud state. Non-precipitating thin clouds exhibit a modest LWP decrease with increasing cloud droplet number concentration (Nd), consistent in sign but weaker in magnitude than satellite estimates, reflecting enhanced turbulent mixing and evaporation. The largest model-observation discrepancy occurs in non-precipitating thick clouds, where simulated LWP susceptibilities are strongly positive (+0.32) while observations indicate large negative values (−0.69). This discrepancy stems from excessive precipitation driven by underestimated entrainment, overly active accretion, and overly broad drop-size distributions in polluted conditions. While our high-resolution setup mitigates the excessive drizzling common in coarser models and captures key regime transitions, these biases persist – highlighting that improved parameterizations of cloud-top processes, precipitation, and aerosol effects are needed beyond simply increasing model resolution.Additionally, misrepresented moisture inversions in reanalysis introduce a moist bias in cloud-top relative humidity, further amplifying positive LWP susceptibility. Our results also suggest that large negative Nd–LWP relationships in observations may reflect internal cloud processes rather than true ACI effects."

Here we show different thermodynamic models differed in the NH4NO3 non-ideality representations, resulting in discrepancies in nitrate gas–particle partitioning predictions. The driving factors of chemical profiles and meteorological conditions are also investigated. This discrepancy can be an important source of uncertainty in air quality predictions. 
 Semi-volatile NH4NO3 is a major component of atmospheric aerosols, and its environmental and climate effects are largely regulated by the gas-particle partitioning. The activity coefficient of NH4NO3, γAN, is one key parameter controlling the gas-particle partitioning of nitrate, with lower γAN typically favouring particle-phase partitioning of nitrate. However, the γAN dependence on meteorological condition and chemical profile remains uncertain. Here we investigated into this issue with comprehensive simulations and ambient observations, based on results of three widely-used thermodynamic models, i.e. ISORROPIA, E-AIM, and AIOMFAC. Correspondingly, AIOMFAC estimate higher particle phase nitrate fp,NO3- values. Across all models, γAN2 ranges between 10−2 and 10−1, with AIOMFAC results ∼ 33 % lower than E-AIM and ISORROPIA. Correspondingly, AIOMFAC estimate higher particle phase nitrate fp,NO3- values. For all three models and all chemical profiles tested, the γAN2 correlates positively with relative humidity (RH) and temperature, and RH generally contributes larger variations. In comparison, the effect of chemical composition on γAN2 is more complex and is strongly modulated by RH, with differed dependence pattern observed at varying RH levels. Furthermore, γAN2 responds more strongly to changes of particle chemical profile in E-AIM, whereas in ISORROPIA and AIOMFAC γAN2 is more sensitive to meteorological variations. As E-AIM is typically considered as the benchmark thermodynamic model, these results suggest the potential under-representation of chemical profiles in predicting γAN2 for ISORROPIA and AIOMFAC. The corresponding influence on 3-D chemical-transport model predictions of NH4NO3 are encouraged in future studies."

We used a high-resolution model to simulate many instances of the transition with different environmental conditions. In low aerosol conditions, the transition occurred faster due to drizzle depleting the cloud of moisture and aerosol, whereas in high aerosol conditions, other factors were more important. Understanding different regimes is important for accurately simulating clouds in global models. 
 Stratocumulus-to-cumulus transitions are driven primarily by increasing sea-surface temperatures, with additional contributions from numerous interacting cloud-controlling factors. Understanding these interactions is important for improving the accuracy of cloud responses to changes in climate and other environmental factors in global climate models. Many studies have found lower-tropospheric stability dictates the transition time, while aerosol-focused studies found that aerosol concentration plays a key role via the drizzle-depletion mechanism. We consider the role of aerosol together with several other cloud-controlling factors representing a selection of the wider environmental conditions that affect drizzle in a clean to moderately polluted environment. A 34-member perturbed parameter ensemble of idealised large-eddy simulations with 2-moment cloud microphysics is used to train Gaussian process emulators (statistical representations) of the relationships between the factors and two properties of the transition: transition temporal length and average rain water path. We base the ensemble around a composite of trajectories in the Northeastern Pacific during summer. Using these emulators, parameter space can be densely sampled to visualise the joint and individual effects of the factors on the transition properties. We find that in the low-aerosol regime (< 200 cm−3) the transition time is most strongly affected by the aerosol concentration out of the factors considered here. Fast transitions, under 40 h, occur in this regime with high mean rain water path, which is consistent with a drizzle-depletion effect. In the high-aerosol regime, the inversion strength becomes more important than the aerosol concentration through the inversion's effect on entrainment and the deepening-warming decoupling mechanism."

Salinity increased significantly in Lake Daihai and Lake Dalinor. The dataset can contribute to research on salinization prevention and salinity budget research. 
 Lake salinity is an important parameter to characterize physical and biogeochemical processes and a fundamental indicator to evaluate lake water quality. However, its estimation in inland waters has been challenging because passive microwave salinity satellites lack sufficient spatial resolution, and optical satellites cannot directly measure it. To address it, we constructed a framework for estimating lake salinity by combining Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI) data. It can be summarized in step 1: construct a salinity mechanism model based on SAR data using the Elfouhaily spectrum, dielectric constant, and small perturbation method (SPM) models; step 2: develop four machine learning (ML) salinity algorithms using quasi-synchronous salinity and MSI with SAR imagery; and step 3: build an ensemble model to estimate salinity by coupling the mechanism and ML models via a generalized additive model. The proposed integrated algorithm (N= 84, RMSE = 0.60 ppt, and MAPE = 2.3 %) outperformed single-satellite microwave mechanistic or ML models across all eleven lakes in the Inner Mongolia Xinjiang Lake zone. On this basis, we reconstructed the lake salinity dataset for 2016–2024 and conducted independent validation (N= 65, R2= 0.97, and RMSE = 0.89 ppt) and pixel-level histogram validation confirmed dataset quality, with no significant systematic bias across lake types. The reconstruction revealed a spatial pattern of smooth transition from the nearshore to the center and trends with significant increases in Lake Daihai and Lake Dalinor. The dataset and its development framework will facilitate exploration of salinity status and trends in inland lakes, providing scientific evidence and methodological support for salinization prevention and global lake salinity budget research.

This open dataset extends existing records and supports environmental monitoring, offshore infrastructure management, and planning of mitigation strategies. 
 Accurate information on the location and operational status of offshore oil and gas platforms (OOGPs) is important to inform decision-making by various stakeholders and to evaluate the environmental impacts of OOGPs. However, existing OOGP databases are often incomplete or outdated data. In this work, we use satellite data and the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform to construct a new database of OOGPs for six major offshore oil and gas basins in the world between 2017 and 2023. We use synthetic aperture radar (SAR) images from the Sentinel-1 satellite mission to detect OOGP candidates due to its high sensitivity to OOGPs, dense spatio-temporal sampling, and global coverage. Our main processing steps comprise the detection of OOGP candidates using monthly averages of SAR images and the removal of noise and false positive objects from annual image composites. With the resulting dataset of OOGPs, we map the spatiotemporal distribution of OOGPs in the study regions and analyze platform status after the post-processing of the platform targets. Using these methods, we identified a total of 5,358 OOGPs distributed in six offshore basins: the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) (1,593), Persian Gulf (PG) (1,437), North Sea (440), Caspian Sea (CS) (794), Gulf of Guinea (460), and Gulf of Thailand (634). An independent validation dataset was used to evaluate the performance of the detection algorithm, which achieved an extraction accuracy of 98 %. This OOGPs dataset substantially enhances and complements the existing offshore platform database in terms of spatial and temporal coverage. From our analysis of this OOGP dataset, we observed that offshore platform activity has declined in regions like the GoM due to infrastructure aging and policy shifts, while it has expanded in the PG and CS, reflecting ongoing offshore development. These different regional trends highlight the need for targeted environmental oversight and region-specific mitigation strategies."

We release an open global dataset of temperature-driven vertical thermoelastic displacement for ~15,000 stations (2000–2023), computed from hourly temperature fields and site-specific soil and rock properties. The dataset helps improve the consistency of GNSS height time series for long-term land-motion studies. 
 The nonlinear signals in global GNSS station height time series reflects both non-tidal mass loading (atmospheric, oceanic, and hydrological) and temperature-driven thermoelastic deformation (TED). However, a globally consistent and reproducible TED data product has long been lacking. Here we present a global dataset of vertical TED for ~15,000 GNSS stations spanning 2000–2023, generated using a full-spectrum, layered finite-element model. The model is driven by hourly ERA5 soil-temperature profiles and parameterized with depth-dependent thermophysical properties from the SoilGrids dataset, enabling consistent quantification of TED from semi-diurnal/diurnal variability through seasonal to interannual timescales. Compared with an identical homogeneous-medium benchmark, subsurface stratification typically changes annual amplitudes by ~0.3 mm and shifts the timing of the annual maximum by ~1 month, yielding regionally coherent and smoothly varying spatial patterns. At stations with independent site characterization, the site-constrained solutions agree closely with SoilGrids-based solutions, with annual-amplitude differences of 0.01–0.03 mm and annual-phase differences mostly within 1–3°. Sensitivity tests using ±10% perturbations in thermal expansion, thermal diffusivity, and Young’s modulus indicate that annual-cycle amplitude and phase are robust. Globally, annual TED amplitudes are typically 1–2 mm, exceed 2–3 mm at some stations, and reach peak-to-peak values up to ~5 mm, with the largest signals concentrated in arid inland and continental climate regions. When TED corrections are applied together with non-tidal mass-loading corrections, the residual vertical dispersion decreases at most stations, with vertical scatter reduced by up to ~70 % at selected sites.

 We developed the WULFFSS, a stochastic monthly gridded forest-fire model for the western United States (US). Operating at 12 km resolution, WULFFSS calculates monthly probabilities of fires that burn at least 100 ha of forest area as well as the forest area burned per fire. The model is forced by variables related to vegetation, topographic, anthropogenic, and climate factors, organized into three indices representing spatial, annual-cycle, and lower frequency temporal domains. These indices can interact, so variables promoting fire in one domain amplify fire-promoting effects in another. Fire probability and size models use multiple logistic and linear regression, respectively, and can be easily updated as new data or ideas emerge. During its training period of 1985–2024, WULFFSS captures 71 % and 86 % of observed interannual variability in western US forest-fire frequency and area, respectively. It reproduces regional differences in seasonal timing, frequencies, and sizes of fires, and performs well in cross-validation exercises that test the model's accuracy in years or regions not considered during model training. While lacking fine-scale fire dynamics, use of classic statistics promotes interpretability and efficient ensemble generation. Designed to run within a vegetation ecosystem model, bidirectional feedbacks between vegetation and fire can identify how ecosystem changes have altered or will alter fire-climate relationships across the western US. The model's predictive power should improve with increasingly accurate and extensive observational data, and its approach can be extended to other regions. Here we provide a thorough description of the WULFFSS model, including the motivation underlying its development, caveats to our approach, and areas for future improvement."

This study elucidates the impact of alternating aerobic–anoxic conditions on metabolism of the two phylogenetically distinct groups of methanotrophs: Methylomonas koyamae (type I, γ-proteobacteria) and Methylocystis bryophila (type II, α-proteobacteria). Using batch cultivations with single and repeated oxygen pulses, we demonstrated that cyclic aerobic–anoxic alternation significantly increased the secretion of organic compounds. Notably, acetate secretion by the type II methanotroph M. bryophila was observed for the first time. Genome-scale metabolic modeling and flux balance analysis revealed that acetate secretion serves as an auxiliary ATP-generating pathway for M. bryophila under oxygen limitation. We further uncovered a dynamic mechanism: aerobic phases trigger methane uptake and build up intracellular organic carbon pools, while anoxic phases redirect these pools toward acetate and/or hydrogen release to sustain survival under oxygen limitation. This cyclic regimen effectively channels more methane-derived carbon into extracellular acetate. Our findings underscore that redox conditions critically shape methanotrophic metabolism, influencing both the biological methane cycle and the global climate."

However, the aridity threshold at which the transition occurs and how the controls over different soil C fractions shift remain unclear. Here, we conducted a 2400 km transect survey across 45 sites spanning a broad aridity gradient in temperate grasslands of China. We identified a pronounced shift in the dominant drivers of soil C storage at an aridity threshold of 0.749. Below this threshold, complex vegetation structures enhanced soil C by promoting microbial activity and mineral abundance, which stimulated the accumulation of both POM and MAOM, with a stronger effect on POM. Above the threshold, fine roots dominated soil biochemical processes, sustaining microbial activity and mineral formation that indirectly stabilized SOC, particularly via MAOM. Across the entire aridity gradient, vegetation structure mediated surface soil susceptibility to wind erosion with complex structures providing effective protection, while simpler structures offered limited buffering. These findings highlight the dual role of vegetation-mediated C input and wind erosion protection in sustaining soil stocks in drylands, underscoring the need to account for canopy and root structure when species are selected for dryland restoration."

While studies have examined either chemical composition or toxicity, comprehensive investigations combining both remain limited. Here, we conducted an in-depth physicochemical characterization of airborne, size-separated BWP from two brake pad types and comprehensively assessed their in vitro toxicity using human lung epithelial cells (A549). Iron, primarily in the form of iron oxide, was the most abundant element in the wear particles (33–50% by mass), with evidence pointing to the brake disc as the main source. A surprisingly high resemblance in elemental composition at the nano- and microscale was observed. This, along with an absence of clear differences in metal profiles or toxicological responses between size fractions, suggests that brake wear microparticles may form through compaction of vapor-condensed nanoparticles on the friction surfaces, followed by their release through mechanical shearing. Acellular and cellular assays showed the concentration-dependent ability of all studied particles to induce reactive oxygen species production, antioxidant depletion, and oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage. The nonasbestos organic pad, with more than 50-fold higher copper levels than the low-metallic pad, induced stronger DNA damage and acellular antioxidant depletion, suggesting copper as a potential source for the enhanced toxicity."

Hornbuckle,Widespread Emissions of Polychlorinated Biphenyls from Building Materials in Vermont Schools,"In collaboration with Vermont state and school officials, we conducted a research study to measure emissions of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) from room surfaces in Vermont schools. Our study, the largest of its kind, investigated the sources of airborne PCBs in indoor school environments. Using simultaneous deployment of air samplers and emission samplers, we measured airborne PCBs in 16 schools and 98 school rooms constructed prior to 1980. There was a wide range in PCB air concentrations (1.7–5700 ng m–3, n = 159) and surface emissions (33–830,000 ng m–2 d–1, n = 182) across different schools as well as between rooms in the same school. We found that emissions of PCB congeners from walls, floors, ceiling and wall expansion joint caulking, and spray insulation explain the airborne PCB congener concentrations in many rooms. Our emission samplers identified three distinct types of building materials with emissions exceeding 30,000 ng m–2 d–1 including expansion joint sealant (up to 480,000 ng m–2 d–1), glass block windows (up to 30,000 ng m–2 d–1), and fireproof coating on steel columns (up to 830,000 ng m–2 d–1). Consequently, school staff have an estimated excess lifetime cancer risk from both dioxin-like and nondioxin-like PCBs that ranges from 1.3 × 10–8 to 1.7 × 10–4 for central tendency exposure, and 2.8 × 10–8 to 3.8 × 10–4 for reasonable maximum exposure (State of Vermont’s target cancer risk = 1 × 10–6). Although production has been banned for decades, our study illustrates that PCBs continue to pose an exposure risk to occupants due to their long history of use in building materials. Our findings underscore the risks associated with the historic presence of PCB-containing building materials, offering critical insights for community efforts aimed at reducing exposure among children and school staff in thousands of schools across the country."

This study investigated temporal variations of 26 per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in four alpine lake sediment cores across the TP spanning 1952–2020. Total PFAS concentrations ranged from 43.7 to 1428 pg g–1 of dw. Linear regression of log-transformed PFAS concentration revealed a significant elevation-dependent trend across the studied lakes (R2 = 0.58, p < 0.01) after excluding the lower-altitude, more human-impacted Qinghai Lake (3190 m), supporting mountain cold-trapping of these pollutants in high-altitude environments. Ranwu Lake demonstrated a unique PFAS profile dominated by perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), which contributed 48% of total PFASs on average, reflecting the predominant influence of glacier meltwater input pathways. The deposition flux exhibited an overall increasing trend, with fluctuations between 7.62 and 258 pg cm–2 a–1 during the studied period. Following a phase of relative stability or slight decline in the 1980s–1990s, all lakes showed a pronounced and sustained rise after 2000. Notably, the doubling time of short-chain PFBA (C4) flux in these lakes was estimated to be 7.4–15.6 years since the post-2000 period. Compositional analysis revealed a global shift from long-chain to short-chain PFASs in TP lake sediments, as reflected by declining PFOS (C8) and rapidly increasing levels of PFBA. The sedimentary record reveals temporal PFAS trends that closely track the historical evolution of global and regional PFAS emissions. Our findings provide crucial insights into the long-term trends of PFAS pollution in high-altitude ecosystems, contributing to global PFAS management efforts by assessing the effectiveness of regulations and the environmental impacts of industrial relocations."

Recent studies have demonstrated that sunscreen chemicals can undergo sea-to-air transport via sea spray aerosols (SSA). However, their transformation behavior and environmental fate in the aerosol phase remain poorly understood. This study reports the heterogeneous oxidation kinetics and mechanisms of three typical sunscreen chemicals (4-methylbenzylidene camphor (4-MBC), benzophenone-4 (BP-4), and propylparaben (PrPB)) initiated by hydroxyl radicals (OH) in the aerosol phase composed of sea salt and organic matter. The measured heterogeneous rate constants for reactions with OH ranged from 2.07 × 10–12 to 4.52 × 10–12 cm3 molecule–1 s–1, corresponding to an average atmospheric lifetime of approximately 41–89 h, indicating their potential for long-distance transport before degradation. Through the characterization of the components of aged aerosols, it was found that the functionalization reactions play a key role in the oxidation process, and the unexpected decrease in the O/C ratio of BP-4 products was attributed to sulfonic group loss. In addition, the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay indicated that the aged aerosols exhibit an overall low oxidative potential. These findings enhance our understanding of the environmental behavior and potential atmospheric impact of sunscreen chemicals in SSA."

Herein, an analysis of data from US Air Force bases was conducted to demonstrate that high levels of soil and groundwater PFAS contamination at such sites are common, particularly in testing and training areas, suggesting that prevention of PFAS leaching from such soils is a critical priority. Nonsaturated soil column experiments were conducted to optimize the use of soil-applied biochars as a low-cost strategy for adsorbing C8 perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and C4 perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS) and preventing their downward leaching. A wood-based biochar produced at >900 °C and added to the soil at 1% (m/m) was found to exhibit physio-chemical properties that facilitated excellent (>99%) retention of PFOS in a sandy loam soil. Moreover, postproduction thermal treatment (400 °C in air) of the biochar led to excellent retention of short-chain PFBS, essentially yielding nondetectable PFBS levels in the column leachate. The application of carefully selected biochars to areas with high levels of PFAS contamination at military facilities is likely a useful and low-cost approach for protecting groundwater from PFOS and PFBS (and perhaps other PFAS) contamination."

Effective defluorination methods are crucial, especially in clarifying reactive species’ roles in carbon-skeleton disruption versus C–F bond cleavage. We present a novel UV/Fe(NO3)3 system that integrates ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT), reactive nitrogen species (RNS), and singlet oxygen (1O2) to achieve 90% GenX degradation in 1 h and 99% defluorination in 6 h. Mechanistic studies under controlled atmospheres reveal a hierarchical pathway: Fe3+-triggered LMCT initiates C–C bond disruption, decarboxylation, and ether-oxygen bond cleavage, while nitrate-photolysis-derived RNS accelerates this process via electron transfer (ET). Fe2+-mediated conversion of O2 to 1O2 drives C–F bond scission, revealing an oxygen-dependent cascade defluorination involving Fe3+/Fe2+ redox cycling and RNS. Oxygen availability raises defluorination from 8 to 99%. Density functional theory calculations confirm that the Fe2+ activation of triplet O2 to 1O2 lowers the defluorination barrier by 118.8 kcal/mol. This approach works across diverse water matrices, achieving >88% defluorination of eight per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) within 12 h and remains robust in treating fluorochemical effluents. Using acidic iron-containing pickling wastewater as an in situ reagent enables >90% GenX defluorination, offering a closed-loop, additive-free, scalable solution for sustainable PFAS remediation."

Previous estimates have relied on the emission factor (EF) approach, which carries substantial uncertainties due to its inherent limitations. Here, we developed a mass-balance model to re-estimate global Hg emissions from OBB during 2010–2019, enabling quantification of emissions from individual vegetation tissues. Our results indicate that global annual Hg emissions average 280 Mg yr–1 (ranging 93–803 Mg yr–1), including 129 Mg yr–1 from vegetation-derived combustion, 81 Mg yr–1 from litterfall combustion, and 70 Mg yr–1 from peatland fires. Emissions exhibit strong latitudinal and longitudinal variability, with hotspots in central Africa, the Indo-China Peninsula, and boreal Asia. By category, the largest contributors are Africa (49%) among continents, savannas (29%) among biomes, and leaves (58%) among vegetation-derived emissions. Seasonal peaks occur in January, March, and August, while total annual emissions remain relatively stable over the decade, despite extreme anomalies such as the 2015 Indonesian fires. This approach reveals distinct emission sources and high spatial heterogeneity, providing a more accurate and nuanced assessment of Hg emissions from global OBB."

Many new mechanistic insights have been reported recently, diversifying potential α-pinene ozonolysis SOA formation pathways. However, our ability to integrate these mechanisms and kinetically simulate α-pinene ozonolysis SOA formation has not been fully evaluated. In this work, we updated the detailed α-pinene ozonolysis mechanism in the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) with processes including peroxy radical (RO2) unimolecular autoxidation and bimolecular reactions with HO2 and RO2, the fates of alkoxy radicals (RO), gas-particle partitioning, and condensed-phase dimer ester formation. A kinetic model was built to evaluate the new mechanism along with existing mechanisms in simulations of SOA mass concentrations and chemical composition. Uncertainties of key parameters such as reaction rate constants, product yields and volatilities, and gas-particle partitioning coefficients are tested to demonstrate the gaps in current understandings of the α-pinene ozonolysis mechanism. Our results suggest that uncertainties in MCM reactions, RO2 autoxidation, RO2 + RO2 dimerization kinetics, as well as the gas-particle partitioning parameters, all significantly impact α-pinene ozonolysis SOA simulations. Although the SOA mass concentrations can be well predicted by tuning the parameters within reasonable ranges, all models overestimate the SOA oxygen-to-carbon ratios and peroxide fractions, indicating unrecognized pathways. By comprehensively analyzing these uncertainties and gaps, this work provides new insights for future α-pinene ozonolysis mechanistic studies."

Here, we explore the capacity of α-cyclodextrin to absorb molecules representing odorants. The semivolatile sugar erythritol (C4H10O4) is soluble in α-cyclodextrin. It evaporates from pure seed particles in an aerosol suspension in roughly 3 h at room temperature and more slowly when mixed with α-cyclodextrin, consistent with an ideal solution (Raoult’s law). However, when erythritol evaporates from particles in the presence of other particles containing α-cyclodextrin at low relative humidity, the erythritol does not appear to be taken up into the α-cyclodextrin (unlike other sugars such as glucose, sucrose, and raffinose). This suggests that the dry α-cyclodextrin is sufficiently glassy to resist the uptake of the semivolatile polyol. In contrast, α-cyclodextrin will sorb the much more volatile sesquiterpene β-caryophyllene, showing evidence for a substantially low (favorable) activity coefficient toward this species, illustrating the capacity of α-cyclodextrin to capture and retain highly volatile compounds."

Specifically, the loss mechanisms (export, melt, deformation) and gain mechanism (replenishment) associated with MYI area variations are examined. On average, there was an annual (October‐September) MYI area loss of 1,080.3 × 103 km2 due to export, melt, and deformation of 749.2 × 103 km2, 222.5 × 103 km2, and 108.6 × 103 km2, respectively. The substantial MYI depletion was largely offset by replenishment from the aging of first‐year ice (FYI) at the end of the melt season, which on average amounted to 993.8 × 103 km2 in the Arctic Ocean. Therefore, a net annual MYI area loss of −86.5 × 103 km2 emerged in the Arctic. The consecutive occurrence of the anomalously low MYI replenishment from 2005 to 2007 was responsible for the dramatic decadal decline of MYI area between the QuikSCAT (P1:2000‐2008) and ASCAT (P2: 2009–2018) periods from 3.29 × 106 km2 during P1 dropping a half to 1.61 × 106 km2 during P2. Moreover, the recently enhanced melt and deformation processes were favorable in maintaining the Arctic MYI at the low‐level coverage during P2 relative to P1. The thermodynamic (melt and replenishment) and dynamic mechanisms (export) related to MYI variations are linked to Dipole Anomaly (DA), whereas North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) acts to influence the thermodynamic mechanism (melt and replenishment).

The FMJO typically occurs in November, whereas the FBSISO mainly occurs in early May. The FMJO onset exhibits substantially larger interannual variability. The timing of both phenomena is strongly influenced by the El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which modulates large scale atmospheric conditions, particularly through column moisture anomalies. The leading Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) mode of April column moisture anomalies displays a meridional dipolar pattern over the Indian Ocean. Its associated principal component (PC) time series shows a statistically significant correlation with the FBSISO onset date, indicating that a strong meridional moisture contrast with positive anomalies over the northern Indian Ocean favors an earlier FBSISO onset. The leading EOF mode of November column moisture anomalies exhibits a zonal dipolar pattern extending from the western equatorial Indian Ocean to the Maritime Continent, with a pronounced meridional contrast over the Maritime Continent. The corresponding PC is significantly correlated with the FMJO onset date, suggesting that a zonal moisture contrast with higher moisture over the western Pacific favors an earlier FMJO onset. These moisture anomalies are closely linked to ENSO conditions. Consequently, ENSO also modulates the onset timing of these events, although the onset dates show weaker correlations with ENSO than with monthly moisture anomalies. The physical mechanisms underlying the distinct responses of the FMJO and FBSISO to ENSO remain to be elucidated."

 Anthropogenic emissions of hydrogen (H2) are expected to rise if H2 energy technology is widely implemented as part of the green energy transition1,2. Although atmospheric H2 is not radiatively active, it warms the Earth’s climate through chemical effects on methane, ozone and water vapour1–6. Predicting the atmospheric response to anthropogenic perturbations is challenging, in part because of the limited duration of the modern instrumental record7. Ice core measurements of H2 can extend the observational record, providing information about anthropogenic and natural perturbations and the biogeochemical controls on H2 levels over long timescales. However, ice core measurements of H2 are challenging because of the high permeability of H2 in ice8,9. Here we present an ice core record of atmospheric H2 recovered from a Greenland ice core, spanning the past millennium. The record shows a 70–111% (2σ) rise in atmospheric H2 from the pre-industrial to the modern era, consistent with increasing direct emissions from fossil fuel burning and increased atmospheric concentrations of H2 precursors. The pre-industrial record also shows a 4–25% (2σ) decrease in H2 levels during the Little Ice Age (LIA), indicating that H2 biogeochemistry may be sensitive to climate change. The findings suggest that the sensitivity of H2 sources and sinks to climate warming should be considered in estimates of the radiative consequences of rising anthropogenic H2 emissions.

Additional N reductions could benefit ecosystems and human health. However, the high risk of yield loss associated with additional N reductions makes this practice unacceptable for farmers. This emphasizes the need for incentive programs that consider the responsibilities and limitations of all actors along the food supply chain. Excess nitrogen fertilization in maize production harms the environment and society, yet farmers face yield risks when reducing inputs. Using field trials across the US Corn Belt, this study suggests that nitrogen rates can be reduced by 12–16% with minimal yield risk, reducing emissions and leaching."

 Previous studies have noted that cities enhance cloud cover, but the mechanisms of urban morphological types on cloud formation remain elusive. Observations of cloud climatology from 44 major U.S. cities show that cloud enhancement increases with the street-canyon aspect ratio and decreases with building density. Here, to explain these observations, we conducted numerical experiments using urban morphology-resolving large-eddy simulations. In these simulations, urban and rural surfaces retain their respective heat-flux differences, while the moisture sources and background atmospheric water vapor are prescribed to be identical, allowing us to isolate the morphological controls on moist convection. Results show that urban morphology influences cloud formation through two mechanisms: taller buildings intensify urban-breeze circulations at the urban-rural interface, while denser buildings, acting as momentum sinks, reduce vertical turbulent transport at the urban core. These vertical motions modify the transport of moisture in the urban atmospheric boundary layer, causing different cloud amounts across different urban morphology. This study highlights the mechanistic link between urban form, vertical motions, and cloud enhancement, thus providing a basis for city-specific boundary-layer convective parameterizations in large-scale weather and climate models. Using cloud observations from 44 US cities and large-eddy simulations, this study shows that taller buildings strengthen urban-breeze updrafts, while denser buildings suppress vertical turbulence, together reshaping moisture transport and cloud formation in urban environments."

 Most tropical cyclones (TCs) originate from tropical disturbances over the western North Pacific (WNP). This study examines the tropical disturbances that developed into TCs and their relationship with maximum attained intensity. Using data from 1981 to 2020, we reveal that 29.1% of developing disturbances originated from Mixed Rossby–Gravity (MRG) waves. Compared with other origins, MRG-originated TCs intensify faster, produce more super typhoons, and reach higher lifetime maximum intensity (LMI). These developing systems typically form farther southeast and follow prolonged northwestward tracks, benefiting from a longer pre-LMI oceanic trajectory and greater exposure to favorable large-scale conditions, including warmer sea surface temperature, greater mid-level moisture, stronger convection and weaker vertical wind shear. Following their formation, the disturbances co-propagate westward with the MRG wave packet, which itself does not dissipate. 81.8% of these disturbances remain within the MRG wave packet until reaching their LMI, for an average duration of 3.7 days. The MRG wave packet provides favorable conditions for disturbance development, including warmer sea surface temperatures, enhanced moisture supply, reduced vertical wind shear, and stronger upper-level divergence—features that collectively promote intensification. Furthermore, the proportion of TCs statistically associated with MRG-related disturbances shows a significant increasing trend, underscoring an increasingly important role of MRG wave environments in modulating TC intensity."

 Arctic sea ice has undergone dramatic changes over the past four decades, leading to far-reaching climate impacts. Anomalous sea surface temperature (SST) in the extra-polar oceans is recognized as one of the principal drivers of Arctic sea ice variability. However, the relative importance of SST anomalies across different ocean basins remains uncertain. Here, we employ a deep neural network (DNN) model to reconstruct Arctic sea ice extent (SIE) variability independently using the observational daily SST anomaly fields in the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans. We find that the Atlantic SST-based DNN produces the best and most stable reconstruction of Arctic SIE, a result that cannot be achieved by a linear regression model. In particular, based on explainable AI techniques, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf Stream are identified as key regions where SST variability has the most pronounced influence on Arctic SIE. The superiority of DNN over the regression model in SIE reconstruction elucidates the integral role of Atlantic SST interannual variability in modulating Arctic sea ice, likely through the SST-driven latent heat flux anomalies in those key regions. These findings highlight the importance of interannual Atlantic SST variations to Arctic sea ice variability, underpinned by the ability of DNN to capture their complex teleconnections."

 Glaciers in Alaska contribute greatly to sea-level rise and are losing mass at a faster rate than any other region. Yet, our understanding of ongoing changes and ability to model them are hindered by a lack of observations, particularly at high spatiotemporal resolution. Here, we leverage Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data to produce temporally-varying glacier melt extents and snowlines from mid-2016 to 2024 for 99% of glaciers in Alaska greater than 2 km2. The melt extents are strongly correlated with temperatures, revealing that each 1°C increase in summer temperature causes up to 3 additional weeks of glacier melt. The high spatiotemporal resolution also captures subseasonal changes such as the 2019 heat wave, which caused subregional snowlines to retreat up to 105 m higher and exposed up to 28% more of the underlying glacier compared to typical years. Our snowlines agree well with optical datasets (r2 up to 0.94), thus providing unprecedented reliable data unencumbered by clouds or lighting conditions. Moving forward, our automated, open-source workflow can easily be applied to other regions. These data also present unique opportunities to calibrate and validate large-scale glacier evolution models, a critical step for improving projections of glacier changes and their impacts."

 Over the past few decades, China’s cropland configuration has changed markedly, with important implications for food security and agricultural sustainability. Here we examine how cropland spatial-temporal concentration relates to agricultural intensification across China from 2000 to 2020. We mapped cropland distribution for five benchmark years using Google Earth Engine platform and 234,804 Landsat images and quantified cropland landscape configuration. These data were combined with provincial statistics on crop yield, fertilizer application, irrigation water use, and agricultural machinery power. We find that cropland experienced a contraction phase from 2000 to 2015 followed by a recovery phase after 2015. During contraction, increases in crop production commonly coincided with rising fertilizer and machinery inputs, whereas during recovery these inputs declined in most regions, alongside increased cropland contiguity. Overall, agricultural intensification in China became more sustainable by reducing reliance on fertilizer and machinery inputs and placing greater emphasis on cropland-use efficiency and environmental protection.

 Time-series analysis is a crucial component of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) pixel offset tracking (POT), directly impacting the accuracy of deformation monitoring. However, most existing time-series approaches struggle with precise long-term monitoring, particularly for landslide experiencing long-term large deformation. The widely used Pixel Offset–Small Baseline Subset (PO-SBAS) method supports long-term analysis but often underestimates deformation in high-gradient regions. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Robust Sequential Pixel Offset Tracking (RS-POT) method. RS-POT initially derives short-term deformations using a single-reference POT approach, then sequentially integrates them into a complete deformation time series through a robust fusion strategy. This ensures both long-term continuity and high accuracy in capturing large deformations. Simulation results show that RS-POT provides accurate deformation estimates in 94.42% of the study area. In a case study of the Qiantaishan landslide, RS-POT outperforms PO-SBAS through reducing the root mean square error (RMSE) with reference to global navigation satellite system (GNSS) measurements by 51.51% in the azimuth direction and 43.61% in the line-of-sight (LOS) direction. Additionally, due to fewer image pairs being required, RS-POT improves computational efficiency by 122% compared to PO-SBAS. Further simulations confirm that RS-POT performs reliably under large-gradient deformation conditions, and it is applicable to various landslide types, including traction, thrust, and homogeneous landslides. These results demonstrate that RS-POT offers a more accurate and efficient solution for long-term landslide deformation monitoring."

 Reliable mapping of windthrow, a common abiotic disturbance in Canadian forests, is crucial for effective forest management and conservation, and remote sensing is becoming a useful tool for this purpose. Due to the spectral similarity of disturbances like windthrow, logging, and insect outbreaks, pixel-based approaches show limitations for accurate windthrow detection at large scales, underscoring the need for a method to distinguish windthrow events across the Canadian boreal forest. In this study, we developed and evaluated a new approach to detect windthrow-affected forest areas, primarily in the boreal forests of Eastern Canada, covering over 90 million hectares from 2019 to 2024. The method integrates deep learning (DL) models with 10 m Sentinel-2 annual composites and incorporates the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm to improve timestamp estimation. We trained and evaluated the performance of machine and DL approaches, namely, LinkNet, CResU-Net, ResU-Net, DeepLabv3+, and Random Forest. Among them, CResU-Net, an enhanced variant of ResU-Net with a convolutional block attention module, demonstrated the best performance, achieving an overall accuracy of 98.79%, a producer’s accuracy of 75.31%, and an Intersection over Union (IoU) of 58.7% using reference data from a major windthrow event in Canada, the May 2022 Canadian derecho. Including CCDC improved our yearly timestamp to monthly timestamp for 63% of the windthrow affected area with a delay of 1–2 months relative to the event. A historical windthrow map from 2019 to 2024 was generated, highlighting the potential of combining DL and Sentinel-2 imagery for accurate and scalable windthrow detection and characterization."

 Frequent and severe wildfires driven by climate change intensify the need for accurate burned area (BA) mapping, which can be effectively addressed using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) due to its cloud-penetration capability and sensitivity to vegetation and moisture changes. However, BA mapping based on SAR-only approaches relies on U-Net with ResNet50 backbone or fully convolutional neural network, while the potential of advanced architectural components remains underexplored. Moreover, prior research primarily emphasizes log-ratio features, with limited focus on standalone capacity of dual polarized vegetation indices (VIs). This study addresses these gaps by evaluating the performance of five U-Net variants (U-Net, Attention U-Net, Residual Attention U-Net, U-Net++, and U-Net 3 +) using four input schemes: log-ratio, log-ratio without cross-ratio, VIs, and a combined feature set of all. Three combinations of loss function such as binary cross entropy (BCE), dice, and focal are also applied to the best model of all scheme. Experimental results show that U-Net++ with log-ratio inputs under BCE loss function achieves the highest performance, yielding an F1 score of 0.8218 and an Intersection of Union (IoU) of 0.6795. Further analysis reveals that VIs alone can effectively delineate burned areas (F1: 0.8244; IoU: 0.7013) with focal loss, and combining them with log-ratio features delivers the best performance (F1: 0.8364; IoU: 0.7188), when dice and focal loss functions are applied. Overall, this study offers a quantitative evaluation of how dual-polarized VIs and deep learning architectures affect SAR-based BA mapping performance and suggests promising directions for future enhancement through advanced feature extraction techniques."

 Reliable characterization of nighttime cloud cover (CC) remains challenging due to the limited availability of long-term ground-based observations and the lack of coordinated multi-instrument measurements. This study presents a coordinated nighttime cloud observation framework that integrates standardized ground-based camera systems with collocated meteorological measurements, lidar-derived cloud base height (CBH), pyrgeometer-based net longwave radiation, and Himawari satellite’s CC across four sites in East Asia — Chiba, Toyama, Shiga (Japan), and Taoyuan (Taiwan). A continuous six-year nighttime CC record is available at the Chiba site that can be used to assess of seasonal variability and cloud-environment relationships. Unlike previous studies that rely on single instruments or isolated locations, this work systematically analyzes nighttime CC in relation to near-surface temperature, relative humidity (RH), cloud base height, and longwave radiation using a unified methodology. In persistently humid conditions such as Taoyuan, enhanced atmospheric water vapor suppresses the increase of CC with near-ground temperature. At the same site, net longwave radiation increases by 1.778 W m−2 per 1% increase in CC. In Chiba, a pronounced decrease in CC with increasing CBH (approximately −4.931% km−1). These results exhibit the value of coordinated multi-site nighttime observations using standardized ground-based instrumentation. The study provides a methodological foundation for expanding nighttime cloud monitoring networks and offers observational constraints useful for validating satellite-based nighttime CC and improving the representation of nighttime clouds in atmospheric models."

We investigate how volcanic eruptions may have occasionally triggered abrupt climate change during the last glacial period. Our results show that very large equatorial eruptions can induce large changes in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation via atmospheric and ocean circulation changes and air-sea buoyancy fluxes, potentially pushing the climate system between persistent warm and cold states lasting millennia.

Based on microphysical properties, we show that within these clouds a distinction must be made between classic mixed-phase clouds and a mixed-phase haze regime. Instead of supercooled droplets, the haze regime contains large wet sea salt aerosols. These findings improve our understanding of Arctic low-level cloud processes. 
 A comprehensive in-situ dataset of low-level Arctic clouds was collected in the Fram Strait during the HALO-(AC)3 campaign in spring 2022 using the research aircraft Polar 6. The clouds observed at altitudes below 1000 m were frequently in a mixed-phase state. We demonstrate that despite comparable optical properties, classic mixed-phase clouds (MPC) and mixed-phase haze (MPH) can be distinguished on the basis of their microphysical properties, with MPH observed about 8 times more frequently than MPC. While the thermodynamic phases of the particles within the MPH are similar to those in the MPC, the supercooled droplets observed in MPC are replaced by large (> 3 µm) wet aerosol particles in MPH. Furthermore, the particle number concentration measured in MPH is reduced by approximately 3 orders of magnitude compared to MPC. MPH is observed in subsaturated air with respect to water, suggesting that the small liquid particles are haze droplets and are in equilibrium below the activation threshold to form cloud droplets. Chemical analysis suggested that the haze particles contained significant amounts of sea salt. Additional in-situ measurements with an optical particle counter indicated that their number concentration was 2 times larger over the sea ice compared to the open ocean. Furthermore, measurements of the vertical distribution of the thermodynamic phases in low-level Arctic clouds revealed a characteristic structure, with a liquid regime frequently occurring at the top of the atmospheric boundary layer, followed by MPCs, and an MPH layer below. The findings from this study enhance our understanding of the microphysical composition of clouds in mixed-phase conditions."

It found that pollution in the Arctic is decreasing, likely due to European emission regulations, while wildfires are becoming a more important source of particles. In Antarctica, particle levels are higher near the coast than inland, and vary by season. These results help us better understand how air pollution and climate are changing at the Earth’s poles. 
 A multi-year analysis of aerosol optical depth (AOD, τ) and Ångström exponent (α) was conducted using ground-based photometer data from 15 Arctic and 11 Antarctic sites. Extending the dataset of (Tomasi et al., 2015) through December 2024, the study incorporates stellar and lunar photometric observations to fill data gaps during the polar night. Daily mean values of τ at 0.500 µm and α (0.440–0.870 µm) were used to derive monthly means and seasonal histograms.In the Arctic, persistent haze events in winter and early spring lead to peak τ values. A decreasing trend in Arctic τ suggests the impact of European emission regulations, while biomass-burning aerosols are becoming more significant. In Antarctica, τ increases from the plateau to the coast. Fine-mode aerosols dominate in summer-autumn, while coarse-mode particles are more prevalent in winter-spring. Shipborne photometer data align well with ground-based measurements, confirming the reliability of mobile observations.Trend analyses using the Mann-Kendall test and Theil-Sen regression indicate a significant negative trend in τ at Andenes (−2.43 % per year), likely driven by reduced anthropogenic emissions. Antarctic stations such as Syowa and South Pole show positive trends (+3.84 % and +3.54 % per year), though these are subject to uncertainties from data limitations and instrument changes.This work contributes to the Polar-AOD network (https://polaraod.net/, last access: 15 May 2025), enhancing the understanding of aerosol variability and long-term trends in polar regions while promoting open data access for the scientific community."

Such clouds are challenging to simulate in climate models, leading to uncertainties in the projection of polar climates. This study presents major advances in the representation of polar mixed-phase clouds in a climate model thanks to the adaptation of an original subgrid parameterization which considers interactions between turbulent eddies and clouds. 
 Representing mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) is a long-standing challenge for climate models, with major consequences regarding the simulation of radiative fluxes at high-latitudes and uncertainties in future cryosphere melting estimates. Low-level boundary-layer MPCs that prevail at high-latitudes can be either coupled or decoupled to the surface, which modulates their dynamical and microphysical properties. This study leverages a recent physically-based parameterization of phase partitioning considering an explicit coupling between microphysics and subgrid-scale dynamics and involving direct interactions between the cloud and turbulent diffusion schemes. This parameterization makes it possible to capture the structure of the decoupled state of polar boundary-layer MPCs – with a supercooled liquid dominated cloud-top sitting on top of precipitating ice crystals – in single column simulations with the LMDZ Atmospheric General Circulation Model. The positive feedback loop involving cloud-top radiative cooling induced by supercooled liquid droplets, subsequent buoyancy production of turbulence as well as the supercooled liquid water production associated with turbulence, is captured by the model. However, the liquid and cloud ice water path remain underestimated and most of the turbulence is confined near cloud top which is probably due to a missing parameterization for convective downdrafts in the model. The study further shows that accounting for the detrainment of shallow convective plume's air when diagnosing the in-cloud supersaturation makes it possible to capture the overall vertical structure of surface-coupled clouds, with realistic liquid and ice water contents. Nonetheless, a parameteric sensitivity analysis emphasizes the importance of properly calibrating the parameter controling the supercooled liquid water production term by subgrid turbulence."

Using standard gas cell measurements, it identifies key sources of modulation loss and spectral artifacts. A simple atmospheric example is included to demonstrate how these instrumental effects can influence scientific measurements. The results improve understanding of instrumental stability and support more accurate long-term use of the spectrometer. 
 This study investigates the impact of non-ideal instrumental effects on the performance of high-resolution Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectrometers, with a focus on the Bruker FTS 120M. Key non-idealities, including retroreflector misalignments, baseline drift, and spectral channeling, were systematically analyzed using advanced diagnostic tools such as ALIGN60 and LINEFIT. The nominal configuration exhibited significant anomalies, notably modulation efficiency (ME) deviations of up to +10.9 %, phase error (PE) variability of 2.11 × 10−2 radians, and spectral channeling frequencies such as a persistent 2.9044 cm−1, along with emerging frequencies around 0.24 cm−1 attributed to retroreflector wear and CaF2 beamsplitter degradation. A pronounced anomaly at 40.672 cm−1, likely induced by environmental factors such as external vibrations or mechanical instability, was also identified. Implementation of a modified configuration effectively addressed these issues, reducing PE variability to 0.042 × 10−2 radians, aligning ME within the NDACC-acceptable threshold of 1.1, and achieving substantial improvements in the instrument line shape (ILS), including sharper peaks, narrower full-width at half maximum (FWHM), and reduced sidelobe asymmetry. Analysis of HBr transmission spectra revealed improved fitting of the P(2) line, characterized by lower residuals and enhanced spectral quality. Simulated Haidinger fringes near zero path difference (ZPD) highlighted alignment degradation patterns, underscoring the necessity for precise optical adjustments. Temporal trends showed an increase in ILS peak height of >14 % associated with the instrument upgrade, together with significant mean absolute error (MAE) reductions achieved by the modified configuration. In addition, a targeted retrieval case study demonstrates that explicit propagation of the empirically characterized instrumental response into the forward model reduces spectral residuals and retrieval uncertainties while increasing the retrieved total column by approximately 6 %–7 % relative to the nominal configuration. Overall, this study provides a robust framework for diagnosing and correcting instrumental artifacts, ensuring the accuracy, reproducibility, and long-term stability of FTIR measurements essential for atmospheric trace gas retrievals."

Ward;Luke M. Western;Rachel L. Tunnicliffe;Elena Fillola;Aki Tsuruta;Tuula Aalto;Anita L. Ganesan,Uncertainty and retrieval sensitivity in TROPOMI-based methane inversions over the North Slope of Alaska,"We studied methane emissions in Arctic Alaska using satellite observations to assess how well they can monitor this important greenhouse gas. We found that emission estimates varied depending on the satellite data product and were strongly affected by assumptions in the model. Our results highlight the need for careful interpretation of emissions from Arctic satellite data and thorough testing of models, with implications for reliable climate monitoring. 
 The Arctic is experiencing unprecedented environmental changes with rapidly rising temperatures. Emissions of methane (CH4) – a potent greenhouse gas – may be increasing from the region, making accurate monitoring essential. The TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) instrument offers high spatial and temporal coverage of CH4 column mole fractions. However, its data in the Arctic has historically exhibited seasonal and latitudinal biases and low-quality retrievals. A major challenge is the lack of ground-based validation data in high-latitude regions, which are used to improve satellite retrievals. This study evaluates inverse modelling to estimate CH4 emissions using TROPOMI measurements over the North Slope of Alaska. Using two retrieval products – the operational SRON product and the scientific WFMD product from the University of Bremen – we assess the alignment of derived emissions with surface measurement-derived inversions over 2018–2020 and test their robustness through sensitivity analyses. Our results show that tundra emissions from SRON inversions align more closely with surface measurement-derived emissions than WFMD inversions. Both TROPOMI-product derived emissions have anomalously low emissions in August 2018 compared to surface measurement-derived emissions, likely due to low data density resulting from high cloud cover. TROPOMI inversions provided stronger constraints on fugitive anthropogenic emissions compared to surface inversions. However, each retrieval produced different emission estimates, highlighting retrieval-dependent differences. Sensitivity tests revealed a strong prior dependence in both retrievals, raising concerns about robustness in northern high latitudes. This study highlights the importance of using multiple retrievals and rigorous sensitivity testing in high-latitude satellite inversions."

Ford;Jamie D. Shutler;Katy L. Sheen;Gavin H. Tilstone;Vassilis Kitidis,UEx-L-Eddies: decadal and global long-lived  mesoscale eddy trajectories with coincident  air–sea CO2 fluxes and environmental conditions,"Mesoscale eddies are abundant in the global oceans affect the physical, chemical and biological properties of the ocean. These changes can modify the air–sea CO2 fluxes. Here, we present a dataset of air–sea CO2 fluxes for 5996 long lived mesoscale eddies trajectories in the global ocean between 1993 to 2022. These trajectories can be used to understand the processes modifying and controlling the air–sea CO2 fluxes in mesoscale eddies which are supported by a comprehensive uncertainty budget. 
 Mesoscale eddies are prevalent features within the global ocean that modify the physical, chemical and biological properties as they move and evolve. These modifications can alter the air–sea exchange of CO2, and therefore these features may be hotspots for enhanced or reduced CO2 uptake compared to the surrounding environment. The understanding of the global and regional effect of mesoscale eddies on ocean CO2 uptake is limited and largely based on single eddies or small regional subsets. Here, we provide a global dataset of 5996 long lived eddies trajectories (lifetimes greater than a year) with corresponding air–sea CO2 fluxes between 1993 to 2022 all tracked using a Lagrangian approach. The trajectories comprise 3244 anticyclonic (“warm core”) and 2752 cyclonic (“cold core”) eddies and the dataset provides the environmental conditions, including the CO2 fluxes, within and outside each eddy. The dataset refines a previous regional methodology with a focus on climate quality environmental parameters and uses a global neural network for estimating the fugacity of CO2 in seawater (fCO2(sw)) along with a comprehensive air–sea CO2 flux uncertainty budget. These refinements provide a robust foundation for studying the modulation of air–sea CO2 fluxes by mesoscale eddies. As an example use of the dataset, we investigate the role of mesoscale eddies in modifying the global and regional air–sea CO2 fluxes, by comparing the eddy driven air–sea CO2 flux to that of the surrounding environment. We find that globally, long-lived anticyclonic eddies enhanced the CO2 sink by 4.5±2.8 % (95 % confidence), while long-lived cyclonic eddies reduce the CO2 sink by 0.7±2.6 %. Collectively, the long-lived mesoscale eddies indicate an enhancement of the ocean CO2 sink by 2.7±1.1 Tg C yr−1. Propagating the air–sea CO2 flux uncertainties was found to be a key component needed to fully understand apparent differences between previous regional and global studies.

Using anonymous GPS signals from vehicles, we tracked traffic CO2 emission patterns throughout the year 2023. The results show that emissions vary significantly between cities and across different days and seasons. This method could help cities monitor on-road emissions in real time and design better strategies to reduce them. 
 On-road transportation is a major contributor to CO2 emissions in cities, and high-resolution CO2 traffic emission maps are essential for analyzing emission patterns and characteristics. In this study, we developed new hourly on-road CO2 emission maps with a 100 × 100 m resolution for 20 major cities in France, Germany, and the Netherlands in 2023. We used commercial Floating Car Data (FCD) based on anonymized GPS signals periodically reported by individual vehicles, providing hourly information on mean speed and the number of GPS sample counts per street. Machine learning models were developed to fill FCD data gaps and convert sample counts into actual traffic volumes, and the COPERT model was used to estimate speed- and vehicle-type-dependent emission factors. These models were calibrated using independent traffic observations available for Paris and Berlin, and subsequently applied to the remaining 18 cities in an extrapolated manner due to data availability constraints. Hourly emissions, initially estimated at the street level, were aggregated to 100 × 100 m grid cells. Annual on-road CO2 emissions across the 20 European cities in 2023 ranged from 0.4 to 7.9 Mt CO2, with emissions strongly correlated with urban area (R2= 0.98) and, to a lesser extent, population size (R2= 0.74). Spatially, emissions are either highly concentrated along major highways in cities such as Paris and Amsterdam or more evenly distributed in cities such as Berlin and Bordeaux, highlighting the need for context-specific mitigation strategies. Temporally, this study shows the CO2 emission fluctuations due to holiday periods, weekly activity cycles, and distinct usage profiles of different vehicle types. Due to the low latency of FCD, this approach could support near-real-time traffic emission mapping in the future. Our approach enhances the spatial and temporal characterization of CO2 emissions in on-road transportation compared to the conventional method used in gridded inventories, indicating the potential of FCD data for near-real-time urban emission monitoring and timely policy-making. The datasets generated by this study are available on Zenodo https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16600210 (Shi et al., 2025)."

Using mobile ultrafine particle (UFP) data in Toronto, we compared LUR models trained under random, spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal cross-validation (CV), with and without forward feature selection (FFS). Model hyperparameters and feature subsets were optimized within each CV scheme. Spatial CV folds were designed at fine scales to reflect UFP autocorrelation. Each approach was evaluated on a hold-out test set, across CV schemes, and against independent stationary backyard measurements. Models based on spatiotemporal CV coupled with FFS were able to reduce overfitting, improve generalization, and produce stable exposure surfaces. These surfaces avoided the spatial artifacts and exaggerated variable effects typically seen in models trained with random CV. Models tuned with random CV overfit, performed poorly on independent samples, and were sensitive to outliers. The average percentage error (APE) decreased from ∼217% for a model with random-CV to ∼79% with spatiotemporal CV and FFS. Our findings demonstrate that proper alignment of model design with the data’s spatiotemporal structure and modeling objective ensures reliability, minimizes data reproduction, and enables true prediction."

However, climate feedback from forestation, such as changes in wind speed and downwelling shortwave radiation following forestation driven by modified land-atmosphere heat, momentum, and moisture exchanges, could potentially compromise the availability of weather-dependent renewable energy. Here, based on coupled land-atmosphere simulations with contrasting forest distributions, our results showed that, in idealized forestation scenarios, pixels of forestation remaining suitable for renewable energy deployment are projected to experience a 27.8 ± 1.1% decline in wind energy potential and a 1.9 ± 0.1% reduction in solar energy potential. For the future emission scenario of SSP1-2.6, which is compatible with the goal of the Paris Agreement that limits global warming below 2 °C, forestation-driven reduction (−9.5 ± 1.9%) in wind energy potential for current onshore wind installations can even surpass that caused by climate change (−2.1 ± 1.5%). In contrast, solar energy change for current onshore solar installations in the SSP1-2.6 scenario is projected to be dominated by climate-driven increases (+3.9 ± 0.7%) rather than forestation-induced change (+0.3 ± 0.2%). Our study highlights the need to account for the trade-off between forestation-based carbon removal and renewable-based emission reduction when formulating climate mitigation pathways."

This study presents a century-long (1960–2100) bottom-up vehicular emission inventory for Brazil, leveraging locally derived emission factors. Our estimates reveal substantial discrepancies in magnitude, timing, and speciation of non-CO2 pollutants (CO, NMHC, PM2.5) compared to leading global inventories (EDGAR, CEDS, CAMS), highlighting critical inaccuracies in widely used data sets. More critically, future projections under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) uncover a novel positive feedback mechanism: rising temperatures significantly enhance vehicular evaporative nonmethane hydrocarbon (NMHC) emissions. This temperature-dependent increase and subsequent NMHC oxidation to CO2 suggest an overlooked pathway that could amplify climate warming and air pollution globally, particularly after a breakpoint around 2050 (p < 0.05). While historical emissions peaked in the 1990s–2000s, nonexhaust PM becomes increasingly important. Air quality simulations using our inventory in the MUSICA model show good regional PM2.5 agreement but highlight challenges in resolving local primary pollutant peaks. This comprehensive inventory provides crucial data for Brazil and uncovers globally relevant climate–chemistry interactions, urging a re-evaluation of regional specificities in global emission assessments."

However, its climatic and hydrological impacts remain poorly quantified because high-quality data sets are scarce. This study introduces a novel Dual Random Forest (DRF) framework that synergistically constrains BCS concentration estimates through both physical mechanisms and observational fidelity. By pretraining with six spatiotemporally complete Earth System Model (ESM) simulations, driven by multisource reanalysis data, and fine-tuning against global field observations, the DRF generates a 44-year (1981–2024) global monthly BCS data set at 0.5° × 0.625° resolution. This data set achieves higher accuracy in BCS patterns and concentrations compared with observations (spatial correlation R = 0.92; normalized mean error NME = 31%), outperforming both single-constrained machine learning approaches (ESM- or observation-only) and traditional methods (CMIP5, CMIP6, and MODIS; R = 0.07–0.82, NME = 51%–1951%). It also excels in capturing seasonal variations and long-term annual trends, better reproducing increasing trends driven by anthropogenic forcing and decadal variability modulated by natural climate variability. This data set is hence valuable for robust quantification of BCS-induced radiative forcing and attribution of snowmelt acceleration to snow darkening versus climate warming on a global scale."

However, how contaminants adsorbed on sediment surfaces are degraded at oxic-anoxic interfaces remains unclear. Here we investigated the degradation of tetracycline (TC), a model adsorbed contaminant, during the oxygenation of three Fe(II)-bearing sediments. Quenching experiment results, in situ Raman spectra, and fluorescence microscope images revealed the formation of surface-bound •OH (•OHsurface). •OHsurface, rather than •OHfree, was primarily responsible for the rapid degradation of adsorbed TC. Sediments with moderate Fe(II) oxidation rates and electron release exhibited the highest •OHsurface production and TC degradation, due to competition between the pathways of •OHsurface generation and Fe(IV) formation. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate a facet-dependent mechanism for the activation of adsorbed O2 on Fe(II)-bearing clay minerals in sediments and the subsequent production of •OHsurface via surface electron transfer processes. The degradation of adsorbed TC via •OHsurface oxidation followed a distinct pathway compared to homogeneous reactions, generating intermediates with larger molecular weights. Overall, our findings expand the understanding of •OH formation from aqueous phases to sediment surfaces, offering a novel but overlooked pathway for the natural attenuation of adsorbed organic contaminants at oxic-anoxic interfaces."

While its long‐term positive trend is well‐documented, changes in the amplitude of SAM variability remain poorly understood. Based on reanalysis data and surface‐station observations, we demonstrate that the amplitude of SAM variability has substantially increased over the past eight decades, which is associated with more frequent and severe weather extremes. A simple model and idealized climate experiments reveal that this amplification is primarily driven by enhanced stochastic eddy momentum flux, which is linked to a strengthened meridional temperature gradient. State‐of‐the‐art climate model projections indicate that SAM variability will likely continue to intensify throughout the 21st century, driven by a further increase in the meridional temperature gradient. These findings highlight a critical but previously overlooked response of large‐scale circulation to climate change, with important implications for assessing and mitigating future climate risks across the Southern Hemisphere."

Upstream spatiotemporal propagation characteristics of EPEs can provide useful precursors for forecasting North China EPEs but remains poorly understood. Using climate network analysis, two dominant EPEs propagation pathways, that is, a northwestern pathway from West Siberian Plain (6‐day lead) and a southwestern pathway from Tibetan Plateau (TP) (3‐day lead), are identified during the warm season. The northwestern pathway is driven by an eastward‐propagating mid‐latitude wave train coupled with Arctic cyclone. The cyclone in the wave train drives the southeastward‐propagating EPEs, and when it merges with the Arctic cyclone, its downstream anticyclone is enhanced, ultimately inducing North China EPEs. The southwestern pathway stems from quasi‐stationary waves coupled with Arctic anticyclone. Interactions between anticyclone in the wave train and Arctic anticyclone generate a TP cyclone, whose intensification and eastward expansion propel EPEs northeastward and strengthen the Northeast Asian anticyclone, ultimately causing North China EPEs."

However, observed trends are “La Niña‐like,” displaying a strengthened zonal equatorial gradient, raising concerns about the accuracy of these projections. Here we explore multi‐model ensemble variability in the projected Pacific warming pattern. This pattern variability is largely explained by two dominant patterns: one linked to hemispheric warming asymmetries, and the other to zonal equatorial gradients. Crucially, model differences in projected zonal equatorial gradients are strongly tied to the model representation of the mean state in the off‐equatorial east and west Pacific. This implies that mean state biases partly control the projected warming pattern. Moreover, models with more realistic mean states tend to produce: (a) historical trends with stronger gradients, aligning better with observations, and (b) more “El Niño‐like” future projections."

To evaluate observed changes in UK winter precipitation from 1901 to 2023, we separate the signal into dynamical and non‐dynamical components by applying a dynamical adjustment using European weather patterns. We find long‐term changes in the non‐dynamical component are tied to temperature, with a 7% increase in UK winter precipitation per degree of local warming, in line with expected increases in atmospheric moisture content. We find this significant increase in non‐dynamical winter precipitation is attributable to anthropogenic forcing according to the CMIP6 global climate model simulations. Notably, most CMIP6 models produce a much weaker intensification of the non‐dynamic (thermodynamic) component relative to observations, with a model ensemble mean scaling of 4% °C−1. The results show that projections based on CMIP6 models could underestimate the scaling of precipitation with temperature and increase in flood risk."

Coupled climate models are conventionally used to more robustly sample these teleconnections and their differences, yet they have persistent tropical sea surface temperature (SST) biases. To better understand teleconnection differences between EP and CP El Niño, we use atmosphere‐only ensemble simulations with both observed and realistic synthetic SSTs generated from a Linear Inverse Model. With a sufficient number of El Niño events, the perceived teleconnection differences weaken due to broader sampling of event patterns, event strengths, and intrinsic atmospheric variability. However, biases in the atmospheric model's teleconnection caveat these conclusions. With CP event frequency projected to increase in the future, associated global impacts have the potential to become stronger, too."

Analysis of multi‐year station data reveals that wind speed has a stronger influence on this anomalous CD increase than atmospheric stability. High‐resolution WRF‐LES simulations demonstrate that while moderate winds conform to MOST, the constant‐flux‐layer assumption fails under low winds: momentum flux varies by 378% within 25 m. Applying MOST under these conditions yields height‐increasing CD, explaining the excessively large CD in observations. Additionally, turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is significantly lower under low winds, and the mean momentum flux reverses to upward. Further analysis identifies hundred‐meter‐scale eddies causing counter‐local‐gradient transport, with spectral analysis confirming their dominance in momentum flux. The near‐surface momentum flux is primarily generated by pressure perturbations and transported upward via vertical gradient terms."

Global warming has driven substantial snow cover retreat, yet projections from climate models vary widely, hindering reliable climate change adaptation and policy planning. For the Tibetan Plateau (TP), observationally constrained projections offer an opportunity to improve the credibility of snow cover projections, yet such applications are still limited. Based on climate models, we find that the historical inter‐model snow cover reductions are strongly correlated with the projected remaining snow cover by the end of the 21st century. By this emergent relationship and satellite‐derived products, we calibrate the best estimate of the remaining frequency of spring snow cover (relative to 1981–2020) to 37%, which is lower than the multi‐models' prediction (55%) and substantially reduces inter‐model spread (17% after constraint compared to 23% in standard deviation) in a high emission scenario. Cross‐validation tests reinforce the robustness of the constrained projection. The underestimation of snow cover loss is likely attributed to an underestimation of observed warming magnitude. Sensitivity analyses indicate that the choice of period for historical snow cover extent reduction trends and climate model ensemble are the main sources of uncertainty, whereas differences between the two satellite‐derived data sets have only a limited impact on the constraint."

Observations show that these transitions often occur abruptly within days. We develop a new framework to diagnose zonally asymmetric abrupt seasonal changes (ASC) in tropical circulation, using a pseudo‐streamfunction (Ψpseudo) and a dual‐component vector index (ASCI). Ψpseudo recovers the traditional overturning streamfunction when zonally averaged and is decomposed into rotational and divergent parts via Helmholtz decomposition. Strong ASC is found over land regions containing low‐heat‐inertia land area and intense deep convection, notably the Maritime Continent and South America. Unlike the zonally symmetric Hadley cell, rotational flow dominates ASC in these regions, with divergent flow contributing in regions with strong convection. These results highlight the essential role of tropical and extratropical eddies in shaping abrupt seasonal transitions in regional tropical circulation."

Recent studies using ice core records report large increases (up to tenfold) in Arctic TFA deposition since the 1970s, and trends suggest long‐lived chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) replacements may be a major source. Here, we use a chemical transport model to examine the global TFA budget arising from CFC replacements–hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs)–and inhalation anesthetics. Global TFA deposition from these sources increased ∼3.5‐fold from 6.8 (5.9–7.6) Gg/yr in 2000 to 21.8 (18.6–25.0) Gg/yr in 2022, with cumulative deposition reaching 335.5 Gg. We find HCFC‐123, HCFC‐124, and HFC‐134a account for most modeled TFA production and that long‐lived CFC replacements account for virtually all of the observed Arctic deposition trend. At lower latitudes, our analysis supports the recent emergence of hydrofluoroolefins (HFOs) as a TFA source. We conclude that increased TFA monitoring is required."

This study evaluates whether satellite retrievals (GPM‐IMERG and CloudSat) and reanalysis (ERA5) represent the contrasting precipitation between open and closed mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) observed over the SO, from limited in situ records. Substantial discrepancies are found across data sets. While ERA5 captures the expected contrast, GPM‐IMERG underestimates precipitation, especially from open MCCs, and fails to reflect morphological distinction. Both CloudSat products detect higher mean precipitation for open MCCs, though with differences in intensity distribution. Using observed precipitation rates and occurrence frequencies, open MCCs are estimated to contribute 9%–13% and closed MCCs 1%–11% of the annual precipitation between 40°S and 50°S. These results highlight the importance of improving the representation of marine atmospheric boundary layer cloud morphologies in models and observational data sets to better constrain the SO water cycle."

We report observations from two campaigns in May and October 2024, each featuring 10‐ton TNT‐equivalent controlled surface chemical explosions recorded by a dense network of 31 single‐sensor stations within 23 km. Despite identical sources, the observed wavefields were very different. October signals followed a near‐unimodal period–distance trend, whereas May signals exhibited a pronounced azimuthal bifurcation in both period and celerity. Downwind paths largely preserved the short‐period baseline observed in October, while upwind paths showed systematically longer periods caused by wind‐driven low‐pass filtering. This study provides the first direct observational evidence that tropospheric winds can impose azimuth‐dependent low‐pass filtering at local ranges, without the influence of measured temperature inversions. Thus, the structure of the atmosphere can modify the spectral characteristics of low‐frequency acoustic waves even at a distance of only a few kilometers."

In this study a numerical model with comprehensive Secondary Ice Production (SIP) descriptions is used to investigate the impact of SIP on the evolution of medicane Qendresa. SIP refers to processes that can generate small cloud‐ice crystals in concentrations exceeding those produced by primary ice nucleation, promoting cloud glaciation and precipitation. However, its effects on medicane thermodynamics have not been considered before. Our results indicate that improving SIP representation in the model leads to a more accurate prediction of the cyclone track, resulting in improved precipitation patterns, particularly in the regions where extreme precipitation is observed."

Box model simulations revealed that dialkene chemistry enhanced ROx cycle rates by over 10% under BD‐dominant and 40% under isoprene‐dominant conditions contributing nearly half of reactive aldehyde formation. Further simulations on O3 indicate that the reactive aldehydes formed from dialkenes exert an influence nearly equivalent to the direct impact of dialkenes.

Motivated by persistent LLJs detected through Doppler LiDAR observations during March to April 2021, this study systematically characterizes these LLJs over Juehua Island (western Bohai Sea coast) by integrating high‐resolution Weather Research and Forecasting Model simulations. Based on a 61‐day simulation spanning March to April 2021, this study reveals a notable LLJ occurrence frequency of 25.3%, dominated by two distinct directional modes: southwesterly and northeasterly. The high frequency and pronounced directional dominance of LLJs in this region motivated a systematic investigation combining Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis and sensitivity experiments. The LLJ‐favorable synoptic patterns were extracted through EOF analysis of the sea‐level pressure (SLP) field. The northwest‐southeast SLP dipole pattern plays a dominant role, contributing 68% to LLJ formation. Southwesterly and northeasterly LLJs are favored by “high‐southeast, low‐northwest” and its opposite synoptic dipoles, respectively. Sensitivity experiments quantify the contribution of local geography at 21%, collectively accounted for by the Bohai Sea (16%) and the northwestern highlands (5%). Additionally, the Bohai Sea preferentially enhances southwest LLJs, which exhibit lower LLJ heights. In contrast, the northwestern highlands elevate LLJ heights and align LLJ directions with the terrain orientation, resulting in a more clustered wind direction distribution. This study quantified LLJ‐favorable synoptic patterns, Bohai Sea and northwestern high terrain influences. These findings could provide valuable insights for regional LLJ forecasting."

This study presents a framework for assessing the future compound flood hazard profiles in a coastal megacity in the Delta region of southern China. A coupled hydrology‐hydrodynamic model is applied to simulate the flooding processes of 7 typhoon events. Scenarios are constructed using all possible pairwise combinations of three rainfall and three CWL conditions. These inputs are derived from statistical and dynamical downscaling of climate projections from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) ensemble under the SSP5‐8.5 pathway. The results show that future CWL rise contributes more to future inundation than increasing rainfall, whereas rainfall contributions exhibit considerable uncertainties due to regional rainfall downscaling. Under extreme warming scenarios, future typhoons may produce increases of up to 230 mm in total rainfall and 28 mm per hour in rainfall intensity, which in turn increase the average urban inundation depth and area by 1.2 cm and 24.7 km2 $\mathrm{k}{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{2}}$, respectively. Given an average CWL of 170 cm and a maximum CWL of 440 cm in the future, the inundation depth and area could increase by up to 8.4 cm and 29 km2 $\mathrm{k}{\mathrm{m}}^{\mathrm{2}}$, respectively. Within the 7 typhoons in this study, Hagupit (2014) exhibits the most notable compound effect, potentially expanding the medium‐to‐high risk area (inundation depth above 27 cm) by over 5%.

 Normal faulting in the southern Tibetan rift system reflects ongoing orogenic collapse. Here we use multisensor InSAR (Lutan-1, Sentinel-1 and ALOS-2) to map deformation from the 2025 MW 7.0 Dingri earthquake and to invert fault geometry and slip for the main rupture and a geodetically inferred west-side slip episode. The mainshock exhibits bimodal slip on steeply dipping conjugate faults (dip ≥55°). The west-side episode is equivalent to MW ~6.0 and involves two oppositely dipping segments, including deeper reactivation of the fault that ruptured in the 2020 MW 5.6 Dingri earthquake. Numerical dynamic-rupture simulations indicate that, under the adopted friction and stress conditions, static and dynamic stress perturbations alone are unlikely to generate MW ~6 slip on the west-side structure, implying additional weakening or near-critical prestress. Larger fault-bounded volumes host larger slip, highlighting the role of connectivity and mechanical heterogeneity in seismic hazard assessment.

 Accurately quantifying canopy height and above-ground carbon across diverse land-cover types is crucial for understanding carbon storage dynamics and guiding climate-mitigation strategies.

We then estimate the above-ground biomass and carbon from these heights using a Random Forest model (MAE = 37.71 Mg ha-1). By deriving carbon from canopy height, we take advantage of U-Net’s ability to capture trees in non-forest ecosystems such as croplands, grasslands and urban areas.

 Accurate large-scale crop yield mapping is crucial for understanding how weather and climate variability affect food security. While temporal deep learning models have achieved notable success in extracting time-series features for yield mapping, they often struggle to model spatial dependencies, such as yield spatial autocorrelations and the influence of time-invariant variables (e.g., soil properties and topography). To address this limitation, we propose KGML-Graph, a knowledge-guided graph machine learning framework that integrates spatial learning with temporal structures to explicitly capture these underutilized spatial dependencies. We incorporate knowledge-guided edge weights, derived from historical yield correlations, into the graph structure to identify patterns among counties with similar yield dynamics and enhance model training. The framework was evaluated using data from 627 counties across the U.S. Corn Belt from 2000 to 2020, benchmarking against Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), and Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TempCNN). Results show that KGML-Graph outperformed benchmarks in cross-year testing, reducing RMSE by at least 10.8%, and improved R2 by at least 9.3% in temporal extrapolation during 2017–2020. Furthermore, it demonstrated superior spatial transferability by maintaining accuracy in unseen regions and significantly reducing spatial autocorrelation in estimation residuals. Under extreme climatic conditions, the model achieved at least a 14.4% improvement in R2 on out-of-distribution test data and reduced the mean estimation residual from -0.413 to -0.074 metric tons per hectare, effectively mitigating the systematic yield overestimation observed in baseline models. Our attribution analyses highlighted the contributions of both graph structure and knowledge-guided edge weights to the improved performance by better capturing spatial patterns and representing key static variables, such as soil organic carbon content. These findings underscore the potential of KGML-Graph as a robust framework for unifying spatial and temporal learning to support accurate, large-scale crop yield mapping across diverse climatic and geographic conditions."

 In SAR imagery, the backscattered power from scenes covering agricultural areas contains information from both soil and vegetation. External factors such as precipitation and irrigation modify soil and vegetation moisture and consequently change the backscattered power, making it difficult to isolate changes related to crop growth from them. To address this issue, the co-polar complex coherence was recently proposed as an effective tool for crop growth monitoring. In this study, a new method for extracting scattering features from the co-polar complex coherence is proposed, which is based on the distances on the complex plane with respect to the coherences associated with elementary targets. In addition, to further enhance the sensitivity to the changes in scattering features between acquisition dates, associated with phenological development, here we define a new change matrix based on these scattering features. This matrix is constructed to characterize the magnitude, direction, and type of change between any two given dates. Airborne quad-pol SAR data gathered during the AGRISAR 2006 and CROPEX 2014 campaigns were used to assess the proposed monitoring approach for three representative crop types: corn, barley, and canola. Besides a physical and a visual interpretation of the change matrix, a phenological clustering was carried out based on it.

 Distributed scatterer interferometry (DSI) is an effective technique for improving InSAR-derived deformation quality in low-coherence permafrost regions. Reliable identification of statistically homogeneous pixels (SHPs) and deformation inversion through a two-tier network are key steps of DSI. However, existing SHP selection methods based on parametric hypothesis testing generally assume temporal stationarity of surface backscattering, which is often violated in permafrost regions due to freeze‒thaw processes in the active layer. In addition, the conventional two-tier network strategy tends to produce unstable inversion networks in decorrelated permafrost areas, thereby degrading deformation reliability. To address these limitations, this study proposes a robust coherent scatterer InSAR (RCSI) method. First, considering temporal variations in surface backscattering, a U test is developed to identify SHPs with similar temporal backscattering behavior. Second, a multitier network strategy is proposed, in which persistent scatterers (PS) and distributed scatterers (DS) candidates are evenly partitioned into multiple groups according to posterior coherence, and deformation is progressively estimated using robust M−estimators. The effectiveness of RCSI is quantitatively validated using both simulated data and Sentinel-1 observations over the Beiluhe region on the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. The results show that the U test can effectively identify SHPs under non-stationary backscattering conditions. Compared with the two-tier network strategy, the multitier network strategy achieves a 19.9% improvement in deformation accuracy, as validated against in situ leveling measurements, and yields a 42.6% increase in the number of measurement points (MPs). Our study demonstrates that RCSI can significantly enhance the quality of InSAR-derived deformation in permafrost regions."

 Change detection in remote sensing leverages temporally distinct imagery to identify alterations in the surface of regions of interest, and holds significant application value in areas such as environmental protection and land use. Existing change detection networks consider pixel-level and mask-level perspectives separately, and have achieved promising results. However, methods based on pixel-level change detection are susceptible to challenges, including the merging of change regions and the omission of small change masks. Mask classification based change detection methods, which rely on query predictions, are more susceptible to false changes. To mitigate these limitations, we propose TextMCD, a mask classification based change detection framework that integrates multimodal vision–language learning. Specifically, our network adaptively obtains potential change masks through queries and further constrains the semantic categories of predicted masks using the text label information of a single mask. Meanwhile, we propose a multimodal decoder based on ground truth mask attention mechanism. During the decoding phase, the ground truth is incorporated into the training process without affecting the validation. By combining the mask attention mechanism, the model simultaneously captures the location, category, and temporal embedding information of the masks, which enhances the semantic consistency of individual masks in the change detection process. To validate our method, we performed before-and-after category labeling of change masks on multiple binary change detection datasets. The quantitative analysis reveals a notable increase in F1 score across various datasets. Qualitative analysis further demonstrates the advantages of our network in addressing issues such as mask adhesion, small mask miss detection, and false changes.

 Crop yield prediction is crucial for food security and agricultural decision-making. Conventional approaches struggle to reconcile the heavy parameter reliance of process-based models with the extensive label dependencies of data-driven models. To address this, we propose a process-aware crop yield prediction framework that integrates the mechanistic interpretability of crop growth models with the flexibility of deep learning. A Knowledge-Informed Fusion Network (KIFN) is introduced to transcend conventional shallow fusion by transferring mechanistic knowledge of biomass accumulation dynamics from process-based models into data-driven architectures. KIFN incorporates a three-stage design. (1) In the knowledge-informed pre-training stage, an expert network is trained on synthetic daily growth trajectories generated through crop growth model simulation. (2) In the process-aware fine-tuning stage, the expert network is aligned with historical yield data. (3) In the dual-stream fusion stage, the expert network output is calibrated using remote sensing observations via a cross-attention mechanism, thereby dynamically refining in-season predictions. Experimental results from the USDA’s multi-year corn yield dataset show that our model achieves high accuracy (R2 = 0.793, RMSE = 1.039 t/ha). The model’s predictions improve progressively throughout the growing season as satellite observations are used for calibration, demonstrating its effectiveness for dynamic in-season yield prediction. Additionally, interpretability analysis indicates that the cross-attention mechanism in KIFN assists the network in identifying more informative temporal windows throughout the crop growth process. This work provides a principled and interpretable pathway for crop yield prediction, offering new insights into integrating domain knowledge with deep learning in agricultural applications."

 This study examines global heavy snowfall (snow rate > 2.5 mm h−1) using 10 years (2014–2023) of observations from the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR). Heavy snowfall cases are categorized into three distinct types using an Expectation-Maximization (EM) approach based on liquid-equivalent mass-weighted diameter (Dm) and normalized intercept parameter (logNw).The first type represents the majority of heavy snowfall over highland regions and is characterized by smaller snow particles and higher particle number concentrations, along with lower hydrometeor content and colder environments, indicating limited growth of snow particles. The second type exhibits slightly larger Dm and lower logNw than the first type and predominantly occurs over continental regions. The third type dominates over oceans and explains the largest contribution to global volumetric heavy snowfall, characterized by relatively larger snow particles and lower particle number concentrations, along with higher hydrometeor content. Based on the characteristic occurrence frequency distributions of each type, the three types are referred to as topographic heavy snowfall (THS), continental-like heavy snowfall (CHS), and oceanic heavy snowfall (OHS), respectively. All three types exhibit pronounced seasonality, whereas their diurnal variation is relatively weak.This study enhances understanding of the characteristics and environmental differences among the three heavy snowfall types, which is expected to support improvements in satellite heavy snowfall retrievals and microphysical parameterizations in numerical models."

 Halogenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (HPAHs) are halogenated aromatic compounds formed when chlorine or bromine atoms substitute onto the ring structure of PAHs containing three to five aromatic rings. They have been identified as ubiquitous environmental contaminants. This study investigated the concentrations of HPAHs and coexisting source tracers in ambient particles from different inhabited areas in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia. The mean concentrations of the total HPAHs and PAHs in winter and summer were 70 pg/m3 and 230 ng/m3, and 1.0 pg/m3 and 6.3 ng/m3, respectively. The seasonal concentration ratio (winter/summer) was higher for the total HPAHs (69) than for the total PAHs (36), suggested that HPAH productions are efficiently enhanced by coal combustion-related heating activities during winter. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis showed that 6-chlorinated benzo [a]pyrene has the potential to be a specific tracer of coal combustion. The inhalation risks for HPAH exposure, estimated as the incremental lifetime cancer risk (ILCR), were lower than the minimum potential risk threshold (10−6), whereas the ILCR for PAH exposure exceeded this threshold."

 The mid-latitude cut-off low substantially influences air quality through stratospheric O3 intrusions, however, its spatially extensive impacts on ambient O3 and the associated diverse pathways remain insufficiently understood. Therefore, this study addresses this knowledge gap by integrating observational and simulation data for the Northeast Cold Vortex (NECV), a typical cut-off low over East Asia during April 15–18, 2020, to explore the mechanism underlying NECV-associated near-surface O3 increases over Eastern China (EC). During the southeastward NECV progression, near-surface O3 levels increased across the broad EC region spanning mid- to low-latitudes. When the NECV was centered near the EC coastline along the Pacific, near-surface O3 rose by 40–60 μg·m−3 over northern, central and southern EC, corresponding to relative increases of 29.76%, 17.29%, and 47.49%, respectively. The deep subsidence at the NECV periphery drove the downward transport of stratospheric O3 into the troposphere over northern EC. Concurrently, the NECV interacted with the westward-expanded Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH), generating a convergence zone over central EC between northwesterly and southwesterly flows that accumulated transported O3 and enhanced near-surface O3 levels in central EC. In southern EC, anticyclonic anomalies developed due to the westward WPSH extension led to clear-sky conditions with stronger incoming solar radiation and consequently intensified photochemical O3 production. Collectively, the results demonstrate a synergistic meteorological mechanism of the NECV-associated near-surface O3 enhancements, comprising three coupled pathways: stratospheric intrusion (SI), horizontal transport, and photochemical production. These findings contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the environmental implications of the cut-off low and support efforts to refine O3 pollution control strategies."

Tropical regions are particularly critical to climate mitigation due to their high carbon density and ongoing conversion to agricultural uses. While earth observation (EO) has become fundamental for assessing land-use change over time and space, key gaps persist in understanding associated carbon emissions (CE) and their distribution across production systems, information required by diverse international and European policy frameworks targeting greenhouse gas reduction and deforestation. To address this, the study integrates satellite-derived aboveground biomass (AGB) with machine learning-based land-use modeling to quantify commodity-specific CE from deforestation in Colombia. Our key findings reveal that pasture expansion for livestock dominates emissions (>67% in the Amazonas and Orinoquía regions, approximately 25% nationally), while cocoa and coffee, despite smaller cultivation areas, exhibit high emission factors (>25% of subregional totals in the Andes, Pacífico, and Caribe). Smallholder croplands contribute up to 16.7% regionally, and oil palm plays a modest role nationally. These results underscore the importance of targeting both extensive pasture systems and high-emission perennial crops in deforestation-free supply chain policies, while considering the diverse regional land-use dynamics. In conclusion, our framework offers spatially explicit, crop-specific emission estimates that address essential gaps in EO-based CE quantification. It provides clear, actionable baselines for monitoring policies aimed at promoting deforestation-free supply chains, such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), across tropical landscapes. Ultimately, this data supports the creation of a comprehensive database of country-specific emission factors, a resource critical for enhancing national carbon inventories, guiding policy decisions related to high-risk deforestation commodities, and ensuring more transparent and traceable zero-deforestation supply chains."

Despite widely available forest monitoring tools that effectively map deforestation, accurate and scalable remote sensing methods to detect selective logging are less advanced. Previous efforts are largely unable to reliably detect the low-intensity selective logging (<10 m3 ha−1) that dominates across much of the Amazon rainforest, the world’s largest remaining stock of tropical timber. Utilising a unique training dataset of high-resolution uninhabited aerial vehicle imagery from logged forests across the Peruvian Amazon, we build random forest models trained to detect selective logging using freely available optical satellite images from Sentinel-2 and Landsat. We find the Sentinel-2 model to be highly accurate (F1 score: 0.88, kappa: 0.85, false detection rate: 6.3%), outperforming the Landsat model (F1 score: 0.77, kappa: 0.74, false detection rate: 21.7%). Both models accurately detected 3- to 20-fold more selective logging activity in our validation data than widely available forest monitoring tools (TMF, GLAD-S2, RADD). We demonstrate novel uses for these logging-detection models in the monitoring of legal timber harvesting inside forest concessions and illegal harvesting of wood inside Protected Areas. These results have the potential to transform our understanding of low-intensity, logging-induced forest degradation at broad scales, demonstrating the clear potential of remote sensing methods to effectively monitor both legal and illegal selective logging in tropical forests."

Palmer;Michael Boy,Modelling the impact of anthropogenic aerosols on CCN concentrations over a rural boreal forest environment,"Cloud condensation nuclei are necessary to form clouds, and their size distribution affects cloud properties and therefore Earth’s energy budget. This study modelled the origins of cloud condensation nuclei at SMEAR II, Hyytiälä, Finland, and found that primary emissions and new particle formation separately contribute to more than half of the condensation nuclei, but they suppress each other, leading to current concentrations. Largest condensation nuclei originated mostly from emissions. 
 The radiative properties of clouds depend partially on the cloud droplet number concentration, which is determined by the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) when the clouds are formed. In turn, CCN concentrations are determined by the atmospheric particle size distribution and their chemical composition. We use a novel Lagrangian modelling framework to examine the origins and history of gas and aerosol components observed at the boreal forest measurement site SMEAR II, and their potential to act as CCN. This framework combines: (a) global emission datasets, (b) backward trajectories from the FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model (FLEXPART) airmass dispersion model, (c) a detailed description of atmospheric chemistry and aerosol dynamics from the Model to Simulate the Concentration of Organic Vapours, Sulphuric Acid and Aerosol Particles (SOSAA). We apply this SOSAA-FP (FP standing for FLEXPART) framework to simulate a period from March to October 2018 with 1 h time resolution, focusing on the concentrations of CCN between 0.1 % and 1.2 % maximum supersaturation as calculated by the κ-Köhler theory (with respective dry particle diameter of activation ca. 175–35 nm). We find that the model PM1 fraction of primary particles, sulfates and secondary organic aerosol correlate well with the observed organic aerosol and sulfate trends and explain most of the observed organic aerosol and sulfate PM1 mass. Our results show that primary particle emissions play a considerable role in CCN concentrations even at a rural site such as SMEAR II. Changes in atmospheric cluster formation rates had a relatively weak impact on the CCN concentrations in the sensitivity runs. Enhanced cluster formation increased (decreased) the CCN concentrations for the highest (lowest) maximum supersaturation. Without any cluster formation our modelled median CCN concentrations changed by −48 % and +23 % for supersaturations of 1.2 % and 0.1 %, respectively, whereas omitting primary particle emissions had a decreasing effect in all calculated CCN supersaturation classes (−82 % and −33 % decrease in median CCN of 1.2 % and 0.1 % supersaturation, respectively). While the enhancing effect of cluster formation to high supersaturation (i.e., small diameter) CCN concentrations is unsurprising, the weak sensitivity to cluster formation rates and the decreasing effect to lowest supersaturation CCN was unexpected, as was the strong influence of anthropogenic primary emissions. The Lagrangian model framework showed its power, as it was possible to trace down the causes behind the unexpected outcomes by comparing how the particle population evolved along the trajectories in different sensitivity tests."

Our results generate non-negative emission datasets using objective selection and filtering methods. The results include lower minimum emission thresholds for all power grids and fewer false positives. The new method provides more robust emission quantification in the face of data uncertainty, going beyond traditional plume identification and background subtraction. 
 We propose a novel method for computing the effects of TROPOMI observational uncertainties on emissions calculation arising from the nonlinearity of the gradient terms and non-biased filtering in space and time. Application using TROPOMI XCH4 data in clean areas of Western China with long-term WMO background observations quantifies a minimum detectable emission threshold of 0.3 µgm-2s-1, lower than existing community thresholds using TROPOMI. By combining threshold-based and stochastic approaches that incorporates pixel-by-pixel and day-by-day XCH4 uncertainties, we identify and filter physically unrealistic emission values in both space and time. The resulting emissions reveal both missing sources and emission bias caused by the nonlinearity of the gradient term. Validation was performed by applying the method to the Permian Basin, where comparisons with airborne observations demonstrate the method's ability to align with independent datasets. The importance and implications of our results are related to this being a new methodology for methane emissions estimate from TROPOMI which enables precise identification of emission sources and improved handling of observational noise, offering a more accurate framework for methane emission monitoring across diverse regions using existing satellite platforms. Our results yield a non-negative emissions dataset using an objective selection and filtration method, which includes a lower minimum emissions threshold on all grids and reduction of false positives. Finally, the new approach can be adopted to other satellite platforms to provide a more robust and reliable quantification of emissions under data uncertainty that moves beyond traditional plume identification and background subtraction."

OFS exhibiting a diurnal shift dominated by the morning regime; prioritizing VOCs while co-controlling NOx is the most effective strategy for O3 pollution control in the PRD region. 
 Ground-level ozone (O3) pollution has recently become of increasing concern in China. Studies have shown that conventional models often fail to predict accurately the net O3 production rate (P(O3)net) due to the absence of certain mechanisms, particularly the kinetics from missing reactive volatile organic compounds (VOCs) species, and hence affects the reliability of evaluation for O3 formation sensitivity (OFS). Therefore, we conducted a field observation of P(O3)net and OFS using a P(O3)net (NPOPR) detection system based on a dual-channel reaction chamber technique at the Guangdong Atmospheric Supersite of China in Heshan, Pearl River Delta (PRD) in autumn of 2023. The in-situ monitoring data were then compared with results from a zero-dimensional model incorporating the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM v3.3.1). We tested the model performance by incorporating parameterization for 4 processes including HO2 uptake by ambient aerosols, dry deposition, N2O5 uptake, and ClNO2 photolysis, and found that the discrepancies between the modelled P(O3)net (P(O3)net_Mod) and measured data (P(O3)net_Mea) did not change evidently, the maximum daily P(O3)net differed by ∼ 44.8 %. Meanwhile, we found that the agreement of OFS assessment results between the direct measurements and the modelling study was lower in the P(O3)net rising phase (08:00–09:00 LT, 63.6 %) than in the P(O3)net stable phase (10:00–12:00 LT, 72.7 %) and P(O3)net declining phase (13:00–17:00 LT, 72.7 %). The results in this study reflected that unmeasured oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) were the most effective compensating factor for the discrepancies between observed and computed P(O3)net and OFS, hinting clearly at the importance of quantitative understanding the total reactivity of VOCs in O3 chemistry."

Westervelt;Jayanarayanan Kuttippurath,Sensitivity of photochemical surface ozone formation regimes to emissions and meteorology in India,"This study examines the inverse effect of aerosol surface area and particulate matter (PM) reduction on air quality and atmospheric chemistry, particularly on surface ozone levels. Aerosols act as surfaces for the uptake of hydroxyl radicals (HO2), which are essential for controlling ozone formation. Reducing aerosols and PM may enhance surface ozone formation, thus worsening air quality. However, further efforts to decrease NOx emissions could mitigate this rise in surface ozone levels. 
 Atmospheric aerosols significantly contribute to air pollution and influence atmospheric chemistry, impacting air quality and public health.  Decrease in aerosols can hinder the radical uptake sink of HO2, and thus increase NOx and OH, and subsequently increase ozone levels. This study investigates the seasonal variations of PM10 and aerosol surface area and their effect on surface ozone levels in India, using the GEOS-Chem Chemical Transport Model for the years 2018 and 2022, two years with high and low simulated PM10 concentrations, respectively. The results reveal substantial seasonal variations in PM10 and aerosol surface area. In winter (DJF), higher PM10 and aerosol surface area in the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and western Central India (CI) result from biomass burning and industrial activity, while coastal regions show lower aerosol surface area.  A decrease in aerosol surface area is seen during the pre-monsoon (March–April–May; MAM) and monsoon (June–July–August–Septmember; JJAS), followed by an increase in the post-monsoon (ON) season. As a result, aerosol-induced HO2 uptake during winter and post-monsoon suppress surface ozone by approximately 5–10 µg m−3 in 2022 when compared to that of 2018. In contrast, during monsoon in 2022, the decrease in aerosol surface area caused an ozone increase of 5–7.5 µg m−3 when compared to that of 2018. On average, this increase in surface ozone due to the decrease in aerosols can be mitigated by reducing anthropogenic NOx emissions by about 25 %–50 %. Thus, we recommend integrated strategies addressing aerosols, precursor emissions and regional meteorology to combat ozone pollution."

Based on mountaintop observations in the Yangtze River Delta, we show that under polluted conditions, NPF at the boundary-layer top is enhanced and accelerates its conversion to CCN. Ammonia plays a key role, and a newly defined ""Time Window"" metric highlights the importance of oxidation-driven growth and regional transport in this process. 
 To what extent the new particle formation (NPF) contributed to the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) remained unclear, especially at the boundary layer top (BLT) in polluted atmosphere. Based on measurements at a mountain-top background site in southeastern China during spring 2024, this study systematically investigates the nucleation mechanism and subsequent growth dynamics of NPF events under contrasting air masses, and quantifies their role as a source of CCN. Eight NPF events were observed, and three of them occurred in the polluted conditions (NPF-P) which associated with regional transportation while the rest five events appeared in the clean conditions (NPF-C). The average formation rate (J2.5: 2.4 cm-3s-1 vs. 0.7 cm-3s-1) and growth rate (GR: 6.8 nm h−1 vs. 5.5 nm h−1) were significantly higher in NPF-P events than in NPF-C events, alongside elevated concentrations of sulfuric acid and ammonia. The correlation between log J3 and [H2SO4], as well as theoretical simulations with the MALTE_BOX model, indicates that the enhanced nucleation in polluted conditions can be attributed to the participation of ammonia in stabilizing sulfuric acid-based clusters. In addition, much higher CCN enhancement factor was observed in NPF-P (EFCCN: 1.6 vs. 0.7 in NPF-C) due to the regional transported of anthropogenic pollutants from the urban cluster regions and their secondary transformation under enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity. Furthermore, the duration of NPF-to-CCN conversion was quantified using a “Time Window (τ)”, revealing that polluted conditions accelerated the conversion by 17.0 % (τ = 16.4 h vs. 19.8 h). Nitrate played an important role in maintaining a rapid particle growth rate, thereby shortening τ and enhancing CCN production from NPF – a process that can ultimately influence cloud microphysical properties by increasing the potential cloud droplet number concentration. These findings reveal that polluted air masses enhance both the efficiency and speed of CCN production at the BLT through elevated atmospheric oxidation capacity."

In passive remote sensing observations of greenhouse gases, it creates false patterns in gas concentration maps. In this work, the impact of stray light in the full processing chain from measured spectra, retrieved concentration maps, to emission rate estimates using measured and simulated data is analysed for MAMAP2D-Light. Additionally, a hardware improvement mitigates stray light for onward missions. 
 MAMAP2D-Light is an airborne passive remote sensing imaging push-broom spectrometer developed at the Institute for Environmental Physics at the University of Bremen to determine atmospheric methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) column anomalies in the 1.6 µm-band to quantify point-source emissions. In its initial version, as flown in 2022 in Canada, a significant stray light level of 5.6 % of the measured signal has been observed post-campaign, causing apparent error patterns in the retrieved CO2 and CH4 column anomalies. Measurement data collected during an airborne campaign in 2022 in Canada offer the unique opportunity to investigate the end-to-end impact of stray light and its correction on the retrieved CO2 and CH4 column anomalies, as well as the derived emission rates. We successfully developed and applied a stray light correction to the instrument and investigated its impact on the CH4/CO2 proxy method, the CH4 column, and derived point-source emissions. In nearly all cases, applying the CH4/CO2 proxy method reduced the stray-light-related column errors below the CH4 column noise. The derived emission rates for the proxy-retrieval with and without stray light corrected spectra are comparable, proving the ability of the CH4/CO2 proxy method to correct stray-light-related artifacts. In this paper, we additionally investigate the impact on the CH4 total column retrieval for a high contrast scene condition under which the correction by applying the proxy method is no longer sufficient. Following the initial campaign in 2022, the post-campaign stray light characterization and analysis revealed that a significant fraction of stray light was attributed to reflective surfaces in the object plane of the spectrometer. Based on these findings, the total stray light was reduced by ∼ 63 % by implementing a hardware modification from 2023 onward."

Safanelli;Nancy Harris,OpenLandMap-soildb: global soil information at 30 m spatial resolution for 2000–2022+ based on spatiotemporal Machine Learning and harmonized legacy soil samples and observations,"We used satellite data and thousands of soil samples to create detailed global maps showing how soil changes over time. These maps reveal important patterns in soil health, such as a significant global loss of soil carbon in the past 25 years. Our results help track land degradation and support better land restoration efforts. This work provides a new global tool for understanding and protecting soil, a key resource for food, water, and climate. 
 There is increasing interest in global dynamic soil information with changes in soil properties mapped over time and at high spatial resolution. Thanks to long-term, multi-temporal, and fine- and medium-resolution satellite missions such as Landsat, MODIS, Copernicus Sentinel and similar, it is possible to produce globally consistent predictions of key soil variables that match other 10–30 m spatial resolution global data sets. This paper describes data preparation, modeling, and production of OpenLandMap-soildb: global dynamic predictions of soil organic carbon content, soil organic carbon density, bulk density, soil pH in H2O, soil texture fractions (clay, sand and silt) and USDA subgroup soil types (USDA soil taxonomy subgroups) at 30 m spatial resolution based on spatiotemporal Machine Learning (Quantile Regression Random Forest with output predictions showing the mean plus the 68 % probability lower and upper prediction intervals). To train the models, a large compilation of soil samples imported from legacy soil projects was used: 216 000 soil samples with soil carbon density (kg m−3), 408 000 soil samples with soil carbon content (g kg−1), 272 000 soil samples with soil pH in H2O, 363 000 soil samples with clay, silt and sand content (%) and 134 000 samples with bulk density oven dry (t m−3). Soil carbon and soil pH were mapped with 5-year time-intervals; soil texture fractions, bulk density, and soil types were mapped for recent years only. The cross-validation results indicate Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 17.7 (kg m−3; 0.486 in log-scale) and Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.88 for SOC density, RMSE of 51.3 (g kg−1; 0.574 in log-scale) and CCC of 0.87 for SOC content, RMSE of 0.15 (t m−3) and CCC of 0.92 for bulk density of fine-earth, RMSE of 0.51 and CCC of 0.91 for soil pH, RMSE of 8.4 % and CCC of 0.87 for soil clay content, and RMSE of 12.6 % and CCC of 0.84 for soil sand content respectively. The most important variables for predicting soil organic carbon density (kg m−3) were: soil depth, Landsat-based uncalibrated Gross Primary Productivity (GPP), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and CHELSA bioclimatic indices. The global distribution of soil pH can be primarily explained by the CHELSA Aridity Index (long-term), annual precipitation, and salinity grade. The global stocks for 2020–2022+ period for 0–30 cm depth interval are estimated at 461 Pg (Peta grams); the results further indicate that, in the last 25 years, the world has lost at least 11 Pg of SOC in the top soil.

Each contrail is segmented, tracked, and, where possible, attributed to individual flights. A baseline model based on panoptic segmentation is also provided to demonstrate instance-level detection. This dataset enables empirical analysis of contrail lifecycle and supports the validation and calibration of physical models. 
 Aviation’s climate impact includes not only CO2 emissions but also significant non-CO2 effects, especially from contrails. These ice clouds can alter Earth’s radiative balance, potentially rivaling the warming effect of aviation CO2. Physics-based models provide useful estimates of contrail formation and climate impact, but their accuracy depends heavily on the quality of atmospheric input data and on assumptions used to represent complex processes like ice particle formation and humidity-driven persistence. Observational data from remote sensors, such as satellites and ground cameras, could be used to validate and calibrate these models. However, existing datasets do not explore all aspects of contrail dynamics and formation: they typically lack temporal tracking, and do not attribute contrails to their source flights. To address these limitations, we present the Ground Visible Camera Contrail Sequences (GVCCS), a new open data set (Jarry et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16419651) of contrails recorded with a ground-based all-sky camera in the visible range. Each contrail is individually labeled and tracked over time, allowing a detailed analysis of its lifecycle. The dataset contains 122 video sequences (24 228 frames) and includes flight identifiers for contrails that form above the camera. As reference, we also propose a unified deep learning framework for contrail analysis using a panoptic segmentation model that performs semantic segmentation (contrail pixel identification), instance segmentation (individual contrail separation), and temporal tracking in a single architecture. By providing high-quality, temporally resolved annotations and a benchmark for model evaluation, our work supports improved contrail monitoring and will facilitate better calibration of physical models. This sets the groundwork for more accurate climate impact understanding and assessments."

Here, we present SAL-GPP, a process-based model that incorporates coastal-specific modules to capture the effects of salinity and temperature stress on photosynthesis, as well as light-use efficiency across salinity gradients in diverse CSM plant species. Model validation showed strong agreement with observations, with R2 of 0.82 and model efficiencies of 0.82 and 0.74 for daily and seasonal GPP, respectively. Driven with global inputs, SAL-GPP produced high-resolution global simulations, yielding a mean annual GPP of 66.89 ± 11.68 TgC yr–1 (2011–2020), with 64% concentrated in key hotspots across the southeastern United States, western Europe, southeastern China, and Australia. From 2011 to 2016, global CSM GPP increased by 1.56 TgC yr–1, then declined, rebounded after 2018, and peaked at 71.45 ± 12.02 TgC yr–1 in 2020. Model evaluation showed that SAL-GPP outperformed existing remote sensing-based GPP products and TBMs at both site and grid levels. By explicitly incorporating coastal ecosystem dynamics, SAL-GPP supports global BC accounting and climate mitigation strategies aligned with nature-based solutions for carbon neutrality."

Apte,Methodological Design Choices Can Affect Air Pollution Exposure Disparity Estimates: A Case Study on California’s Agricultural Sector,"People of color in the United States are disproportionately and unfairly exposed to air pollution. Equity-oriented scientific evaluations quantifying these disparities often use population-average exposure metrics to capture the overall inequality within a system. Utilizing these metrics involves choices about the exposure input for assessing disparity, the study geography, and the reference population, which are critical to understanding disparities and effectively designing interventions. Here, we use a case study of exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from California’s agricultural sector to dissect the implications of these decisions. Using a reduced-complexity model and emissions of PM2.5 and precursors, we compare estimates of racial and ethnic disparities in exposure resulting from different combinations of these methodological choices. The full population distributions highlight differences between disparities at the extremes (e.g., 90th percentile) and at the mean. Additionally, the selection of study geography and reference population can influence the magnitude and relative ordering of exposure disparities. Thus, methodological choices can lead to different conclusions for the same concentration and population surfaces; this can impact not only the findings of an individual study but also have implications for mitigation strategies. We conclude with recommendations for best practices for making, justifying, and communicating these methodological decisions."

We propose a novel equilibrium analysis framework to assess the feasibility of implementing ETS in China’s central heating sector. The results demonstrate that implementing an emission trading scheme (ETS) within the central heating sector can accelerate decarbonization process by shifting the focus of the current Clean Heating Campaign from gas boilers to industrial surplus heat and geothermal energy, aligning with China’s goal of reaching 25% nonfossil energy by 2030. It can provide a more cost-effective and sustainable decarbonization pathway in which a 1% annual reduction in carbon quotas leads to emissions peak at 2033, as well as it is expected to generate significant co-benefits by reducing heating-related air pollution. A well-designed subsidy reallocation and phase-out strategy can enable the ETS to drive decarbonization and alleviate fiscal pressures. This combination of ETS and subsidies ensures a smooth transition to low-carbon heating in the short term and is sustainable in the long run through endogenous technological advancement and market self-regulation."

While the Global Value Chains (GVCs) division enhances productive efficiency, its impact on carbon productivity remains elusive. Here we integrated the GVCs theory with the Environmental Expanded Input-output model to investigate the highly globalized automotive manufacturing industry. We found that CO2 emissions intensity, the inverse of carbon productivity, fluctuated between 0.37 and 0.47 kg/USD in automotive manufacturing GVCs during 2001–2021. Notably, developing economies nearly doubled their CO2 emissions intensity during this period, whereas developed economies almost halved theirs. The global distribution of CO2 emissions and value added is becoming increasingly unequal in industrial production and service segments. Lower production levels and energy efficiency in developing economies, coupled with their upstream roles in GVCs (raw materials and industrial parts suppliers), exacerbate these disparities. Our findings indicate that merely global labor division is insufficient to create low-carbon automotive manufacturing GVCs. Formulating emission reduction targets that consider the diverse roles of economies within GVCs, and supporting developing economies in boosting energy productivity, labor value added efficiency, and skill can help narrow the distribution gaps and enhance the carbon productivity of the entire automotive manufacturing GVCs."

The deficiency of reactive oxygen species fundamentally restricts the low-temperature catalytic toluene combustion in transition-metal oxide catalysts. Herein, we report a strategy for intelligently designing active Cu+–Ov–Ti ensembles by coupling isolated Cu with adjacent oxygen vacancy, which can synergistically activate chemisorbed O2 into reactive superoxide species (O2–). The defective Cu/TiO2–x catalyst exhibited remarkable catalytic performance for toluene oxidation, achieving a T90 of 225 °C, significantly 100 °C lower than that of the pristine Cu/TiO2 catalyst. The low coordination geometry and electron transfer within Cu+–Ov–Ti ensembles synergistically activated O2 to form the Cu–(O–O)ad–Ti bridged superoxide O2– intermediate with an elongated O═O bond. In addition, the distinctive Cu–(O–O)ad–Ti bridging structure with localized electrons facilitated the chemisorbed O2 dissociation into electrophilic monatomic O– species, which subsequently nucleophilically attack the methyl C–H of toluene. These benzyl alcohol-derived Ph–CH2–O– intermediates can be readily and flexibly converted into reactive benzaldehyde and benzoic acid species, which were available for subsequent aromatic ring-opening reactions. This study not only advances mechanistic insights into the Cu+–Ov–Ti ensembles and electrophilic O– species in toluene catalytic oxidation but also establishes a design Cu+–Ov–Ti principle for engineering efficient VOC elimination catalysts."

We evaluated the accuracy of seven longitudinal PM2.5 concentration data sets from 2002 to 2014 and conducted equity and health impact analysis using each. Specifically, we estimated population exposure improvements over time, exposure disparities for vulnerable subpopulations, and PM2.5-attributable mortality across several combinations of inputs. Nationally, reductions in population exposure to PM2.5 were consistently observed in all models between 2002 and 2014 in Canada, with larger reductions among subpopulations of visible minority status, suggesting that PM2.5 exposure and absolute exposure disparities improved over this period. Agreement between PM2.5 models is strongest for PM2.5-attributable mortality, whereas exposure time trends and contrasts between subpopulations differ more widely. Nationally, estimated PM2.5-attributable mortality ranged from 7,400 to 26,000 deaths in 2014 across combinations of seven PM2.5 models, four Canadian risk estimates, and counterfactuals of 0 and 2.5 μg/m3. PM2.5-attributable death estimates are sensitive to inputs of mortality risks, counterfactuals, and PM2.5 models.

Here we demonstrate that, since the 2000s, Central American precipitation anomalies in spring have become more likely to persist into summer‐a shift that single‐season analyses overlook. This lengthened persistence arises from a regime change in which multi‐month “persistent events” now dominate over the previously common “transitional events.” Persistent events are anchored by coupling between warm tropical Atlantic (TA) and cold tropical Central‐Eastern Pacific (TCEP) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies that sustains cyclonic circulation, whereas transitional events rely on rapid TCEP SST reversals that disrupt rainfall anomalies. Strengthened Atlantic influences on Pacific climate since 2000 have prolonged Pacific SST persistence, boosting persistent‐event frequency and extending springtime rainfall anomalies into summer. This cross‐seasonal persistence heightens risks to water, food and biodiversity in Central America."

Here we demonstrate that this surge is not physical but largely an artifact of sensor orbital drift, which alters viewing geometry and solar illumination. By leveraging concurrent Suomi‐NPP VIIRS observations unaffected by drift, we developed an empirical correction that removes this artificial signal and quantified global mean Nd artificial biases of +2.4 cm−3 in 2023 and +5.0 cm−3 in 2024. These biases substantially distort the Nd trends, reversing the previously decreasing global Nd trend into an apparent strong rise after 2022. These findings highlight the critical need to correct for such artifacts when constructing satellite‐based climate data records."

Using satellite data and a coupled ocean–sea ice model, we examined how freshwater from the Mackenzie River influences fall sea ice formation in the Beaufort Sea. An “ice bridge” between the coast and offshore ice edge consistently forms over the river's freshwater plume, with its location and extent varying interannually with freshwater distribution. Regions influenced by the plume experienced sea ice onset an average of 3 weeks earlier than adjacent, saltier waters. Earlier ice formation was associated with enhanced stratification, shallower mixed layers, and reduced upper ocean heat content, all of which promotes faster surface cooling. Our findings highlight the importance of river discharge in shaping sea ice formation and suggest continued Arctic freshening will impact future sea ice timing and extent."

Using a moisture‐tracking model, we quantify the moisture sources of APENC's precipitation and its trends, and reveal mechanisms linking anomalous upwind moisture transport to droughts. Terrestrial moisture sources (67.60%) dominate APENC's precipitation. Over 2000–2023, moisture sources from high‐latitude Eurasia and the Tibetan Plateau have increased, whereas those from oceanic sources have decreased significantly. During recent drought events, reductions in moisture inflow from key terrestrial source regions, especially East Asia and the South Asia–Indian Ocean region, primarily triggered rainfall deficits in the APENC. The combination of weakened moisture inflows and reduced local humidity amplified moisture scarcity, sustaining drought severity. These findings highlight the coupled roles of remote transport and land–atmosphere feedbacks in APENC droughts, providing new evidence for understanding semi‐arid hydroclimate risks."

CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) models capture these trends but show considerable inter‐model spread in the magnitude, distribution, and seasonality of Arctic surface albedo. Over land, spread in AMIP (Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project) and CMIP6 is associated with snow cover variations, while over the ocean, where sea ice dominates, the sources are less clear. We compare CMIP6 simulations with observations from the Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) and develop a decomposition method to quantify contributions from sea ice albedo, concentration, and extent. Over the Arctic Ocean, all three factors contribute to inter‐model spread in CMIP6. In AMIP, despite prescribed sea ice concentrations, we were surprised to find an inter‐model spread in Arctic Ocean albedo similar to that in CMIP6, driven solely by sea ice albedo. Applying the decomposition to future projections shows that the largest decline occurs in the Central Arctic, driven primarily by reductions in sea ice extent. After 2045, sea ice extent emerges as the dominant driver, highlighting ice edge retreat as key to future albedo decline. These findings pinpoint key sources of inter‐model spread in Arctic surface albedo and offer insights into quantifying shortwave (SW) radiative effect associated with sea ice responses in future projections."

Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) of the HPLC–HRMS data set classified SOCs into distinct clusters based on their molecular characteristics. Substantial differences in SOC composition were observed between urban (U) and rural/remote (R) clusters. In ESI− mode, the SOCs in the U cluster exhibited higher unsaturation degrees, oxidation levels, and larger molecular sizes than the R cluster. These compounds were likely derived from anthropogenic sources, such as transportation and industry, whereas those in the R cluster exhibited signatures of mixed sources, including biomass burning, cooking‐related emissions, and local biogenetic inputs. In ESI+ mode, SOCs were scarcely detected in the R cluster but were abundant in the U cluster. These compounds were predominantly reduced and unsaturated SOCs, with more than 85% (by intensity) containing one or no oxygen atoms in their elemental formulas. Tentative assignments for these species include sulfoxides, polycyclic aromatic S‐heterocycles, thiols, and sulfides, likely originating from the use and production of heavy oils. Additionally, volatility estimates suggest that the SOCs identified in this study are more volatile than those found in other environmental media. The findings highlight the unique SOCs composition in snowpack of northwestern China, particularly those detected via positive ESI mode, offering new insights into the environmental, climatic, and biogeochemical roles of SOCs."

 Using Alaskan lake sediment oxygen isotope records (δ18O), which trace the δ18O of precipitation, we establish that abrupt atmospheric shifts occurred during the last deglacial period in the North Pacific-Arctic. The robust lake δ18O chronologies confidently correlate Younger-Dryas (YD) atmospheric adjustments in Alaska with Greenland ice-core records and their seasonal sensitivity are consistent with cooling during winter. In contrast, abrupt δ18O decreases during the late Holocene observed in our records, of similar magnitude as the YD, are best explained by atmospheric modes involving long-distance transport of sub-tropical Pacific moisture. Our sediment cores are among the most reliably dated records yet produced in the circum-Arctic and show that similar decreases in δ18O of winter precipitation during the YD and late Holocene were driven by different atmospheric teleconnections. These results underscore major roles for seasonality and atmospheric patterns in the conceptual understanding of global scale climate oscillations, both past and future.

 Soil moisture strongly modulates heat waves and droughts by altering land-atmosphere feedbacks, yet its influence on large-scale circulation remains inadequately quantified. Using large-ensemble simulations with the state-of-the-art climate model EC-Earth 3, we demonstrate that interactive soil moisture has a substantial impact on Northern Hemisphere summer circulation climatology. Two experiments were conducted: a fully interactive simulation and one with prescribed soil moisture states. The results reveal pronounced circulation shifts. Relative to the prescribed case, the interactive experiment drives a poleward displacement of the subtropical jets. It strengthens the polar front jet and enhances land-atmosphere coupling, amplifying wave amplitudes over land by ~24%. Interactive soil moisture raises mean summer surface temperatures by up to +1.5 K and extremes by +3.0 K. These findings demonstrate that soil moisture fluctuations can modify mean atmospheric circulation, with important implications for future summer climate projections."

 In recent decades, the warm-wet climate has markedly altered the hydrological and ecological systems of the Tibetan Plateau, potentially leading to changes in its atmospheric oxidative capacity. Stable isotopic compositions (δ15N, δ18O, Δ17O) of atmospheric nitrate can provide direct evidence on nitrogen oxide sources and oxidation pathways. Here we characterize the atmospheric oxidative capacity transformation over the past two decades (2002-2023) in the northeastern Tibetan Plateau by combining nitrate isotopic measurements in an ice core collected in Anemaqen with numerical model (GEOS-Chem) simulations. We observed a decreasing trend in Δ17O-NO3- from 2008 to 2023 and interpreted it as evidence for an increasing importance of the hydroxyl radical in nitrate production. This trend may reflect an enhanced atmospheric oxidative capacity driven by rising humidity and increased microbial nitrogen oxides emissions associated with warming and wetting trends on the Tibetan Plateau. These findings point to a possible sensitivity of regional atmospheric oxidative capacity to climate change.

 Marine heatwaves pose a growing threat to coral reefs globally, prompting divergent theories on where corals might survive in the near future. However, global predictions of climate refugia often overlook local human disturbances that can negate their benefits. We quantified the relationships between marine heatwaves, local human pressures, environmental conditions, and stony-coral cover using a mixed-effects spatio-temporal Bayesian model. We examined where local human disturbances suppress geographical climate refugia and tested four environmental refugial hypotheses based on latitude, remoteness, depth, and turbidity. While some refugia remained unimpacted by local human disturbances, we identified many potential refugia that are currently suppressed by local human disturbances. The most effective refugia were reefs that experience naturally moderate turbidity. We highlight where local intervention could create or restore climate refugia that are otherwise suppressed by local human disturbances. Reducing local human disturbances in these regions could vastly expand the area of functioning climate refugia.

 Tropical forest recovery plays a vital role in mitigating climate change and conserving biodiversity, yet accurately monitoring its ecological success remains a persistent challenge. Common proxies such as canopy cover or greenness often overestimate recovery by conflating rapid structural regrowth with the slower processes of compositional reassembly and functional reintegration. This review synthesizes recent advances in remote sensing that enable more comprehensive tracking of tropical forest recovery across structural, compositional, and functional dimensions and at multiple spatial and temporal scales. We evaluate the capabilities and limitations of key sensor types: LiDAR for mapping canopy structure and estimating biomass; optical sensors for assessing spectral diversity and phenological variation; synthetic aperture radar (SAR) for reliable structural monitoring under all weather conditions; passive microwave sensors capture plant water content, with Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) serving as a valuable proxy for hydrological function; and thermal sensors for tracking evapotranspiration and plant stress. Crucially, we highlight how integrating these complementary data streams (e.g., fusing LiDAR with hyperspectral or SAR with VOD) overcomes single-sensor blind spots, revealing decoupled recovery trajectories and avoiding misleading ""green deserts"" assessments. We identify persistent challenges, including sensor saturation, cloud cover, calibration gaps, and computational barriers in under-resourced regions. To guide ecologically robust monitoring, we present a decision-support framework that aligns sensor selection with specific recovery dimensions, spatio-temporal scales, data availability, and operational capacity. This framework emphasizes the use of defensible sensor combinations and prioritizes open-access data and feasible validation strategies. Future progress hinges on equitable calibration networks, integrating functional physiological metrics such as solar-induced fluorescence and VOD, developing interpretable machine learning tools, and expanding scalable cloud-based processing platforms. Multi-sensor integration is essential for verifying restoration outcomes to foster resilient tropical forest landscapes."

 Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) is a microwave–derived indicator linked to vegetation water content (VWC) and above-ground biomass. In this study, we improve VOD estimates by optimising key parameters of the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM) through minimising residuals between modelled brightness temperatures and those observed by AMSR2 at 10.7 GHz. Guided by a global sensitivity analysis that reveals strong parameter interactions, we jointly optimise surface roughness, effective temperature, and single scattering albedo at each location. We evaluate two optimisation schemes, which differ only in the effective-temperature input: a Microwave scenario, which uses AMSR2 Ka-band observations, and an ERA5 scenario, which uses ERA5-Land skin temperature.Both optimisation strategies reduce model residuals and strengthen the agreement between VOD and MODIS leaf area index (LAI) seasonal cycles, with the largest gains in forests. On seasonal-cycle agreement with MODIS LAI, the ERA5 scenario delivers the larger improvement relative to the Microwave scenario. Performance diverges for anomalies: VOD from the ERA5 scenario degrades in arid regions but retains gains in forests, whereas the Microwave optimisation maintains or improves anomaly agreement more broadly. Consistent with this, the comparison against in situ Normalised Microwave Reflectance Index, a VWC proxy, shows higher correlations for the Microwave scenario, while ERA5 fails to track day-to-day VWC variability. Both approaches resolve known boreal seasonality issues. Finally, improvements in VOD do not necessarily translate into better soil moisture estimates (SM), confirming known VOD–SM trade-offs."

 Traditional surface solar radiation (SSR) estimation methods are limited by sparse ground stations, inconsistent data quality, and inadequate representativeness, while cloud-parameter-based physical retrievals are prone to errors under complex cloud conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a DenseNet-based, cloud-transmittance-driven framework that, for the first time, employs the high-accuracy Himawari-8 radiation product as the training reference instead of ground observations, and uses cloud transmittance as the model target for estimating SSR across China. This strategy eliminates the reliance on sparse ground stations and mitigates errors from cloud-phase retrievals, thereby substantially enhancing model stability. When evaluated against observations from 120 China Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations, the model achieved an hourly correlation coefficient (R) of 0.92, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 107.2 W m−2, and a mean bias error (MBE) of −0.2 W m−2. The proposed approach demonstrated superior performance relative to several existing SSR products derived from Fengyun-2. The results demonstrate that integrating high-precision satellite products as training references into deep-learning frameworks, while avoiding complex cloud parameter estimation, is a viable pathway to producing high-resolution, stable, and internally consistent radiation products from geostationary meteorological satellites, offering a new perspective for SSR estimation."

 Integrated effects of concurrent exposure to multiple air pollutants and extreme temperatures can amplify health hazards and may induce differential health impacts. However, air quality regulations do not take these combined effects into account. In this study, we assess exposure levels for combinations of different ambient air pollutants, extreme temperature, population and mortality in distinct regions of China during 2000-2019. The results show that, during this period, population exposure to PM2.5 and PM10 declined by 4.09% and 3.95% per year, respectively, within the existing regulatory framework governing Chinese national ambient air quality standards (CNAAQS). In contrast, exposure to O3 increased notably, with 2.43% per year. Despite improvements of air quality, under the CNAAQS Level-1 framework, five out of seven climatic regions in China experienced compound pollution events involving PM10-O3, PM2.5-PM10, and PM2.5-PM10-O3 during at least 158 days in 2019. The exposure time to extreme temperature episodes exhibited a fluctuating change pattern during the study period. However, it is worth noting that the exposure time during heat waves increased significantly since 2015, by 2.67% per year. While we highlight the improved air quality in China, we underscore the imperative for prioritized interventions targeting specific pollutants and their co-occurring phenomena for different climatic regions, particularly under climate-driven temperature escalation observed since 2015."

 This study investigates the impacts of urbanization on typhoon-induced precipitation in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region by employing the Advanced Research version of the Weather Research and Forecasting model (WRF-ARW), with Typhoon Mangkhut selected as a case study. Unlike previous studies that focused solely on the effects of urban expansion on typhoon-induced precipitation, this research explicitly quantifies the impact of urban spatial layouts. To achieve this, we design a series of numerical experiments comprising one control experiment (CTR) and three distinct urbanization scenarios: no-urban (NU), compact urban expansion (UEC), and dispersed urban expansion (UED). The results show that changes in the urban underlying surface exert negligible influence on the track and intensity of Typhoon Mangkhut, but substantially modulate the intensity and spatial distribution of typhoon-induced precipitation. Specifically, the UEC scenario leads to a significant amplification of extreme precipitation within urban regions, thereby increasing the likelihood of concentrated heavy rainfall events and related flooding. Conversely, the UED scenario tends to trigger large-scale moderate-to-heavy precipitation across broader regions rather than localized extremes. A detailed analysis of the underlying physical mechanisms further reveals that the UEC scenario is characterized by reduced near-surface wind speeds but enhanced wind field convergence. These dynamic processes effectively facilitate the upward transport of moist air and the formation of extreme precipitation. In the UED scenario, while thermal disturbances are more pronounced, the associated wind convergence is notably weaker, resulting in relatively lower precipitation magnitudes. This contrast highlights the dominant role of dynamic processes in enhancing typhoon-induced precipitation in the study region. These findings underscore the critical influence of urban spatial structure on regulating the intensity and spatial distribution of such precipitation events, thereby addressing a key research gap concerning how distinct urban layouts modulate typhoon rainfall and the associated physical mechanisms. Consequently, in the PRD and other coastal regions, urban planning should explicitly incorporate the response mechanisms of typhoon precipitation to urbanization, which is essential for balancing socioeconomic development with the urgent need to enhance urban resilience to disasters, particularly in the context of future urban expansion and climate change."

 Continuing current involves substantial charge transfer and is considered a primary cause of lightning-related hazards. Many studies have suggested that the transferred charge primarily originates from the extension of intra-cloud lightning channels, but the relationship between charge transfer and lightning channel extension remains unclear. This study investigates the relationship between intra-cloud lightning channel extension and charge transfer during initial continuous current (ICC) and continuing current (CC). CC is further categorized by duration into traditional continuing current (TCC) and questionable continuing current (QCC). The results show that the duration increases with increasing intra-cloud channel length during ICC, TCC, and QCC. The three types of processes exhibit distinct charge transfer characteristics. ICC shows a slow charge transfer pattern. The charge transfer has a strong linear correlation with channel length during ICC (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.81), with 22.71% of the charge released in the first 25% of the duration. QCC shows a fast charge transfer pattern. Charge transfer during QCC is mainly associated with the main channel length during the cut-off interval (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient = 0.645), with 90.55% of the charge released in the first 25% of the duration. TCC shows an intermediate charge transfer pattern (68.57% of the charge is released in the first 25% of the duration). Its charge transfer is influenced by two factors: the main channel length during cut-off interval (LCI-main) and the channel length during TCC (LTCC-tot). The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient for the summed length is 0.737, with LTCC-tot being the dominant factor. Additionally, TCC can be further divided into two modes: a high-current, short-duration type dominated by LCI-main, and a low-current, long-duration type dominated by LTCC-tot."

Srinivas,Changing dynamics of pre-monsoon rainfall over India (1963–2022): The role ocean-atmosphere drivers and regional impacts,"•Significant changes in rainfall amount and rainy days were observed over India during 1993–2022. •Indian Ocean warming (SST > +0.4°C) and local instability together enhanced pre-monsoon convection. •Weakened AS–BOB anticyclones, westward WNP extension, and stronger land–atmosphere coupling enhanced convection over India. 
 Pre-monsoon rainfall (PMR) over India, occurring during March–May, plays a crucial role in mitigating heat stress, replenishing soil moisture, supporting agricultural planning, and sustaining water resources prior to the onset of the Indian Summer Monsoon. This study investigates the spatiotemporal variability and evolving dynamics of PMR over India during 1963–2022 by comparing two multi-decadal periods: the Past Decades (PD: 1963–1992) and the Recent Decades (RD: 1993–2022). The analysis integrates high-resolution rainfall observations from the India Meteorological Department with ERA5 reanalysis datasets, including sea surface temperature (SST), relative humidity (RH), soil moisture, total precipitable water (TPW), surface solar radiation, and wind fields at 850 hPa and 200 hPa. The results reveal a marked intensification of PMR during RD, with significant increases in both rainfall amount and the frequency of rainy days (>2.5 mm day−1) over southern, central, and western India, while northern and northeastern regions exhibit notable declines. This spatial reorganization of rainfall is closely linked to basin-wide Indian Ocean warming, particularly over the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal, which has enhanced atmospheric moisture availability and convective potential. Increased TPW, elevated near-surface RH, and higher moist static energy indicate strengthened thermodynamic instability, supported by circulation changes marked by weakened low-level anticyclonic flow over the Arabian Sea and enhanced upper-level divergence over peninsular and central India. These conditions collectively favour deep convection and vertical moisture transport during the pre-monsoon season. Multi-model simulations from six CMIP6 climate models independently reproduce the observed RD–PD rainfall increase, reinforcing confidence in the observational findings. Overall, the results suggest that the combined influence of large-scale oceanic warming and locally enhanced convective instability has created a more favourable environment for pre-monsoon convection over India in recent decades. Improving the representation of these coupled land–ocean–atmosphere feedbacks in seasonal forecasting systems is therefore essential for advancing climate adaptation strategies in agriculture, disaster preparedness, and water resource management under a rapidly warming climate."

 The Northern Hemisphere dust belt (NHDB) is a critical region for dust emission and transport, significantly influencing global climate and environmental systems. However, a comprehensive three-dimensional understanding of its dust distribution and transport structure has been limited. This study quantitatively characterizes the vertical profiles of dust mass concentration (DMC), horizontal dust transport flux rate (DFR), and dust mass flux divergence (DFD) over the NHDB by synergistically analyzing the CALIOP observations (2007–2016), the MERRA-2 reanalysis and DustCOMM dust property data. We reveal three key findings: (1) Central Asian deserts exhibit the highest dust uplift, with the top heights of their dust mass layers remaining above 4.5 km year-round and low-DMC (LDMC) layers persisting above 10 km, while North African and northern Arabian deserts show intermediate heights. Crucially, DMC for most sources does not decay exponentially with height, challenging conventional model parameterizations. (2) Dust transport exhibits complex vertical decoupling, in that monsoon-driven flows over South Asia cause dust transport direction to rotate with height, forming distinct stratified layers, while Central Asian deserts maintain stable southeastward transport toward the Tibetan Plateau. (3) The upper troposphere dust belt (UTDB) exhibits seasonally shifting uplifting regions—from the Arabian Peninsula, inland Central Asia, and the Mongolian Plateau in spring to the Tibetan Plateau especially in autumn and winter, with deposition zones migrating correspondingly from the North China Plain to southern China. These results provide critical observational constraints for improving the representation of dust vertical transport in climate models."

 Accurate weather forecasts are important to society and to the economy. However, the extent to which surface air temperature (SAT) can be reliably predicted remains largely unknown. The nonlinear local Lyapunov exponent (NLLE) method takes account of nonlinearity, which governs the evolution of initial error growths in chaotic systems such as the atmosphere and ocean. Using the NLLE method and the ensemble forecasts of summer SAT derived from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts 2009 to 2018, the upper limit of atmospheric predictability can be quantitatively estimated. This study directly applies the NLLE method to explore the upper limit of summer SAT predictability at a synoptic timescale over East Asia (EA). We investigate the upper limit and error growth dynamics for summer SAT over all EA and separately over northern EA (NEA) and southern EA (SEA). Our results show that the upper predictability limits for summer SAT over EA, NEA, and SEA are all 12 days, but there are different error growth dynamics in NEA and SEA. Considering a 15-day forecast period, we found that forecast error growths and rates are larger for SEA than for NEA during the early period, whereas the reverse is true during the later forecast period. Forecast error growths and rates over NEA and SEA also have different spatial structures. Smaller forecast error growths and lower rates occur mainly in western and northern regions of NEA throughout the forecast time, whereas southern regions of SEA have smaller forecast error growths and lower rates than northern regions. Our results will have practical guiding significance for the operational forecasts over EA."

We examine how volatile organic compounds (VOCs), nitrogen oxides, and nitrous acid influence hydroxyl radical, ozone, and peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) based on three aircraft campaigns over the United States. Our analyses reveal variable, highly elevated hydroxyl radical concentrations in the first 2 hours, resulting in evident fire-to-fire variability in VOCs oxidation and in ozone and PAN production. About 40 to 70% of the variability is explained by chemical aging. Ozone production in the plumes is usually VOC-limited for the first 2 hours and then nitrogen oxide limited downwind. Box model results for hydroxyl radical, ozone, and most VOCs, using the full, explicit Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) mechanism, suggest no major gaps in the current best knowledge of gas-phase chemistry. However, the MCM sometimes overestimates PAN due to underestimated nitrogen oxide sinks. GEOS-Chem, a widely used chemical transport model with a reduced mechanism, generally underperforms because of incomplete VOC representation. We identify these critical pathways to guide future model development."

The NOx−production rate using NBs is found to be 60.4 ± 1.21 μM hour−1, which shows a fourfold increase in the production as compared to the same reaction performed in microbubbles (15 μM hour−1), which is the result from an enhanced electric field strength at the GWI.

These components can interact with plastic particles in different ways that may alter their surface properties and environmental behavior. In this study, we examined how soil solution affects the aggregation kinetics and colloidal stability of nanoplastics made from a soil-biodegradable plastic (poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate), PBAT) and a conventional plastic (polyethylene). Without the soil solution, both PBAT and polyethylene nanoplastics aggregated more readily in CaCl2 than in NaCl, with critical coagulation concentrations of 344 and 284 mM in NaCl and 31 and 36 mM in CaCl2, respectively. The addition of the soil solution promoted the aggregation of both nanoplastics, as evidenced by the larger aggregate sizes, despite that the critical coagulation concentrations did not decrease correspondingly. Such an increase in aggregate sizes was induced not only by the formation of an eco-corona on nanoplastics, which enhanced aggregation through polymer bridging and attractive patch-charge interactions, but also by the heteroaggregation between nanoplastics and colloids present in the soil solution. These results suggest that interaction with soil solution can promote the aggregation of nanoplastics through eco-corona formation and heteroaggregation, underlining the role of the complex interactions between nanoplastics and their surrounding matrices on the environmental behavior of nanoplastics."

However, its underlying radiative processes remain unclear. This study integrates GEWEX satellite observations with ERA5 and MERRA‐2 reanalysis, applying surface energy balance diagnostics to quantify the WTV's radiative forcing on T2m variability. We find the WTV explains ∼66% of T2m variance (R = 0.81) across the western TP and the adjacent Southwest Asia. Downward shortwave radiation (DSW) emerges as the primarily radiative factor modulated by the WTV via cloud radiative forcing (CRF) processes. Specifically, anticyclonic WTV events reduce cloudiness, generating positive CRF anomalies that enhancing surface DSW and cause warming. Conversely, cyclonic events increase cloudiness, producing negative CRF anomalies that diminish DSW and induce cooling. These findings advance understanding of the radiative processes by which the upper circulations modulate the surface climate over the TP."

We present the first comprehensive analysis of topside ionospheric ambipolar diffusion using the difference between the field‐aligned ion drifts and neutral winds observed by the Ionospheric Connection Explorer (ICON) satellite. The ambipolar diffusion exhibits a distinct evening enhancement within ±10° MLAT. The reversal of its direction near ±10° MLAT demarcates the boundary between the trans‐equatorial diffusion‐dominated region (within ±10° MLAT) and the area governed by the vertical gradient‐driven diffusion‐dominated region (out of ±10° MLAT). For the field‐aligned drift, the neutral wind contribution is also significant, but less influential than diffusion. The equatorial fountain effect further modulates diffusion, enhancing winter‐hemisphere transport and creating its longitudinal structures. These findings provide crucial observational evidence to strengthen the understanding of ionospheric diffusion mechanisms, offering reliable and critical inputs for ionospheric theoretical models."

We use an implementation of a simple steady source gravity wave parameterization to show that this observed distribution is not reproduced, the most prominent departure from it being a large negative skew. We perform a crude tuning of the scheme's parameters to show that the discrepancy in the distribution cannot be corrected. We observe that at higher levels, parameterized fluxes are still skewed but less so. We suggest that dynamical filtering alone cannot introduce enough variability to obtain fluxes that are log normally distributed."

Based on station observations, we found that since 1990 early summer hot extremes have warmed 2–3 times faster than those in peak and late summer stages. A Lagrangian decomposition points to the main driver for the intra‐seasonally disproportionate warming rates as the enhanced adiabatic heating, contributed by more frequent arrival and intensified descent of upper‐level air particles from west and south. We further illustrated that the past‐decade prevalence of a ridge pattern well atop North China was essential to the enhanced adiabatic heating.

Using Eulerian temperature decomposition, we show that horizontal heat advection (remote) process contributes minimally to both heatwave types compared to diabatic and adiabatic (local) processes. Antecedent factors highlight the critical role of pre‐monsoon showers, followed by nocturnal low‐level clouds and surface moisture, creating a conducive environment for moist heatwaves. In contrast, dry heatwaves form due to anticyclonic conditions, high sensible heat flux, lack of moisture advection, and cloud‐free conditions.

Despite consistent efforts to develop the irrigation network for increased agricultural production, approximately 60% of India's cropped area still remains rain fed, thereby functional to the strength of the Indian summer monsoon (ISM). The probability of a weak monsoon is strongly correlated with the occurrence of droughts during the ISM season. The possible influence of atmospheric drivers in initiating these droughts is observed through the dynamics of low‐level jets (LLJ) over the northern Arabian Sea forming the core of LLJ during the ISM. Interestingly, since the past 72 years, from 1951 to 2022, the core of LLJ has become dry (increased saturation deficit by 17%) and weak (reduced wind speed by 5%). Additionally, the wind speed (saturation deficit) at the core shares close dependence (75%–80%) with the initiation of dry (wet) extremes exhibiting maximum correlation at a 2‐day lag. Furthermore, we observed a 50% (40%) increase in the dry (wet) extremes driven by the lower‐atmospheric dynamics of the LLJ core. Consequently, these dry (wet) extremes are characterized by a 6% (12%) enhancement in duration (intensity). Such conditions act as strong precursors for monsoon droughts."

Natural dust particles are known to have highly irregular shapes, but many models assume spheres when calculating the direct radiative effect (DRE). While the superior performance of non‐spherical shapes in remote sensing applications has been widely recognized, there has been no consensus about the importance of dust non‐sphericity in climate models. We assess the extent of the shape effect upon the dust optical properties and DRE at shortwave wavelengths within the NASA Goddard Institute for Space Studies ModelE2.1. We assume tri‐axial ellipsoids as an approximation to natural dust shapes that is suitable for model applications, and combine a widely used database of ellipsoidal single‐scattering properties with a recent shape distribution constructed from a comprehensive compilation of measurements. We find a shape‐induced enhancement of global dust extinction of +20% ${+}20\,\mathrm{\%}$ (±1%) $(\pm 1\,\mathrm{\%})$, resulting in a global cooling increase of +24% ${+}24\,\mathrm{\%}$ (±3%) $(\pm 3\,\mathrm{\%})$ at the top of atmosphere and +12% ${+}12\,\mathrm{\%}$ (±2%) $(\pm 2\,\mathrm{\%})$ at the surface. The ellipsoidal shapes increase the total dust extinction per unit mass, improving our model representation of the dust optical depth compared to a semi‐observational constraint and ground‐based measurements. However, our analysis shows that the database of ellipsoidal scattering properties covers only one‐third of the observed distribution of shapes. This represents a major uncertainty in evaluating the dust shape effect in model applications."

The Year of Polar Prediction, an international effort to improve weather prediction over the southern polar region, presents an opportunity to study the clouds and precipitation associated with winter atmospheric river events. This study uses enhanced surface, profile, and remote‐sensing observations from the Antarctic Peninsula (AP) during a Targeted Observing Period around 16 May 2022, when an event occurred with local warming similar to a warm front. We compare regional atmospheric simulations with the polar‐optimized version of the Weather Research and Forecasting Model to various in situ and remote‐sensing observations. The study emphasizes data from three stations: Escudero, Vernadsky, and Rothera. Mixed‐phase clouds were simulated at the three stations, with the precipitation being primarily rain at Escudero and primarily snow at Vernadsky and Rothera. The model produced reasonable simulations of the clouds and precipitation. Furthermore, modeled longwave cloud forcing at Escudero had small errors compared to observed values. A sensitivity test enhancing secondary ice production indicates mixed‐phase cloud sensitivity to the Hallett‐Mossop process, especially at Rothera."

This study examines the influence of anthropogenic warming on intense tropical cyclones (TCs) over the Arabian Sea using convection‐permitting simulations with the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. In particular, we provide the first quantitative assessment of the impact of anthropogenic forcing on recently observed TC‐induced extreme rainfall. Human‐induced changes were assessed through two experiments: all forcings (ALL) and natural forcings only (NAT). Anthropogenic warming “delta” patterns of sea surface temperature, relative humidity, and air temperature were derived from CMIP6 models and applied in WRF under a pseudo‐global warming framework. Three major TCs—Ockhi (2017), Kyarr (2019), and Maha (2019)—were simulated, and the model reproduced their tracks, intensities, and rainfall with high fidelity. Comparison of ALL and NAT runs shows a clear anthropogenic signal: TC‐induced total and extreme rainfall both increases, linked to stronger vertical motion and greater moisture availability that enhance latent heat release and deep convection. Furthermore, there is a statistically significant expansion in the area experiencing extreme rainfall by ∼16%–34%, and an enhanced intensity of extreme rainfall by ∼4%–12% under anthropogenic warming. Additional differences in vertical thermal profiles and warm‐core structures further highlight the impact of human‐induced climate change on TC dynamics."

 Land-to-water hydrological connections represent a key regulatory mechanism of carbon transport, controlling carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions from lakes; however, as of yet, there is no assessment of its role at a pan-Arctic scale across large climatic and topographical gradients. We hypothesized that hydrologically well-connected lakes in wetter regions are CO2 sources fueled by stronger lateral fluxes of external carbon relative to drier regions. However, based on data from >200 Arctic lakes, we found that lakes in drier regions have higher and more variable annual CO2 emissions ($${37.0}_{6.2}^{146.0}$$ gC m-2 yr-1, $${{median}}_{Q1}^{Q3}$$) compared to lakes in wetter regions ($${8.0}_{1.7}^{17.3}$$ gC m-2 yr-1), with both the lowest and the highest fluxes recorded among dryland lakes. We hypothesize that with increasing wetness, the relative proportion of fluvial emissions increases, whereas in drier landscapes where lakes often have limited stream export, carbon inputs can be retained and more efficiently emitted from lakes. CO₂ emissions from Arctic lakes are higher and more variable in drier regions than in wetter ones, likely due to limited fluvial export that allows carbon to accumulate and be more efficiently emitted, based on the analysis of a pan-Arctic CO₂ dataset."

 High-resolution ocean observations and numerical simulations are increasingly in demand. However, conventional multi-source remote sensing wind products often struggle to capture the spatiotemporal consistency and dynamic variability required for mesoscale and submesoscale oceanic studies. This paper proposes an Optical Flow-based Temporal Displacement Correction (OF-TDC) method to improve the temporal alignment and mitigate structural misalignment in global multi-satellite wind fields (MSWF). The method treats satellite wind fields as sequential images while utilizing ERA5 winds as a dynamic reference. To ensure consistent input quality for this process, a robust bias correction scheme combining hierarchical Bayesian shrinkage and dual-reference LOESS smoothing is introduced. OF-TDC then estimates advection trajectories of MSWF over time and projects satellite wind fields observed at different times to a unified reference time to complete temporal registration. Evaluations show robust performance under moderate winds of 4 to 20 m/s and effective correction over medium to long timescales, with error standard deviation (STD) reductions of 1° in direction and 0.03 m/s in speed. Tropical cyclone analysis shows error STD improvements of up to 0.19 m/s and 2.24°, respectively, indicating that stronger, compact cyclones enable more accurate OF tracking. Validations against independent GNSS-R data and heavy rainfall confirm significant robustness. OF-TDC enhances MSWF temporal consistency, especially in structured, moderate-evolution environments, facilitating integrated wind and air-sea interaction studies."

 Southeast Asia exhibits strong spatiotemporal heterogeneity in aerosol loading due to mixed emission sources and monsoon–land–sea circulations, and its interannual variability is strongly modulated by the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). This study evaluates the applicability of the Modern Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2) aerosol products in Southeast Asia during 2015–2024 by integrating AERONET ground-based observations, MERRA-2 reanalysis data, and GHSL population grids within a cloud-based workflow. Hourly MERRA-2 AOD at 550 nm and Ångström exponent were validated against observations from 26 AERONET stations. The results show pronounced site-dependent performance, with stronger agreement over inland sites and degraded skill over coastal and marine-influenced environments. A segmented analysis further reveals a clear loading-dependent bias pattern: MERRA-2 shows a weak positive bias under clean conditions (AOD <0.2) but shifts to systematic underestimation as aerosol loading increases, reaching a pronounced negative bias under heavy loading (AOD >0.6), particularly at coastal stations. Component-resolved analyses indicate that organic carbon and sulfate are the dominant contributors to regional AOD, and ENSO-year contrasts show increased organic carbon contributions relative to normal years. Population-weighted AOD maps reveal persistent exposure hotspots over the Indochina Peninsula and major urbanized corridors, with peak exposure years aligned with El Niño episodes. A process-oriented assessment using regional fire density and precipitation time series further supports that El Niño periods are associated with enhanced fire activity and suppressed precipitation, providing a physically consistent interpretation for ENSO-related AOD anomalies in Southeast Asia."

 Global climate change is intensifying sea level rise (SLR) and sea surface temperature (SST) variability, placing low-lying coastal regions at increasing risk. This study evaluates historical (1993–2023) and future (2030–2089) trends in sea surface height (SSH) and SST along Oman's coast by combining satellite data, CMIP6 GCMs, and a novel hybrid downscaling approach capable of addressing non-stationarity biases, unlike Quantile Mapping (QM) alone. Historical analysis reveals significant trends, with SSH rising to 47.86 mm/decade and SST warming by 0.48 °C/decade, driven by steric expansion, monsoon dynamics, and regional heat fluxes. Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) analysis identifies dominant variability modes linked to the Indian Ocean Dipole and ENSO. Among 15 CMIP6 models, HadGEM3-GC31-LL performs best in simulating SSH/SST and is selected for future projections under SSP126, SSP245, and SSP585 scenarios. For downscaling, a hybrid Quantile Mapping–Random Forest (QM + RF) model is introduced, demonstrating superior accuracy (NSE = 0.77–0.90) compared to standalone QM. Projections highlight stark spatial contrasts: under SSP126, mid-century SSH rebounds to +14.3 mm/decade after an initial decline, while SSP585 drives a relentless SST rise (0.85 °C/decade by 2089), exacerbating marine heatwaves. Coastal urban centers like Muscat and Salalah face compounded risks from SLR-induced inundation and ecosystem degradation, with northern Oman emerging as a warming hotspot. This study underscores the importance of integrating hybrid downscaling methods for regional climate adaptation and emphasizes the need for Oman to prioritize nature-based defenses and adaptive infrastructure in its National Adaptation Plan."

While numerous studies have identified elevated concentrations of certain emerging PFAS, the sources and environmental accumulation differences of many homologues remain insufficiently characterized. In this study, we employed suspect and nontarget screening to characterize both legacy and emerging PFAS across environmental matrices, including water, sediment, and soil, surrounding an industrial park with predominant perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) contamination. A total of 32 classes comprising 112 compounds were identified, including 80 emerging PFAS detected through the screening approach. In addition to PFCAs, emerging PFAS, including perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs), perfluoroalkyl alcohols (PFAs), and PFA derivatives, were frequently detected in the study area, primarily in water and sediment samples. In contrast, the contamination profile was less complicated in soil samples, where PFCAs were the predominant homologues. The median total concentrations of target PFAS in water, sediment, and soil samples were 427 ng/L, 4.17 ng/g of dw, and 3.92 ng/g of dw, respectively. Predicted risk assessment further indicated that these emerging PFAS with high concentrations pose non-negligible risks to both ecological and human health, underscoring the need for further investigation into their potential impacts."

Existing assessments fail to account for plant-level heterogeneity in production routes and geographic settings─critical determinants of health impacts─hindering the formulation of targeted decarbonization strategies that maximize health gains. Here, by integrating a facility-level emission inventory with inverse atmospheric modeling, we estimate that the Chinese ISI emits 1.56 Pg of CO2 and 0.85 Tg of PM2.5 annually, with 147,000 (IQR: 121,000–184,000) annual PM2.5-attributable premature deaths linked to ISI emissions, and the health burdens varying by 77,500-fold across individual plants. Blast furnace-basic oxygen furnace (BF-BOF) processes impose 3.8 times higher mortality intensity than electric arc furnaces (EAFs) (172 vs 45 deaths per 1000 Gg steel produced), with 80% of mortality concentrated in 21% of plants─predominantly large BF-BOF complexes in densely populated eastern China. Strategically relocating 30 Tg eastern BF-BOF capacity (3.6% of the national total) to scrap-based EAFs in low-carbon southwestern power grids could prevent 12,300 (IQR: 9500–16,100) annual deaths (8.4% reduction), generating USD 24.5 (IQR: 20.0–30.4) billion in combined climate-health benefits. Natural gas-based direct reduced iron-electric arc furnace (DRI-EAF) integration offers a scrap-independent alternative, achieving ∼50% lower mortality than BF-BOF.

While the oxidative potential of DMSe-derived aerosols has been shown to be greater compared to that of ambient aerosols from various sources, the role of selenium (Se) in processes governing reactive oxygen species (ROS) production remains unclear. Utilizing dimethyl sulfide (DMS) as a chemical analogue and mechanistic control of DMSe, we detected, quantified, and contrasted ROS produced by DMSe- and DMS-derived aerosols in aqueous solutions and confirmed the changes in Se oxidation state after dissolution. DMSe- and DMS-derived aerosols produced 9.0 ± 2.1 nmol ·OH/μg-aerosol and 0.29 nmol ± 0.11 ·OH/μg-aerosol, respectively. The average 33-fold difference in ·OH produced in these systems implies different dominating mechanisms of formation. DMS-derived aerosols can generate ·OH through organic hydroperoxide decomposition, whereas DMSe-derived aerosols are additionally capable of producing ·OH through Fenton-like reactions by cycling among Se(0), Se(IV), and Se(VI). Selenate (SeO42–), selenite (SeO32–), selenium dioxide (SeO2), and methane seleninic acid (CH4O2Se) were redox-active compounds confirmed within DMSe-derived aerosols. This study highlights the redox cycling of particulate Se and the production of aqueous ·OH, which have important implications for atmospheric aqueous chemistry and Se biogeochemical cycles."

Convective‐permitting numerical simulations were conducted. These included a control experiment and a Gap‐Filled experiment with a closed mountain gap near the Gulf of Papagayo, to test the effect of a weaker Papagayo jet on this EW event. The initial disturbance developed into a mesoscale convective system in the Panama Bight and transitioned into an EW in the Papagayo jet exit region, both of which are reasonably captured in the control experiment. The weakened Papagayo jet in the Gap‐Filled experiment reduces the meridional shear of the zonal wind and the associated barotropic energy extraction from the mean flow. This results in significantly weakened upward motion and vertical stretching near the center of the disturbance, thus weakening vorticity particularly at low levels below 700‐hPa in the jet region. The weaker Papagayo jet and diminished low‐level vorticity in the Gap‐Filled experiment can further limit the subsequent EW vorticity intensity as it travels northwest along the Mexican coast. However, the Papagayo jet appears to have a limited impact on the horizontal vorticity structure and propagation of the EW disturbance. These results suggest that the broad‐scale monsoonal westerlies south of the Papagayo jet may help maintain the low‐level horizontal wind shear, even when the Papagayo jet is weakened, thereby contributing to the formation of the EW's tilted vorticity structure."

However, common land surface models (LSMs) overlook salinity effects on ET, contributing to uncertainties in simulating land–atmosphere interactions and climate processes, particularly in the coastal regions. In this study, the Noah‐MP LSM was enhanced to incorporate the effects of soil salinity. Using half‐hourly meteorological forcing data and observed soil properties and salinity from the Dongtan coastal wetland in Shanghai (July–December 2023), we evaluated model performance before and after this improvement. Comparisons with in situ observations show that incorporating salinity significantly reduces the model's overestimation of latent heat flux—by up to 90 W/m2 during the cold season—and decreases cumulative ET bias by as much as 130 mm, with the error rate reduced by approximately 33%. This improvement is largely attributed to salinity constraints on soil evaporation under sparse vegetation conditions. These findings highlight salinity as a key regulatory factor in wetland hydrothermal dynamics and offer a promising approach to improving LSM accuracy in coastal wetland environments."

The combined effects of temperature and salinity on soil GHG emissions still remain unclear. This study integrated in situ monitoring and laboratory‐controlled incubation to quantify the fluxes of CO2, CH4, and N2O from the salt marsh (Phragmites australis) soils in the Yangtze River Estuary, in response to temperature and salinity variations. The results demonstrated that warming magnified the influence of salinity, elevating the salinity threshold for GHG emissions, while at low temperatures (<20°C), emissions remained unaffected by salinity. At low salinity (0–4 ppt), temperature significantly stimulated emissions, whereas higher salinity suppressed them. Nevertheless, at elevated salinity, soil respiration becomes more temperature‐sensitive, indicating heightened microbial activity under favorable thermal conditions. Soil temperature was identified by the random forest model as the dominant control on GHG emissions than salinity, with 25°C and 5 ppt identified as tipping points for temperature and salinity. Under SLR scenarios of 0.5, 1, and 2 m, GHG fluxes from the Yangtze River Estuary wetlands exhibited a slight decline in emissions with moderate salinity increases, but emissions intensify under more extreme SLR scenarios. This study underscores the combined impact of global warming, SLR, and saltwater intrusion on coastal GHG emissions, highlighting the potential reduction in the effectiveness of carbon sequestration by salt marshes.

 Pollen in the atmosphere can affect the Earth's climate by impacting cloud formation and can harm human health by triggering respiratory diseases such as allergic rhinitis (hay fever) and asthma. However, the current understanding of atmospheric pollen is limited by sparse observational data. To address this gap, we integrate spaceborne aerosol optical properties with meteorological and phenological data in a machine learning framework to estimate atmospheric pollen concentrations and composition across the continental United States. The model is based on a random forest algorithm trained using multi-year observations from 40 airborne pollen monitoring stations. Model performance is evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation using three metrics designed to assess mean concentration (Symmetric Mean Absolute Percentage Error, SMAPE), peak intensity (Normalized Average Range difference, NAR), and interannual variability (Normalized Average Interquartile Range difference, NAIQR). The model performs best in regions with dense observational coverage, particularly the northeastern and southeastern U.S.; for example, the average SMAPE for Poaceae in these regions is 0.40, compared to 0.56 in other regions. Our results also suggest that satellite-observed aerosol optical properties significantly improve model performance. Compared to models without optical inputs, our integrated approach achieves up to a 130% improvement in NAR and NAIQR for key taxa such as Ambrosia, Pinaceae, Populus, Ulmus, and Betula. This novel approach provides a consistent and comprehensive data-driven mapping of pollen concentrations, with the potential to extend predictive capability into regions lacking historical observations. Our results demonstrate that model performance improves largely when even limited local data are available for pre-training. This work advances our understanding of pollen distributions in data-sparse regions and provides a valuable tool for climate, ecosystem, and public health research."

 The North China Plain (NCP) faced severe summer ozone pollution in 2023, exacerbating risks to public health and crop yield. Accurate county-level ozone source attribution is essential for precise air quality management, yet conventional city-scale source modeling often overlooks heterogeneity in intra-urban contributions. Here, the Nested Air Quality Prediction Modeling System (NAQPMS), coupled with an online tracer-tagging module, was employed to quantify ozone sources and crop impacts, successfully reproducing spatiotemporal ozone variations across the NCP. The results showed that regional transport dominated summer ozone formation; emissions within 200 km contributed 43%–49% to the site-averaged maximum daily 8-h average (MDA8) O3, rising to 77%–91% at the 800 km scale. Local priority control zones shifted substantially when evaluated against site-average, site-maximum, and maximum population-weighted metrics. Notably, Beijing's maximum noontime ozone peaks (MNP) differ distinctly from MDA8 O3: local emissions contribute 44% to MNP versus 26% to MDA8 O3, whereas 200–500 km transport dominates MNP in Zhengzhou and 500–800 km transport in Shijiazhuang, reflecting intensified midday photochemistry and precursor transport. Furthermore, AOT40-based assessments estimate 21% relative maize yield losses (RYL) across the NCP, primarily attributable to regional transport. In Beijing, local emissions contribute 22% to maize RYL, with urban sources accounting for 26% of local emission-induced RYL. These findings underscore the need for coordinated regional controls to curb long-range ozone transport alongside localized precision interventions, providing a scientific basis for integrated air quality and agricultural management."

 Compound dry-hot events (CDH) are escalating climate hazards in China. This study examines spatiotemporal changes in the frequency, duration, dryness severity, and extreme heat characteristics of CDH using high-resolution daily data, including the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI) and daily maximum temperatures, from 1962 to 2022. Using high-resolution daily data (1962–2022) and a conditional Copula-based framework to calculate a risk amplification ratio (RAR), we analyzed daily CDH events nationwide. Our key results show: (1) a significant increase in the frequency and spatial extent of drought-related heatwaves, especially in recent decades; (2) intensifying CDH events, with annual durations extending by 1.8–3.6 days and severity rising by 2–9 units per event; and (3) drought amplifying concurrent heatwave risks by 3–7 times across most regions, which underscored regionally amplified impacts, particularly in China's arid regions, largely driven by anthropogenic climate change. The analysis, further validated by employing two distinct data products, indicates that background aridity critically modulates both CDH spatiotemporal characteristics and the magnitude of drought-induced heatwave risk amplification. By leveraging daily-scale data and a novel probabilistic framework, this research enhances the mechanistic understanding of compound event dynamics and underscores the necessity of accounting for drought as a key triggering factor in climate risk assessments."

 Numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are subject to inherent limitations such as insufficient resolution and systematic biases, which present formidable challenges for regional precipitation forecasting. High-precision precipitation forecasting is crucial for regional flood prevention and urban flood risk reduction. This study proposes an explainable deep learning framework (DualTransBU-Net-P), integrating spatial self-attention. This framework incorporates a core downscaling-bias correction model (DualTransBU-Net), a post-processing optimization module for extreme precipitation, and SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) for interpretability. It performs end-to-end joint downscaling and bias correction on Global Forecast System (GFS) precipitation forecast data by integrating multi-source data. The results show that compared to existing models, the proposed architecture significantly enhances GFS precipitation forecast accuracy, improving resolution from 0.25° to 0.025°. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the test set is reduced by 4.6% to 18.7%, and the fair threat score (ETS) is improved by an average of 43.9%. Among 437 heavy-precipitation day samples, RMSE decreased for 412 samples (94.3%). The ETS under the extreme precipitation threshold (>10 mm d−1) increased by 50.6% to 63.1%. Furthermore, the model's performance remained high during the seasonal analysis, demonstrating strong seasonal generalization. Interpretability analysis revealed distinct decision-making mechanisms of the deep learning model during heavy precipitation under typhoon and non-typhoon conditions, with different underlying physical factors controlling these mechanisms. The combination of a self-attention mechanism and interpretable deep learning provides an effective approach for refined precipitation forecasting."

 The Italian Peninsula's climate is highly influenced by its complex topography and diverse regional weather systems, making high-resolution seasonal forecasting crucial for many societal sectors. Traditional seasonal prediction models, such as the CMCC SPSv3.5 (SPS), provide valuable insights but lack the spatial resolution necessary to capture local-scale climatic details. Thus, this study aims to provide a high-resolution seasonal forecast over Italy by enhancing SPS through statistical downscaling (SD) techniques tailored to the region's demand for finer-scale climate information. The SD method involves a three-step process that utilises observational datasets (ERA5 and CHIRPS) at 1/4° horizontal resolution and two machine-learning methods based on Empirical Quantile Mapping (EQM) and k-Nearest Neighbours (kNN), translating 1° SPS forecasts into high-resolution fields by matching predicted conditions to observed patterns. Both SD methods were cross-validated over the 24-year hindcast period available (1993–2016), and the results indicate significantly enhanced seasonal predictions for the Italian Peninsula, with biases about 5–6 times smaller than those of the original SPS. The main component of this improvement is spatial accuracy, which allows the identification of domain characteristics that are unnoticed in SPS. The bias evaluated by lead time, key for seasonal forecasts, showed accuracy declining from lead month 1 onward. For instance, the 2 m temperature bias increased from −0.14/−0.31/−0.85 °C in lead month 1 to −0.68/−0.71/−1.41 °C in lead month 6 (kNN/EQM/SPS), highlighting the challenge of maintaining predictive skill and the need for adaptive correction strategies to enhance lead-time reliability. Combining SD techniques with SPS outputs offers a solution for high-resolution seasonal predictions, supporting climate-sensitive applications by reducing forecast bias and improving spatial accuracy."

 This study investigates the accuracy of aerosol optical thickness (AOT) forecasts and analyses during a whole year, by assimilating AOT retrievals from the Naval Research Laboratory (NRL) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) into the aerosol-coupled Non-hydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model. We explore the impact of data assimilation on aerosol direct radiative effect (DRE), taking into account the interactions between aerosol particles and radiation. Evaluation against the assimilated MODIS AOT data shows an improvement in the AOT fields. The root mean square error (RMSE) dropped from 0.027 in the free-run to 0.018 (a 33% reduction) for the forecast and to 0.017 (a 37% reduction) for the analysis, while the correlation coefficient rose from 0.640 (free-run) to 0.911 (forecast) and 0.986 (analysis), respectively. Furthermore, the most significant improvements were observed during the peak biomass burning period from August to October. This enhanced performance is further certified independently by Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations, which show a reduction in RMSE from 0.050 (free-run) to 0.038 (forecast) and 0.040 (analysis), alongside a marked rise in correlation coefficient to 0.810 and 0.884, respectively.

Mineral dust was predominant during the experiment, with Saharan and Arabian dust showing distinct optical properties, in particular, the Angstrom Exponent in the near-infrarred range and Volume Efficiency factor. Both magnitudes can served as a reliable proxy for mineral dust typing. No significant black carbon presence was detected. 
 The A-LIFE (Absorbing aerosol layers in a changing climate: aging, lifetime, and dynamics) field experiment, conducted in Cyprus in April 2017, employed a wide range of ground-based and airborne instruments, including passive/active remote sensing and in-situ techniques. This study presents the columnar records obtained by sun photometry. Two sun/sky/lunar photometers, belonging to AERONET network, were strategically placed at two sites: Pafos and Limassol, 40 km apart. Aerosol optical and microphysical properties derived from direct sun and sky radiance measurements are analysed to determine an inventory of aerosol event days during the experiment, with mineral dust being present in nearly 75 % of days. Ångström exponent values obtained from 1020 and 1640 nm channels (0.5 for Saharan dust and 0.34 for Arabian dust) can be served as a classification criterion. Dust sources are key point for a well understanding of the size distribution and absorption power. According to columnar records, Saharan dust exhibited less absorbing particles. The columnar volume efficiency factor (linear fit between aerosol optical depth and total volume concentration) was proved as a reliable proxy for the identification of dust origin since Arabian and Saharan dusts exhibit different slopes: 1.28 and 1.68 µm2 µm−3, respectively. Analysing all the inversion products mixtures of mineral dust were mainly dominated by Arabian dust, while mixtures of fine and coarse aerosols showed no clear prevalence of dust origin. No significant presence of black carbon-rich aerosols was detected in the atmospheric column, as absorption Ångström exponent values ranged from 1.6 to 3 across aerosol types identified."

We show that increasing European sulphate aerosol emissions played a crucial role in shaping the monsoon rainfall trends. This has important implications for reducing uncertainties in monsoon projections, particularly in light of the diverse future aerosol emission scenarios for the region. 
 Observations show that the Asian summer monsoon experienced substantial multi-decadal changes during the early 20th century, including a wetting trend over South Asia and a southward rainfall shift over East Asia. Despite their significance, these variations have received limited attention, and the underlying mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study investigates the role of increased European sulphate aerosol emissions in shaping these monsoon changes using ensemble experiments with the Community Earth System Model. The aerosol-driven rainfall patterns over South and East Asia resemble observations, suggesting that European aerosols played an important role in modulating the monsoon. These changes are linked to large-scale anomalies in surface climate and three-dimensional atmospheric circulation across the Indo-Pacific, which alter moisture transport to the continent, the main driver of the rainfall anomalies. Regional circulation anomalies form part of a hemispheric upper-tropospheric wave train originating over central Europe and extending through the Middle East to the Pacific. The wave train arises as a thermodynamic adjustment to the aerosol-induced surface cooling and related anticyclone over Europe, extends to the upper troposphere, and, while propagating eastward, induces three-dimensional circulation anomalies across Asia that affect the monsoon. These findings provide compelling evidence for the influence of European sulphate aerosols on the early 20th-century monsoon variability, which is relevant for improving current understanding of the regional-scale impacts of anthropogenic aerosols. As European SO2 emissions continue to decline, this study sheds light upon a possible ongoing and future pathway which may significantly modulate the monsoon response to Asian aerosol changes."

Using computer simulations, we compared flat terrain with realistic terrain and with added winds. We found that even modest hills make the air mix more quickly and rise higher, and winds further strengthen this effect. Our results show that overlooking small terrain features can lead to underestimating how strongly the atmosphere mixes over high plateaus. 
 We investigate how small-scale orography influences the evolution and structure of the exceptionally deep convective boundary layer (CBL) over the Tibetan Plateau (TiP).  Using large-eddy simulations (LES) at 50 m resolution under semi-idealized dry conditions, we compare four experiments over an elevated plateau (4.2 km above mean sea level (a.m.s.l.)): FLAT (no local orography), REAL (realistic terrain), and FLATu10/REALu10 (including a 10 m s−1 upper-level wind).  ABL height is diagnosed using a passive tracer method and cross-validated against turbulence and thermodynamic fields.  All simulations produce a very deep CBL, reaching ∼9 km a.m.s.l. by late afternoon, consistent with the record-high values observed over the TiP.Small-scale orography accelerates early CBL growth and anchors persistent thermals. REAL shows only a modest (∼1 %–2 %) increase in domain-mean ABL height relative to FLAT, yet locally the ABL is up to 20 % higher over the ridge, revealing strong spatial heterogeneity.  Imposed upper-level shear (FLATu10, REALu10) produces deeper and more laterally uniform CBLs, with shear-driven rolls increasing the mean ABL height by roughly 10 %–15 % and homogenizing the tracer field.  Orography primarily affects the upper tail of the distribution, with ridge-top 99th-percentile ABL heights exceeding flat-terrain values by 10 %–20 %, while shear is the dominant control on domain-mean deepening.These results show that unresolved fine-scale orography and shear strongly modulate both the depth and spatial variability of the TiP CBL, and can substantially influence entrainment under weak stability.  Their omission may lead weather and climate models to underestimate CBL growth and vertical exchange over high-altitude regions."

The method performs very well with the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) products as inputs describing the state of the atmosphere. The method exhibits a better performance than published state-of-the-art methods when compared to ground and satellite-based τc retrievals serving as reference. 
 A new method was developed to estimate the cloud optical depth (τc) from photovoltaic (PV) power measurements under overcast sky conditions. It is a fully physical method utilizing directly PV power measurements. It exploits the recent advances and real-time availability at global scale of aerosol properties, downwelling shortwave irradiance and its direct and diffuse components received at ground level under clear-sky conditions and ground albedo, altogether provided by the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) radiation service. In addition to CAMS data, wind speed and air temperature from European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts twentieth century reanalysis ERA5 products are also used as inputs. The τc estimates have been compared to different data sources of τc retrievals at four experimental PV sites located in various climates. When compared to τc retrieved from ground-based pyranometer measurements serving as reference, the correlation coefficient is greater than 0.97. The bias ranges between −3 and 4, i.e., −8 % and 14 % in relative value. The root mean square error (RMSE) lies in the interval [3,8] ([9,21] % in relative value). When compared to satellite-based retrievals from Meteosat Second Generation and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer, both relative errors become comprehensively greater. Nevertheless, our method remarkably reduces the relative bias and RMSE, by up to 10 % and 20 % respectively, compared to the existing state-of-the-art approach. This work demonstrates the accuracy of the method and clearly shows its great potential use whenever PV power measurements are available."

We present a global dataset of plant functional types and corresponding leaf area index for 1985–2020, derived from multiple satellite observations. The dataset reduces uncertainties in vegetation representation and improves the description of phenological dynamics, supporting more realistic land surface and climate modeling. 
 Land surface data describe the heterogeneity of the terrestrial surface and serve as fundamental input for earth system models. Under ongoing climate change and increasing intensity of human activities, land surface data are required to quantify the impact of land use and land cover change (LULCC) and their contribution to regional and global climate. Plant functional type (PFT) and PFT-specific leaf area index (PFT LAI) characterize land surface and vegetation canopy attributes and are essential model inputs. However, uncertainties associated with current derivation methods may limit their application in earth system models. Moreover, long-term, high-resolution datasets of PFT distributions and PFT LAI remain scarce for fine-scale simulations. To address these gaps, we derived a global 30 m PFT map (PFT30) spanning 1985–2020, updated at five-year intervals prior to 2000 and annually thereafter. By integrating multiple high-resolution remote sensing products, we minimized the assumptions typically required for PFT fraction determination. Building on PFT30, we generated a monthly 500 m PFT LAI dataset for 1985–2020 by fusing PFT30 with the reprocessed MODIS C6.1 LAI and GIMMS LAI4g products, using a remote-sensing-derived phenology scheme instead of the empirical approaches commonly adopted in land surface models. Comparisons with three other hundred-meter global PFT products show that all datasets produce broadly consistent tree fractions, while short-vegetation fractions differ substantially; PFT30 shows better agreement with site observations. Compared with empirical schemes, the new PFT LAI dataset can better distinguish short vegetation types such as grasses, shrubs and crops, because it captures realistic phenological variations directly from remote sensing. This long-term, high-resolution PFT map and the associated PFT LAI data provide a finer representation of land surface characteristics and can be applied in land surface and earth system modeling from regional to global scales."

We used a detailed physics-based model simulations to improve runoff estimates in a Earth system land model. Our method improved runoff accuracy and worked well across two different Arctic regions. This helps make runoff parameterization schemes more reliable for understanding water flow in permafrost areas under a changing climate. 
 Modeling of hydrological runoff is essential for accurately capturing spatiotemporal feedbacks within the land–atmosphere system, particularly in sensitive regions such as permafrost landscapes. However, substantial uncertainties persist in the terrestrial runoff parameterization schemes used in Earth system and land surface models. This is particularly true in permafrost regions, where landscape heterogeneity is high and reliable observational data are scarce. In this study, we evaluate the performance of runoff parameterization schemes in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) land model (ELM). Our proposed framework leverages simulation results from the Advanced Terrestrial Simulator (ATS), which is a physics-based integrated surface/subsurface hydrologic model that has been successfully evaluated previously in Arctic tundra regions. We used ATS to simulate runoff from 22 representative hillslopes in the Sagavanirktok River basin, located on the North Slope of Alaska, then compared the output with ELM's parameterized representation of total runoff. Results show that (1) ELM's total runoff was the same order of magnitude as the ATS simulations, and both models were similarly variable over time; (2) minor adjustments to coefficients in ELM's runoff parameterization improved the match between the ATS simulation and ELM's parameterized representation of annual and seasonal total runoff; (3) overall, runoff responses in ATS and ELM are more similar in flat hillslope environments compared to steep hillslopes; and (4) shallower active layer thicknesses and higher precipitation simulations resulted in lower correlations between the two models due to greater total runoff. By incorporating the optimized runoff coefficients from the Sagavanirktok River basin into ELM, the simulated total runoff better matched the streamflow observations at a small watershed located on the Seward Peninsula of Alaska. Our findings revealed important insights into the effectiveness of runoff parameterizations in land surface models and pathways for improving runoff coefficients in typical Arctic regions."

Off-peak delivery (OPD), which refers to the delivery of goods during evening and overnight hours, provides an opportunity to mitigate traffic congestion and improve delivery efficiency. However, the impacts of this delivery schedule on population exposure to air pollution are not clear. This study investigates the spatial distribution of traffic-related air pollutants under two OPD scenarios and assesses their environmental justice implications, in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area (GTHA). Using truck movement information from a regional travel demand model and a chemical transport model, we estimated the diurnal changes in air pollutants. The OPD scenarios entail shifting the shares of delivery trips to the evening and overnight periods and account for induced passenger trips during the daytime, resulting from a reduction in truck traffic. One scenario was designed to reflect the industry sectors that would most likely participate in such a scheme and a realistic participation rate, while the other reflects an aggressive shift to overnight periods. While ambient air quality improves during the daytime, despite increased commuter traffic replacing truck movements, air pollutant concentrations worsen at night due to increased emissions under more stable atmospheric conditions. Under both scenarios, the most disadvantaged communities experience the highest variations in air pollution, as they often live close to highways and major truck routes."

Results vary across vehicle classes but point to common trends: today, battery electric vehicles (BEVs) offer significant (10–60%) GHG emissions reduction compared to diesel internal combustion engine vehicles and are the lowest emissions option per ton-mile of cargo movement, followed by hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) (5–50% emissions reduction). Emissions savings depend largely on the duty cycle and fuel economy of the vehicle type. Future vehicle technology advancements result in comparable emission reductions associated with BEVs and hydrogen FCEVs. Weight-limited BEV trucks see less per-ton-mile emissions reduction due to the impact of battery weight on increased vehicle weight and reduced payload capacity. By 2035, improvements in vehicle efficiency can reduce emissions across all powertrains. However, very low levels of emissions require switching vehicles’ use-phase fuel/energy to low-carbon fuels and electricity. Renewable diesel, e-fuels, hydrogen produced from natural gas with carbon capture and storage or renewables, and use of low-carbon electricity can all achieve over 70% reduction in GHG emissions from the current day diesel-based internal combustion engine vehicle."

In this study, optical microscopy, poke-and-flow experiments, and thermodynamic modeling were combined to examine the phase behavior of wintertime urban PM2.5 collected in Ansan, South Korea. Morphological analyses revealed humidity- and composition-dependent transitions, with liquid–liquid and liquid–liquid–solid states frequently observed in individual particles. Polluted, nitrate-rich aerosols predominantly exhibited liquid-like morphology and followed near-equilibrium partitioning of nitrate and ammonium. In contrast, cleaner, organic-rich particles likely exhibited higher viscosity and nonliquid characteristics, which may have led to partial deviation from equilibrium predictions. These results provide direct experimental evidence of phase complexity in ambient PM2.5 and demonstrate that the particle phase state, modulated by relative humidity and composition, plays a critical role in determining thermodynamic behavior and atmospheric reactivity of urban aerosols."

However, their biological half-lives in humans remain poorly characterized. This study employed a controlled mouse pharmacokinetic experiment with human biomonitoring data to elucidate key parameters for selected NEOs. Human biomonitoring provided renal clearance (CLrenal), while controlled mice experiment provided the volume of distribution (Vd); these were combined to estimate the biological half-life. Analysis of 172 paired human urine and blood samples revealed that CLrenal varied substantially among parent NEOs (median: 9.04 to 158 mL/day/kg) and exhibited a distinct structure-dependency. The CLrenal of fused, bicyclic NEOs (i.e., imidacloprid (IMI), thiacloprid (THD), and thiamethoxam (THM)) was governed by water solubility, while that of their nonfused, monocyclic systems (i.e., acetamiprid (ACE), clothianidin (CLO), and dinotefuran (DIN)) was determined by lipophilicity. A one-compartment log–linear regression analysis of intravenous mice data provided robust estimates of Vd, which ranged from 306 to 700 mL/kg body weight for ACE, IMI, and DIN. By combining Vd with human CLrenal, the extrapolated median biological half-life for ACE, IMI, and DIN were 15.5, 24.8, and 53.7 days, respectively, indicating significant potential for bioaccumulation in humans. Uncertainty analysis and sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of these prolonged estimates, yielding 95% confidence intervals of 5.53 (ACE) to 157 (DIN) days, with even the most conservative scenario giving a range of 5.17 (ACE) to 17.9 (DIN) days. The prolonged half-life of NEOs indicates a significant potential for bioaccumulation in humans upon continuous exposure, which warrants further investigation regarding its implications for human health risk assessment."

Most radionuclides, such as radiocesium (137Cs), remain in the charred residues and burned soil even after wildfires. This study investigated the impact of wildfires on 137Cs speciation in forest litter and soils following the Fukushima nuclear accident. Extraction tests of 137Cs from unburned litter and soil artificially combusted at 250, 375, and 500 °C were conducted. 137Cs leaching from charred residues and burned soil collected from the field after the wildfires was tested. Sequential extraction was performed on soil obtained after the fire. The results indicated that water-soluble 137Cs from burned litter increased with combustion temperature. However, in artificially combusted soil, the release of water-soluble 137Cs was significantly reduced. In the field, 137Cs leaching from charred residues was lower than that from unburned litter. The fraction of water-soluble 137C in burned soil did not differ significantly from that in unburned soil. This suggests that the combustion temperature was relatively low and insufficient to promote significant leaching or soil drying. Furthermore, the combustion of soil organic matter may have altered the exchangeable form of 137Cs. Overall, these findings suggest that wildfires enhance 137Cs retention in soil, potentially delaying its release."

However, due to limited large-scale sampling and long-term wetland distribution records, their impacts on soil organic carbon (SOC) remain poorly known. Here, we integrated a nationwide wetland SOC density database, multitemporal wetland maps, and related geospatial environmental data sets and applied a random forest model to map China’s wetland carbon pool and quantified SOC losses and gains associated with conversion and restoration between 1980 and 2020. The results showed that the mean SOC density of top 1 m in China’s wetlands was 23.10 kg C m–2 over the study period, with pronounced spatial heterogeneity. We found that SOC density declined markedly within the first decade after conversion of wetlands to agriculture, with an average reduction of ∼19%. The rate of decline then slowed and gradually stabilized. Over the four decades, conversion to agriculture led to a cumulative loss of ∼574.66 Tg C, equivalent to ∼10.6% of the national wetland carbon pool. By contrast, wetland restoration promoted SOC recovery, although levels remained below preconversion baselines. Conservation and restoration can offset over half of the carbon emissions from wetland conversion. Among them, restoration contributed 186.36 Tg C (∼3.43% of the wetland carbon pool), offsetting ∼32.4% of conversion-induced losses. Overall, from 1980 to 2020, SOC losses from conversion gradually decreased, while restoration-driven gains gradually increased. These results highlight the critical role of wetland conservation and restoration in reversing carbon losses and advancing climate change mitigation toward carbon neutrality."

This study applied portable exposure samplers to collect PM2.5 samples under hazy, precipitation, dusty, and calm weather scenarios. Non-targeted screening (NTS) based on gas chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC-QTOF MS) was conducted for comprehensive identification of organic contaminants in the samples. Over 500 organic compounds were annotated and semi-quantitatively analyzed. The assessment model combining persistence–bioaccumulation–toxicity (PBT) characteristics with exposure levels was established to identify high-priority pollutants. The results indicate that the occurrence and risk characteristics of organic contaminants vary significantly under different weather scenarios with the compounds’ average risk index for being highest during sandstorm weather. These findings emphasize the importance of integrating weather exposure scenarios into the complex atmospheric environment monitoring to achieve comprehensive risk assessment and provide evidence for targeted air pollution control strategies."

However, for similar cyclone strength and environmental moisture, NH warm fronts during early development contain more ice but are less efficient at precipitating than those in the SH. Higher dust concentrations in NH might explain the greater ice amounts, while higher sea‐salt concentrations in SH might explain the greater precipitation efficiency in their respective warm frontal regions."

In the Southwestern Atlantic, the western boundary current known as the Malvinas Current (MC) fertilizes the outer shelf through recurrent slope‐water intrusions. Here we analyze the 2003–2024 interannual variability of satellite chlorophyll‐a around 41°S, where the inflection of the 100‐m isobath promotes these incursions. The first Empirical Orthogonal Function mode explains 43% of the variance and exhibits a spatial pattern consistent with the MC intrusion zone. Backward Lagrangian simulations reveal that low‐chlorophyll periods correspond to waters advected by the onshore MC jet, whereas high‐chlorophyll years are linked to offshore‐origin parcels likely richer in nutrients. Sea‐level anomaly composites indicate that mesoscale eddies near 40°S can block or deflect the MC, favoring intrusions onto the shelf. These results provide new quantitative evidence that variability in boundary‐current pathways strongly modulates interannual changes in chlorophyll‐a over continental shelves."

Spatially averaged mean heatwave temperatures are reduced by 1.5°C (4.8°C) in +30 days (+60 days), and the spatial area over which records were broken is reduced by 25% (81%).

In July–August 2022 we used an aircraft to sample aerosol near developing deep convective clouds over Magdalena Mountain, New Mexico, USA. We observed INP concentrations consistently at the upper end of those typically observed in continental air with ∼0.01–0.5 L−1 at −8°C. Vertically resolved sampling revealed a deep aerosol layer extending 3–4 km above ground level, in which INP concentrations only varied within an order of magnitude. Above this layer, low temperature INP (<−15°C) decreased, but high temperature INP (>−15°C) remained abundant, despite having been collected in air with a lower aerosol concentration. Compositional analysis of filter aerosol showed mineral dusts dominated the surface area of aerosol larger than ∼800 nm, but the activity of the mineral alone cannot account for the observed INP concentrations. We suggest that these mineral dust particles are internally mixed with ice‐nucleating biogenic components, as they would be in organic containing fertile soils, or there is an additional biogenic/biological ice‐nucleating component(s) strongly enhancing the INP population over what would be expected for mineral dust alone. Finally, ice particle measurements in rising cloud turrets at progressively colder temperatures reveal that the temperature at which we first observed ice was consistent with the measured INP spectra."

A. Veerman;C. C. van Heerwaarden,The Impact of Horizontal Resolution on Surface Irradiance Over Land in km‐Scale Earth System Models,"Storm‐resolving global climate models, approaching km‐scale grid spacings, are slowly emerging. With increasing horizontal resolution, we expect improvements in the surface radiation budget because (a) synoptic variability may be better represented, (b) convective systems are better resolved, and (c) landscape heterogeneity is represented in more detail. Here, we study the performance of two km‐scale global climate models within the next generation Earth Modeling Systems (nextGEMS) project, the Integrating Forecasting System (IFS) and the ICOsahedral Non‐hydrostatic model, in producing accurate downwelling surface solar and thermal irradiances. Furthermore, we study how horizontal resolution affects mean surface irradiances as well as irradiance variability on hourly time scales. Most simulations have global annual mean biases within 4.5 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ and 7.6 W m−2 ${\mathrm{m}}^{-2}$ for solar and thermal irradiance, respectively. Locally, irradiance biases with respect to station observations are up to an order of magnitude higher, with no consistent improvement as we move to higher resolution. Comparing three IFS simulations ranging from 4.4 to 28 km resolution, we indeed find that differences in mean surface irradiance are most pronounced in areas with high orographic variability, suggesting that the better resolved orography is the main pathway of resolution‐driven changes in the surface irradiance climatology. Furthermore, we find that the temporal irradiance variability improves with horizontal resolution among these three simulations, but only at sub‐daily time scales. Our findings suggest that for an accurate representation of surface irradiance climatologies, moving towards km‐scale resolution may not improve much beyond the current generation of climate models."

Oh;Sebastian D. Eastham;Steven R. H. Barrett,Mechanisms driving altitude- and latitude-dependent air quality variations from high-altitude NO<sub>x</sub> emissions,"Mechanisms driving altitude- and latitude-dependent air quality variations from high-altitude NO<sub>x</sub> emissions 
 The environmental impact of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions varies with emission altitude and latitude. NOx emissions from subsonic aviation (9-12 km) contribute to net global ozone formation, whereas those from supersonic aircraft (above 14 km) lead to net global ozone depletion. However, the effects of NOx emission altitude on surface air quality remain understudied. We evaluate how NOx emissions at different altitudes (8–22 km) and latitudes influence near-surface concentrations of two known air pollutants: ozone and fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Using the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem, we find that NOx emissions of 1 Tg N yr−1 at 8–10 km (30–60°N) increase surface ozone (population-weighted) by 0.52 ppb and surface PM2.5 by 35 ng m−3, whereas emissions at 20–22 km reduce surface ozone by 1.73 ppb and increase surface PM2.5 by 310 ng m−3; this is nine times the PM2.5 increase per unit NOx from lower-altitude emissions. These effects stem from altitude-dependent mechanisms: at lower altitudes typical of subsonic aviation, NOx emissions increase upper tropospheric ozone which leads to enhanced surface ozone and nitrate aerosol. However, when emitted at higher altitudes NOx instead depletes ozone, permitting more ultraviolet light to reach the troposphere which boosts OH production and accelerates production of sulfate aerosol while destroying near-surface ozone. Our findings suggest that NOx emissions from high-altitude sources, including supersonic aircraft may not only contribute to stratospheric ozone depletion but also cause larger changes (albeit of mixed sign) in surface air quality than subsonic aviation per unit of NOx emitted."

 Hydropower expansion creates tension between renewable energy goals and freshwater ecosystem health. However, the global impacts of dams across the full spectrum of freshwater biodiversity remain poorly quantified. Here, we combine remote sensing and global threatened species datasets to assess dam-related risk patterns for fish, mollusks, mammals, odonates, and amphibians. We show that threatened freshwater species are consistently more common near dams than elsewhere, with mammals showing the highest exposure. Most species whose risk status changed between 1996 and 2022 shifted toward higher threat levels in dam-influenced areas affected by habitat loss and reduced river connectivity. Planned future dams, concentrated in Global South countries, may further elevate extinction risk, particularly for critically endangered fish. These findings support sustainable planning that balances energy development with freshwater conservation.

 With increasing frequency and intensity under global climate change, storms, particularly typhoons, have become critical drivers reshaping coastal morphology. However, researches capturing the full morphodynamic sequence, especially the pre-landfall phase, remain scarce due to the challenges of field observations under extreme conditions. To address this, continuous observations were conducted throughout the Typhoon Fung-wong on the Yangtze Estuary intertidal flat. Here we found that, the loose and easily erodible surface layer of the intertidal mudflat was primarily eroded prior to typhoon landfall, exposing stiff, well-consolidated subsurface sediments. Subsequently, bed-level change remained minimal during peak hydrodynamics at typhoon landfall, showing that vertical sediment properties modulate morphodynamic responses. The decade-long continuous observations at the Sheshan Station in the Yangtze Estuary confirmed this severe pre-landfall erosion which also appears common across both China and the United States. This highlights the importance of pre-landfall erosion and sediment stratification in storm-driven coastal change prediction and management.

 Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and their halogenated derivatives (XPAHs) are emerging persistent organic pollutants with potential carcinogenicity. Their occurrence in indoor environments remains largely unexplored. We measured 26 PAHs and 40 XPAHs in indoor air and house dust from 45 residences in Toyama, Shizuoka, and Kanagawa, Japan (2022–2024). At least one XPAH was detected at all sites, with concentrations 103–104 times lower than PAHs but with similar size distributions and compositions, suggesting analogous atmospheric behavior. Homes using unventilated wood stoves exhibited indoor/outdoor ratios >10 for high-molecular-weight PAHs, notably benzo[a]pyrene, indicating strong indoor sources. Cancer risk assessment showed inhalation as the dominant exposure pathway, with 95th percentile incremental lifetime cancer risk exceeding 1 × 10−6 in the investigated residences in Toyama, Shizuoka, and Kanagawa, Japan, surpassing safety thresholds.

The experiments were performed inside a closed glass chamber for each species separately. Gas pollutants (NO2 and SO2) and volatile organic compounds (formaldehyde, acetone, n-hexane and n-heptane) were introduced into the chamber monitoring concentration changes. High values of the Pollutant Reduction (PR%) indicator were recorded after releasing pollutants in the chamber, especially for CH2O and SO2. After 24 h, PR% in the chamber ranged 96-98% for all the plant species studied. The ALW was more efficient in removing CH2O and NO2 than other air contaminants. In addition, differences in Differential Reduction Efficiency (DRE%) indicator were observed among plant species depending on the pollutant considered.

Solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) directly traces photosynthetic activity and offers a promising alternative, yet its mechanistic integration into yield models is still limited. In this study, given that the two different photosynthesis pathways C3 and C4 differ greatly in their environmental requirements, we apply this framework to estimate crop yield for two crops (C3: winter wheat and C4: summer maize) in the North China Plain. This framework is based on the mechanistic light reactions (MLRs) model utilizing remotely sensed SIF as a major input. The performance of the model was rigorously evaluated against official statistical yield records. Results indicate that from 2019 to 2022, both SIF and gross primary productivity (GPP) exhibited consistent and synchronous seasonal cycles, with clearly distinguishable dual-growing seasons corresponding to winter wheat and summer maize. Significant linear correlations between GPP and SIF were observed for both C3 and C4 crops, with stronger associations evident in C4 species. In addition, the strength of the SIF-yield relationship varied across phenological stages, and the cumulative SIF over the entire growth period (SIFtotal) demonstrated the strongest correlation with yield. The MLR-SIF model achieved robust estimation accuracy for both crops (C3: R2 = 0.6195, MAE = 0.6802 ton ha−1, RMSE = 0.8301 ton ha−1; C4: R2 = 0.6093, MAE = 0.6054 ton ha−1, RMSE = 0.7483 ton ha−1).

However, uncertainties remain in how ET responds to tree cover (TC) change in Earth system models (ESMs), primarily due to the lack of large-scale observational constraints. Here, we synthesize flux tower measurements and satellite observations to quantify the sensitivity of ET to tropical TC change (∂ET/∂TC) under controlled climate conditions. Using both climate-bin regressions and space-time analogy approaches, we find a robust and significantly positive impact of TC on ET across multiple datasets and approaches, with an average sensitivity of ∼11.06 mm yr−1 per 1% change in TC. This sensitivity exhibits pronounced climate dependence, with ∂ET/∂TC amplified in arid and semi-arid regions, where additional TC enhances transpiration efficiency, but attenuated in humid regions as canopy–atmosphere decoupling limits energy exchange. These findings provide the first large-scale, observation-based quantification of ET sensitivity to TC change and establish an empirical benchmark for improving ESM representations of land–atmosphere feedbacks and predicting tropical forest resilience under the climate change."

We then combine these projections with an European forest resources model to assess the impact of projected fire regimes on forests in three major biomes in Europe (i.e. Mediterranean, temperate and boreal forests, here represented by three countries: Spain, Germany and Sweden). Burned area was projected to increase in all regions in the 21st century, with the biggest increase and highest absolute damage in the Mediterranean region under the most severe climate scenario. Furthermore, we found that future fire disproportionately affects temperate forests, where a higher level of damage occurs for the same relative increase in burned area, compared to the other biomes. This was mostly due to the combination of increasingly favourable weather conditions for fire and large standing biomass, which drove the increased susceptibility of temperate regions to emerging wildfire regimes. Our findings call for mainstreaming fire and fuel management strategies into forest planning to increase resilience to fires, particularly in temperate regions with limited past fire occurrence and a projected increase in favourable fire weather."

This study observed the variations in the concentration of WSPyC in atmospheric aerosols in Sapporo, Hokkaido, over the course of a year, and examined its sources. The results suggest that WSPyC can be formed through the oxidation of soot during atmospheric transport, highlighting the need to reassess the global deposition flux of WSPyC. 
 Pyrogenic carbon (PyC) is a continuum of compounds generated during the incomplete combustion of biomass or fossil fuels. Water-soluble PyC (WSPyC), a PyC smaller than 0.7 µm, is transported to the ocean via rivers or atmospheric deposition and is considered a key component in the long-term regulation of the global carbon cycle. Compared to the riverine input flux, the atmospheric deposition flux of WSPyC may have large uncertainties due to limited observations. This study examines the factors influencing WSPyC concentration in atmospheric aerosols in Sapporo, Hokkaido, based on a year-round observation. The WSPyC concentration in the aerosols, determined with the benzene polycarboxylic acid method, ranged from 1.41 to 46.5 ng C m−3, with an average value of 13.7±10.6 ng C m−3. The average concentration was lower than previously observed near combustion sources. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis revealed that 60 % of the WSPyC concentration was attributed to a K+-dominated combustion, which included the burning of biomass and biofuels. Meanwhile, 40 % of WSPyC was associated with factors related to the atmospheric aging of aerosols derived from fossil fuel combustion. The global WSPyC deposition flux to the ocean has previously been estimated based on the concentration ratio of WSPyC to elemental carbon (EC) or water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC). The results of this study suggested that these ratios vary due to the atmospheric aging processes, including photochemical production of WSPyC from soot, indicating the need for a reassessment of the global WSPyC deposition flux."

We used drones and ground-based instruments to study how dust particles interact with light and relate this to their mass. Current methods often underestimate large dust particles, leading to errors in dust quantity. Our results show that regional differences in dust must be considered to improve climate models and satellite observations. 
 The volume-to-extinction ratio (ζ) is an important aerosol property, allowing to relate gravimetric and optical quantifications, widely used in remote sensing and in climate models. The ζ ratio is affected by the microphysical properties of aerosol particles, including their size, shape and composition. This study presents a synergistic approach combining airborne in-situ observations and ground-based remote sensing to study this ratio during dust events originating in the Middle East and Saharan regions, and to examine its vertical variability and general estimation uncertainty. The data were collected during the 2021 Cyprus Fall Campaign and the 2022 ASKOS campaign in Cabo Verde. The combination of observations offered vertically-resolved information on the particle size-distribution and volume-to-extinction ratio. The findings of this study reveal pronounced differences in the ζ ratio and effective radius across events and regions, reflecting variations in the degree of mixing with fine particles, as well as some variability with altitude due to varying particle size and shape. During Middle East dust events in Cyprus in fall 2021 the observed average ζ was the lowest with ζ=0.53±0.24 µm, whilst for a Saharan dust case in Cabo Verde in summer 2022 observations showed the highest values with ζ=1.14±1.01 µm, both values obtained at the dust layer altitude in some of the reported cases. The analysis highlights large discrepancies compared to AERONET-derived values and previous literature, especially in the presence of super-coarse and giant particles. Scattering computations allowed to evaluate the experimental results and provide insights into the role of particle asphericity. Atmospheric model simulations also showed discrepancies, mainly due to assumptions that neglect larger particles. These findings suggest that improved dust representation in models is essential for accurate climate assessment."

Using 45 years of reanalysis data, we found that warmer sea surface lead to a warmer Antarctic stratosphere during the subsequent austral winter. This link, driven by the planetary waves and reinforced by regional sea-ice loss, provides a new insight to make long-range forecasts for stratospheric warming. 
 In this study we examine the cross–seasonal effects of boreal winter sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the tropical central Pacific (Niño 4 region) on Antarctic stratospheric circulation and ozone transport during the subsequent austral winter using ERA5 reanalysis of 45 years (1980–2024). Our analyses show that warm (cold) SST anomalies in the Niño 4 region during December–February are associated with mid- and high-latitude stratospheric warming (cooling), a contracted (expanded) stratospheric polar vortex (SPV), and enhanced (suppressed) polar ozone concentrations in the subsequent July–September period. This delayed response is mediated by the Pacific–South America (PSA) teleconnection pattern, which excites planetary waves that propagate upward into the stratosphere, thereby modifying the Brewer–Dobson circulation and enhancing ozone poleward transport, ultimately warming polar stratosphere. In addition, as the influence of the Niño 4 SST anomalies on the PSA teleconnection pattern diminishes during July–September, surface heat feedback at mid- and high-latitude becomes critically important for planetary waves. For example, persistent southeastern Pacific SST warming and sea–ice loss over the Amundsen and Ross Seas reinforce planetary waves by releasing heat from ocean into atmosphere. A multivariate regression statistical model using factors of boreal winter Niño 4 SST and June PSA indices explains approximately 32 % of the variance in austral winter stratospheric temperatures. These findings highlight a previously underexplored pathway through which tropical Pacific SST anomalies modulate Antarctic stratospheric dynamics on cross-seasonal timescales."

Our findings provide evidence of the nonlinear responses of cloud systems to absorbing aerosols. When liquid water is relatively abundant compared to aerosol concentration, increased aerosols tend to enhance droplet formation; otherwise, aerosols may suppress cloud development by altering the surrounding environment. 
 Air masses carrying absorbing aerosols play a dual role by altering ambient supersaturation and acting as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), thus contributing to both the semi-direct and indirect aerosol effects. However, in real cloud development processes, aerosol influences can simultaneously act to suppress cloud formation or enhance droplet production, resulting in microphysical characteristics that remain difficult to describe. In the study, an aerosol and cloud microphysics experiment, focusing on warm cloud events strongly coupled with biomass-burning aerosols transported from the Southeast Asia Peninsula, was conducted in the spring of 2024 at the Lulin Atmospheric Background Station (LABS, 2862 m a.s.l.) in Taiwan. One-minute resolution of in-situ data was used in the data analysis, allowing exploration of the microphysical responses under varying mixing states of absorbing aerosol concentration and cloud liquid water content. This study applies the cloud-aerosol mixing ratio (e.g., mass concentration mixing ratio (MCr), log(LWC×106PM2.5)) in conjunction with the ACI index (ACINd=13(∂lnNd∂lnα)) to describe the behavior of aerosol-cloud interactions. Results identify two distinct responses: (1) under high MCr conditions (MCr>4.5), clouds exhibit features of the Twomey effect (ACINd≈0.08); (2) under low MCr conditions (MCr=3–4.5), not only is the ACINd less than −0.06, but the high aerosol loading also coincides with elevated temperatures, lower relative humidity, and a reduction in small droplets (<10 µm), consistent with a semi-direct effect. This study provides a comprehensive explanation of how absorbing aerosols influence cloud systems over East Asia and highlights the critical role of the cloud-aerosol mixing ratio in characterizing the microphysical responses associated with the Twomey effect and the semi-direct effect."

Distinct mechanisms of different-sized CIs in secondary organic aerosol formation were proposed, and a synergistic effect between RO2 autoxidation and CIs oligomerization was identified. This study provided new insights into the ozonolysis process from the Criegee chemistry perspective. 
 Criegee intermediates (CIs) are highly reactive species generated during the alkene ozonolysis, which play a critical role in atmospheric chemistry. Myrcene is a typical monoterpene, and its linear structure is significantly different from other cyclic monoterpenes such as α-pinene. This structural distinction consequently leads to different reactions mechanisms. This study employs a combined approach of matrix isolation Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (MI-FTIR) and smog chamber experiments to elucidate the mechanisms of myrcene ozonolysis from the Criegee chemistry perspective. C3-CIs are captured at 880 cm−1 by using MI-FTIR. Ordered oligomers, which contain C3-CIs as chain units, are detected as significant components in secondary organic aerosol (SOA). These oligomers are formed via RO2+n C3-CIs + HO2/RO2 mechanisms. C7-CIs are more prone to unimolecular decomposition to form C7-RO2 radical, which act as initiators for oligomerization reactions. The mechanisms may also exist in other monoterpenes ozonolysis, which offering new insights into the contribution of CIs to SOA formation. Furthermore, the effect of the synergistic interaction between SCIs oligomerization and RO2 autoxidation is illustrated. The mechanisms facilitate the rapid formation of highly oxygenated species, playing a critical role in particle nucleation. The increase in relative humidity can effectively reduce the formation of higher-order oligomers, thereby suppressing the SOA yield. This study provides a systematic elucidation of myrcene ozonolysis mechanisms, thereby significantly enhancing the understanding of oxidation processes in acyclic monoterpenes."

However, the Earth System models show consistent agreement that there will be an increase in drying over continental Europe with global warming. 
 Observations indicate that parts of Europe have experienced summer drying over recent decades. There is, however, substantial uncertainty in terms of precipitation changes projected by global climate models, underscoring the need for improved understanding to guide adaptation. Here, we analyse changes in European summer precipitation with global warming in 35 CMIP6 Earth system Models using a regional atmospheric energy budget framework. Over the historical period we compare these models to two reanalysis datasets, ERA5 and MERRA-2, as well as the E-OBS daily gridded observational dataset. Although ERA5 and MERRA-2 compare well to observed precipitation, they diverge substantially from each other and exhibit large discrepancies with the CMIP6 models when evaluating other terms in the atmospheric energy budget. In future projections, variability across models increases relative to the historical period for the changes in precipitation, sensible heat and the dry static energy flux divergence, highlighting the uncertainties in the magnitude of these terms. Nevertheless, the models show consistent agreement on the projection of summer drying over continental Europe with anthropogenic forcing over time."

 The stratopause, the boundary between the stratosphere and the mesosphere, is projected to cool and drop in response to anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. A lack of long-term observations with high vertical resolution at the stratopause has made it difficult to quantify trends in this region. We use observations from the Optical Spectrograph and InfraRed Imager System (OSIRIS) and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument to assess the annual and inter-annual variability and to quantify trends in the stratopause temperature and height. The SABER and OSIRIS observations at the stratopause are highly correlated, and both show that the stratopause cooled by ∼ 0.5–1 K per decade during 2005–2021. The observations also suggest that the tropical stratopause moved lower during this time period by 300–475 m per decade. The observational stratopause trends are consistent with trends from chemistry climate models simulations."

Participating teams used satellites, drones, and other systems to estimate methane leak rates without knowing the true rate. Some systems were more accurate than others, and wind and other environmental conditions made measurements harder. Our findings help improve these tools and support efforts to track and reduce methane emissions as new environmental rules take shape in Europe and beyond. 
 This study presents an independent and blinded controlled release evaluation of methane detection and quantification technologies in Europe. Conducted at the TotalEnergies Anomalies Detection Initiatives (TADI) site in France, the campaign tested eight commercial systems – including satellite, drone, and continuous monitoring platforms – under controlled single-blind conditions. Participants submitted methane emission rate estimates without prior knowledge of true release values.  Performance was assessed through detection limit curves, parity plots, and statistical metrics including slope and R2. False positive detection rates ranged from 0 % to 11 %. Quantification slopes ranged from 0.09 to 1.13, with a trend toward underestimation, and R2 values ranged from 0.08 to 0.97. Wind conditions – particularly low speeds and high variability – were a key factor affecting quantification accuracy, emphasizing the need for high-quality wind data integration. This study underscores the importance of rigorous, standardized testing to benchmark technology performance and inform regulatory efforts. Results highlight platform-specific strengths and challenges, providing actionable insights for participants, policymakers, and regulators.

The simulations are compared to two radiance-to-irradiance conversion approaches. Especially for viewing angles in the backscattering direction the approach that is aware of the cloud microphysics results in better flux estimates. 
 To accurately estimate outgoing top-of-atmosphere (TOA) shortwave (SW) fluxes from measurements of broadband radiances, angular distribution models (ADMs) are necessary. ADMs rely on radiance-predicting models that are trained on hemispherically-resolved CERES TOA radiance observations. The estimation of SW fluxes is particularly challenging for cloudy skies due to clouds' anisotropy, which substantially varies with their optical properties for any given sun-object-observer geometry. The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of micro- and macrophysical properties of liquid clouds on SW fluxes estimated by ADMs that are based on a semi-physical model and compare to operational ADMs. We hypothesize that a microphysically aware ADM performs better in observation angles influenced by single-scattering features.The semi-physical approach relies on a parameterized asymmetry parameter gΔ, which depends on the cloud effective radius and, after adjustments during training of the model, explicitly varies with sun–observer geometry. We link these adjustments to single scattering features, such as the shift of the cloud bow and glory with varying cloud droplet sizes.For the investigation, 125 3D cloud scenes are constructed based on observational data and theoretical assumptions. Using a Monte Carlo model, the TOA broadband SW radiances and fluxes of the semi-synthetic cloud scenes are simulated for different scenarios with varying viewing angles (θv) along the principal plane and solar angles (θs). Based on the resulting 20 000 scenarios, the sensitivity and accuracy of the two SW radiance-to-irradiance conversion approaches to cloud droplet size, spatial distribution of liquid water path, and mean optical thickness are quantified.The study emphasizes that explicitly including the liquid droplet effective radius in ADM generation can improve the accuracy of shortwave flux estimates. Particularly for viewing geometries that exhibit single scattering phenomena, such as cloud glory and cloud bow, flux estimates can benefit from microphysically aware ADMs. For the analyzed scenarios, we found that the errors of instantaneous TOA SW flux estimates could be reduced by up to 25 W m−2. For scenes with very large or small droplets, the median error was reduced by up to 7 W m−2."

We describe methods for managing water vapor, calibration, and estimating the various components of measurement uncertainty. With appropriate engineering and calibration, the instrument shows the capability to measure CH4 and C2H6 with sufficient stability to distinguish regional methane emission sources. 
 Concurrent measurements of methane (CH4) and ethane (C2H6) can be used to identify and separate methane sources, as ethane is present in thermogenic sources (e.g., oil and natural gas) but not in biogenic sources (e.g., agriculture). In this study, we evaluated the performance of multiple Aeris MIRA Ultra instruments (Versions 1 and 2) through controlled laboratory tests and tower-based deployments under field conditions. The systems were modified with an external pump, flow control, a Nafion dryer, and a custom-built auxiliary box to automate the system and transmit near real-time data. We determined the best calibration approach for our application, given practical limitations, to be a full calibration cycle (with ambient and high calibration cylinders) about once per day and an ambient calibration cylinder sampled hourly. Measurement uncertainty was assessed, including the uncertainty due to instrument noise as a function of calibration frequency, uncertainty in the water vapor correction, and cylinder assignment uncertainty. Instrument noise was the dominant source of uncertainty for C2H6, while the water vapor correction dominated the CH4 uncertainty. For Version 2 systems with hourly calibrations and a Nafion dryer with counterflow, the mean total uncertainty, including both systematic errors and noise, of hourly averages was 0.8–3.0 ppb CH4 and 0.35–0.37 ppb C2H6. Laboratory intercomparisons showed network compatibility within 1.2 ppb CH4 and 0.23 ppb C2H6, and a collocated deployment with a NOAA Picarro system agreed within 1.8 ppb CH4. Instrument noise varied substantially amongst the instruments, with errors reaching up to 11 ppb CH4 and 2 ppb C2H6 for hourly means, with similar variability indicated in a 50 h cylinder test. With appropriate engineering and calibration, the Aeris MIRA Ultra has the potential to distinguish regional methane emission sources in many field settings."

The present study describes the open access software GLOFI (GLObal wave FIt) which uses the 2D spectral decomposition to perform this removal. It is validated on simulated temperature observations synthesised for ESA (European Space Agency) Earth Explorer 11 candidate CAIRT (Changing-Atmosphere Infra-Red Tomography Explorer). 
 The direct analysis of atmospheric gravity waves (GWs) in temperature observations is difficult since the much stronger signal of large-scale temperature perturbations such as planetary waves obscure the perturbations due to GWs. The small-scale GW perturbations need to be isolated from the measurements by removing the large-scale temperature background, thereby revealing the object of analysis. In this study, the scale-separation via 2D spectral decomposition, which has the advantage of removing physical wave modes of zonal wavenumber up to 7 and wave frequency up to one cycle per day, is discussed. The technical implementation of this technique in a scale-separation Python-based toolbox, GLOFI (GLObal wave FIt), is detailed and demonstrated on a simulated satellite dataset for the ESA Earth Explorer 11 candidate CAIRT incorporating ECMWF ERA5 temperature data. Planetary wave spectra for the specified wavenumbers and frequencies are obtained by using a 28 d sliding window. These spectra are subsequently used to remove perturbations due to planetary waves from the measurements. This is followed by the removal of tides in a similar way but using a shorter 5 d sliding window and a fit of only stationary waves for ascending and descending orbits separately.For the considered dataset, the variances of the difference between reference and GLOFI-generated temperature background are an order of magnitude smaller than GW temperature variances, which suggests that the method removes the large-scale waves to a degree that enables the separation of the GW perturbations. Furthermore, the obtained spectra can be used to generate a global temperature background grid which approximately resembles the actual global temperature field. More importantly, the temperature background estimated by GLOFI at the satellite track coordinates is almost identical to the actual reference temperatures along the tracks. Regarding the performance on data including GW perturbations, the isolated small-scale temperature perturbations are virtually identical to the actual reference GW perturbations from the model.The GLOFI toolbox for scale separation of satellite observations is published as open access along this article."

Heat transfer peaks in spring, while water vapor release is highest in summer. Most stations act as carbon sinks, but one in a forested valley is a carbon source, likely due to vegetation loss and human activity. The findings highlight the strong connections between water, heat, and carbon fluxes, offering valuable insights into climate change and weather forecasting. 
 Land-atmosphere (LA) interactions, through the turbulent exchange of water, heat and CO2 fluxes, strongly influence regional micro-climates, water cycles, energy budgets, and ecosystem dynamics. The Tibetan Plateau (TP), characterized by its vast extent, high elevation, strong solar radiation and extreme weather variability, remains underexplored due to the scarcity of LA observation sites, particularly in its western and northern regions. This study introduces a newly established research and observation platform, comprising 16 planetary boundary layer towers that span diverse landscapes and dynamic meteorological conditions. Across these sites, mean annual air temperature, wind speed, and liquid precipitation range from −3.5 to 18.5 °C, 0.6 to 5.6 m s−1, and 43 to 2164 mm, respectively. Elevation exhibits significant correlations with all meteorological variables, highlighting the pronounced spatial heterogeneity of land–atmosphere coupling across the region. The turbulent fluxes of water and heat exhibit distinct seasonal patterns, with maximum sensible heat flux (SH) in April–May and latent heat flux (LE) in July–August. Most stations act as carbon sinks, with net ecosystem exchange (NEE; the net CO2 exchange between the ecosystem and the atmosphere, where negative values indicate net ecosystem CO2 uptake) ranging from −3.2 to −174.3 gCm-2a-1, except the Medog station, which behaves as a carbon source likely linked to vegetation disturbance and human activity. LE is significantly correlated with SH, NEE and ecosystem respiration, revealing a strong coupling among water, heat and carbon fluxes. This high-resolution, quality-controlled dataset provides critical in situ observations for studying water–heat–carbon coupling, validating models and satellite algorithms, and improving understanding of climate-ecosystem interactions over the TP.

It serves as a critical tool for clarifying the impacts of forest cover change on the regional terrestrial carbon balance. 
 High-spatial-resolution and long-term data on forest cover and plant functional types (PFTs) are crucial for elucidating the effects of forest cover change on the national terrestrial carbon balance. Since the 1980s, China has experienced a substantial expansion in its forested area, primarily driven by large-scale national afforestation programs. However, existing land cover products often fail to capture this long-term increasing trend, leading to an underestimation of forest cover change–related ecological processes. Here, we developed a high-resolution (1 km), annual forest cover dataset for China for 1981–2023. This dataset integrates spatial constraints from multisource remote sensing data with provincial-level statistics from China's national forest inventories (NFIs), providing a consistent and spatially explicit record of forest dynamics over four decades. Building on this primary dataset, we further produced an annual PFT dataset that disaggregates total forest cover into nine distinct plant functional types suitable for use in dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs). Validation against independent data indicates that our reconstructed dataset achieves an overall accuracy (OA) of 84.86 % ± 1.18 % for five aggregated forest types (evergreen needleleaf forests, evergreen broadleaf forests, deciduous needleleaf forests, deciduous broadleaf forests, and mixed leaf forests), and it reproduces NFI-consistent forest dynamics (R2≈1). To evaluate its applicability, we implemented the dataset in the Lund–Potsdam–Jena General Ecosystem Simulator (LPJ–GUESS). Compared with the widely used PFT dataset from the European Space Agency's Land Cover Climate Change Initiative (ESA CCI) and the MODIS land cover type product (MCD12Q1), our product yields a markedly improved simulation of key biophysical and biogeochemical processes in China. Specifically, it reduced errors relative to over extensive regions, outperforming these baselines across 77.7 % and 85.2 % of the terrestrial area for gross primary productivity (GPP), 63.1 % and 69.7 % for net ecosystem exchange (NEE), 66.9 % and 77.3 % for the leaf area index (LAI), and 78.7 % and 85.3 % for actual evapotranspiration (ET). With its high spatial resolution, long-term temporal coverage, and detailed forest type classification, our dataset offers a robust foundation for assessing the ecological impacts of forest restoration and for constraining estimates of China's forest carbon sink since 1981.

We combined the long-term coverage of ERA5-Land with the high accuracy of SMAP (Soil Moisture Active Passive) satellites to create a corrected global moisture dataset spanning 1950–2025. Validated against 3.8 million ground measurements, our product reduces errors by ~ 25 % in the modern period (2015–2020) and maintains ~ 20 % improvement historically (1960–2015). This reliable, daily 75-year record is essential for monitoring long-term climate trends and droughts. 
 Accurate, high-resolution soil moisture data are critical for hydrological modeling, climate studies, and ecosystem management. Unfortunately, current existing global products suffer from inconsistencies, coverage gaps, and biases. In this study, we evaluated the surface layers of three widely used soil moisture products, including ERA5-Land, ESA-CCI (v09.1 Combined), and SMAP L4 with resolutions ranging from 0.1 to 0.25°, against in situ measurements across five networks, including ISMN, CMA, Cemaden, COSMOS-Europe, and SONTE-China. The in situ dataset, to our knowledge, represents the most extensive global soil moisture compilation to date, comprising approximately 3.8 million records, organized into a primary dataset for modern validation (2015–2020) and an independent historical dataset (1960–2015). It is found that during the primary validation period (2015–2020), ERA5-Land exhibits high correlation (with correlation coefficient of 0.69) between measured and predicted soil moisture but the data also shows significant bias. SMAP L4 provides the highest accuracy (with root mean square error (RMSE) value of 0.088 m3 m−3) and low bias, but is limited by its temporal coverage from 2015 to the present. To address these gaps, we developed an adjusted ERA5-Land dataset spanning 1950 to 2025 by fusing ERA5-Land and SMAP L4 using a mean-variance rescaling method optimized for long time-series alignment, which enhanced the spatiotemporal coverage and reduced bias. Validation against the primary validation period demonstrates a reduction in RMSE of 24.6 % and an improvement in normalized Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NNSE) of 30.6 % compared to the original ERA5-Land products. Crucially, the reliability of the backward extension was verified against independent historical observations spanning 1960 to 2015, demonstrating sustained improvements over ERA5-Land with 19.7 % RMSE reduction and 26.6 % NNSE increase. This confirms the robustness of the adjustment parameters in the mean-variance rescaling method. The adjusted ERA5-Land dataset, which is publicly available, can be used as benchmark for future research and support drought monitoring, weather prediction, and water resource management, contributing to global climate resilience across diverse ecosystems.

Based on the Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ) and integrating multi-source data. GloWE-8D is the first publicly available global wind erosion product, offering reliable support for dust emission estimation, wind erosion mechanism studies, and land degradation monitoring at both global and regional scales. 
 Wind erosion constitutes a critical driver of global land degradation and dust emission, posing persistent threats to ecological security, agricultural production, and human health. Although regional-scale wind erosion assessments exist, there remains a lack of long-term, high spatiotemporal resolution, and publicly available global-scale wind erosion datasets, which has constrained a deeper understanding of its dynamic processes and driving mechanisms. Based on the Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWEQ), this study constructed a global wind erosion dataset from 1982 to 2020 with an 8-day temporal resolution and a 0.05° spatial resolution. By introducing a residue factor scheme based on growing season identification, the characterization accuracy of wind erosion suppression during vegetation cover periods was enhanced, enabling a more refined depiction of episodic wind erosion features. The dataset revealed that the global annual average wind erosion total from 1982 to 2020 was 539.13 Pg, with severe erosion areas concentrated in the arid and semi-arid regions of the Northern Hemisphere. The wind erosion exhibited a slowly increasing trend, although with significant regional variations. Data validation demonstrated a high spatial consistency between this dataset and the MERRA-2 dust emission data (R2 = 0.79), and a significant temporal correlation with coarse-mode aerosol optical depth observations from AERONET stations. Furthermore, comparisons indicated that the results of this study were within the same order of magnitude and showed high correlation with existing regional research. As the first publicly available long-term, high spatiotemporal resolution global wind erosion data product, this dataset provides crucial data support for global and regional dust emission estimation, research on wind erosion process mechanisms, land degradation prevention, and climate change response.

Here, we integrated a factorial microcosm experiment with stable isotope tracing and molecular techniques to disentangle how warming and MPs jointly regulate nitrogen (N) cycling in coastal sediments. We demonstrate that warming and MPs interacted nonadditively to reshape nitrification, denitrification, and associated nitrous oxide (N2O) production dynamics. Warming reversed the stimulatory effect of polyethylene (PE) on nitrification, turning it inhibitory, and amplified the suppressive impact of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) (PBAT), primarily through synergistic intensification of anoxic stress. In contrast, warming strengthened PE-driven stimulation of denitrification and mitigated PBAT-induced inhibition, likely due to the selective enrichment of nirS- and nosZ-harboring denitrifiers. Moreover, warming overturned the stimulatory effects of both PE and PBAT on N2O production, shifting toward inhibition through nitrifier denitrification, as substantiated by dual-isotope (15N–18O) tracing and genomic evidence. Collectively, these findings provide novel mechanistic insights into how warming interacts with MPs to reconfigure sedimentary N cycling, with broad implications for predicting the responses and evolution of coastal ecosystems under accelerating global change."

This review provides the first comprehensive synthesis of STGL tailored to urban environments. We summarize advances in graph construction, spatial and temporal modeling, and fusion strategies, and examine applications across urban water systems, soil and agriculture, air quality, and urban risk.

We developed HaloFormula, a software for high-confidence formula assignment of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and DBPs. The workflow integrates candidate selection from a newly constructed formula database, dynamic in situ generation of an isotope matrix database, and formula assignment based on spectral similarity indices, achieving high computational efficiency and assignment accuracy. By incorporating a dual-isotope labeling strategy using equimolar 14N/15N-labeled monochloramine, HaloFormula enhances assignment accuracy and enables differentiation of nitrogen origins. The method was validated across diverse FT-ICR-MS data sets, including DOM and model compounds treated by chlor(am)ination and UV-based processes. HaloFormula assigned 1,875 formulas for a Suwannee River Fulvic Acid data set, of which 937 exhibited 13C isotopes. For halogenated compounds, over 900 Cl-containing formulas were assigned, with more than 1,400 isotopic peaks exhibiting accurate isotopic distributions. Up to 17 isotopologues were detected for individual N-DBPs due to enhanced 15N detection from the dual-isotope labeling strategy, enabling unambiguous formula assignment and nitrogen origin tracking. This novel methodology is readily adaptable for elucidating nitrogen sources in other systems and extendable to broader elemental analyses."

However, the relative importance of planktonic and benthic biomagnification pathways to fish MMHg concentrations in marine food webs is challenging to quantify. Here, we apply compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) of Hg to identify fish MMHg biomagnification pathways across nearshore bay (NB), marine continental shelf (MCS), and pelagic ocean (PO) regions. We observe significant differences in Δ199Hg between MMHg and total mercury (THg), highlighting the limitations of using THg isotopes to resolve MMHg dynamics in the environment. In NB fish, Δ199Hg of MMHg closely matches that of benthic invertebrates, while in MCS and PO fish, it aligns with phytoplankton. According to the MMHg isotope binary mixing model, about 85% of MMHg in NB fish derives from the benthic biomagnification pathway, whereas over 90% of MMHg in MCS and PO fish originates from seawater-phytoplankton trophic transfer. These findings reveal that the benthic biomagnification pathway in near-shore regions has been underestimated in previous models, leading to potential uncertainties in evaluating marine Hg cycling and human exposure risks. This study highlights the importance of the benthic biomagnification pathway in coastal environments and demonstrates the potential of the CSIA of Hg for investigating MMHg biomagnification pathways in marine food webs, which provides new insights for global Hg pollution management under the Minamata Convention."

Here, we quantified γMgly on deliquesced pH-buffered ammonium nitrate (AN) and sulfate/nitrate/ammonium (SNA) aerosols via flow tube experiments by directly measuring SOA formation under variable relative humidity (RH, 75–92%) and pH (3.1–4.4). For AN aerosols, γMgly ranged from 1.92 × 10–4 to 7.29 × 10–4, increasing with enhanced RH due to salting-out effects. Moreover, γMgly decreased by a factor of 2 to 10 as pH rose from 3.15 to 4.4 with NH3 addition, suggesting that acid-catalyzed reactions dominate the Mgly uptake. The pH dependence was captured by a first-order reaction rate constant (kI = 102.44–0.85·pH, R2 = 0.93). This kinetic parameter, together with effective Henry’s law constants, can be implemented to update the γMgly parametrization. Addition of sulfate aerosols was found to strongly suppress γMgly, reducing kI to 12–38% of the estimation on AN-alone aerosols at a similar pH. Our findings underscore the critical role of aerosol pH and composition in Mgly uptake and provide kinetic parameters to atmospheric models to improve predictions of Mgly SOA."

This study integrates epidemiological and in vitro and in vivo evidence to elucidate the role of Fe homeostasis in the effects of PM2.5 exposure on lung injury. Serum was collected from 35 women from Hebei Province, North China, and their residential PM2.5 concentrations were monitored from January 2015 to January 2016. We found that the ferritin light chain (FTL) in serum was positively associated with the PM2.5 concentration, suggesting that PM2.5 disrupts Fe homeostasis in the human body. Intratracheal instillation of naphthalene-1,4-dione-coated black carbon (1,4-NQ-BC), a PM2.5 analogue, increased FTL, but impaired the autophagy flux in rat lungs. 1,4-NQ-BC reduced Fe2+, but increased total Fe in RAW264.7 cells, when there was unimpaired Fe transportation through cell membranes. Likewise, 1,4-NQ-BC activated autophagy, but impaired lysosomal function, consequently inhibiting the autophagic flux in RAW264.7 cells. The role of lysosome dysfunction in PM-induced Fe2+ deficiency was revealed for the first time, via overexpression of transcription factor EB in a RAW264.7 cell model. We concluded that lysosomal damage-evoked Fe2+ deficiency provided sensitive biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets in pulmonary injury associated with ambient PM2.5 exposure."

Here, 41 physicochemical properties were characterized across 30 dust samples and evaluated for associations with EMT progression in A549 lung epithelial cells after 24-h exposure. EMT was assessed using three hallmarks: E-cadherin downregulation, vimentin upregulation, and α-SMA upregulation. A hybrid feature selection strategy combining correlation filtering with LassoLarsCV reduced feature redundancy and improved model robustness. The selected features were modeled using optimized regressors (Extreme Gradient Boosting regressor for E-cadherin and Vimentin; Support Vector Machine for α-SMA), and SHAP analysis quantified each property’s contribution. Crystalline silica emerged as the most influential factor, showing negative associations with E-cadherin and positive associations with Vimentin and α-SMA. In contrast, sodium-, aluminum-, and rutile-bearing components were associated with lower EMT progression, likely reflecting their occurrence within less reactive mineral phases than crystalline silica. Specific surface area and absolute ζ potential were positively associated with the EMT, indicating enhanced particle-cell interactions and surface-related signaling. These findings establish a framework for linking dust physicochemical characteristics to marker-specific EMT responses and demonstrate the effectiveness of interpretable machine learning for particulate toxicity assessment."

Here, we report year-round characterization of ACs (nitrated phenols (NPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and nitrated PAHs (NPAHs)) in PM2.5 at Mt. Gongga, Tibetan Plateau (TP). AC concentrations were higher in the dry season (1.38 vs 0.94 ng m–3), but mass absorption coefficients at 365 nm (MAC365) peaked in the wet season from higher aerosol liquid water content and elevated pH. Clear-sky direct RF (DRF) was positive in the wet season (5.7 × 10–4 W m–2) driven by NPs (single scattering albedo (SSA) = 0.81; imaginary part (k) = 0.055 at 365 nm) and stronger in the dry season (6.8 × 10–3 W m–2) due to higher AC concentrations and solar radiation. Under all-sky conditions, multiple scattering further amplifies DRF, highlighting the cloud modulation of BrC climatic effects.

This work represents the first demonstration of real-time neutron radiography of hydrogen migration in reservoir and caprock lithologies. Cylindrical cores of Indiana limestone, Amherst Gray sandstone, and Tumey shale were subjected to constant-pressure hydrogen charging and scanned in real time using high-resolution neutron radiography. Results indicate immediate hydrogen infiltration in sandstone and limestone, with homogeneous distribution detected throughout their pore structure. In contrast, hydrogen remained largely absent from fine-grained shale under the same pressure, except in an apparently localized fracture zone, where neutron signatures confirmed the presence of hydrogen. Subsequent neutron CT of the sandstone sample, using image subtraction against an uncharged reference, corroborated hydrogen distribution patterns. Even under low-pressure, single-phase conditions, distinct neutron imaging signatures of hydrogen were achieved.

We conducted a repeated-measures panel study of 76 healthy older adults in Jinan, China, with five monthly clinical examinations. Pedestrian-level neighborhood greenspace exposure was quantified using AI-based semantic segmentation of street-view videos collected around participants’ residences. Pulmonary and cardiovascular function were repeatedly assessed, alongside multiomics profiling of blood and urine samples. Linear mixed-effect models were used to examine associations of greenspace exposure with cardiopulmonary outcomes, while causal inference tests and integrative pathway analyses explored potential biological mechanisms. Higher neighborhood greenspace exposure was significantly associated with improved forced vital capacity (FVC), but not with other pulmonary indices or cardiovascular outcomes. In fully adjusted models, each interquartile range (IQR) increase in greenspace exposure was associated with a 189.9 mL (95% CI: 35.9 to 343.2 mL) increase in FVC. Multiomics analyses identified mediating metabolites, lipids, transcripts, and enriched pathways related to immune activation, nitric oxide metabolism, and DNA repair.

Using an ensemble of downscaled climate models, we assess future impacts at GWLs of 1.5°C, 2°C, and 3°C (2.7°F, 3.6°F, and 5.4°F). We compare the number of days/year that exceed air temperature thresholds recommended for safe fan use (35°C, 39°C, or 95°F, 102.2°F) in high‐SVI and low‐SVI areas. We find that for exposure to a 35°C air temperature threshold, at 1.5°C global warming there is an average annual exposure difference of ∼16 days, at 2°C ∼18 days, and at 3°C ∼22 days. For exposure to a 39°C threshold, at 1.5°C global warming there is an exposure difference of ∼5 days, at 2°C ∼6 days, and at 3°C ∼9 days. These results highlight that future warming will disproportionately increase the number of days exceeding adaptation‐relevant air temperature thresholds in high‐SVI areas. These findings support the need to slow global warming and direct adaptation efforts toward more vulnerable communities."

Clean air actions in China, Europe, and North America reduced anthropogenic aerosols, whereas Siberia experienced increased wildfire aerosols due to local warm and dry conditions. South Asia exhibited mixed trends with increased emissions of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and decreased carbonaceous aerosols. Using the Community Earth System Model version 1 (CESM1), this study investigates Arctic climate responses to these regional aerosol changes. Reductions in aerosols from China and Europe‐North America resulted in Arctic warming effects of +0.18°C and +0.16°C, respectively, while changes in South Asian aerosols had a relatively small influence on Arctic climate. Increased aerosols from Siberian wildfires induced an Arctic cooling effect of −0.84°C, outweighing the warming from reduced anthropogenic aerosols. These cooling/warming effects are primarily attributed to changes in northward heat transport driven by aerosol changes outside the Arctic, rather than Arctic local radiative forcing. This research highlights the relationship between regional aerosols and Arctic climate, emphasizing a negative feedback mechanism via which increased Siberian wildfire aerosols, amidst accelerated warming in the Arctic Siberia, buffer the Arctic warming. It also implies that future Arctic warming could amplify Siberian wildfires, potentially reinforcing this negative feedback."

 Europe has experienced abnormal warming over the recent decades. Model-based studies highlight that multi-centennial internal variability of the North Atlantic can strongly affect European temperatures. However, the limited availability of high-resolution proxy records has hindered observational assessment of the existence and amplitude of such variability in the real climate system. Here, we compile annual-to-decadal proxy-based Holocene reconstructions, instrumental observations, and climate model simulations to demonstrate the existence of this multi-centennial variability mode and quantify its amplitude. We show that this mode is closely tied to the internal variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation. Its temporal evolution explains part of the observed 20th century variability, and a shift towards a positive phase in the late 1990s can explain the recent amplified warming over Europe. When its amplitude is constrained by observations, this internal variability may enhance anthropogenic warming in Northern Europe by up to 30% over 2000–2035.

 Compositionally engineered metal-organic frameworks are designed and used to fabricate ultrafast scintillating films. The inclusion of hafnium ions in the nodes of the metal-organic framework enhances the interaction with ionizing radiation, partially compensating for the low density of the porous material and increasing the scintillation yield. The high diffusivity of molecular excitons within the framed conjugated ligands allows bimolecular annihilation processes that partially quench the system luminescence, resulting in fast scintillation pulses in the hundreds of picoseconds time scale. Despite the quenching, the gain in scintillation yield achieved is large enough to maintain the film light yield above 104 ph MeV-1 under soft X-rays. These high efficiencies and fast emission kinetics are obtained at room temperature in a technologically attractive solid-state configuration, placing the metal-organic framework platform in a prominent position for the realization of the next generation of fast scintillation counters for high-energy physics studies and medical imaging applications.

 The balance between liquid and ice in clouds remains a major challenge in climate modeling, largely due to uncertainties in ice-related processes. We investigate the relative importance of four microphysical processes—primary ice nucleation (PIN), secondary ice production (SIP), sedimentation, and transport of ice crystals—for the supercooled liquid fraction (SLF) in mixed-phase clouds using three global climate models: EC-Earth3-AerChem, NorESM2-MM, and ECHAM6.3-HAM2.3. All models identify PIN as the dominant influence on SLF at cold temperatures in high northern latitudes, but diverge elsewhere and for higher temperatures. Implementing a unified SIP parameterization produced varied model responses, revealing fundamental differences in how microphysical processes interact within each model framework. These discrepancies suggest that each model prioritizes different processes in shaping the cloud phase. Such divergence may limit the reliability of conclusions regarding microphysical processes drawn from any single model."

 Rapid surges in vegetation growth—defined by thresholds in growth rate and duration—are critical yet understudied indicators of ecosystem responses to environmental change. Here, we investigate spatiotemporal patterns of such abrupt, short-lived flash flourishing events across the northern extratropical latitudes (NEL) from 2003 to 2022. We find more frequent occurrence of flash flourishing events at high latitudes (≥45° N), where their incidence is 1.6 times higher than at mid-latitudes. Moreover, there is an increasing tendency in frequency, duration, and intensity of flash flourishing events over the past two decades, alongside consistent rises in vegetation indices across onset, post-onset, and entire phases. Model simulations attribute these multiyear increases primarily to elevated atmospheric CO2, while temperature and radiation predominantly control phase-specific variability, with onset traits strongly predicting subsequent phenological responses. Together, these findings identify the patterns and drivers of NEL flash flourishing and highlight their large-scale impacts on ecosystem dynamics, offering critical insights for model improvement and the assessment of ecological shifts."

 Glaciers in High Mountain Asia (HMA) are important water sources for millions of people in arid regions. However, their mass balance exhibits strong regional heterogeneity. The reasons are still not well understood mainly due to limited high-resolution temperature and precipitation datasets in high-altitude zones. Here, we propose a glacier ablation and accumulation index based on firn and snow observation from Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar data, which represent the seasonal ablation and accumulation patterns across HMA. Evaluations of the index with the summer snow line, precipitation, and temperature records from supraglacial weather stations confirm their reliability. Comparisons to available mass balance data show that glaciers with the lowest ablation and lowest summer-accumulation index which are located in the center of the HMA region, have the most balanced state (+0.05 m w.e. a-1). In contrast, glaciers with a high ablation and median summer-accumulation index, show highly negative mass balances (−0.47 m w.e. a-1). Under similar ablation index, the type of glaciers with higher summer-accumulation index is more negative.

 The arid and semi-arid regions of the Eurasian continent (the Eurasian arid region) are home to extensive shrublands and these shrublands are critical components of the regional biomes. However, identifying shrublands and distinguishing them from grasslands via remote sensing remains challenging due to their spectral and phenological similarity, as evidenced by the varying distribution areas and patterns of shrublands across each common land cover product. To address this, we combined a multi-strategy sampling framework with a phenology-pixel-based method to map shrubland distribution in the arid Eurasian region. We achieved a mean F1 score of 67.05%, notably higher than that of existing global land cover datasets. The total mapped shrubland area is approximately 427,643 km2, exhibiting a clear latitudinal peak (30°–50°N) and multimodal longitudinal distribution pattern. In different biomes, climatic conditions—moisture or temperature—regulate the optimal phenological windows by driving functional trait divergence between shrubland and grassland. Background shrubland cover strongly determines identification accuracy. When shrubland coverage exceeds 60%, mapping accuracy shifts from “detectable” to “reliable”. Below this threshold, classification accuracy is limited by phenological noise and topography interference, whereas above it, canopy continuity enhances spectral separability and reduces terrain-related noise. This study demonstrates that shrub coverage, phenological timing, and terrain collectively regulate mapping accuracy. The phenology-optimized classification framework significantly outperforms existing common shrubland distribution datasets, especially in complex microtopography and transition zones. Improved shrubland mapping is critical for evaluating ecosystem health and investigating carbon cycling in arid regions."

 Beach slope is a fundamental morphometric parameter governing coastal dynamics, wave dissipation, and shoreline stability, and serves as a key basis for coastal hazard prediction, wave runup and overtopping assessment, and the design of coastal engineering structures. However, due to the limited spatial coverage and high costs of conventional monitoring techniques, no high-resolution, national-scale dataset of beach slopes has previously been available for China until now. In this study, we develop an automated and transferable framework for deriving beach slopes from ICESat-2 ATL03 photon data and produce the first systematic national-scale dataset of China’s sandy beach slopes. The workflow integrates (1) data preprocessing, including shoreline-orthogonal correction of ICESat-2 ground tracks, vertical datum harmonization to EGM2008, and selection of high-confidence photons (confidence ≥ 2); (2) adaptive photon clustering based on an OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure) algorithm coupled with a moving-window filter for accurate beach photon extraction; and (3) slope inversion using low-order Fourier polynomial delineation of the foreshore combined with robust linear regression. The resulting dataset encompasses 688 along-track profiles covering 243 sandy beaches along China’s coastline. Validation against high-precision reference data, including RTK-GNSS surveys and DEM-derived slopes, yielded strong agreement (RMSE = 0.012, R2 = 0.89), demonstrating the reliability of the proposed method across diverse geomorphic settings. Spatially, the results reveal a distinct north–south attenuation pattern, with steeper, more variable slopes in temperate northern coasts and gentler, low-gradient beaches in the tropical south. This novel dataset provides the first quantitative characterization of beach-slope spatial patterns at the national scale, offering critical parameters for storm-surge modeling, coastal-erosion assessment, and sustainable coastal management. Furthermore, leveraging open-accessible, global-scale ICESat-2 data, this framework is designed for easy transferability across coastal regions, offering a scalable solution for worldwide beach monitoring and assessment."

 Salt inhalation therapies in salt rooms are increasingly popular for prevention and as complementary therapy for individuals with impaired respiratory conditions. “Active” salt rooms apply devices that disperse dry sodium chloride aerosol or nebulized saline into the indoor air, while “passive” salt rooms contain large amounts of salt. However, their therapeutic efficacy remains controversial, and general operating standards are lacking. This study aimed to (i) survey environmental conditions in kindergartens’ salt rooms using a standardized checklist; (ii) investigate indoor air quality during operation; and (iii) identify common problems related to their operation. In our national survey, salt rooms were reported in 500 out of 3372 inspected kindergartens in Hungary. Most of these spaces were characterized by high occupant density and poor ventilation. Air quality was measured in 19 salt rooms. Salt particle concentrations were significantly higher in “active” salt rooms compared to “passive” ones. The maximum carbon dioxide concentration exceeded 1500 ppm during therapy sessions in most rooms. In all cases, the indoor airborne concentration of bacteria significantly exceeded outdoor levels, with a median indoor/outdoor concentration ratio of 48.7. In 7 out of 19 rooms, the concentration of fungi was also above the threshold level. In conclusion, salt rooms can potentially serve as sources of illness and infection due to inadequate indoor air quality.

 This study investigates particulate matter pollution pathways in the industrial corridor of Durgapur and Asansol-Raniganj in the state of West Bengal in eastern Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), a region lacking long-term monitoring and requiring airshed-based management strategies due to prominent transboundary influences. We measured time integrated PM2.5 and PM10 at eight land-use specific sites, over a 15-month period from Oct 2022 to Dec 2023 - one of the first such efforts in this region. The annual PM2.5 concentrations ranged from 86 ± 48 to 171 ± 105 μg m−3, and PM10 from 144 ± 64 to 310 ± 189 μg m−3, with lowest concentration observed in SNT-BG and highest in RG-IND. The concentration peaked in winter, 193 ± 61 μg m−3 and 317 ± 73 μg m−3 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively; driven by stagnant meteorology and reduced boundary layer height (∼396m). In contrast, the lowest concentrations were observed during the monsoon, 55 ± 29 μg m−3 and 100 ± 59 μg m−3 for PM2.5 and PM10, respectively, coinciding with intense rainfall (∼938 mm) and enhanced wet scavenging. Multiple linear regression revealed temperature and relative humidity as major inverse predictors of PM2.5. Concentration Weighted Trajectories (CWT) analyses identified the northwestern IGP, particularly Punjab and Uttar Pradesh, as dominant source regions during post-monsoon and winter. Conditional Bivariate Potential Function (CBPF) analysis indicated high local contributions from industrial clusters and traffic corridors. The health burden estimates 874 premature deaths per million population annually, more than 90% of which is attributed to cardio-pulmonary health end points.

 Organic acids (OAs), crucial components of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), not only influence cloud condensation nuclei but also promote particle nucleation and growth. Elucidating the chemical composition and key sources of atmospheric OAs is therefore crucial, particularly in Central China, a region with agricultural and cooking practices. This study investigated the chemical characteristics and sources of PM2.5-bound OAs (C9-C32 monocarboxylic acids, C4-C10 dicarboxylic acids, 22 aromatic acids) in urban Changsha from August 2021 to January 2022. Results show that the quantified total OAs concentrations continuously increased from 362.2 ng/m3 in August to 894.1 ng/m3 in January. Chemically, hexadecanoic acid exhibited the highest average concentration (14.5% of quantified OAs), followed by p-Terephthalic acid (10.2%), octadecanoic acid (9.6%), succinic acid (9.1%), and azelaic acid (7.9%). Source apportionment revealed vehicle emissions as the predominant contributor (32.2% on average). Notably, biomass burning (24.8%) and cooking emissions (20.2%) also made substantial contributions. Particularly during October and November, biomass burning emission contributions surged to 32.2%, attributable to intensified open straw burning in October and residential firewood heating in surrounding suburban/rural areas in November. Even in August, with minimal agricultural burning and residential heating, biomass burning still contributed over 20%. A significant correlation (R2 = 0.90) exists between biomass burning and cooking emissions tracers in August, which features prevalent charbroiling cooking and concurrently explains the marked contribution of cooking emissions (25.0% on average). This study provides critical insights into the molecular composition and potential sources of OAs in Central China, highlighting the importance of biomass burning and cooking emissions in developing air-quality management strategies for this region."

 Based on in-situ precipitation observations, ERA5 reanalysis, and GDAS datasets, this study investigates water vapor transport and multiscale convergence characteristics during a typhoon-induced heavy rainfall (TIHR) event impacted by the binary tropical cyclones (BTCs) Lupit (2109) and Mirinae (2110) in eastern Fujian, China, from 5 to 6 August 2021. Under the control of the subtropical high, BTCs move slowly, and the southwest monsoon provides abundant water vapor for both BTCs and the heavy rainfall area. Based on methods from both Eulerian and Lagrangian viewpoints, the multi-scale characteristics of water vapor transport at three different stages during the prolonged maintenance of Lupit are quantitatively analyzed and compared. It is found out that the evolution of water vapor distributions clearly reveals the possible dominant reasons for the intensity and location of remote precipitations. The southwest monsoon serves as the primary moisture source, with its transport pathways strongly modulated by the relative positioning of the BTCs. Lupit plays a dominant role in guiding moisture into the precipitating area, whereas Mirinae, although geographically nearby, is located downstream and contributes limited moisture transport to Lupit and the remote precipitation. Decomposition of water vapor flux divergence shows that that the moisture advection by divergent winds (Qv_S) provides a more accurate indication of rainfall centers than the total water vapor flux divergence (Qv_all) poorly, particularly under the influence of complex terrain and multiple interacting systems. Furthermore, HYSPLIT trajectory analysis confirms that two branches of southwest monsoon water vapor transport contribute 78.74% of the total water vapor, while the direct contribution from Mirinae accounted for only 6.56%. These findings underscore the critical role of cyclone-relative positioning in shaping moisture pathways and remote precipitating intensities, thereby may help to better understand the complicated physical mechanisms of moisture transport in rainstorms impacted by BTCs and other atmospheric systems."

We demonstrate the critical role of sulfate burden anomaly and the contribution of sulfur removal processes. Faster sulfate deposition directly lowers atmospheric sulfate levels, while enhanced SO₂ deposition reduces the precursor for sulfate formation. The systematically short sulfate lifetime implies that model improvements should focus on SO₂ deposition processes, rather than sulfate deposition. 
 Including sophisticated aerosol schemes in the models of the sixth Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project (CMIP6) has not improved historical climate simulations. In particular, the models underestimate the surface air temperature anomaly (SATa) when anthropogenic sulfur emissions increased in 1960–1990, making the reliability of the CMIP6 projections questionable. This cooling bias is largely attributable to the unreasonable simulated atmospheric sulfate burden changes. Sulfate burden anomaly are closely linked to both sulfate and SO2 deposition processes. Intensified sulfate deposition directly reduces atmospheric sulfate loading, while enhanced SO2 deposition limits precursor availability for sulfate formation by oxidation. These deposition processes regulate sulfate concentrations directly and indirectly. The systematically underestimated sulfate turnover time in CMIP6 models suggests that refining SO2 deposition process rather than sulfate deposition would be a more scientific approach for model improvement. This is supported by two post-CMIP6 models that show better SATa reproduction after improving the SO2 deposition parameterizations.

 The Eppley Precision Infrared Radiometer (PIR) is widely used for broadband (3.5–50 µm), thermal infrared wavelength measurements of the downwelling and upwelling radiation from the atmosphere and surface, respectively. The field of view of the instrument is 2π steradians with a receiver that has an approximate cosine response. In this paper we examine four equations suggested by the literature that have been used to transfer irradiance calibrations from our standard PIRs that are calibrated at the World Radiation Center to field units used for network operations. We first discuss various equations used to convert the resistance measurements of the thermistors to temperatures of the body and dome that are used in the derivation of incoming irradiance. We then use the four related, but distinct, equations for the transfer of the calibration from standard PIRs to field instruments. A clear choice for the preferred equation to use for calibration and transfer of calibration to field PIRs emerges from this study."

A variety of different sensors measure precipitation, water vapor content, humidity, temperature, and cloud properties in high spatial and temporal resolution. This enables detailed analyses of weather phenomena in a changing climate, such as heavy rainfall events and thunderstorms. 
 This paper describes the first release of Level 1b and Level 2 high-resolution atmospheric data cubes generated in the WegenerNet 3D Open-Air Laboratory for Climate Change Research Feldbach Region (WEGN3D Open-Air Lab). These datasets, based on the continuous WegenerNet 3D observations form a growing multi-year observational data collection at sub-kilometer scale and sub-hourly resolution. They are capable to support the study of weather extremes in a changing climate, water vapor–cloud–precipitation interactions, and interactions between the surface and the free atmosphere, among other uses.The data are not assimilated into reanalyses or numerical weather prediction models. Consequently, they can also serve as an independent dataset for evaluation and validation of such models, as well as of climate-oriented modeling, at high spatial and temporal resolution. The instrumentation behind the WEGN3D Open-Air Lab atmospheric data cubes consists of an X-band dual-polarization precipitation radar, a combined microwave/infrared tropospheric sounding radiometer, an infrared cloud structure radiometer, and a six-station water vapor sounding Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) network with baselines of 5 to 10 km. These sensors form the WegenerNet 3D Observing System and complement the existing WegenerNet climate station network in the Feldbach region. The site is situated in the Alpine forelands of southeastern Austria and covers an area of approximately 1400 km2, with radar volume scans reaching up to an altitude of about 6 km and tropospheric profiles up to an altitude of 10 km. Precipitation radar measurements started in mid-2020, with the current sensor configuration being operational since mid-2021. The dataset will be continuously extended in near real time with the goal of providing a consistent, high-resolution long-term data record for atmospheric and climate sciences.The temporal resolution of the datasets ranges from 2.5 min for precipitation radar and GNSS-derived datasets to 10 min for radiometer-derived datasets. Precipitation and cloud data cubes are provided on a 200 m by 200 m Cartesian grid, with height level resolution ranging from 20 m near the surface, to 200 m at 10 km altitude. These height levels adequately cover the sensor resolution of the observed tropospheric profiles.The Level 1b dataset (Kvas et al., 2024a, https://doi.org/10.25364/WEGC/WPS3D-L1B-10) and the Level 2 dataset (Kvas et al., 2024b, https://doi.org/10.25364/WEGC/WPS3D-L2-10) are published under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license on the WegenerNet Data Portal (https://wegenernet.org/portal/3ddownload/, last access: 9 January 2026) and are described with standardized metadata formats.

Sanz;Clemens Schwingshackl;Stephen Sitch;Giacomo Grassi,The LULUCF Data Hub: translating global land use emissions estimates into the national GHG inventory framework,"We created the LULUCF Data Hub to make information on how land use affects carbon dioxide emissions and removals more transparent and comparable among datasets. We show country-level data from national reports and global sources, allowing users to explore differences and similarities in land-based carbon fluxes. It helps identify where data agree, where they differ, and where more research is needed. 
 Global estimates of anthropogenic land use CO2 fluxes from bookkeeping models and dynamic global vegetation models, as well as those derived from Earth observations (EO), can differ widely from those obtained by aggregation of national GHG inventories (NGHGI). These discrepancies are mostly due to conceptual differences, reflecting varying definitions (or system boundaries) of anthropogenic CO2 fluxes, particularly on the forest carbon sink. This study presents a new online platform ‒ the ""LULUCF Data Hub"" ‒ which compiles various datasets of country-level CO2 emissions and removals from land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). Through a multi-disciplinary collaboration, results from two key global initiatives ‒ one based on carbon cycle modelling (Global Carbon Budget, GCB 2024) and one on Earth Observations (Global Forest Watch, GFW 2024) ‒ are ""translated"" to conceptually align with NGHGI definitions. We compared these global approaches to the 2024 NGHGI data submitted to the UNFCCC under the Paris Agreement reporting rules (cut-off date April 2025). The aim is to enhance comparability and foster consensus on anthropogenic land-use CO2 flux estimates. Translating definitions between datasets considerably improves the match in land use CO2 flux estimates, both globally and for most countries. At the global level, NGHGI indicate that LULUCF is a net sink of -3.4 Gt CO2 yr-1 (2001–2023 average; 2023 estimate is an extrapolation for all NGHGI), whereas GCB reports a net source of +4.7 Gt CO2 yr-1. This +8.1 Gt CO2 yr-1 discrepancy drops to +1.8 Gt CO2 yr-1 when GCB fluxes are translated to NGHGI definitions. When the global net forest-related flux of -5.8 Gt CO2 yr-1 estimated by the GFW model (sum of fluxes from Forest and Deforestation including organic soils) is limited to a proxy of managed forest area, the sink declines to -3.5 Gt CO2 yr-1, closely aligning with NGHGI (-3.2 Gt CO2 yr-1 for forest-related flux only, including Forest, Deforestation, and organic soils in Indonesia). Despite improved alignment in magnitude after translation, some differences persist in global CO2 flux trends: in the last two decades, forests (including re/afforestation) have remained a roughly constant net sink in NGHGI and GCB but are a declining net sink in GFW; deforestation emissions are stable or slightly declining in NGHGI and GCB but increase in GFW. For other land uses, NGHGI globally reports a greater sink than GCB (the GFW model does not include other land uses). At the country-level, we identify both convergences and divergences in CO2 flux estimates between NGHGI and the translated datasets – in sign, magnitude and trend. Notably, after translation, estimates of both GCB and GFW still differ from individual NGHGI values in 19 countries by more than ±0.1 Gt CO2 yr-1 on average (2001–2023), highlighting areas that deserve further investigation."

As models become more detailed, traditional methods are too slow. TChem-atm runs on both standard processors and graphics processors, making these simulations faster and more efficient. The tool provides a foundation for next-generation models that improve predictions of air quality and climate. 
 We present TChem-atm, a performance-portable approach that enables efficient simulation of chemically detailed and multiphase atmospheric chemistry on modern heterogeneous computing architectures. Unlike previous efforts that rely on architecture-specific code or focus exclusively on gas-phase chemistry, TChem-atm supports fully coupled gas–aerosol systems with execution across CPUs, NVIDIA GPUs, and AMD GPUs through the Kokkos programming model. It integrates the flexible multiphase capabilities of the Community Atmospheric Model Chemistry Package (CAMP) with the high-performance kinetic routines of TChem, and includes automatic Jacobian construction with support for a range of stiff ODE solvers. In a proof-of-concept integration with the particle-resolved model PartMC, TChem-atm reproduces the existing PartMC–CAMP implementation within solver tolerances and delivers substantial GPU speedups, especially for large particle populations. Performance benchmarks reveal substantial speedups on GPU platforms, particularly for large particle populations, with consistent results across hardware backends.  TChem-atm enables performance-portable execution across CPUs and GPUs, though optimal efficiency may require modest architecture-specific tuning (e.g., team and vector sizes), with up to a twofold improvement on the NVIDIA H100. It directly supports sectional and particle-resolved host models, while modal aerosol schemes require minor adaptation to provide particle-scale quantities such as representative diameters. By enabling chemically detailed, multiphase simulations with performance portability and host-model flexibility, TChem-atm facilitates the incorporation of advanced chemistry into atmospheric models."

However, the occurrence, mechanisms, and products of surface heterogeneous reactions remain poorly understood. Here, based on flow tube experiments, we show that cleaning-emitted reactive chlorine gases (RCGs) (containing ∼350 ppb chloramine) react with surface-sorbed aromatic and aliphatic amines, generating diverse transformation products, including nitrosamines, hydrazines, chlorinated species, and dimers. As an example, dibenzylamine exhibited a heterogeneous reaction rate constant of approximately 7.9 × 10–3 min–1 at 30% relative humidity (RH), corresponding to a half-life of ∼2.1 h, and with nitrosamine and hydrazine yields of 6.2% and 1.0%, respectively. Nontargeted analysis identified an extensive suite of additional products for different amines, generated through ring cleavage, hydroxylation, chlorination, oxidation, and dimerization. Product formation and reaction kinetics depend on RH, chloramine levels, and amine structures. We further confirmed the formation of these products during cleaning events in indoor environments. These transformation products exhibit greater environmental persistence than their parent amines, especially for chlorinated products, posing concerning exposure risks. Our findings demonstrate that heterogeneous reactions of surface-bound organic amines during cleaning form structurally diverse, persistent, and hazardous products─a process potentially applicable to a wide range of indoor contaminants."

Here, we developed a multiple-probe chemical method capable of quantifying all five key PPRIs under solar irradiation. The method integrates two complementary probe sets: (i) a high-level probe set (5 μM terephthalic acid (TA), furfuryl alcohol (FFA), 2,4,6-trimethylphenol (TMP), and 3,4-dimethoxyphenol (DMOP)) to determine 3CDOM* while suppressing the CO3•– and LOOR contribution, and (ii) a low-level probe set (0.1 μM 4-methylphenol, 0.05 μM TMP and DMOP, 5 μM TA and FFA) to quantify CO3•– and LOORs with minimal probe–probe interference. Using this framework, the five PPRIs were determined in both simulated and natural waters. Kinetic modeling revealed that at Br– < 10 μM, halogen radicals minimally affected the method accuracy, confirming its applicability to most freshwaters and wastewater effluents. Overall, this multiple PC method provides a practical, sensitive, and accessible tool for the simultaneous determination of five major PPRIs in sunlit waters."

Here, we demonstrate expanded applications, indoors and outdoors, with commercial PDMS-foam, including for: (i) wide-scope target analysis of >220 priority substances by quantitative liquid- and gas chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry, (ii) microscopic characterization and nontarget profiling of accumulated fine particles, and (iii) effect-guided discovery of harmful substances, combining toxicological data with nontarget analysis in silico. Median method quantification limits were 0.12 ng/mL, 90% of target analytes had absolute recoveries between 70 and 130%, and hazardous substances were discovered, including ethylene glycols, insecticides, and UV filters. Microscopy revealed the accumulation of abundant fine particles, and the automated characterization of the fluorescent fraction revealed that most were <4 μm. Extracts from outdoor samples reduced human lung cell viability, and multivariate modeling flagged families of potentially toxic substances in a virtual effect-directed analysis. PDMS-foam disks require field calibration to determine their linear sampling rate(s), but current results and applications establish PDMS-foam as a multimodal passive sampler, enabling integrated chemical quantitation, toxicological analysis, and molecular discovery in air."

This work reports methane oxidation rates at 25 °C for oxide-based photocatalysts for methane concentrations ranging from 2 to 5000 ppm. Even under dry conditions with less than 2% relative humidity, residual water attracted to the hydrophilic surfaces of these photocatalysts severely inhibits methane oxidation. Thinning this water layer boosts methane oxidation rates by up to 1 order of magnitude. Furthermore, surface modification of titanium dioxide with a hydrophobic fluorosilane coating (1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorooctyltriethoxysilane) enables room temperature photocatalytic removal of dilute methane even under conditions with up to 80% relative humidity.

Recently, it was shown that treating the exhaust gas with a combination of a scrubber and a wet electrostatic precipitator can significantly reduce particle number, mass, and black carbon concentrations in the exhaust of marine engines. In this study, the effect of the system on the secondary aerosol formation potential was investigated. The exhaust aerosol produced during heavy fuel oil combustion readily formed aged particle mass, with the majority of the mass consisting of sulfate. The combination of the scrubber and WESP reduced the aged PM to levels corresponding to air utilized for dilution of the exhaust. For sulfate, the detected reduction efficiency of the system was more than 99%. The system was also effective in reducing primary PM during both heavy fuel oil and marine diesel oil combustion.

These interactions influence effective radiative forcing, cloud dynamics, and precipitation patterns, yet remain insufficiently constrained due to limitations in observations, modeling, and process understanding. This uncertainty hampers robust policy advice across multiple domains—from estimating remaining carbon budgets and climate sensitivity, to anticipating regional extreme events and evaluating climate interventions such as solar radiation modification. In many cases, the influence of ACI is either underappreciated or excluded from decision‐making frameworks due to its complexity and lack of quantification. This perspective outlines a path forward to overcome these barriers by leveraging emerging opportunities in satellite remote sensing, ground‐based and airborne observations, high‐resolution climate modeling, and machine learning. We identify key areas where rapid progress is feasible, including improved retrievals of cloud microphysical properties, better representation of natural aerosols in a warming world, and enhanced integration of observational and modeling communities. Even as anthropogenic aerosol and its impacts on clouds is reducing owing to emissions controls, addressing ACI uncertainties remains essential for refining climate projections, supporting effective mitigation and adaptation strategies, and delivering actionable science to policymakers in a rapidly changing climate system."

This study documents the remotely sensed fire spread, intensity, and smoke emissions from the wildfires by leveraging fire and emission observations from multiple satellites. We found that during the first 24 hr after ignition, two main fires moved through urban settlements, under hurricane‐like Santa Ana winds, at rates of up to 3.7 km hr−1 while burning 75%–80% of the final fire areas, including all affected residential areas. We also report the first satellite‐derived intensities of wildfires burning through residential areas. With a mean intensity of 72–297 W m−2, these fires at night were significantly more intense than the contemporaneous vegetation fires in the Palisades Fire. Smoke emissions exhibited strong hourly variations that were closely coupled with temporal fire intensity patterns, and the emission coefficients (Ce) of carbon monoxide (CO), total particulate matter, and nitrogen oxides (NOx) were 146, 10.2–21.1, and 0.89 g MJ−1, respectively. In comparison between vegetation fires and residential‐area fires, CO Ce discrepancies suggest that residential fires likely released less CO emissions per unit of radiative energy, whereas temporal variations in NOx Ce discrepancies varied temporally indicate complex factors influencing Ce in wildfires occurring at the wildland‐Urban Interface. Our findings reveal the extreme characteristics of the Los Angeles wildfires and illustrate how integrated remote sensing imagery can provide critical wildfire information to support safe evacuation, firefighting operations, and air quality forecasting."

The kernels comprise a five‐dimensional data set that includes latitude, longitude, time, wavelength, and radiative forcing scenarios. They quantify the sensitivity of top‐of‐atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes to changes in stratospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD), and distinguish between scattering and absorbing aerosols. Band‐by‐band radiative kernels are developed to capture the spectral dependence of ARE, while adjusted kernels account for stratospheric temperature responses. Additionally, an analytical kernel is introduced, enabling the estimation of broadband radiative kernel values from boundary conditions such as TOA insolation, reflectance, and stratospheric AOD. Using these kernels, the stratosphere AREs of the 2022 Hunga volcanic eruption and the 2020 Australian wildfire are estimated. The Hunga eruption resulted in a global mean cooling effect of approximately −0.4 W/m2 throughout 2022. In contrast, the Australian wildfire induced a global mean instantaneous ARE of +0.3 W/m2 and a stratosphere‐adjusted ARE of −0.04 W/m2. Validation against radiative transfer model calculations confirms the accuracy of our kernel‐based estimates. The results demonstrate the significance of spectral dependencies in stratospheric ARE and highlight the distinct radiative sensitivities of stratospheric aerosols compared to their tropospheric counterparts. The developed radiative kernels provide an efficient and versatile tool for assessing the climatic impacts of stratospheric aerosols."

The model performs well when tested against data from a cloud‐resolving model simulation, suggesting it captures the essential physics governing anvil cloud lifecycles. Sensitivity tests reveal a strong dependence of the total net CRE on initial cloud temperature and the timing of convective initiation, and identify several microphysical and dynamical processes that may be relevant for high‐cloud feedbacks."

Warm extremes exhibit broadly linear trends: they are more intense and frequent in the early‐Holocene and weaken toward the pre‐industrial period. In non‐monsoon regions, these warm events respond directly to changes in solar radiation, with only a small seasonal lag. In Northern Hemisphere monsoon regions, increased pre‐monsoon precipitation cools the surface and suppresses warm extremes, while reduced precipitation amplifies them in the South American monsoon region. Notably, in Australia, a decrease in the warmest day temperature coincides with an increase in warm day frequency, reflecting opposing seasonal insolation effects on intensity versus frequency. Cold extremes are simpler relative to warm extremes: at low latitudes, they track winter insolation linearly—the coldest nights occur just after the annual insolation minimum, and their frequency changes accordingly. In contrast, Northern Hemisphere high‐latitude cold extremes show no clear response to orbital‐driven insolation change, likely because they occur during polar night when internal climate variability dominates. Our findings highlight that, under early‐Holocene orbital conditions, both warm and cold extremes are more intense and more frequent, in contrast to more warm extremes but less cold extremes in response to anthropogenic warming."

In China, previous studies focused on the total area of mangroves using remote sensing technique, neglecting expansion of the exotic mangrove species Sonneratia apetala, even when it is encroaching on habitat of native species. We proposed a robust and interpretable approach to identify the exotic species, applied this approach to generate S. apetala map in China for 2024 using Sentinel‐1/2 imagery, and revealed its expansion since start of the SDGs by combining existing data sets. The approach, in the form of a decision rule—Sentinel‐1 VH (vertical transmit–horizontal receive polarization) ≥ −14.390 & Sentinel‐2 B11 (shortwave infrared band) < 0.084—achieved an overall accuracy of 97.0% for the S. apetala map. The total area of the exotic species in China for 2024 was 3675 ha, which is ∼1.25 times the area in 2020 and ∼1.99 times that in 2016. The expansion characteristics of the species were analyzed from multiple perspectives, including at the provincial level, inside and outside national mangrove nature reserves (NMNRs), and across NMNRs. Hotspots of expanded S. apetala were also identified, revealing that these regions are in varied expansion stages. We also reported area and expansion‐rate estimates with uncertainties. This study reveals whether a pixel from Sentinel‐1/2 imagery is inferred as S. apetala. This study provides the first holistic view on expansion dynamics of exotic species, alongside the shrinking habitats of native species."

While global and basin scale trends in TC size have been examined previously, whether there have been regional changes over time remains unclear. Here, using a suite of observations and reanalyses, we detect an increasing TC outer size over the western North Atlantic during 1979–2022. Over the western subtropical North Atlantic where the largest changes are found, the area‐averaged increase in the radius of 17 ms−1 ${\text{ms}}^{-1}$ winds is about 7.5% over this period. Analysis of the large‐scale environment reveals that the air‐sea thermodynamic state has become more favorable for storm intensification, and thereby expansion, over that region.

In this retrospective study, the association between wildfire‐specific PM2.5 exposure and asthma‐related hospital encounters was evaluated among children (0–18 years old) in these two counties from January 2017 to February 2020 at a regional children's hospital. Distributed lag quasi‐Poisson regression models were used to assess short‐term impacts up to six days post‐exposure. Over 9,300 hospital visits were modeled and found that wildfire‐specific PM2.5 was associated with increasing asthma‐related hospital encounters. Specifically, each 10 μg m−3 increase in wildfire‐specific PM2.5 was associated with a 4% (95% CI: 0%–8%) increase in pediatric hospital encounter risk on the day of exposure, with additional 3%–4% increases on days 3 and 4 (95% CI: 1%–4% and 1%–6%, respectively). Cumulatively, these exposures corresponded to a 13% (95% CI: 9%–18%) increased risk over the five‐day lag period. Baseline hospital encounter risk varied across census tracts, reflecting underlying community vulnerabilities. Notably, wildfire‐related health risks were amplified in communities with high baseline vulnerability compared to communities with lower vulnerabilities. These findings quantify the risk of wildfire smoke in communities already facing environmental and socioeconomic disadvantages, emphasizing the need for targeted public health interventions in high‐risk areas."

 The spin supersolid—a magnetic analogue of the supersolid that simultaneously exhibits solid and superfluid orders—has emerged as a promising sub-Kelvin refrigerant with strong low-energy fluctuations and associated entropic effects1. However, the stringent prerequisites have so far confined its presence to certain magnetic insulators. Here we report the discovery of a metallic spin supersolid in a rare-earth compound EuCo2Al9 (ECA), which is a good metal with excellent electrical and thermal conductivity. The high-spin Eu2+ ions form a three-dimensional lattice with stacked triangular layers, in which the spin-supersolid state is stabilized through a mechanism involving both Ruderman–Kittel–Kasuya–Yosida (RKKY) and dipolar couplings. Neutron diffraction shows microscopic evidence of spin supersolidity, demonstrating the coexistence of out-of-plane and in-plane spin orders in this alloy. Our RKKY–dipolar model successfully captures the metallic spin-supersolid Y and V phases in ECA, along with the 1/3 magnetization plateau. The observed nonclassical magnetization behaviours within these phases point to significant quantum fluctuations, probably enhanced by the conduction electrons. The resistivity measurements provide a transport probe for the spin-supersolid transitions, because of scattering of conduction electrons from local moments. Through the adiabatic demagnetization process, ECA achieves ultralow cooling to 106 mK, exhibiting a giant magnetocaloric effect that manifests sharp anomalies in the magnetic Grüneisen ratio. ECA emerges as one of the first metallic spin supersolids, combining low cooling temperature, large magnetic entropy and ultrahigh thermal conductivity for high-performance sub-Kelvin refrigeration.

 The exceptionally low-energy isomeric transition in 229Th at around 148.4 nm (refs. 1–6) offers a unique opportunity for coherent nuclear control and the realization of a nuclear clock7,8. Recent advances, most notably the incorporation of large ensembles of 229Th nuclei in transparent crystals6,9–11 and the development of pulsed vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) lasers12–14, have enabled initial laser spectroscopy of this transition15–17. However, the lack of an intense, narrow-linewidth VUV laser has precluded coherent nuclear manipulation8,18. Here we introduce and report a continuous-wave (CW) laser at 148.4 nm, generated by means of four-wave mixing (FWM)19 in cadmium vapour. The source delivers more than 100 nW of power with a projected linewidth well below 100 Hz and supports broad wavelength tunability. This represents a five-orders-of-magnitude improvement in linewidth over all previous single-frequency lasers below 190 nm (refs. 12–14,20). We develop a spatially resolved homodyne technique that places a stringent upper bound on FWM-induced phase noise, thereby supporting the feasibility of sub-hertz VUV linewidths. Our work addresses the central challenge towards a 229Th-based nuclear clock and establishes a widely tunable, ultranarrow-linewidth laser platform for potential applications across quantum information science21–24, condensed-matter physics25 and high-resolution VUV spectroscopy26.

 Electrocatalytic CO₂ reduction (ECO₂R) presents a sustainable pathway for industrial decarbonization by converting CO₂ into carbon-neutral fuels and chemicals. Despite progress in catalyst design, industrial scalability is hindered by slow mass-transfer kinetics. Here, we introduce a high-diffusion-flux gas diffusion electrode (HDF-GDE) that overcomes this limitation in alkali-cation-free systems, achieving CO₂ conversion rates at industrial current densities. Kinetic analysis demonstrates that conversion is governed by mass transfer efficiency rather than flow rate. By optimizing the GDE structure to maximize CO₂ diffusion and GDE utilization, we realize a kW-scale ECO₂R system with stability (>1000 hours), producing CO or C₂H₄ depending on the catalyst. Operating with a 3 L/min CO₂ flow rate, the system delivers 144 kg of CO (1.29 kW) or 17 kg of C2H4 (1.95 kW) over 1000 h. The alkali-cation-free ECO2R system, equipped with HDF-GDEs, demonstrates economic viability for large-scale ECO2R-to-CO/C2H4 production.

 Ice accumulation poses a significant threat to aviation safety and energy infrastructure. Photothermal superhydrophobic surfaces offer a promising anti-/deicing strategy; however, their excessive heat absorption in summer accelerates material degradation and exacerbates urban heat island effects, highlighting the urgent need for dynamic thermal regulation. In this study, we present a self-regulated photothermal storage superhydrophobic film with a trilayer design, comprising a photothermal phase-change base layer, a freeze-resistant thermochromic hydrogel interlayer, and a transparent superhydrophobic top layer. This multifunctional design enables seasonal adaptability, achieving 92% solar absorptance for efficient anti-/deicing in winter and 62% solar modulation to mitigate overheating in summer. This dual mode prolongs freezing time by 10-fold at −20 °C and lowers surface temperature by up to 17 °C in hot weather, demonstrating substantial potential for global building energy-savings. Additionally, its ultraviolet-blocking capability and durable superhydrophobicity ensure long-term durability performance in harsh environments. This work not only addresses the critical overheating challenge in photothermal materials but also advances the development of next-generation anti-icing systems.

This research reveals that national inventories widely omit key sources and apply inconsistent methods, which lead to greatly under-reported emissions. 
 The wastewater sector is now increasingly targeting fugitive CH4 and N2O emissions. National inventory reports (NIRs) are central to tracking these non-CO2 emissions, yet the extent to which NIRs capture sector-wide wastewater emissions remain unclear due to inconsistent accounting methodologies, complex systems and large fluctuations across regions and time. Here we conduct a global analysis of wastewater GHG accounting in NIRs, which reveals widespread omissions of key wastewater pathways and methodological discrepancies. These shortcomings systematically underestimate sectoral emissions and undermine cross-country comparability. For 38 countries studied, we estimate an unreported gap of 52.0–73.2 million metric tons (MMT) of CO2-equivalent (CO2e) per year, largely from omitted pathways and underestimation at centralized wastewater facilities. Extrapolated globally, approximately 94–150 MMT CO2e yr−1 are under-reported, though precise quantification remains challenging due to the lack of detailed activity data. These findings underscore the need for more comprehensive and harmonized accounting approaches in future Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change guideline revisions to strengthen wastewater GHG inventories.

 Climate change and increases in the frequency and severity of climate-driven wildfires, particularly in the western United States, has serious ramifications for enhanced downwind reactive nitrogen (Nr) emissions, deposition, and critical load exceedances. Here we present a multi-decadal (2002 − 2021), harmonized model-data-driven study using the George Mason University North American Chemical Reanalysis (NACR) system and simulations including both “with-fire” and “without-fire” conditions to quantify the change in trends of fire activity and source contributions to total Nr emissions and deposition over the U.S. Our results show that fire activity has increased substantially in the western U.S., especially in the west-northwest U.S. for wildfires, and that this increase is associated with positive annual near-surface temperature and vapor pressure deficit anomalies compared to the period average. Major results and implications of this work are increasing trends in the contribution of climate-driven wildfires to higher Nr emissions, deposition, and critical load exceedances of up to 20-40% due to fires in the western U.S. There are also smaller increases (<5 %) in Nr deposition trends for the eastern U.S., which are related to greater occurrence and reporting of agricultural and prescribed burns.

 Atmospheric rivers cause extreme precipitation and sustain water resources in the western United States. Their occurrence has often been attributed to extratropical cyclones. Here, we apply a recently proposed multiscale index to atmospheric rivers identified from reanalysis data and show that their landfalls in this region are not merely synoptic-scale phenomena but are also driven by large-scale circulation independent of extratropical cyclones. Specifically, quasi-stationary waves with centers of action along the Eurasian and North American coasts form a circum-North Pacific pattern. This large-scale teleconnection pattern channels subtropical moisture toward the U.S. West Coast on intraseasonal timescales, enabling its constructive interference with extratropical cyclone-induced moisture transport. The resulting “intermediate” atmospheric rivers account for up to twice as much winter precipitation as purely synoptic atmospheric rivers and exhibit a stronger correspondence with high-category events. Recognizing this multiscale process will be critical for the improved understanding of their predictability, variability and projected changes.

 Geostationary Earth Orbit (GEO) satellites offer unique capabilities for capturing diurnal variations and providing valuable insights into aerosol cycles. However, publicly available hourly aerosol products with sufficient accuracy remain scarce across Europe, Africa, and West Asia, primarily due to the lack of shorter-wavelength (< 0.6 μm) channels on the Meteosat Second Generation (MSG) satellite series. Therefore, we developed a novel “AeroTrans” deep learning framework to retrieve hourly aerosol optical depth (AOD) at 550 nm over land in 2021 from MSG-1/SEVIRI imagery, which offers wider spatial coverage through Indian Ocean Data Coverage (IODC). This framework integrates an advanced time-sequence Transformer architecture with transfer learning, utilizing pre-training and fine-tuning techniques. The eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analysis revealed that satellite observations across multiple wavelengths contribute 38% to the AOD retrieval, followed by viewing geometry (34%). In comparison with ground-based AOD measurements, our model achieves high accuracy, with an average ten-fold cross-validation (CV) R2 of 0.88 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.079. Additionally, our model maintains strong predictive performance in areas and periods lacking ground-based measurements, as evidenced by strong spatial- and temporal-based CV-R2 values ranging from 0.71 to 0.86. The model performance is significantly improved when withholding each continent, with accuracy increasing markedly (R = 0.71–0.78) compared to models trained without transfer learning (R = 0.23–0.47). Using the generated reliable 3-km-resolution AOD datasets, we capture pronounced diurnal aerosol variations, characterized by a gradual increase after sunrise, a peak around 10:00 UTC, and a decline by late afternoon, with average magnitude changes of approximately 26% ± 15% relative to the daily mean level (0.22 ± 0.14) on an annual scale, especially during the Northern Hemisphere summer, reaching 30% ± 19%. More importantly, we successfully tracked the rapid dispersion of aerosols and their transport process throughout the day during highly polluted events, driven by both natural and anthropogenic emissions, including dust storms, wildfires, and urban haze. These findings emphasize the unique value of our study for advancing aerosol research over under-monitored regions, particularly focusing on diurnal variations during extreme events."

 Rapid urbanization across many regions worldwide has significantly contributed to the growth of deprived urban areas (DUAs), often called slums or informal settlements. The lack of reliable geospatial information on their location and extent in many cities continues to hinder efforts aimed at improving living conditions. This study addresses this critical information gap by exploring a User- and Data-centric Artificial Intelligence (AI) approach for accurately mapping these areas to support Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Indicator 11.1.1. In collaboration with local communities, governments, and international stakeholders, we co-designed an AI-driven strategy leveraging open Earth Observation (EO) and geospatial data acrosseight cities worldwide. Instead of relying solely on algorithmic precision, our method prioritizes local knowledge, iterative validation, and adaptive data collection. To achieve this, we developed a tailored multi-branch encoder-decoder convolutional neural network capable of integrating multi-modal data sources. Our approach incorporates an agile and iterativemodel refinement process, ensuring continuous feedback loops between AI design, data collection, and validation. Recognizing the importance of stakeholder engagement, we developed the IDEAtlas collaborative data collection platform - https://portal.ideatlas.eu/ - to enhance data quality and inclusivity. The resulting dataset (IDEABench) is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.17026/PT/X4NJII to facilitate continued research and development. Findings indicate that fusing multi-spectral EO data with urban morphometric features, particularly Sentinel-2 imagery and built-up density, provides the highest accuracy for identifying DUAs. Furthermore, improvements in reference data quality through the IDEAtlas platform led to increased mapping precision.

 Depth-resolved soil moisture is hard to obtain at basin scale because satellites sense only the upper few centimeters and field profiles are sparse. We use Earth-observation (EO) predictors with limited profile data to map volumetric water content (VWC) at 10-cm intervals from 0–1 m in a permafrost-affected basin. The pipeline benchmarks tree ensembles and then applies Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)-guided selection to build a compact 12-predictor Extra Trees model, followed by block-wise mapping on 30-m grids. On an external 10% hold-out, the model achieves R2 = 0.85 and RMSE = 0.08 L/L, with > 80% of residuals within ± 0.10 L/L. Skill is stable through most layers but degrades at 90–100 cm, reflecting limited test support and weaker surface constraint at depth. SHAP attribution identifies permafrost presence, wetland extent, vegetation greenness, and terrain metrics as leading controls, with surface influences weaken below 50 cm. Residual diagnostics show no pronounced distance-to-river shift in residual centroids and no significant spatial clustering in site-mean residuals (Moran’s I). The resulting GIS-ready GeoTIFFs provide depth-layered, climatology-consistent thaw-season VWC patterns that complement coarse satellite soil-moisture products by resolving subsurface heterogeneity."

 Indoor exposure to semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) is affected by their sorption onto indoor surfaces such as clothes, toys, building materials and furniture. They are transferred from these contaminated surfaces to the body via various routes such as skin contact, inhalation or hand-to-mouth transfer. Knowledge of their sink surface/air partition coefficients KSurf are needed to apply indoor fate models and assess occupants’ exposure to SVOCs.Partition coefficients of triphenyl phosphate (TPP), 2-ethylhexyl diphenyl phosphate (EHDPP) and 1,2-cyclohexane-dicarboxylic acid, dinonyl ester (DINCH) on cotton, glass and stainless steel (SS) surfaces were experimentally determined using two different methods. In the Micro-Chamber/Thermal Extractor (M-CTE), Kcotton values were close to 104 m. For this method, improvements were proposed to investigate the sorption on surfaces having lower sorption capacities such as glass or SS. In the sandwich-like emission cell, Kglass and KSS values ranged from 20 to 465 m, and from 99 to 1570 m, respectively. In coherence with the literature, sorption on cotton was higher than on SS and glass. Moreover, based on literature data, the SVOC vapor pressure (VP) could be a good predictor of KSurf for non-porous surfaces such as SS and glass. For porous surfaces (cotton), additional parameters related to the surface (porosity or composition) should be used with VP. Strong sorption capacity of cotton reinforces the health risk posed by contaminated clothes. This study highlights the need for further research to understand the key parameters of SVOC sorption on textiles."

 Inorganic ions are ubiquitous in aerosol microdroplets, especially in sea salt aerosols (SSAs). However, the molecular mechanisms by which inorganic ions regulate redox reactions in microdroplets remain unclear. We nebulized water microdroplets containing various inorganic salts to simulate SSAs and investigated the effects of different ions on the spontaneous oxidation of L-cysteine in microdroplets. By modulating the concentration, charge, and ionic radius of inorganic ions, we found that cations at certain concentrations enhanced the spontaneous oxidation of L-cysteine by influencing the electric double layer of microdroplets. The spontaneous oxidation of thiols was progressively enhanced with the increasing concentration of transition metals, which acted as electron acceptors. Anions with larger ionic radii formed free radicals and also promoted oxidation. Our results confirmed the critical role of inorganic ions in the spontaneous oxidation of thiols in aerosol microdroplets. Furthermore, the research provided new insights into the atmospheric transformation of sulfur-containing pollutants, which is of great importance for the global sulfur cycle and climate change."

 Surface ozone (O3) exhibits spatiotemporal variability in the New York City metropolitan area (NYCMA) under the influence of complex mesoscale flows which transport O3 and its precursors. Fine-scale ambient air quality monitoring is critical for estimating air pollution exposure and assessing whether mitigation strategies are sufficient to attain the National Ambient Air Quality Standards. To improve air quality monitoring in the NYCMA, 38 New York State Mesonet (NYSM) sites were outfitted with well-calibrated low-cost O3 sensors. This study applies the Satellite Enhanced Data Interpolation (SEDI) method to bias-correct 1-year of gridded output from the Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) through fusion with surface O3 observations from the NYSM low-cost sensor sites and instruments from the U.S. EPA's AirNow monitoring network. Prior to bias correction, WRF-Chem overestimated O3 concentrations at 11 NYCMA AirNow sites. Constraining WRF-Chem using the NYSM low-cost sensor sites alone reduced mean bias error by around 6 ppb at the AirNow sites. At NYSM sites, the gridded O3 dataset constrained by observations from NYSM and AirNow together resulted in a better-performing dataset compared to the dataset constrained using observations from AirNow alone. These results highlight the value added by low-cost sensors in filling observational gaps in existing regulatory monitoring networks. Additionally, the SEDI algorithm is a computationally inexpensive post-processing technique that effectively reduces error and bias and is enhanced by the increase in spatial resolution of air quality monitoring provided by integrating the NYSM low-cost sensor sites with the AirNow network."

 Previous studies rarely consider the regional disparity in precipitation variability beyond the overall consistency in Northeast China (NEC). This study examines the spatial distribution and variability of spring precipitation in NEC, a critical region for grain production that is prone to precipitation-related natural disasters. Our results indicate that approximately 26.7% of spring precipitation events in NEC demonstrate a dipole pattern—characterized by contrasting precipitation distributions within the region—that is significantly influenced by low-pressure systems. Our analysis reveals a strong connection between these precipitation patterns and the preceding winter's sea ice conditions in the Kara Sea. Reduced sea ice leads to a decrease in Ural Mountain snow cover, lower surface albedo, and an increase in upward heat flux, thereby warming the lower atmosphere. This process weakens the meridional temperature gradient, slows the westerly jet stream, and intensifies cyclogenesis over NEC. Moreover, persistent anomalies in sea ice and snow cover drive the eastward movement of Rossby waves, shaping the “− + −” Eurasian teleconnection pattern that intensifies regional low-pressure systems. Consequently, these circulation patterns result in increased precipitation in northern NEC and decreased precipitation in the south. Additionally, numerical experiments using the CAM6.0 and LBM model were conducted to investigate the atmospheric response to sea ice loss and the subsequent dynamical mechanisms affecting precipitation in NEC. Therefore, variations in Kara Sea ice and Eurasia snow cover serve as predictive indicators for NEC's spring precipitation pattern, thereby enhancing our understanding of NEC's precipitation dynamics and providing vital insights for predicting and managing regional natural disasters."

Conventional sensitivity-enhancement strategies rely on reactive surface modifications, which may risk long-term stability, whereas inefficient gas-solid interaction time limits detection sensitivity. Here, we find gas vortex effects in butterfly wings that can prolong molecular residence time and apply this bioinspired mechanism to gas sensor design to resolve this trade-off. We establish a universal design rule: Periodic microcavities with diameter-to-height ratios of 1 to 1.33 generate centralized vortices that prolong molecular residence time by 85% and optimize mass transfer efficiency, as validated through computational fluid dynamics, fluorescence tracking, and Sherwood number analysis. This geometric principle enables metal oxide (ZnO, In2O3, Co3O4, and WO3) sensors to achieve ultralow detection limits (0.8 to 30 parts per billion) while maintaining long-period stability. A four-channel microsensor array leveraging vortex-enhanced microstructures enables real-time profiling of human breath biomarkers.

Conventional paradigms generally describe the relationship between MLD and stratification for the subsurface layer or the upper ocean below 5 m, where a weak stratification is associated with a deeper MLD, and a strong stratification with a shallower MLD. In this study, satellite-based and in situ-based monthly data from 2011 to 2021 reveal a positive relationship between monthly-averaged near-surface stratification (above the bulk layer) and MLD. That is, on a monthly timescale, a weaker near-surface stratification co-occurs with a shallower MLD, and vice versa. This observed pattern deviates from the conventional expectation. Analysis shows that this phase synchronization is primarily driven by density variations in the bulk layer, which exceed those in the subskin layer. Further investigation using wind stress and buoyancy flux data indicates that MLD deepening aligns with enhanced stratification above the bulk layer. These findings refine the traditional understanding by emphasizing the distinct roles of vertical layers (subskin vs bulk). They underscore the necessity to incorporate layer-specific dynamics when using satellite-derived stratification to parameterize MLD dynamics in climate models. Such refinement is critical for optimizing predictions of ocean-atmosphere interactions and climate variability. Future work should leverage the fusion of satellite and in situ data to advance multi-layer ocean stability diagnostics."

However, air pollutant concentrations reductions are not observable, and the related environmental benefits provided by the train service might be underestimated. Our research quantifies the emission reductions attributable to regional rail services by exploiting a natural experiment. We leverage an unexpected accident in Florence that temporarily disrupted part of the Tuscan railway network. We find that affected areas experienced, on average, a 25% increase in NO₂ pollution compared to counterfactual areas where train services remained operational. This increase was most pronounced during peak commuting hours. These findings are consistent with the assumption of substitutability between public and private transport: when regional trains were unavailable, more people had to switch to private vehicles to commute, causing a rise in local pollution. Our study provides an indirect measure of the positive environmental impact of public transport."

Leveraging the recently homogenized daily Rs data at ∼2600 stations across China and Europe during 1961–2022, this study provided the first quantification of long-term variations in extremely low (Rs10p) and high (Rs90p) Rs and their contributions to Rs trends. During the dimming period, increasing Rs10p and decreasing Rs90p frequencies, along with increased magnitudes, jointly led to the dimming over China and Europe. Europe began to steadily brighten after 1980, due to early air pollution emission controls and reduced cloud cover, which reversed the frequency trends of Rs10p and Rs90p and intensified the severities of both extremes. In contrast, dimming in China persisted until 2014, only transitioning to brightening after the implementation of stricter emission controls which increased Rs90p frequencies but attenuated the severities of both extremes. Overall, Rs extremes jointly regulated Rs trends: China’s brightening was positively contributed by both extremes, while Europe’s brightening was dominated by Rs90p but partially offset by Rs10p. These findings underscore the pivotal role of extremes in shaping overall Rs trends and highlight their importance for accurately assessing regional solar energy availability under global climate change."

Here, we show that a colder winter tends to be followed by a hotter summer over Eurasia. This winter-summer extreme temperature reversal is linked to the phase switch of the Arctic oscillation (AO) from winter to summer, which is driven by the North Atlantic air–sea interaction and Arctic sea ice-atmosphere coupling. Specifically, a negative AO in winter weakens high-latitude westerlies, causing cold extremes over Eurasia. Negative AO also induces a tripolar sea surface temperature anomaly in the North Atlantic that persists into the following summer and triggers positive AO-like atmospheric anomalies, leading to a hotter summer across Eurasia. Moreover, winter atmospheric anomalies reduce the Barents–Kara sea ice through horizontal moisture transport. This sea ice loss persists into summer and contributes to the formation of positive AO-like atmospheric anomalies. These processes establish a cross-seasonal transition from extreme cold winters to extreme hot summers over Eurasia, offering new insight into the prediction of summer extreme events."

The sea-to-air transfer of DOC is driven by the synergy of biological and the interaction between DOC and bubble rupture. This synergistically-driven DOC flux affects aerosol properties and climate, highlighting the ocean–atmosphere link in organic carbon cycling. 
 The formation of sea spray aerosol (SSA) is linked to wave-breaking events at the sea surface and is widely recognized as an important pathway for the transfer of marine substances to the atmosphere. Although climate change and sea eutrophication have led to the expansion and intensification of coastal phytoplankton blooms, systematic studies on the sea-to-air transfer of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) via SSA during phytoplankton blooms are still lacking, which hinders the understanding of SSA's atmospheric chemistry and climate impacts. In this study, we induced a phytoplankton bloom using coastal seawater and employed various characterization tools to investigate the sea-to-air transfer of DOC. During the phytoplankton bloom, the dynamic accumulation of DOC in coastal seawater led to fluctuations in the number concentration and mean geometric diameter of SSA by approximately 60 % and 30 %, respectively; in the meantime, the enrichment factors of DOC in the sea surface microlayer, supermicron SSA, and submicron SSA can increase up to ∼5-fold, 10-fold, and 30-fold, respectively. The sea-to-air transfer of DOC depended on its selective enrichment as well as the fractionation process at the air-water interface. Interestingly, the particulate property of operationally defined DOC still needed to be considered during SSA formation. Additionally, the sea-to-air transfer of DOC was influenced by the synergistic effects of phytoplankton production and heterotrophic microbial processing, rather than being solely dependent on chlorophyll a concentration. Compared to previous studies, this work focuses on the sea-air interface, systematically and comprehensively elucidating the relationships between DOC's transfer mechanisms, biological activity, and SSA formation. This will further improve our understanding of the ocean-atmosphere carbon cycle and provide insights into its impact on global climate change."

Also, SST changes alter cloud-top properties via entrained airmass origin. Resolving ocean-atmosphere coupling in global models is essential for accurate cloud feedback projections. 
 Understanding how Gulf Stream variation influences cloud morphology is critical for evaluating cloud feedback in the western North Atlantic Ocean and beyond, where mesoscale air-sea interactions dominate. This study investigates the impact of altered mean sea surface temperature (SST) and SST gradients on post-frontal cloud characteristics during cold-air outbreaks, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Three sensitivity experiments are conducted: a control simulation (default SST), Plus4 (uniform SST increase of 4 K), and Gradplus (SST gradient enhanced by 25 %, centered around mean SST). Results reveal distinctly different responses in boundary layer dynamics and cloud macro-physics. In Plus4, a warmer and moister boundary layer reduces total cloud cover but promotes larger cloud sizes and elongated cloud streets, with diminished liquid water and enhanced ice-phase hydrometeors. Conversely, Gradplus amplifies impacts in the upwind colder SST regions, yielding a drier, colder boundary layer, weaker energy transport, and higher liquid water path but reduced ice water content and cloud lines. Tracer analysis highlights that SST modifications alter airmass sources near cloud tops due to the entrainment of ambient air, with Plus4 amplifying boundary layer contributions to cloud-top regions. These findings underscore the spatially varying effects of SST gradients and mean SST on cloud organization and microphysics, emphasizing the need to resolve ocean-atmosphere coupling in global models to improve the prediction of marine cloud feedback under warming scenarios."

The results highlight the importance of near-real-time aerosol inputs for improving prediction of aircraft icing environments. 
 Aerosol-cloud interactions profoundly influence the formation and evolution of supercooled liquid water, a key factor in in-flight icing. However, accurately quantifying aerosol emission inventories and their spatiotemporal distributions, as well as simulating supercooled liquid water and predicting in-flight icing, remains a major challenge, particularly in high-aerosol environments such as the Sichuan Basin in China. In this study, the Thompson–Eidhammer aerosol-aware microphysics scheme is applied to a high-aerosol icing event to quantitatively assess the sensitivity of supercooled liquid water properties to different aerosol inputs. Three aerosol configurations are examined: the scheme's default settings representing clean conditions; climatological aerosol values representing polluted conditions; and aerosol fields from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS), representing near-real-time polluted conditions. The CAMS aerosol mass concentrations are converted to number concentrations using typical densities and size parameters of major East Asian aerosol species. All simulations reproduce the synoptic-scale supercooled liquid water and temperature distribution when compared with ERA5. Relative to clean conditions, polluted-environment simulations produce higher supercooled liquid water content, larger cloud droplet number concentrations, smaller median volume diameters, and longer cloud lifetimes. The experiments also reveal that stronger auto-conversion in clean conditions suppresses supercooled liquid water formation, whereas enhanced riming in polluted environments promotes supercooled liquid water depletion. In situ aircraft observations further indicate that the CAMS-driven experiment performs best in capturing the high supercooled liquid water content and large median volume diameters. These findings underscore the importance of near-real-time aerosol inputs for improving simulations of aerosol-cloud interactions and predicting aircraft-icing environments."

It identifies the largest sources of uncertainty in our current understanding and demonstrates the use of observations for formally constraining models and providing information on uncertainty at a process level. 
 The major physical and chemical processes governing the abundance of atmospheric oxidants such as ozone and hydroxyl radicals (OH) are largely understood, but quantitative assessment of their importance in different environments remains challenging. Atmospheric chemistry transport models allow exploration of these processes on a global scale, but weaknesses in process representation in these models introduces uncertainty, and model intercomparisons show considerable diversity even in representing current atmospheric composition. Formal constraint of models with atmospheric observations is needed to provide more critical insight into the causes of model weaknesses. In this study we perform a global sensitivity analysis on a chemistry transport model using Gaussian process emulation and identify the processes contributing most to uncertainty in tropospheric ozone and OH. We then explore the use of atmospheric measurements to calibrate the model and identify weaknesses in process representation and understanding. We find that the largest uncertainties are associated with photochemical kinetic data and with factors governing photolysis rates and surface deposition. Calibration constrains the uncertainty in key processes, improving comparisons with observations and informing model development, but we show that it is also valuable in identifying structural errors in models. We show that surface ozone measurements alone provide insufficient constraint, and we highlight the importance of applying a broad range of different observational metrics. While this study is exploratory in nature, focussing on a limited number of constraints, we clearly demonstrate the value of rigorous calibration for providing important new insight into key processes and their representation in atmospheric models."

Through laboratory experiments, it was found that sulfuric acid dominates the growth of smaller particles, while organics play an increasingly important role as particle size increases. Elevated humidity also significantly enhances the contribution of organics. These findings further our understanding of new particle formation and subsequent growth. 
 Organic compounds play an important role in atmospheric particle initial growth along with sulfuric acid (SA). However, the detailed composition of newly formed particles remains limited due to analytical challenges. In this study, we conducted flow tube experiments to investigate the nanoparticle growth processes of SA and oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs, from α-pinene oxidation) system. Utilizing a custom-built scanning flow condensation particle counter (SFCPC), we report, for the first time, size-resolved measurements of the hygroscopicity parameter (κ) and organic mass fraction (forg) for particles in the 3–10 nm size range within this atmospherically relevant system. The hygroscopicity of SA decreased 49 % as particle size increased (from 0.413±0.011 at 3 nm to 0.209±0.004 at 10 nm) and declined by up to 18 % with increasing RH, which may be explained by hydration effects. In contrast, the κ values of OOMs increased with RH by as much as 57 %, potentially involving changes in oxidation product. Size-resolved forg revealed that larger particles contained a greater proportion of organics, indicating OOMs contribute more significantly to growth at larger sizes. Moreover, elevated humidity enhanced the organic contribution to particle growth by up to 81 %. Compared to 3–5 nm, this enhancement was more pronounced for 5–10 nm particles associated with the incorporation of increased yields of more volatile oxidation products and Kelvin effect. These valuable information on hygroscopicity and chemical composition of 3–10 nm particles during new particle formation and subsequent growth could further the understanding of related atmospheric mechanisms."

The findings highlight that controlling coastal emissions within ~ 260 km is crucial for mitigating marginal sea pollution. 
 Aerosols originating from marginal seas significantly contribute to regional and global air pollution burdens and climate regulation. However, the responses of marine aerosols to terrestrial transport remain uncertain. In this work, we investigated chemical composition and properties of aerosols over Bohai Sea (BS) and Yellow Sea (YS). Our observation results indicate that in the BS and YS regions in summer, the proportion of terrestrial boundary layer air masses is lower than that of marine boundary layer air masses. But the terrestrial characteristics of aerosols in these two regions are still apparent. The characteristics of carbon component ratios (mean: 5.58–12.11 for OC/EC, 0.48–0.58 for WSOC/OC) in aerosols are similar to those in coastal cities, and the proportion of non-sea salt ions (>80 %) is significantly higher than that of sea salt ions. Humic–like substances (HULIS) and water–insoluble organic compounds (WISOC) mainly contain anthropogenic components (oxygenated aromatic compounds, nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds, anthropogenic surfactants, fossil fuel-derived SOA). The δ13CTC characteristics and positive matrix factorization model (PMF) reveal that biomass burning contributes 60 %–80 % to carbonaceous species and marine primary emissions contribute 20 % to aerosols. According to the height of air mass trajectories and the half-life (15–20 h) of light-absorbing components, we determined the coastal region within 190–260 km of the coastline and the coastal waters as key regions controlling the composition of BS and YS aerosols. Our results emphasize that during summer when the influence of marine air masses increases, the terrestrial characteristics of BS and YS aerosols remain evident, being related to air mass transport from coastal terrestrial regions."

This technique more clearly reveals wave patterns than older methods and gives more accurate energy estimates, especially high up near the stratopause. Our approach helps scientists understand how these waves behave and interact across different scales, improving knowledge of atmospheric dynamics. 
 Extracting gravity wave (GW) perturbations from atmospheric observations relies on background removal techniques whose results may differ depending on the observational type and the spectral characteristics of the chosen method. This variability complicates the intercomparison of GW properties across instruments, sites, and studies. Nighttime averaging provides a simple estimate of the background but may smooth out smaller-scale structures. Spectral filtering enables targeted wavelength extraction, though it can be sensitive to noise and edge effects. Sliding polynomial fit offers flexibility but may suppress relevant signals depending on the polynomial degree. To address this issue, we implement and evaluate a processing method based on multiresolution analysis (MRA), designed to better extract and characterize the background and the multi-scale structures of GWs in lidar temperature and wind profiles. The MRA approach is then evaluated in comparison to these techniques and applied to lidar temperature and wind measurements collected on the night of 20 November 2023 at La Réunion. By decomposing the signal into dyadic vertical wavelength bands and an appropriate choice of corresponding details, the MRA can improve the detection of GW-induced perturbations in the spectral range of 0.8 to 12.8 km vertical wavelength by simultaneous background removal and denoising. We use the variance method as a benchmark for determining gravity waves potential energy (GWPE) and ask the question: “How well do the different filtering techniques compare with the variance method?” Given an overall agreement between our developped MRA and the variance method, we conclude that the MRA can also be used to determine reliable gravity wave kinetic energy (GWKE).Beyond energy estimation, MRA provides a unique capability to compute kinetic and potential energy profiles for tunable vertical wavelength bands, enabling the characterization of vertical and temporal evolution and interactions between different GW scales. These results establish MRA as a robust and complementary tool for improving GW analyses from lidar measurements, with promising applications to long-term climatologies and multi-instrument observational strategies."

Bhartia,Solar Backscatter Ultraviolet (BUV) retrievals of mid-stratospheric aerosols from the 2022 Hunga Eruption,"The submarine eruption of the Hunga volcano released water vapor and sulfur dioxide directly into the stratosphere. The sulfur dioxide formed sulfuric acid aerosols leading to increased scattering of solar ultraviolet radiation (UV), interfering with satellite ozone retrievals. We present a new satellite technique for deriving the amount and height of Hunga aerosols from UV measurements, revealing an unusually low sulfuric acid concentration due to the water-rich conditions in the fresh plume. 
 On 15 January 2022, a highly explosive eruption of the submarine Hunga volcano (Kingdom of Tonga) generated the largest stratospheric hydration event ever observed and the largest aerosol perturbation since the 1991 Pinatubo eruption. Here, we develop a novel method for satellite retrieval of stratospheric aerosol optical depth (AOD) and layer peak height (zp) using solar backscattered ultraviolet (BUV) radiation; this is made possible by the exceptional mid-stratospheric altitude of the Hunga aerosols. We analyze BUV observations of the Hunga stratospheric aerosol cloud on 17 January 2022 (47 h after the eruption), using BUV band 1 measurements from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) on board the ESA/Copernicus Sentinel-5 precursor (S5P) satellite, and the Ozone Mapping and Profiling Suite- Nadir Profiler (OMPS-NP) on board the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA)-20 satellite. We retrieve AOD and zp by fitting hyperspectral BUV radiance ratios in a narrow spectral window restricted to 289–296 nm, chosen in order to reduce interference from tropospheric clouds while highly sensitive to stratospheric aerosols located above ozone peak altitude. The retrieval employs radiative transfer calculations from the Vector Linearized Discrete Ordinate Radiative Transfer (VLIDORT) forward model. We assume a single Hunga aerosol layer composed of polydisperse sulfuric acid spherical particles embedded in a Rayleigh atmosphere with a known ozone profile. The ozone profile is supplied from a version of the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, version 2 (MERRA-2) Stratospheric Composition Reanalysis of the Microwave Limb Sounder (MLS) on board NASA Earth Observing System-chemistry (EOS Aura) satellite – produced by NASA's Global Modeling and Assimilation Office using a stratospheric chemistry model and MERRA-2 meteorology. We also include a sulfur dioxide SO2 layer, which coincides spatially with the retrieved aerosol vertical profile, and with the total loading normalized to the stratospheric SO2 vertical column density from the operational TROPOMI SO2 product. We validate our AOD retrievals against ground-based AErosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) direct-sun AOD measurements, and zp retrievals against Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) overpasses using Lagrangian trajectory modeling. We estimate the total Hunga stratospheric wet aerosol mass (sulfuric acid solution droplets, including water uptake) to be Maer∼0.5±0.05 Tg. This value is consistent with our previous BUV estimates of Hunga SO2 emissions (∼ 0.4–0.5 Tg SO2) and rapid conversion of SO2 to sulfate aerosol. Based on these BUV retrievals we can also estimate the sulfuric acid (H2SO4) mass fraction w∼0.4 and H2SO4/H2O solution density: ρ∼1.34 g cm−3. These new values represent an extreme departure from the stratospheric background sulfate aerosol (Junge layer), which is typified by values of w∼0.75 and ρ∼1.7 g cm−3 supported by decades of observations of the lower stratosphere during both quiescent and volcanically impacted periods. The new low values, inferred from BUV observations and backed up by microphysical modeling, are a result of the uniquely water-rich conditions in the early Hunga plume. Relative humidity in the plume, as modeled by the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry-Climate Model with the Community Aerosol and Radiation Model for Atmospheres (CARMA), reached values as high as 60 %, compared to background values closer to 1 %. These findings are unique in the long-term observational record of the stratosphere; similar relative humidities only otherwise occur in overshooting clouds or cold winter hemisphere vortices."

The laser-based system precisely measures water molecules in air, enabling accurate predictions of contrail formation to help reduce aviation's climate impact. 
 We present a state-of-the-art humidity probe for in situ airborne water vapor measurements tailored to the humidity range relevant for the formation of persistent aviation contrail cirrus clouds. Our probe is based on tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy (TILDAS). We scan a laser in wavelength across an isolated water (H2O) absorption line at 7205.246 cm−1 (1.39 µm) to obtain the H2O volume mixing ratio in sample air at 1 Hz in real time. Our optical design features a combination of single-mode optical fibers and a short-path absorption cell with integrated focusing optics and detector to avoid any absorption path outside of the sample volume. A parallel fiber path and detector capture the laser power profile during the wavelength scan for spectral-baseline normalization. We have built and tested two prototypes and tested them side-by-side in the laboratory against a humidity standard as well as against each other. Without any calibration, we found agreement against the humidity standard of better than 98 % for the relevant H2O range below 200 ppm. The agreement between both instruments when operated in series measuring the same sample air was 99.7 %. The stability of both instruments was quantified to be ±1 % (1σ) during a 5 d long period where both prototypes operated without any temperature control. We show that our probes can measure H2O with linear response over 4 orders of magnitude."

In response to this challenge, our new 2003–2023 dataset integrates top-down and bottom-up methods with multi-source data. This provides a plausible emissions range to quantify uncertainty, revealing that the greatest uncertainty is not in traditional hotspots but in regions with infrequent, extreme fires. This work offers vital data for more robust climate models. 
 Large discrepancies among existing inventories hinder a consensus on the true magnitude and long-term trends of global biomass burning emissions. To address this, we developed the Multi-ensemble Biomass-burning Emissions Inventory (MBEI), a framework integrating bottom-up and top-down approaches with multi-source data to generate eight sub-inventories for the period 2003–2023. This ensemble approach allows for the explicit quantification of emission uncertainty at a 0.1° grid scale. We estimate global annual CO2 emissions at 7304 (4400–9657) Tg, with the maximum estimate exceeding the minimum by over two-fold. The uncertainty exhibits significant spatial heterogeneity: it is highest in low-emission regions like Australia and the Middle East (6.0–7.0 fold difference), whereas traditional hotspots like Africa show lower divergence (Approximately 2 fold). Temporally, a distinct decadal shift was identified: global emissions declined from 2003 to 2013 due to reduced tropical burning, but reversed to an increasing trend from 2013 to 2023, driven by intensified fires in northern high-latitudes and extreme events. Comparisons confirm that the MBEI mean provides a robust central estimate, while its max-min range effectively encompasses other major inventories. By providing explicit uncertainty bounds, MBEI enhances the reliability of atmospheric modeling and climate assessments. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18104830 (Liu and Yin, 2025)."

Our product depicts earlier and later planting dates for certain crops, increased use of cover crops, increased synthetic fertilizer and manure Nitrogen application, and shifts towards reduced tillage intensities over time. The data set can inform agricultural studies regarding greenhouse gas emissions, environmental impacts, and food production. 
 Agricultural land management practices affect environmental variables including greenhouse gas emissions, carbon and nitrogen cycles, soil profiles, water quality, and air pollution. To better understand agricultural land management practices, we compiled a land management history for the conterminous United States (CONUS) from 1980–2023. We used the National Resources Inventory as the basis for our sample-based approach to impute planting and harvest dates, synthetic N fertilizer and manure N and C application rates and timing, tillage systems and intensity, and cover crop adoption. We aggregated the imputations to a 0.25-degree grid and compiled a comprehensive dataset detailing the management practices used on agricultural lands across CONUS. From 1980–2023, we found trends towards later planting dates for cotton and spring grains and trends towards earlier planting dates for soybeans. Synthetic N fertilizer rates increased steadily from 1980–2000 and then stabilized from 2000–2023, while manure N amendments were low between 1980 and 2000 and then increased rapidly from 2000–2023. Generally, there were increases in no-till and reduced-till systems across CONUS, with more notable increases in central and eastern regions. Cover crop adoption increased across CONUS from 1980–2023, with the highest level of adoption occurring in the Northeast. The results from this product align with previously published histories, although our work provides a more comprehensive representation of cropland management practices than previous works. Our dataset is available on Dryad under public domain license (Hoskovec et al., 2025) and can be used to inform studies of agricultural lands that evaluate processes such as greenhouse gas emissions, environmental impacts, and food production."

However, ground observations in China are often incomplete and short. We created the first seamless half-hourly dataset covering China from 2000 to 2024 by carefully filling data gaps and extending observations in time. The dataset closely matches measurements and provides a reliable foundation for climate, water, and environmental research. 
 Latent heat flux (LE) provides a direct representation of terrestrial evapotranspiration (ET) and plays a critical role in hydrological cycle studies, land surface model development, and the evaluation of remotely sensed evapotranspiration products. Although flux observations based on the eddy covariance technique are widely regarded as essential benchmark data for evapotranspiration estimation, existing ChinaFlux observations are generally limited by short observation periods and extensive data gaps, which substantially constrain their applicability in long-term change analyses and multi-scale studies. To address these limitations, we developed a gap-filling and temporal prolongation framework specifically designed for half-hourly LE and established a continuous ground-based benchmark dataset covering China for the period 2000–2024 based on observations from 50 ChinaFlux sites. The framework is built upon an automated machine learning approach (AutoML-H2O) and integrates ERA5-Land reanalysis data with MODIS vegetation indices, enabling accurate gap-filling within observation periods and reliable prolongation beyond observation intervals. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that the AutoML framework achieves high accuracy at the half-hourly scale across different gap-length scenarios, with an overall correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.862 and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 33.75 W m-2, and it substantially outperforms conventional methods under long-gap conditions of 7 d and 30 d. The forward and backward prolongation results show high consistency (CC values of 0.902 and 0.896, respectively) and exhibit robust temporal stability under varying training data lengths. Multi-timescale validations further indicate that the prolonged LE data reasonably reproduce diurnal variations, seasonal cycles, and interannual variability from half-hourly to daily and monthly scales. Comparisons with ChinaFlux observations under strict quality control reveal good consistency across different temporal scales, underlying surface types, and climate zones. SHAP-based interpretability analysis indicates that energy supply consistently dominates LE variability, while vegetation state and water availability modulate their relative importance under different environmental conditions. Overall, we present the first continuous half-hourly ground-based LE benchmark dataset covering China for the period 2000–2024. This dataset provides essential data support for the evaluation of remotely sensed ET products, land surface model validation, and studies of regional water–energy cycles and climate change, and it is freely available via the following repository: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18194590 (Qian et al., 2026)."

Our results show that the step heating approach is fast and accurate, comparable to other more complex methods. This method can potentially be applied in different areas of interest where wall surface temperatures are important, e.g. modeling of outdoor thermal comfort, building energy and urban energy balance. 
 The urban climate is highly influenced by its building geometry, material characteristics, street orientation and high fraction of impermeable surfaces. All of these influence the microclimate and the resulting outdoor thermal comfort. Mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) is often used as an estimator for heat exposure as it is one of the most important variables governing outdoor human thermal comfort on clear, calm and warm days. The highest values of Tmrt are commonly found in front of sunlit facades where a human is exposed to high levels of direct and reflected shortwave radiation from the sun, as well as high levels of longwave radiation emitted from surrounding sunlit walls. As a consequence, outdoor thermal comfort modelling requires accurate simulation of wall surface temperatures (Ts).The aim of this study is to present a step heating approach for calculating wall Ts in the SOlar and LongWave Environmental Irradiance Geometry model (SOLWEIG) and quantify how it influences Tmrt. This method requires information on material characteristics, i.e. specific heat capacity, density, thermal conductivity, albedo and thickness of the outer layer of the wall, as well as radiation balance at the wall surface, and ambient air temperature. Simulated Ts is compared to observed Ts of two white walls (albedo = 0.5) in Gothenburg, Sweden; one wooden wall and one plaster brick wall. The simulations show high agreement with the 15 394 observations, with R2=0.93 and RMSE = 2.09 °C for the wooden wall and R2=0.94 and RMSE = 1.94 °C for the plaster brick wall. For the walls presented here, this new parameterization scheme results in differences in Tmrt of up to 2.5 °C compared to the previous version of SOLWEIG.With this new approach, SOLWEIG can be used to evaluate the effect of building materials on outdoor thermal comfort. The speed and accuracy of this approach suggests that it also could be applied in other areas where Ts of walls are important, for example building energy models and urban energy balance models."

Evans;Andréa S. Taschetto;Chiara Holgate,Refining the Lagrangian approach for moisture source identification through sensitivity testing of assumptions using BTrIMS1.1,"Lagrangian approaches have been increasingly employed due to their suitability for extreme events and climatological studies in finding moisture sources of precipitation. However, as these approaches track independent air parcels carrying moisture – rather than simulate processes based on governing physical equations – they rely on several underlying assumptions. This study tests these assumptions and refines the approaches to enhance their broader applicability. 
 Moisture is the fundamental basis for precipitation, and understanding the sources of moisture is crucial for comprehending changes in precipitation patterns. Lagrangian models have been employed for moisture tracking in both extreme weather events and climatological studies as a means to gain insight into driving physical processes. Lagrangian moisture tracking models follow independent air parcels based on a set of defined assumptions. Despite the existence of many Lagrangian models and studies applying them for moisture tracking, these assumptions are seldom thoroughly tested.In this study, we use the Lagrangian model BTrIMS to demonstrate the impact of these assumptions on the results of moisture source identification. In particular, we test the method's dependence on the number of parcels released; the height that parcels are released; the vertical movement of air parcels; the vertical well-mixed assumption that lead to different moisture identification methods along trajectories, the within-grid interpolation method and the back-trajectory time step. We find that releasing approximately 200 air parcels per day from each grid point, is necessary to obtain accurate results for a region of 10 grid points or more (an area of ∼ 9000 km2 in this case). The distribution among different time steps in a day is determined based on precipitation rates. Additionally, the vertical movement of air parcels, their release height, and along-trajectory identification method of moisture substantially affect the identified moisture sources, whereas within-grid interpolation and back-trajectory time step within a reasonable range have a relatively minor role on the results. The theoretical basis of these assumptions involve precipitation formation height, vertical mixing of surface evapotranspiration, and numerical noise, all of which must be carefully considered for realistic results.Based on the results of sensitivity tests and analysis of underlying mechanisms behind the assumptions, we improve the Lagrangian model BTrIMS1.0 to a new version (BTrIMS1.1) for broader applicability. The findings of this study provide critical information for improving Lagrangian moisture source identification methods in general and will benefit future research in this field, including studies examining changes in moisture sources due to climate change."

Dirmeyer;Sunlae Tak,Implementation of a multi-layer snow scheme in the GloSea6 seasonal forecast system: impacts on land–atmosphere interactions and climatological biases,"This study examines a multi-layer snow scheme in seasonal forecasts. Compared to a single-layer scheme, it better captures snow insulation, delaying spring snowmelt by 1–2 weeks. This postpones evaporation and slows soil moisture depletion, which promotes evaporative cooling due to increasing energy partitioning into latent heat flux and enhances precipitation occurrence. This leads to realistic land-atmosphere interactions and reduced biases across Northern Hemisphere mid- and high-latitudes. 
 This study explores the influence of implementing a multi-layer snow scheme on the climatological bias within a seasonal forecast system. Traditional single layer snow schemes in land surface models, particularly those utilising a composite snow-soil layer, often inadequately represent the insulating effect of snowpack, resulting in cold and warm biases during winter and snowmelt seasons, respectively. By contrast, multi-layer snow schemes improve the simulation of energy exchange between the land surface and atmosphere by realistically capturing snowpack thermal processes. To examine this impact, two sets of LSM offline experiments are conducted, using either a single-layer or a multi-layer snow scheme. Results show that the multi-layer configuration better reproduces the observed Northern Hemisphere snow seasonality. To further assess the role of snow insulation in coupled forecast systems, two sets of experiments with the Global Seasonal Forecast System (GloSea) version 6 are compared over 24 years (1993–2016) corresponding to the incorporation of single- (G6single) and multi-layer (G6multi) snowpack schemes. In G6multi, the onset of snowmelt is delayed by approximately 1–2 weeks, postponing springtime evaporation, slowing soil moisture depletion, and improving the memory of soil moisture. Increased soil moisture enhances the partitioning of available energy into latent heat flux, thereby promoting evaporative cooling and suppressing excessive water-limited land–atmosphere coupling. The improved model fidelity of land-atmosphere interactions, particularly over mid-latitude regions, mitigate near-surface warming biases across the entire diurnal period and reduce the sensitivity of atmospheric conditions to land surface variability. The model performance in simulating precipitation is also improved with the increase in precipitation occurrence over snow-covered regions. Above all, this study demonstrates the value of implementing a multi-layer snowpack scheme in seasonal forecast models, not only during the snowmelt season but also for the subsequent summer season, for model fidelity in simulating temperature and precipitation along with the reality of land-atmosphere interactions."

These shifts led to notable adjustments in the strength of their mutual interactions, resulting in substantial alterations in their combined impact on the East Asian Summer Monsoon (EASM). Using the RegCM-Chem-YIBs regional climate-chemistry-ecosystem model, we analyzed the effects of PM2.5, O3, and CO2 interactions on the EASM climate from 2008 to 2018. Our findings indicate that these interactions reduced surface downward shortwave radiation flux by 20–30 W/m2 across East Asia from 2008 to 2012, lowering near-surface temperatures by 0.5–1 K and weakening the EASM. Conversely, surface downward shortwave and longwave radiation fluxes from 2014 to 2018, increased by 2–4 W/m2 and 2–8 W/m2, respectively, in northern and southeastern China, raising near-surface temperatures by 0.5–1 K, and intensifying the EASM. This study highlights the importance of thorough consideration for the interactions among PM2.5, O3, and CO2 in regional climate projections, particularly over East Asia, where atmospheric pollutant concentrations fluctuate significantly, to precisely elucidate their combined impact on the summer monsoon system."

It has been suggested that photochemical processes taking place on mineral particles could reduce large fractions of Fe(III) to Fe(II), which is a more bioavailable form of Fe. Moreover, soluble Fe(III) is also bioavailable. Here, we carried out atmospheric observations and laboratory simulations to show that dust aging processes influenced Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox cycling and enhanced the Fe solubility during long-range transport. Our results show one contrast phenomenon: increasing Fe solubility accompanied by more soluble Fe(III) enrichment in aged dust aerosols. The increasing NOX-to-SO2 ratios and thus the increasing availability of HNO3 enhance soluble Fe(III)-to-Fe(II) ratios. The dissolution experiment of Fe-containing dust demonstrated that high nitrate concentrations suppressed soluble Fe(II) formation at low pH. This enrichment is likely due to a surface-mediated redox mechanism involving nitric acid and Fe(II) when dust plumes are mixed with urban air pollutants. This mechanism is potentially the major mechanism for enhancing Fe solubility in aged dust aerosols and should be included by modeling to better understand the effect of Fe(II)/Fe(III) redox cycling on ocean biological productivity and atmospheric oxidation capacity."

However, the mechanisms by which these pressures undermine ecological stability remain poorly understood. Here, we combined environmental DNA (eDNA) metabarcoding across six trophic groups with a meta-food-web framework to assess multitrophic biodiversity and food-web structure in two Chinese river basins representing contrasting degradation regimes, which together span a gradient of anthropogenic impacts commonly observed in river systems worldwide. Our results revealed pervasive biotic homogenization in the high-stress basin across all trophic levels, along with a structurally simplified food-web characterized by increased modularity but markedly reduced nestedness and stability. Stress responses were stage-dependent: in the lower-stress basin, diversity and network properties tracked gradients of land-use intensity and water pollutants, whereas in the high-stress basin, further increases in stress produced muted structural changes, consistent with a saturation-like degraded state. Food-web destabilization was primarily driven by indirect effects of environmental stress mediated through changes in biodiversity and network topology. Specifically, diversity loss was the dominant cause of reduced stability, while increased predator niche overlap was linked to the erosion of network complexity, particularly through declines in species richness and nestedness. These findings demonstrate that environmental stressors destabilize riverine ecosystems by degrading both the multitrophic biodiversity and the integrity of ecological interactions. Conservation strategies must therefore move beyond species-centric approaches to protect multitrophic networks and support freshwater ecosystem resilience under accelerating global change."

This study characterizes the photoinactivation of two enveloped viruses (Phi6 and influenza A virus, IAV), and a nonenveloped virus (MS2) in clear and colored surface waters using simulated sunlight. We measured light-screening corrected decay rate constants (k^) using infectivity assays. k^ values were greater, especially for IAV, in colored surface water versus clear water. k^ values were generally greatest for IAV, followed by Phi6, then MS2, suggesting greater susceptibility of enveloped viruses to sunlight. Most k^ values for IAV and Phi6 did not differ with UV irradiance variations in colored surface water, indicating dominance of indirect, photochemically produced reactive intermediate–mediated inactivation pathways. Additional experiments with Phi6 as a representative enveloped virus suggest the importance of hydroxyl radicals, indicate adsorption of NOM promotes photoinactivation, and sublethal damage of the virus may occur. For IAV, modeled time for 99% inactivation in a well-mixed 1 m deep wetland water column is 1.2 h, compared to 1.8 h in clear water. These findings, particularly those for IAV, can inform human and animal health protection strategies."

Here, we identified an unprecedented O3 reduction at a high rate of 2.79 ± 0.08 ppbv yr–1 during 2018–2023, contrasting with the long-term rise in the level of O3 at the same site. We found that this change was unlikely to be caused by COVID-19 lockdowns. Carbon monoxide and some volatile organic compounds (e.g., formaldehyde and toluene) also decreased. Significant O3 reductions occurred in the summer and autumn, with summer showing a higher percentage decline (9.51% yr–1). An ensemble machine learning model was developed to eliminate meteorological impacts on the O3 trends, which was shown to explain 24.5% of the year-round O3 reduction rate. The Weather Research and Forecasting model, coupled with Community Multiscale Air Quality, quantified the meteorological contribution of 54.0% to significant O3 reduction in August 2018 to 2023. While the model well reproduced O3 in August 2018, it overestimated the level of O3 in August 2023 when using emissions derived from simple extrapolation. Nevertheless, the remaining half of the O3 reduction rate in August was likely attributed to changes in anthropogenic emissions on land. This study also highlights the need for timely updates to emission inventories for effective air quality policy evaluations."

However, the dynamics and uncertainty in vertical coupling are not fully resolved. By applying the linear inverse model (LIM) to daily, multi‐level NAM indices from reanalysis and CMIP6 models, we show that the leading eigenmode of NAM displays a deep structure extending from the stratosphere to the surface, with an e‐folding timescale of about 30 days in reanalysis data. This stratospheric mode captures the downward propagation of NAM anomalies during weak polar vortex events, further supported by the LIM simulations forced by white noise. Analysis of inter‐model spread suggests that the LIM‐based estimates can reduce the uncertainty in the surface response to stratospheric extreme events by more than 50%. These findings provide dynamic insights into stratosphere‐troposphere coupling of NAM and its representations in climate models."

Relatively dry conditions occurred in westerlies‐dominated regions and extended to marginal monsoon regions before ∼6,000 a BP, followed by wetting transitions during ∼6,000–5,000 a BP, despite contrasting temperature variations between two regions.

We find that when interactive melt increases, it primarily accelerates the evolution of a spatial pattern of continental shelf warming and cooling that is initiated by freshening and sea‐ice formation decline due to projected atmospheric warming. The competition between enhanced warming at depth from reduced ventilation and enhanced continental shelf cooling from reduced dense water export leads to net ∼ ${\sim} $35% reduction in ice‐shelf meltwater input into the Southern Ocean over the 21st century.

Here we quantify the Na‐re relationship by using in situ aircraft measurements, together with a re decomposition method. Our analysis reveals that the cloud‐planetary boundary layer (PBL) coupling plays a pivotal role on the Na‐re relationship. Quantitative re decomposition indicates that the contrasting Na‐re relationships in two cloud‐PBL coupling regimes result from different balances of four distinct aspects.

We estimate ∼95% of the lower glacial oxygen occurred in the deep EEP.

Yet, accurately predicting AR impacts on precipitation remains a challenge. This study investigates the influence of dropsonde data from AR Reconnaissance (AR Recon) on improving weather forecasts in winter 2022, specifically AR‐related precipitation forecasts for the U.S. West Coast. Using operational Global Forecast System version 16 (GFSv16) simulations with and without assimilated dropsonde observations, we evaluated the impact of dropsondes on forecasting key meteorological fields like geopotential height, horizontal wind and water vapor transport, and precipitation. The results demonstrate that assimilating dropsonde data can improve the forecast accuracy of landfalling AR characteristics and associated precipitation, although mixed results were obtained in water vapor transport forecasts. Forecast improvement was achieved for medium to strong AR events, especially when dropsondes targeted the AR cores, showing a large error reduction in integrated vapor transport (approximately 20 kg m−1 s−1) and precipitation (by >5 mm d−1 or ∼20%–40%) for strong AR conditions. The analysis indicates that the effectiveness of dropsonde data is influenced by AR characteristics, such as intensity and track, as well as the complex terrain of the U.S. West Coast. These findings highlight the value of targeted field campaigns in improving AR precipitation forecasts and underscore the need for continued research to address remaining uncertainties, ultimately enhancing water resource management and extreme weather preparedness on the West Coast."

Quantification is challenged by the diversity of emitted species and by their complex dependence on fire characteristics, with scarce field observations available for model evaluation. Remote sensing in the thermal infrared (IR) is a powerful tool for detecting fire VOCs: many compounds exhibit distinct signatures at these wavelengths, and measurements are unaffected by fine aerosols prevalent in smoke. Here, we develop the first thermal IR VOC measurements from an aircraft‐based platform, using radiance observations from the Scanning High‐resolution Interferometer Sounder (S‐HIS) deployed aboard the NASA ER‐2 during the 2019 FIREX‐AQ campaign. We focus on methanol and ethene, and employ a neural network retrieval adapted from Cross‐track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) algorithms. The S‐HIS retrievals achieved high precision (R2 = 0.95–0.99) and accuracy (median absolute bias <5.5 × 1015 molec./cm2) versus the full training data set. However, at low‐to‐moderate concentrations, retrieval performance is degraded by instrument noise. When considering scenes below the median methanol signal encountered during FIREX‐AQ, 30‐fold aggregation is needed to achieve R2 = 0.8, and no amount of aggregation yields the performance that would be achievable for a single pixel with the 10× lower noise of CrIS. The S‐HIS VOC observations exhibit clear enhancements over and downwind of fires that align with those seen by CrIS.

 Earth’s energy uptake—defined as the global mean net incoming radiation at the top of the atmosphere—surged in 2022–2023, contributing to record global surface temperatures and widespread climate extremes in 2023–2024. Yet, the causes of this extreme energy uptake remain unclear, reflecting limited knowledge of how internal climate variability shapes Earth’s energy imbalance. Here we investigate the drivers of the observed extreme energy uptake by using multi-model climate simulations and satellite-based observations. We show that the transition from the multi-year La Niña to El Niño was key to Earth’s extreme energy uptake in 2022–2023, upon the externally forced positive imbalance. Our sampling analyses from the multi-model simulation dataset highlight the dominant influence of the La Niña-to-El Niño sequence on enhanced energy uptake, with crucial importance of multi-year persistence in preceding La Niña. When combined with estimates of the externally forced component derived under Shared Socio-economic Pathway scenarios, the contribution associated with the La Niña-to-El Niño transition explains about 75% of the observed extreme energy uptake. Our finding underscores the role of internal climate variability in shaping Earth’s energy budget and its potential amplification under a warming climate.

 Two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals materials with strong in-plane anisotropy are emerging as fertile platforms for nanophotonics beyond conventional isotropic noble metals and dielectrics. Here, we demonstrate hyperbolic localized plasmon resonances (H-LPRs) in MoOCl2, a representative anisotropic 2D crystal. Unlike conventional plasmons, H-LPRs arise directly from the crystal anisotropy and show unprecedented properties: (i) one-dimensional resonances in circularly symmetric nanodisks, (ii) Z-gap independence in metal–insulator–metal heterostructures, and (iii) twist-induced chirality with circular dichroism values exceeding 0.65. The H-LPRs are characterized by both far-field spectra and near-field imaging. By stacking twisted MoOCl2 flakes, we bridge H-LPRs with concepts of moiré photonics and twistronics, introducing a new degree of freedom in plasmonic design. These findings establish H-LPRs in anisotropic 2D materials as a generalizable and versatile platform for polarization engineering, ultrasensitive chiral sensing, and integration into compact on-chip and quantum nanophotonic devices.

A study now finds that future hydrogen production could overlap with resource and infrastructure constraints, with consequences for the success of a sustainable transition. 
 As European countries transition to fuels with lower climate change impact, distinct challenges may arise. Electrolytic hydrogen is central to planned developments in transportation and industry, but large-scale hydrogen production could have energy and environmental consequences. Here we simulate site-specific hydrogen demand distribution for Europe in 2050, to assess possible effects on local water use risks, regional electricity generation composition and cost, and total land use. Results show that around 20% of annual water use for hydrogen production is simulated to happen in areas with ‘extremely high’ projected risk of water stress, and local water stress caused by hydrogen production could become severe. Widespread electrolytic hydrogen use requires large investments in electricity generation, but the impacts on the marginal electricity cost to consumers could be small. The electricity generation system required for producing hydrogen or e-fuels would require less land than cultivating biomass for biofuels. The findings highlight the need for coordinated policy action to ensure that hydrogen deployment aligns with local water availability, regional electricity system development, land constraints and broader sustainability goals. Europe’s shift to low-carbon fuels raises concerns about water, land and energy pressures from large-scale hydrogen use.

This perspective reduces the quiet influence of methodological choices on jets’ long-term evolution. 
 Accurately locating jet streams is key to understanding climate variability and regional weather patterns. However, the conventional Eulerian view of jets as fast winds overlooks their continuous meandering, favoring spurious streaks to the detriment of weaker but persistent features that shape large-scale transport. Here we make the case for a Lagrangian view of jets as maxima of isentropic displacement. We introduce a new identification scheme, called JetLag, whose two parameters are set by theory. JetLag recovers familiar features of the historical record (1941-2024) without ad hoc parameter tuning. Remarkably, the resulting estimates of jet latitude and variability are robust to parameter choice, supporting a unified view of jets across latitudes and climates.  Jet streams are more than strong winds: they are persistent, meandering wind patterns. This perspective reduces the quiet influence of methodological choices on jets’ long-term evolution."

 Methane mole fractions have been continuously measured since 2018 at Plateau Rosa, a background station in the north-western Italian Alps at 3480 m a.m.s.l., showing a persistent increase in methane over time. Here, we use the methane record to validate the high-resolution transport model FLEXPART coupled with the output of the numerical weather prediction model COSMO for complex alpine terrain and to identify European source regions affecting measurements at the stations. Comparison between simulated methane mole fraction contributions and observed increments indicate that summer advection of methane-rich air masses was not fully captured by the model, and most pollution events were underestimated in magnitude. The Po Valley, just below the Alps and with major urban and industrial activities, is the region affecting most pollution events, mainly from agriculture, while contributions from fuel exploitation increased when air originated from Germany, Poland, Czechia, the Netherlands, and the UK.

 The Gulf Stream is important for the climate system through its transport and air-sea exchange of heat. What is less well accepted is the role of the Gulf Stream in the carbon cycle. Here we examine how the Gulf Stream provides a “biogeochemical stream”, a sub-surface horizontal flux carrying waters with high concentrations of nutrients and low concentrations of anthropogenic carbon. Model experiments reveal particles released in dense layers at the start of the Gulf Stream follow trajectories extending into the subpolar gyre, while particles released at the surface are confined to the subtropics. Following a pathway to the subpolar gyre, the biogeochemical stream carries older, nutrient-rich and anthropogenically carbon-depleted waters along density layers and, when those dense layers outcrop into the mixed layer, enhances the subpolar drawdown of atmospheric carbon. This connectivity is supported by model sensitivity experiments revealing the subpolar upper ocean carbon content and upstream dense waters in the Gulf Stream connecting on timescales of 4 to 8 years. The likely effect of climate change on the biogeochemical stream is a decrease in the delivery of these older waters, both high in concentrations of nutrients and depleted in anthropogenic carbon, to the subpolar mixed layer, so weakening future North Atlantic carbon uptake from the atmosphere. The Gulf Stream provides a sub-surface horizontal flux carrying high concentrations of nutrients and low concentrations of anthropogenic carbon affecting the subpolar North Atlantic carbon, according to data analyses, model and adjoint simulations."

 World Meteorological Organization baselines used to identify climate extremes are routinely updated to reflect recent climate conditions. Yet the implications of these updates for the characterization, trends, and detectability of climate extremes remain poorly understood, particularly in data-sparse and highly vulnerable regions such as Africa. Here, we quantify how updating the reference period from 1981–2010 to 1991–2020 systematically alters the characterization of temperature and precipitation extremes across the continent. Using multiple observational and reanalysis datasets (BEST, ERA5, MERRA-2, CHIRPS), we assess the sensitivity of percentile-based thresholds, long-term trends, and the Time of Emergence (ToE) to changes in the reference period. ToE is employed here as a diagnostic of detectability rather than a definitive marker of anthropogenic signal onset. Our results show that the updated baseline leads to higher temperature thresholds, resulting in a reduced frequency and slower trends for warm extremes (TX90p, TN90p), and a concurrent increase in cold extremes (TX10p, TN10p). Precipitation extremes exhibit more heterogeneous and dataset-dependent responses: trends in extreme precipitation totals (R95pTOT, R99pTOT) generally weaken, whereas intensity-based metrics (R95pINT, R99pINT) often strengthen, particularly in MERRA-2. Moreover, the choice of baseline strongly influences the estimated ToE. Warm extremes emerge 2–8 years later under the newer baseline, while cold extremes emerge earlier (by up to 15 years) due to enhanced signal-to-noise ratios. For precipitation, ToE responses vary widely across datasets and regions. In CHIRPS, the ToE of intense rainfall events is delayed, whereas in MERRA-2 it advances by over 2 decades in some regions. These results indicate that ToE estimates derived from recent decades are highly sensitive to baseline selection. By explicitly isolating the effect of baseline choice, this study provides a critical framework for interpreting extremes, reconciling dataset discrepancies, and improving the robustness of climate monitoring and risk communication across Africa."

In this Review, we discuss the scale-dependent mechanisms through which forests regulate climate, highlighting their contributions to global mitigation and local adaptation. Locally, forests tend to buffer temperatures, cooling in warm conditions and warming in cold ones. In regions that naturally support dense forest cover, trees contribute to global cooling primarily through carbon uptake, with some offsetting from albedo-related warming. By enhancing rainfall interception, evapotranspiration, and cloud formation, forests also influence the hydrological cycle, lowering flood risks in humid regions but often reducing downstream water availability, especially in drier climates. Collectively, these interacting processes show that the greatest climate benefits occur where forests are native, highlighting their importance for both climate adaptation and mitigation."

We use a large set of climate model simulations and find that uncertainty drops in some regions, but persists in other areas, after comparing models to observations. By identifying the specific processes that cause the remaining uncertainty, we guide future efforts to reduce the aerosol forcing uncertainty so we can make more reliable climate predictions. 
 Aerosol radiative forcing remains a major source of climate model uncertainty, limiting climate model projection skill and slowing global action on addressing climate risks. Observations only modestly constrain the magnitude of aerosol radiative forcing despite advances in model fidelity, resolution and availability of observations. Our goals are to understand where aerosol-cloud forcing uncertainty resists efforts to reduce (or constrain) it and to identify the processes that cause the remaining uncertainty, to guide future observation campaigns and model constraint efforts. We map the aerosol forcing uncertainty in a global climate model perturbed parameter ensemble before and after constraint to satellite observations of several cloud, aerosol and radiative properties. Original uncertainty falls by more than 80 % in Northern Hemisphere marine regions and by 70 % for globally averaged aerosol forcing. However, the uncertainty remains large (more than 70 % of the original uncertainty) in Southern Hemisphere marine environments where stratocumulus clouds transition to cumulus, as well as in some highly populated industrialized areas. Regional clusters of shared causes of model uncertainty highlight common processes as targets for future observational constraint. Our findings highlight the value in re-evaluating the remaining causes of ΔFaci uncertainty during the constraint process and provide actionable information for prioritizing existing observations that should be included as constraints. Additionally, our results highlight targeted observations in persistent uncertainty hotspots where novel and process-specific data could further constrain aerosol forcing. This work provides a framework for model evaluation and development that prioritises aerosol forcing constraint to improve model skill at making climate projections."

The results show that particles remain liquid near the Earth’s surface but become semi-solid or glassy at higher altitudes. These viscosity changes influence chemical reactions such as nitrogen oxide uptake, improving understanding of air quality and climate processes. 
 Organic aerosol (OA) viscosity and phase state govern multiphase diffusion and reactivity, yet systematic constraints across tropospheric temperature (T)–relative humidity (RH) space remain limited. We measured the viscosity of sucrose-H2O droplets (OA surrogate) over 273–303 K and ∼ 20 %–90 % RH using bead-mobility and poke-and-flow methods, with viscosity spanning ∼ 8 orders of magnitude across the investigated RH range at each temperature. A Vogel–Fulcher–Tammann fit with experimentally derived fragility (Df= 13 ± 1) extended the parameterization by ∼ 43 K beyond the measurement range, to 230–310 K and 0 %–100 % RH, with substantial uncertainty at low temperatures. When coupled with zonal-mean tropospheric T–RH fields (2020–2024), the parameterization was used to infer global distributions of viscosity and organic-phase mixing time (τmix,org) for 200 nm particles, suggesting predominantly liquid states below ∼ 2 km, semisolid regimes across ∼ 2–9 km (latitude dependent), and near-glassy conditions at higher altitudes; with τmix,org typically being < 1 h in the boundary layer but often exceeding 1 h aloft. The resulting global fields highlight the potential atmospheric implications of temperature- and RH-sensitive viscosity across the troposphere. Calculations indicated the N2O5 uptake coefficient was generally ≥ 10−2 for liquid particles in the boundary layer, decreased by ∼ 1–2 orders above ∼ 2–4 km as bulk diffusion became rate-limiting; with surface hydrolysis, N2O5 uptake coefficient leveled near ∼ 10−3.5 aloft, and without it can drop to 10−5–10−6 at viscosity 109 Pa s. These results provide evidence for the need for T- and RH-sensitive viscosity in next-generation air-quality and climate models."

Evaluations show that MLAWind achieves comparable performance to the widely-used reanalysis datasets at different time scales. It provides reliable historical wind data during both satellite and non-satellite periods, demonstrating broad application prospects in ocean and climate research. 
 A gridded sea surface wind dataset with long temporal coverage is crucial for understanding atmospheric circulation changes and air-sea interactions at different time scales. This study employs an interpretable machine learning model based on random forest algorithm to generate a 1°×1° monthly sea surface wind dataset (MLAWind) from 1950 to 2023, covering the near-global ocean within 60° S–60° N. The data reconstruction model integrates the Cross-Calibrated Multi-Platform (CCMP) satellite data and the spatially sparse long-term International Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS), exhibiting robust interpretability and generalization capability. Evaluations demonstrate that the MLAWind dataset exhibits better agreement with remote sensing observations than existing reanalysis datasets during the training period (1993–2022), while maintaining robust performance during the independent testing period in 2023. Moreover, the performance of MLAWind since 1950 is assessed across multiple time scales. Its characteristics in climatology, annual cycle, and inter-annual variability are comparable to those of existing reanalysis datasets, even during the non-satellite period prior to 1993. Uncertainties remain in the long-term trends of different datasets. The trend derived from MLAWind is corroborated by independent coral records during 1950–1982, which demonstrates its strong capability in reconstructing historical sea surface wind variations. The results indicate that MLAWind serves as a reliable data resource for global climate change research. The reconstructed MLAWind dataset is publicly accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17354864 (Guo et al., 2025b)."

We did this to overcome gaps and coarse resolution in existing satellite data by combining many data sources with advanced artificial intelligence. The results reveal both long-term growth and short-lived increases following events such as wildfires. This dataset supports better tracking of emissions and understanding of climate change. 
 Accurate and temporally continuous global observations of atmospheric carbon dioxide (XCO2) are essential for climate monitoring and emission assessment. However, satellite-based XCO2 observations are often spatially incomplete and temporally discontinuous, while existing products typically suffer from coarse spatial resolutions, hindering the detection of fine-scale emission changes. Here, we developed a novel spatiotemporal Transformer-BiLSTM deep-learning network, which integrates the local temporal feature extraction capability of bidirectional long short-term memory with the global spatial dependency modeling strength of Transformer via self-attention mechanisms. The network assimilates multisource data, from satellite observations, meteorological reanalysis, and precursor gases, to reconstruct global, daily, and seamless XCO2 at 0.1° resolution from 2003 to 2022. Validation against independent Total Carbon Column Observing Network (TCCON) measurements shows excellent agreement, with a correlation coefficient (R2) value of 0.99, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 1.10 ppm, and a mean bias of 0.01 ppm. A subsequent bias correction scheme further improves cross-satellite consistency, achieving a cross-validation coefficient of determination (CV-R2) of 0.99 and an RMSE of 0.97 ppm. Our dataset enables accurate characterization of daily XCO2 concentrations over global land surfaces, facilitating the detection of spatial heterogeneity associated with emission hotspots and point-source activities. The record reveals a persistent global increase in atmospheric XCO2 over the past two decades, with a mean growth rate of 2.24 ppm/yr (p < 0.001). It reliably resolves global XCO2 variability across a wide range of temporal scales, from day-to-day fluctuations to long-term trends. It consistently captures large-scale climate-driven signals, such as ENSO-related interannual variability, and short-lived XCO2 enhancements associated with major wildfire events, demonstrating its capability to represent both persistent and episodic emission signals. This high-resolution, daily global XCO2 product (GlobalHighXCO2) provides a valuable benchmark for carbon cycle studies, atmospheric model evaluation, and emission monitoring, and is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18220961 (Qu and Wei, 2026)."

Sensitivity experiments with the LMDz model assess how uncertainties in emissions, isotopic signatures, OH sinks, and kinetic isotope effects influence atmospheric δ13C-CH4 and CH4, providing guidance for isotopic inversions. 
 The isotopic composition of atmospheric methane (δ13C-CH4) provides critical constraints for attributing methane emissions to specific sources. In this study, we present updated global maps of δ13C-CH4 source signatures across five major methane-emitting sectors (fossil fuels and geological, agriculture and waste, biomass and biofuel burning, wetlands, and other natural sources) for the period 1998–2022. These maps integrate recent spatially explicit datasets and literature-derived observations, and include explicit quantification of both intrinsic (within-sector) and aggregation-related uncertainties. Building upon previous global compilations, our dataset extends the temporal coverage to 2022, harmonizes sectoral definitions with the Global Methane Budget framework, and provides a consistent and traceable quantification of uncertainties suitable for atmospheric inversions. We assess the influence of these updated source signatures on the modeled atmospheric δ13C-CH4 using forward simulations within the Community Inversion Framework (CIF) coupled to the LMDz transport model. A comprehensive sensitivity analysis quantifies the impacts of key drivers of uncertainty, including emission flux datasets, OH sinks, kinetic isotope effects, and isotopic source signatures. We show that uncertainties in methane oxidation chemistry and source signatures, particularly from agriculture and waste, dominate the variability in the modeled δ13C-CH4 signal, while the impact of flux aggregation choices is comparatively minor. The updated isotopic dataset is provided on a global 1° × 1° grid, supporting future atmospheric inversions and improved methane budget assessments at global and regional scales. Practical guidelines for configuring isotopic inversions, including recommended uncertainty specifications and key parameters to optimize, are also provided, offering a framework for next-generation δ13C-CH4 inversion studies. The final version of the gridded δ13C-CH4 source signature dataset is available at the ESA Open Science Data portal: https://opensciencedata.esa.int/products/d13c-ch4-signatures-smart-ch4/collection."

The dataset is produced using a fully independent data-processing framework and is based on measurements from at least two satellites operating at the same time each month. Comparisons with existing global datasets and coastal measurements show close agreement in long-term sea level rise, while also revealing differences in regions with strong ocean variability. 
 Long-term and spatially consistent sea-level anomaly (SLA) products derived from satellite altimetry are fundamental for sea-level and climate change studies. In this study, we develop the PolyU2025 SLA (The Hong Kong Polytechnic University 2025 sea level anomaly), a new global monthly gridded SLA product generated using a fully independent data-processing framework. This product is provided on a regular 0.25° × 0.25° grid and spans the period from January 1993 to December 2024 and is intended to be updated regularly. The PolyU2025 SLA is evaluated through systematic intercomparisons with the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) gridded SLA product as well as with independent tide-gauge observations. The results demonstrate a high level of consistency between PolyU2025 and C3S at global and basin scales, characterized by near-zero differences in global-mean SLA and statistically indistinguishable estimates of global mean sea level trends and accelerations, confirming that both products are suitable for climate-scale applications. At regional and short time scales, differences between the two products become more pronounced, particularly in dynamically active regions, and are mainly associated with differences in the representation of short-term and mesoscale variability. These differences reflect methodological trade-offs in data processing and spatial mapping rather than systematic biases. Overall, the PolyU2025 SLA provides a stable and consistent characterization of sea-level change from regional to global scales and serves as a complementary dataset to existing gridded SLA products, especially for long-term and climate-oriented sea-level studies and multi-product assessments of regional sea-level variability and uncertainty.

We systematically integrate latest aerial campaign measurement into natural gas life cycle GHG emission estimates, capturing methane fugitives with better characterization of superemitter events. More than ten public and commercial data sets are integrated with an engineering-based unit process life cycle assessment (LCA) model. The estimated total GHG emissions from the US gas sector are 719 MMT CO2eq, more than twice the estimates of the US Environmental Protection Agency.

In urban areas, the complex emission patterns of VOCs─driven by diverse anthropogenic activities─present major challenges for accurate source characterization and quantification. In this study, we conducted eddy covariance flux measurements of VOC in a Chinese megacity to elucidate strengths and origins of VOC in urban region. The results revealed pronounced temporal and compositional differences between VOC fluxes and concentrations. By linking compositional differences between VOC fluxes (fresh emissions) and concentrations (chemically processed air), we provide direct evidence of the critical role of the chemical evolution in shaping atmospheric compositions of VOCs in urban air. We demonstrate the advantages of using flux data in source apportionment for emissions by comparing positive matrix factorization (PMF) analyses based on flux and concentration data sets. Flux-based source apportionment revealed that urban VOC tracers, such as toluene, are primarily associated with volatile chemical product (VCP) rather than traffic. The temperature-driven dynamics of biogenic and anthropogenic (average: 53% vs 47%) contributions to the total monoterpene fluxes are quantified, highlighting the shifting importance of anthropogenic and biogenic sources in urban environments. These findings underscore the value of integrating flux and concentration data sets to enhance understanding of urban VOC sources and their atmospheric evolution."

Yet, the mechanisms governing their biodegradation, especially the role of redox transitions in mediating biotransformation, remain insufficiently understood. Here, we integrate metagenomic profiling with chemical analytics in a 10 m simulated riverbank filtration system to demonstrate how sequential oxidizing–reducing degradation enhances organic micropollutant transformation. Oxygen stratification structured distinct microbial and enzymatic pathways: oxidizing zones (>+200 mV redox potential) facilitated cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation (oxidizing condition, OXD), while subsequent redox shifts to reducing conditions (←400 mV, sequential oxidizing–reducing (SOR) conditions) activated reductive transformations (e.g., via nitronate monooxygenase and aldehyde dehydrogenase) and conjugation pathways. These SOR conditions significantly enhanced the removal of recalcitrant compounds, including irbesartan (+25.3%), benzotriazole (13.4%), and gabapentin (+9.7%). Metagenomic analysis revealed redox-driven microbial specialization, with Pseudomonadota and Nitrospirota dominating in oxidizing zones and reducing microzones enriched in pathways associated with nitrotoluene and ethylbenzene degradation, providing genomic evidence for sequential organic micropollutant breakdown. These findings establish a mechanistic framework for harnessing oxidizing–reducing microbial partnerships to amplify organic micropollutant removal in nature-based water treatment systems, which can be used for riverbank filtration site selection and well field construction and optimization."

In this study, we developed a predictive model to estimate the aqueous-phase reaction rate constants between NO3 and organic compounds (kNO3) using a novel machine learning (ML)-based approach. By simultaneously considering the chemical properties of the reactants and experimental conditions, this model enables an accurate prediction of kNO3 across ionic strength (I) ranges of 0–6 M, while also accounting for the influence of different ionic species.

Here, 119 textile products from Chinese online vendors were analyzed for traditional and emerging QACs using target and suspect screening approaches with high-resolution mass spectrometry. The total concentrations of 18 traditional QACs ranged from 7.34 to 145,000 ng/g, and 16 emerging QACs were identified with total concentrations at 5.45 to 349,000 ng/g. Under laboratory-controlled conditions, over 76% of the selected textiles exhibited QAC migration rates exceeding 50% after washing. In simulated laundry experiments, hand-washing released a ΣQAC concentration of 42.1 ng/mL, and machine-washing released 22.4 ng/mL, with differences attributed to the water volume used by different methods. Both laundry wastewater and QACs solution at equivalent concentrations caused dose-dependent immobilization of Daphnia magna. Combining bioassay-based risk characterization factors with environmental dilution factors across 150 countries, 7% of regions showed high risk after WWTP-treatment, increasing to 41% for direct discharge with sewage. The high migration rates suggest that QAC-treated textiles not only fail to maintain long-term antimicrobial efficacy but also contribute to continuous low-level environmental exposures, raising concerns about their essential use in nondisposable textile materials."

Most aerosol sampling methods are believed to contribute to virus inactivation, but the magnitude of this sampling artifact is unknown. To investigate this question, we aerosolized influenza A virus (IAV) and SARS-CoV-2 suspended in human saliva into a small chamber (3.7 L). Aerosols settled for 10 min onto either cells or a thin layer of liquid medium that was immediately transferred to cells for plaque assay. Aerosols that deposited directly onto cells led to the formation of 100× more plaque forming units (PFU) compared to aerosols that deposited first into liquid medium. Further experiments ruled out uneven aerosol distribution in the chamber or inefficient virus recovery as causes of this discrepancy. These findings indicate that aerosolized IAV and SARS-CoV-2 lost infectivity by approximately 2 log10 PFU within ∼10 min unless they attached to cells quickly. As natural infection via inhalation occurs by direct deposition of the virus onto cells, we hypothesize that sampling directly onto cells more accurately reflects the potential for exposure to lead to infection."

During the Georgia Wildland-Fire Simulation Experiment, we measured the hygroscopicity (κ) and size-resolved cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activity of BB particles from controlled burns of fuel beds representative of three ecoregions in Georgia, United States. Primary BB particles were predominantly organic, and photooxidation in an oxidation flow reactor produced secondary organic aerosol (SOA) in a new nucleation mode while transforming primary organic aerosol (POA) into oxidized POA (OPOA) in the pre-existing accumulation mode. We measured hygroscopic growth from 20% to 90% relative humidity using a quartz crystal microbalance and assessed size-resolved CCN activity for particles from 30 to 350 nm at supersaturation between 0.13% and 0.99%. We found that the hygroscopicity parameter of OPOA (κOPOA = 0.10–0.19) was higher than that of POA (0.04–0.10), reflecting the influence of heterogeneous oxidation, whereas the hygroscopicity parameter of SOA (κSOA = 0.07–0.14) fell between the two. Both fresh and aged BB particles displayed size-dependent κ values and evidence of external mixing, likely because of complex emission characteristics of fuel beds and size-dependent deposition processes. Growth factor-derived and CCN-derived κ values were consistent when accounting for such heterogeneity. A strong positive correlation was found between the mass-averaged κ and O/C ratio, described by the regression κ = 0.31 ± 0.02(O/C) – 0.05 ± 0.02, which broadly agrees with previous findings for a wide range of laboratory SOA and ambient oxidized organic aerosols. This suggests the potential applicability of a generalized hygroscopicity parameterization across organic aerosols within acceptable uncertainty. Our results highlight the role of BB particles as significant CCN sources during atmospheric aging and emphasize the importance of heterogeneous oxidation in physicochemical evolution of BB particles."

However, their application is often limited by the requirement for complete continuous exposure data. Simpler lag-specific models with a single exposure can use more data but suffer from an omitted variable bias (OVB). This study develops and validates a three-stage method to accurately estimate distributed lag effects from noncontinuous exposure data by correcting for OVB. We propose a three-stage approach, fitting a series of lag-specific models using the noncontinuous data to obtain biased estimates in the first stage, correcting the bias by the autocorrelation structure of the exposure time series in the second stage, and smoothing the calibrated estimates in the third stage. The method’s validity was confirmed by statistical simulations. We then applied it to a case study analyzing the association between PM2.5, its chemical constituents, and daily all-cause mortality in Beijing from 2013 to 2015. Simulations showed that our three-stage method robustly and accurately recovered the true lag-response functions and cumulative effects, even when only one valid daily record is available for each week’s data. In the Beijing case study, the traditional DLM failed to find significant associations due to a substantially restricted sample size, due to the missingness. In contrast, our method, by utilizing nearly 90% more observations, found significant health effects. For every 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5, the cumulative effect (lag 0–13 days) on all-cause mortality was a 0.37% increase (95% CI: 0.23, 0.50%). Significant associations were also found for the PM2.5 constituents. The proposed three-stage method is an effective and robust statistical tool for overcoming challenges posed by noncontinuous exposure data in time-series analysis. By correcting for omitted variable bias, it maximizes the use of available sparse data and significantly enhances statistical power, offering a practical and reliable solution for environmental epidemiology facing similar data limitations."

We input this reconstructed charge configuration to a 3D quasi‐electrostatic model in order to simulate regions of possible sprite inception as a function of time corresponding to this sprite event following the lightning. We demonstrate how the observed delayed sprite could have been incepted by a prolonged piecewise pattern of the current in the parent flash."

While previous studies have established the linear growth and primary nonlinear development of striations, the formation of secondary structures remains not fully understood. Using two‐dimensional numerical simulations, we show that smaller branch structures evolve asymmetrically on the sides of striations when either the background electric field or the wave vector has a component along the density gradient. Our results indicate that in the linear stage, the electric field in the direction of density gradient modifies the effective growth rate by altering the wave vector orientation. In the nonlinear stage, electric field and wave vector direction coupling govern the emergence of branch structure, with electric field dominating when its effect opposes that of the wave vector.

However, how anthropogenic warming affects this variability remains uncertain due to limited satellite records and model resolution constraints. Based on an eddy‐resolving historical‐and‐future transient climate simulation, we find that the KE decadal variability weakens significantly under a high‐emissions scenario. This weakening likely results from a disruption of the coupled ocean‐atmosphere delayed oscillation, which involves basin‐scale atmospheric circulation both forcing and responding to KE variations. Specifically, warming‐induced strengthening of atmospheric stratification likely suppresses the thermodynamic adjustment, including the deep‐reaching updraft and associated mid‐to‐upper tropospheric responses, typically triggered by oceanic mesoscale warming during the KE stable state. Such suppression disrupts the coupled ocean‐atmosphere delayed oscillation, contributing to the weakened KE decadal variability. Our findings imply that the KE system might be less predictable under future warming."

Globally, about 10% of low and 19% of high phytoplankton biomass extremes are detected. The detection rate is the result of the combined impacts of missing data and extreme misalignment: only 34% of low and 56% of high detected chlorophyll extremes correspond with true biomass extremes, with the largest discrepancies occurring in the subtropical gyres. These findings highlight the need for caution when interpreting satellite chlorophyll as a proxy for phytoplankton biomass extremes."

However, the extent to which such extratropical SST forcing can influence large‐scale atmospheric circulation and surrounding SST remains uncertain, particularly given strong atmospheric internal variability. Here, we investigate the atmospheric response to idealized positive SST anomalies in the KE region using large‐ensemble atmospheric general circulation model experiments. The imposed forcing generates a robust sea‐level pressure anomaly over and downstream of the KE, leading to surface westerly wind anomalies extending into the subtropical North Pacific. Despite substantial atmospheric internal variability over the Aleutian Low region, these subtropical wind anomalies consistently emerge across the ensemble. Our results suggest that SST forcing in the KE region can modulate air–sea interactions not only locally but also across a broader region extending equatorward."

Using observing system simulation experiments with Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐2 (OCO‐2) sampling, we show that seasonally dependent sampling can lead to overestimated annual fluxes. These biases arise when prior flux seasonal cycle differs from the assumed truth. Since OCO‐2 provides more observations during the non‐growing season, posterior fluxes are more constrained in that period. When prior fluxes underestimate the seasonal amplitude, the posterior carbon sink during the growing season is underestimated, leading to a net positive bias. This effect is supported by real OCO‐2 data, where we hypothesize that underestimating fire emissions during non‐growing season and weaker seasonality of prior fluxes may contribute to overestimated annual fluxes. Our results highlight the need to improve prior flux estimates and expand observational coverage during the growing season to reduce biases in regional carbon budget assessments over NTA."

Using a newly developed instrument that measures ultraviolet emissions from coronae, the first direct observations and quantifications of coronae are presented for two trees under a thunderstorm in North Carolina. Coronae moved sporadically among leaves on every tree branch in a narrow field of view while the thunderstorm was directly overhead. Coronae emitted ∼1011 photons at 260 nm, corresponding to electrical currents of ∼1 μA, derived from unique measurements relating corona intensity to tree electrical current.

Four configurations are examined: the traditional approach that uses separate deep (ZM) and shallow (UW) convection schemes (CAM_ZMUW), unified shallow‐deep convection (CAM_UNICON), unified cloud‐turbulence (CAM_CLUBB), and super‐parameterization (CAM_SP). While precipitation is relatively insensitive to parameterization choice, diabatic heating fields differ markedly, which shape temperature, moisture and MRG wave characteristics. All simulations capture the general eastward tilt of MRG waves, but with varying fidelity. CAM_ZMUW and CAM_UNICON produce overly strong convection, while CAM_CLUBB underestimates low‐level early‐phase moistening. Only CAM_CLUBB and CAM_SP reproduce the successive vertical subgrid‐scale transport of moist static energy convergence, though the transport is weaker in CAM_CLUBB, whereas mass‐flux‐based schemes lack coherent vertical organization. Experiments combining Cloud Layers Unified by Binormals (CLUBB) with ZM deep convection behave similarly to CAM_ZMUW, indicating strong sensitivity to deep‐convection scheme. Applying stricter convective triggering in ZM convection alleviates the lower‐tropospheric dry bias but does not lead to an improved simulation of the convectively coupled MRG wave. The stochastic Subgrid Importance Latin Hypercube Sampler, a Monte Carlo technique designed to integrate over subgrid variability and improve estimates of its effects on microphysical process rates, has a relatively minor impact on MRG modeling in CLUBB. These results underscore the need to improve the representation of shallow‐to‐deep convective transitions in mass‐flux schemes and to enhance the vertical subgrid‐scale transport within the CLUBB framework."

Furthermore, high‐q convergence lines are more frequent during relatively wet monsoon years and during the active phases of the monsoon. Over India, high‐q convergence lines near the Tibetan Plateau shift southward during both wet years and active monsoon phases. Similarly, in Australia, the convergence lines shift southward from the Maritime Continent to continental Australia. In contrast, in the West African monsoon region, convergence lines are drier than in the Indian and Australian monsoon regions, with the frequency of the high‐q convergence lines increasing little in wet years or active monsoon phases.

Palisades Fire and Eaton fires, the two largest fires that caused most of that damage, were observed by the infrared sounder CrIS and microwave sounder ATMS aboard a polar‐orbit satellite of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that is, NOAA‐20. The high spatial resolution Single Field‐of‐view Sounder Atmospheric Products (SiFSAP) retrieved from CrIS and ATMS measurement have been used to illustrate the emission and transport of the plume generated by the wildfires. The CO total column and UV aerosol index (UVAI) observed by TROPOMI, CO total column observed by AIRS, the aerosol optical thickness (AOT) provided by VIIRS, and wind provided by ERA5 were used to illustrate plume produced by wildfires. Furthermore, cloud optical depths and top pressures retrieved by SiFSAP and VIIRS were compared to assess the IR sounder's capability to retrieve clouds. Results indicated that the SiFSAP data products effectively capture not only large scale dry airmass transport but also the movement of wildfire‐generated plumes containing high CO concentrations. The study shows that the SiFSAP CO retrieved from IR measurements is less affected by aerosols as compared to solar measurements like TROPOMI.

However, this expansion rate has yet to be compared systematically between hemispheres and across basins. This work quantifies the poleward expansion of PI globally and compares it across basins using ERA5 reanalysis and an ensemble of CMIP6 historical and future climate scenarios. We quantify trends in the latitude of PI thresholds associated with TC intensity and directly decompose PI trends into thermodynamic drivers using a novel PI budget equation that distinguishes Clausius‐Clapeyron response to warming from other effects. Our results show that PI consistently expands strongly poleward near Western Boundary Currents (WBCs) in the Western North Pacific, North Atlantic, South Indian, and South Pacific. It expands slowly near EBCs in the Eastern North Pacific and South Indian basins. Basins with WBC outflow exhibit enhanced coastal PI trends linked to SST warming, outflow cooling, and poleward ocean heat transport. Southern Hemisphere basins display weaker expansion, except near strong WBCs. CMIP6 models capture this east‐west asymmetry in PI trends across basins, but underestimate the magnitude of poleward expansion rates due to misrepresenting changes in outflow temperature and near‐surface air temperature and humidity. Our analysis suggests that ocean circulation plays a critical role in shaping regional PI trends and future increases in TC risk at higher latitudes will be unevenly distributed and may depend locally on the orientation of the coastline relative to oceanic boundary currents."

However, attributing such compound extremes remains challenging due to the lack of integrated frameworks that capture both physical causality and probabilistic assessment. Here, we introduce a storyline‐probability combined attribution framework to quantify individual contributions of atmospheric circulation, La Niña, and anthropogenic warming to this unprecedented 2022 SCHFE. Reanalysis and simulations show that La Niña generated large‐scale circulation patterns conducive to the SCHFE, amplifying the event's severity even when circulation anomalies were weaker than 2022. The SCHFE‐associated atmospheric circulation dynamics accounted for 49.21% (38.64%–59.41%) of the SCHFE's intensity and increased its likelihood by a factor of 4.5 compared with unrelated circulation. Anthropogenic warming contributed 42.31% (34.32%–49.85%) of the intensity throughout the thermodynamic effects, comparable to the circulation‐induced dynamic contribution, while also enhancing the occurrence probability of both La Niña and SCHFE. Projections further indicate that La Niña events will substantially elevate the probability of SCHFEs under continued warming. These findings underscore the need to incorporate atmospheric circulation, La Niña, and anthropogenic warming into early warning systems for such compound extremes."

We use observations of radiocarbon (Δ14C) in atmospheric CO2 from Southern Ocean shipboard transects to develop latitudinal gradients of Δ14C in the surface atmosphere. We present eight years of austral summer observations (2016–2023) from ships of opportunity traveling between New Zealand and Antarctica, along with time series measurements from Baring Head New Zealand, Macquarie Island Australia and Arrival Heights Antarctica. We observe lower Δ14C in the 50°S to 70°S latitude band, consistent with upwelling of 14C‐depleted deep waters in this region. We then combine ocean model simulations of CO2 and 14C with atmospheric dispersion model simulations to predict surface atmosphere Δ14C and compare with the observations. Our model simulations capture the large scale observed spatial patterns with considerable accuracy. However, the model simulation somewhat underestimates the magnitude of the observed atmospheric Δ14C gradient, particularly between 50°S and 60°S. When we artificially increase the strength of the strongest winds over the Southern Ocean in the ocean model, we find an improved match with the Δ14C observations, demonstrating that Δ14C observations with dense spatial resolution across the Southern Ocean can be useful for testing ocean model and CO2 exchange parameters."

Using subseasonal re‐forecasts from the NCAR‐CESM2 model, we demonstrate that significant skill persists even when interannual variability is removed. The highest skill occurs during austral summer and spring. To isolate sources of predictability, we analyze a novel set of re‐forecast experiments initialized with climatological atmosphere, land and ocean states. Results indicate that atmospheric initial conditions are essential for achieving skill, while ocean initializations contribute to skill containing interannual variability and land initializations contribute minimally to skill. Canonical correlation analysis is used to identify the most skillful spatial patterns and associated time series during the high‐skill seasons. The most skillful patterns in December–February are not independent of the South American dipole but also contain additional skill beyond the dipole. This additional skill is not associated with propagating tropical convection or sea surface temperature anomalies indicating that the Madden–Julian Oscillation, El Niño–Southern Oscillation, or South Atlantic SST variability are not the sources of predictability. Instead, a wave‐train‐like structure extends across the South Pacific, resembling a Rossby wave response. Idealized experiments using a simplified atmospheric general circulation model show that this pattern can be reproduced by stationary tropical heating over the Maritime Continent, suggesting a dynamical link between tropical heating and South American precipitation variability on subseasonal timescales independent of ENSO and the MJO."

Developing AR detection tools (ARDTs) is critical yet challenging. This study evaluates 12 ARDTs in the Arctic to assess their performance in representing atmospheric heat (represented by moist static energy) and moisture transport, as well as surface downward longwave radiation (LWD) and precipitation impacts, spanning 2000 to 2019 using ERA5 reanalysis. We find that AR occurrence frequency in the Arctic varies widely, from less than 1% to over 13%, depending on the ARDT. This variability leads to differences in contributions to poleward atmospheric heat (<1%–33%) and moisture (<1%–49%) transport. The highest AR frequency, and corresponding contributions to atmospheric heat and moisture transport, occurs over the Atlantic sector during non‐summer seasons for most ARDTs. This region aligns with the primary poleward moisture pathway and the end of climatological mid‐latitude storm tracks, highlighting strong connections between Arctic ARs and mid‐latitude cyclones. ARs induce significant LWD anomalies, largest in winter, smallest in summer, and also substantially contribute to the seasonal precipitation. Global ARDTs detect fewer ARs with larger anomalies (>100 W m−2 in higher Arctic), but contribute <1% to seasonal climatological LWD and precipitation. In contrast, polar‐specific ARDTs detect higher AR occurrences and account for up to 16% of seasonal LWD and 41% precipitation. This suggests that algorithms emphasizing extreme events with large anomalies do not necessarily indicate a large climate radiative and precipitation impact."

Using reanalysis data, historical atmosphere‐only simulations (AMIP), and simulations with uniformly increased sea surface temperatures (+4K; AMIP+4K), we examine how seasonal‐mean precipitation and burst behavior respond to warming across eight climate models. A consistent link emerges between higher seasonal‐mean precipitation and a greater number of bursts. A moist static energy budget analysis reveals that horizontal moisture advection governs burst evolution, while model‐specific parameterizations add variability in burst characteristics. Some models show gradual transitions governed by horizontal moisture advection, others display abrupt shifts absent in reanalysis. Among the three models with AMIP+4K simulations, MRI‐ESM2‐0 and BCC‐CSM2‐MR reproduce seasonal precipitation patterns close to their AMIP counterparts, with burst frequencies nearly unchanged in BCC‐CSM2‐MR and slightly reduced in MRI‐ESM2‐0. Only MRI‐ESM2‐0 captures a gradual, physically consistent burst evolution resembling reanalysis, whereas BCC‐CSM2‐MR still shows abrupt transitions. IPSL‐CM6A‐LR, the third model with AMIP+4K simulations, shows a gradual evolution but produces stronger mean precipitation and fewer bursts—contrary to the typical positive precipitation–burst relationship. Cluster‐based composites show that precipitation changes arise from differing contributions of thermodynamic and dynamic components of vertical moisture advection. In MRI‐ESM2‐0, enhanced precipitation in warming scenarios is mainly driven by stronger thermodynamic moistening, whereas in IPSL‐CM6A‐LR, dynamically induced drying offsets thermodynamic gains, particularly in specific burst clusters. These results emphasize model‐dependent monsoon burst responses and the need to separate dynamic and thermodynamic influences to strengthen confidence in future hydro‐climate projections."

These coatings amplify radiative effects, according to a model–data analysis for 2023. 
 Black carbon is a global climate forcer due to its strong radiative absorption, which is highly sensitive to coating formation regulated by anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. However, how cross-regional biogenic sources modulate urban black carbon coating and radiative effects remains poorly understood. Here we integrate observations and model simulations to investigate such biogenic–anthropogenic interactions in eastern China. The results show that biogenic volatile organic compounds from vegetation-rich regions undergo atmospheric oxidation to produce oxygenated organic compounds, which are subsequently advected into downwind urban areas. These products enhance regional atmospheric oxidation capacity and supply additional precursors, thereby promoting secondary organic aerosol production. This biogenic-induced strengthening of regional photochemistry drives the formation of highly oxidized secondary organic aerosol coatings on black carbon and increases its fraction within the total particle population. Consequently, black carbon absorption efficiency increases more steeply with the coating carbon oxidation state under biogenic-rich conditions, yielding an average ~20% enhancement in radiative absorption from the lensing effect relative to biogenic-poor periods. Our findings reveal that cross-regional biogenic–anthropogenic interactions enhance both the formation and particle population fraction of secondary organic aerosol coatings on urban black carbon, potentially further amplifying its radiative effects as biogenic emissions increase under future warming scenarios. Biogenic–anthropogenic interactions increase the formation and prevalence of secondary organic aerosol coatings on urban black carbon in Nanjing, China.

 2D covalent organic frameworks (COFs) usually possess a polycrystalline nature as well as lower porosity and surface area than 3D counterparts, restraining their exploration over gas storage applications. Herein, a substituent strategy has been proposed and employed to generate three robust single-crystal 2D COFs isomers with atom-resolution structures determined by 3D electron diffraction. Among three isomers, a precise engineering of their interlayer distance affords the highest Brunauer−Emmett−Teller surface area of ~2100 m2 g−1 and the largest pore volume of 1.40 cm3 g−1 for the desolvated GZU-1. This COF shows the highest total volumetric methane uptake of 240 cm3 (STP) cm−3 at 273 K and 100 bar among 2D COFs, even comparable with those for excellent 3D MOFs. This work not only delivers unique insight into the design of 2D single-crystal COFs by interlayer stacking regulation, but also promotes the application of highly porous 2D COFs in gas storage. 2D covalent organic frameworks usually possess a polycrystalline nature as well as lower porosity and surface area than 3D counterparts, limiting their gas storage application.

 Salinity shapes ocean circulation and marine biogeography, yet its long-term spatiotemporal variability and ecological impacts in marginal seas remain poorly constrained. We reconstruct a high-resolution sea surface salinity dataset (2000–2020) for the China Seas using a machine learning framework that integrates in situ cruises and buoys with satellite observations and diagnose drivers with an eigen microstates approach. The El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is the dominant control, modulating evaporation–precipitation, river discharge and Kuroshio intrusion. During El Niño, sea surface salinity increases by up to 25% in ocean-dominated regions but decreases up to 21% in river-dominated zones, amplifying meridional salinity contrasts. Species-distribution models indicate a southward habitat shift up to 2.5° latitude for 90% of key fish species. Under projected ENSO intensification, salinity inhomogeneity and associated ecological impacts are likely to strengthen. These results support an ‘ENSO forcing–salinity–fishery’ positive feedback framework and call for integrating salinity dynamics into adaptive, climate-informed fisheries management.

This study presents maps of emissions globally for different crops, showing that drained peatlands, rice paddies and fertilizer were the main drivers, and highlights differences in emission intensity. 
 Spatially explicit cropland greenhouse gas emission data are essential for identifying emission hotspots and guiding sustainable mitigation strategies. Here we develop high-resolution (5 arcmin) global maps of cropland emissions across 46 crop classes in 2020 by integrating sectoral datasets on synthetic fertilizer, manure, crop residue, in-field burning, rice cultivation and cultivated drained peatlands. Global croplands emitted 2.5 (95% CI 2.4–2.7) GtCO2e yr−1, with drained peatlands (35%), rice paddies (35%) and synthetic fertilizer (23%) as the primary contributors. Four crops—rice, maize, oil palm and wheat—accounted for 67% of total emissions. Emission areal intensities averaged 2 MgCO2e ha−1 globally, with higher intensities in Asia and Europe, where croplands also achieved high caloric productivity. Spatial correlations between emission intensity and production efficiency reveal geographic trade-offs between mitigation potential and food production. The resulting dataset establishes a unified global framework for a spatially explicit assessment of agricultural emissions and efficiency. Emissions from croplands are an important source of GHG emissions that can be shaped by management. This study presents maps of emissions globally for different crops, showing that drained peatlands, rice paddies and fertilizer were the main drivers, and highlights differences in emission intensity."

 Atmospheric rivers (ARs) and marine heatwaves (MHWs) are two major extreme events of the climate system that strongly influence the ocean–atmosphere interface, yet their mutual interactions remain poorly understood. Here we use long-term oceanic and atmospheric reanalysis datasets (OISST and ERA5) from 1982 to 2023 to quantify the interactions and feedbacks between ARs and MHWs over the North Pacific. Longer and more intense events exhibit a higher probability of overlapping, resulting in nearly 85% of ARs and 57% of MHWs being linked to the other system. Pronounced hotspots of co-occurrence emerge in the mid-latitudes, where both systems frequently develop. ARs promote ocean surface warming and exacerbate MHW intensity by enhancing surface heat fluxes dominated by latent heat, together with increased downward longwave and sensible heat fluxes over the North Pacific north of 40° N. Conversely, MHWs slightly suppress local AR intensity by weakening horizontal winds, while mesoscale convection and cyclonic disturbances disrupt integrated vapor transport. This effect is partially offset by enhanced moisture associated with stronger convection. These findings reveal a bidirectional coupling between oceanic and atmospheric extremes and highlight the need to examine their relationship across other ocean basins and under future warming scenarios to better anticipate compound climate risks."

 Antarctic sea ice variability has long been characterized by a dipole pattern primarily located in West Antarctica, attributed to the Amundsen Sea Low and remote forcing from the tropical Pacific, while variability in other sectors has received less attention. Here we reveal a tripole-like pattern of sea ice variability spanning multiple sectors of Antarctica, comprising the classic dipole together with seasonally varying centers in East Antarctica during austral winter and spring. Using observational analyses and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that, unlike the dipole, this tripole is not governed solely by the Amundsen Sea Low. Instead, it emerges from paired atmospheric circulation anomalies that impose coherent wind forcing along the sea ice edge, initiated by Rossby wave trains from the Pacific, Indian Ocean and Maritime Continent. These findings provide a broader framework for Antarctic sea ice variability and highlight previously overlooked Indian Ocean-Maritime Continent drivers of Antarctic climate predictability.

 Accurate field-scale evapotranspiration (ET) data with high spatiotemporal resolution is crucial for characterizing surface energy and water balance dynamics and guiding water resource management. OpenET, implemented on Google Earth Engine (GEE), provides field-scale ET estimates and relies mainly on Landsat data. Although Landsat thermal infrared (TIR) observations are effective for field-scale ET mapping, the ∼8-day revisit interval of the combined Landsat 8/9 constellation provides insufficient temporal sampling for short-term ET dynamics. This study presents a framework to improve the spatiotemporal resolution of ET mapping by integrating TIR observations from ECOSTRESS and VIIRS with Harmonized Landsat-Sentinel (HLS) data on GEE. Land surface temperature (LST) data from Landsat, ECOSTRESS and VIIRS were sharpened to 30-m resolution using the Data Mining Sharpener (DMS) algorithm. These sharpened LST data, along with 30-m Leaf Area Index (LAI) and albedo derived from HLS, were used as inputs to the GEE-based Disaggregated Atmosphere-Land Exchange (DisALEXI) model to produce daily 30-m ET estimates. ET estimates were validated against flux tower observations and compared with baseline Landsat-derived ET at six sites with varying land cover and climatic conditions. Results indicated that incorporating ECOSTRESS and VIIRS generally improved ET estimation accuracy, reducing average MAE (mm/day) by 8.64% (1.12 to 1.02, daily), 14.40% (1.00 to 0.85, weekly), 16.37% (0.82 to 0.69, monthly) relative to Landsat-only baselines.

 Shrub fractional abundance (SFA), the proportion of shrub cover per unit area, serves as a critical indicator of environmental aridity and ecosystem health in arid and semi-arid regions, particularly across the Mongolian steppe. However, large-scale SFA mapping in Mongolian steppe ecosystems remains challenging due to the small crown size of shrubs, their sparse distribution, and spectral overlap with coexisting low vegetation (e.g., grasses and herbs), which hinders accurate detection using coarser-resolution satellite data or traditional field surveys. To address these challenges, we developed a two-step approach that integrates very-high-resolution (VHR) imagery, time-series Sentinel-2 data, and deep learning techniques. First, we generated high-accuracy benchmark maps of individual shrub crowns from 0.5 m VHR imagery by combining manual segmentation with a hybrid deep learning framework (Dino V2 and convolutional neural networks). Second, we used these shrub crown maps as training data to build an XGBoost model for predicting SFA from 20 m Sentinel-2 time-series data, leveraging phenological information to improve estimation. We validated our approach across 70 sites (1km2 each) in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, which is representative of Mongolian steppe ecosystems. From VHR imagery, we mapped 1.31 million shrub crowns with an accuracy of R2 = 0.92. Scaling up with Sentinel-2 data yielded regional SFA maps with an R2 = 0.60. Further SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis on the developed XGBoost model revealed that phenological metrics (particularly observations in early-May, mid-July, and late-September), which distinguish shrub phenology from that of other land cover types (e.g., grasses and bare soil), were the most influential predictors of SFA. Finally, our regional SFA maps uncovered unimodal relationships between shrub distribution and climate variables, peaking at mean annual minimum temperatures near 0 °C and annual precipitation around 200 mm. Collectively, these findings demonstrate how the integration of multi-source remote sensing and machine learning can overcome historical limitations in SFA mapping, enabling accurate, spatially continuous assessments across vast Inner-Mongolian steppe ecosystems. Our framework has the potential to be applied to other steppe ecosystems and dryland ecosystems across the Mongolian steppe and beyond, offering a foundation for improved monitoring and ecological impact assessments in the face of global climate changes."

 Water level can be effectively monitored through satellite remote sensing. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing spatial coverage and resolution. High-resolution data provide detailed information but suffer from limited spatial coverage, while low-resolution data are inadequate for accurate large-scale monitoring. In this paper, a super-resolution approach with machine learning is proposed to enhance the accuracy of water level monitoring as a solution to this problem. By leveraging Real-world Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (Real-ESRGAN) and a high-quality pretrained model, this study enhances the spatial resolution of Sentinel-1 SAR imagery, whose features are then used to develop a water level estimation model, enabling dynamic monitoring of river water levels. Results show that after super-resolution, the Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) is reduced to 0.322 m (∼30.6% decrease), the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) increases to 0.957, and the Pearson Correlation Coefficient (R) improves to 0.987. The proposed super-resolution approach improves both spatial resolution (to 2.5 m/pixel) and water level estimation accuracy. Moreover, the results from representative stations, including densely urbanized regions, agricultural irrigation zones, and areas near sluices, show that our super-resolution approach provides accurate water level estimates and reliable trend predictions. Our experiments confirm its usefulness across a diverse spectrum of high accuracy hydrological monitoring scenarios."

 Urban areas across Africa have undergone unprecedented growth, posing significant challenges for sustainable development, infrastructure planning, and climate resilience. Existing mapping products often struggle to capture the dynamic and heterogeneous nature of these evolving urban landscapes, highlighting the need for maps that are both up-to-date and locally relevant. This study introduces a practical, cloud-based solution: an online tool for site-specific mapping (i.e., tailored maps for a defined area of interest) that leverages the capabilities of Google Earth Engine. The tool uses Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery to derive a wide range of spectral and texture metrics, supplemented by terrain data, and is trained using open building footprint datasets available for 2022. In an experimental setup, nine model configurations were tested under varying data availability conditions across 100 urban sites in Africa. The best-performing model achieved a mean F1-score of 0.59 (recall 0.63; precision 0.51) when validated against building footprints, with higher accuracy observed in dense urban areas. This configuration was integrated into the freely available ‘Do-it-yourself built-up mapping tool’ (DIY-BU). A quantitative analysis across the 100 test sites showed that the maps generated by our tool for 2022 were substantially more accurate (with an increase of F1-score by 0.18–0.30) than global multi-temporal products analysed for the same period (i.e., Dynamic World, ESRI land cover, GISA, GLC_FCS30D and GISD30). While the quantitative assessment was limited to the 2022 reference year, and the multi-temporal maps rely on a monotonic growth assumption (preventing the detection of demolition), a qualitative analysis highlighted the tool’s advantages in capturing detailed urban expansion and small-scale structures. The DIY-BU-mapping tool offers a valuable resource for a variety of applications, including urban planning, infrastructure monitoring, disaster preparedness and climate adaptation. Beyond presenting the tool’s functionality, the paper discusses its limitations and potential applications across diverse geographic and data availability contexts."

 From 2018 onwards, multiple droughts and heatwaves hit Central Europe including Germany. These triggered, together with other disturbance drivers, unprecedented damages to forests. While annual field-based crown defoliation surveys provide valuable insights into overall forest condition in Germany, continuous spatio-temporal dynamics are not explicitly addressed in current monitoring practices. Here, we present a forest canopy cover loss (FCCL) assessment in Germany at monthly resolution between September 2017 and September 2024 based on Sentinel-2 and Landsat satellite time series. This approach enables near-continuous monitoring of forest disturbance dynamics across spatial and temporal scales. Our results reveal that a strip in central Germany was most affected. Storm events in late 2017 and early 2018 caused the first large-scale canopy losses, while drought- and heat-related disturbances, including bark beetle outbreaks in spruce forests, dominated in 2019 and 2020. FCCL rates generally declined after 2020. We recorded a total of 924,000 ha FCCL over the seven-year period (8.4% of Germany’s forest area), 84.5% of which were found in coniferous forests. At district and municipality level, we detected FCCL of up to more than 50%. Two-thirds of FCCL were recorded during winter (November-April), underscoring the importance of off-season monitoring. This study demonstrates the value of dense, multi-sensor satellite time series for operational forest monitoring. It highlights regions with high future disturbance potential, particularly in southern and southeastern Germany due to their high share of spruce forests. Future monitoring should integrate seasonal data and early-warning systems to improve adaptive forest management at national scale."

 This study characterizes the amplitude changes associated with the 4 December 2021 eruption of Mount Semeru and maps the resulting deposits using Sentinel-1 SAR backscatter and PlanetScope optical imagery. Results show that lahar deposits caused surface smoothening which reduced SAR backscatter, whereas pyroclastic density currents (PDCs) increased backscatter due to higher moisture content. We have also shown the potential of differential polarimetric responses between surface cover types to identify areas of channel widening and vegetation destruction, providing a rapid means of identifying impacted areas in the context of volcanic crisis management. The supervised classification of SAR and high-resolution optical images enabled the production of an accurate geomorphological map able to separate different pyroclastic flow and lahar flow deposits both sedimentologically and spatially. Classified channelized lahar deposits were also used to quantify channel widening associated with the eruption, which significantly impacted the Supiturang Village."

 Climate change is escalating the frequency and intensity of droughts and wildfires globally. In New Caledonia, future intensification is projected, yet the seasonal and directional temporal relationships between vegetation drought and wildfire activity remain insufficiently characterized at the regional scale. This study presents a regional case study combining remote sensing and in-situ datasets spanning 2000–2024, aggregated at monthly and municipal scales, to analyse drought–fire temporal interactions in New Caledonia. The approach quantifies the temporal sequencing of interactions between vegetation condition and burned area occurrence, distinguishing periods when vegetation stress precedes fire activity (fire hazard) from periods when fire occurrence is followed by altered vegetation conditions (post-fire vulnerability and potential feedbacks). Lagged and seasonal correlation analyses were conducted using the Vegetation Health Index (VHI) as a proxy of vegetation drought and the Burned areas Anomaly Index (BAI) to characterize wildfire activity. Results reveal robust and spatially coherent correlations between vegetation drought and burned area extent, highlighting the strong association between VHI and subsequent wildfire activity. Distinct seasonal interaction patterns emerge, with vegetation condition preceding fire activity during the early dry season (August–September), while fire occurrence is followed by modified surface conditions over subsequent months (November–May), consistent with post-fire ecosystem vulnerability and feedback mechanism. Marked geographic contrasts are observed, particularly between the west and east coasts. These findings improve understanding of drought–fire temporal linkages in New Caledonia and provide actionable, region-specific insights for seasonally targeted and spatially explicit wildfire risk management."

 In this work, we described and characterized a novel online instrument for oxidative potential (OP) measurement using the ferrous orange xylenol (FOX) assay. This assay, based on the Fenton reaction, allows a good sensitivity for H2O2 with a LOD of 0.2 μg H2O2/m3 and an acceptable CV of 12%. Laboratory tests indicated that the instrument is responding to O3 and tert-butyl hydroperoxide but not to NO2. Its 5-min sampling and analysis cycle is short enough to catch the fast decay of the reactive and unstable oxidants potentially presents in the ambient aerosol. These analytical specifications allowed us to continuously quantify the total OPFOX — gaseous + particulate — during more than 20 days at an urban monitoring station in Lausanne (Switzerland) for three different periods of the year. Random Forest Regression and Multiple Linear Regression were used and compared in the development of a time-independent predictive model for OPFOX. Random Forest Regression performed better than the Multiple Linear regression, particularly at high OPFOX values. These results strongly suggest that this online instrument responds to photochemically generated gaseous oxidants, particularly H2O2 and O3. The developed models also incorporated aerosol and meteorological variables — including ultrafine particle size, temperature, and solar radiation that may exhibit collinearity with these gaseous oxidants. Comparing online with offline (filter) samples showed that filter-based OPFOX measurements were substantially underestimated. Therefore, the online FOX measurement provides a more accurate estimate of reactive oxygen species and may complement existing indicators used in epidemiological studies of photochemical air pollution."

 Ozone pollution has become an increasingly severe issue in North China. To address the challenges of insufficient prediction accuracy under high-concentration conditions and imbalanced sample distribution, this study proposes a hybrid model named EX-PIM-XGB(Extreme sample enhancement - Permutation Importance Method - Extreme Gradient Boosting), which integrates feature selection with extreme-sample augmentation for ozone forecasting. Using air quality and meteorological data from 79 monitoring stations during 2020–2024, the dataset was divided into four seasonal subsets—spring, summer, autumn, and winter—for model development. Results indicate that NO2 consistently exhibited high and stable importance across all seasons, with a maximum score of 2.78, followed by T2M and D2M, while UVB, CDIR, PM10,PM2.5 exhibited stronger seasonal variation. The R2 values of the spring, summer, autumn, and winter models were 0.90, 0.88, 0.93, and 0.86, and the RMSEs were 17.53, 19.93, 17.50, and 10.67. The enhanced model demonstrated significantly improved performance in high-concentration ranges; for instance, in summer, R2 increased from 0.79 to 0.90, RMSE decreased by 16%, and prediction accuracy improved by over 22%, outperforming both the conventional XGBoost model and the PIM-based variable selection model. These findings suggest that combining feature stability screening with extreme-sample augmentation effectively enhances the model's responsiveness to extreme pollution events, offering methodological insights and data-driven support for ozone pollution warning and control."

 The dynamical and microphysical processes that govern the lifecycle of hail-producing deep convective clouds (DCCs) remain poorly understood, limiting severe weather prediction. Here, we dissect a severe hailstorm that occurred over Inner Mongolia using multi-source observations, including Himawari-8 satellite data, Doppler radar, and a lightning mapping network. Our analysis reveals a tightly coupled co-evolution of cloud-top microphysical properties, cloud-top kinematics, and electrical activity. A key finding is the synchronization during rapid updraft intensification of a collapsing cloud-top effective radius (from ∼40 μm to ∼20 μm) with a surge in total lightning flash rate. Rapid updrafts likely shorten particle residence time, limiting particle growth while accelerating mixed-phase collisions and non-inductive charging, thereby promoting lightning jump activity. Critically, these abrupt changes in updraft velocity and lightning activity preceded surface hailfall and peak rainfall by approximately 30–40 min and 2 h, respectively. This study provides quantitative evidence that the integration of satellite, radar, and lightning observations can elucidate the microphysical pathways leading to severe convective weather and offers valuable lead time for improved nowcasting."

 Reductions in sulfate over recent years have increased the relative contributions of nitrate and ammonium to PM2.5 in Chinese megacities, shifting the focus of further PM abatement toward these semi-volatile species. This shift in focus makes understanding gas-particle partitioning, which is governed by aerosol pH and temperature, central to predicting their particle-phase contributions. Using hourly measurements of water-soluble inorganic ions (WSIIs) and related gases in Hong Kong and Shanghai, we constrained aerosol pH and aerosol water content (AWC) with ISORROPIA-II and evaluated PM2.5 mass sensitivity to total nitrate (TNO3 = HNO3 + NO3−) and total ammonia (TNH3 = NH3 + NH4+). In Hong Kong, sulfate dominated the WSIIs, whereas nitrate was dominant in Shanghai. The seasonally lower temperature (≈ 6–9 °C) in Shanghai, combined with a lower sulfate fraction, contributed to an aerosol pH approximately one unit higher than that in Hong Kong. The combination of higher pH and lower temperature in Shanghai favored particulate nitrate formation (high ε(NO3−)), increasing PM sensitivity to TNO3. Our quantitative sensitivity analysis showed that cutting TNO3 in Shanghai was as effective as cutting sulfate for PM2.5 reduction, while TNH3 controls required reductions of >40% to become effective. Consistent with its distinct chemical and meteorological regime, PM2.5 in Hong Kong was co-sensitive to both TNH3 and TNO3, indicating that a synergistic control strategy is optimal. Meteorology modulated these sensitivities primarily by altering aerosol pH and partitioning. Temperature exerted the strongest influence by directly controlling the thermodynamic equilibrium. High relative humidity favored greater aerosol water content, elevating aerosol pH and further promoting nitrate partitioning. Chemical composition, notably the sulfate and nitrate levels, also played a decisive role by setting the initial chemical regime. This contrast demonstrates that the lower temperatures and higher aerosol pH in Shanghai amplifies PM2.5 sensitivity to TNO3, warranting prioritized NOx control.

 In the Asian monsoon region, October marks the transition from the wet to the dry season, during which precipitation variability plays a crucial role in regional water management and ecological stability. In recent decades, intensified climate warming has led to more frequent extreme precipitation events across Southwest China, posing substantial challenges to agriculture and economic development in the rain-fed Yunnan Province. Using long-term surface observations and ERA5 reanalysis data from 1961 to 2024, this study applies statistical and diagnostic analyses to identify the dominant physical drivers of October precipitation variability in Yunnan. The results show that the Western Tropical Pacific Moisture Anomaly Index (WTPAI) and mid-tropospheric relative humidity (RH) jointly regulate interannual precipitation changes. The positive influence of WTPAI on precipitation is subject to a humidity threshold near 49%, indicating that moisture anomalies amplify precipitation only under sufficiently moist conditions. Furthermore, the Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) primarily modulates WTPAI through its ridge position, linking large-scale circulation to regional moisture supply. Based on these findings, a “humidity threshold plus regional moisture anomaly” framework is proposed to describe the synergistic amplification mechanism between humidity and moisture transport. This framework clarifies the dynamic–thermodynamic coupling processes controlling autumn precipitation over Yunnan and provides a scientific basis for improved precipitation attribution, prediction, and water resource management under a warming climate."

 Convection-permitting simulations offer a promising approach for improving precipitation estimation in complex terrain, yet their added value and sensitivity to parameterizations remain poorly understood in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin. This study systematically intercompares fifteen 3-km WRF simulations to examine how parameterization choices (radiation, cloud microphysics, planetary boundary layer, shallow convection, and orographic drag) influence precipitation characteristics critical for hydrological applications: intensity, duration, frequency (IDF), maxima, and diurnal cycles. Results indicate that convection-permitting simulations add clear value by mitigating the “drizzle bias” typical of coarse-resolution models and by producing higher-intensity, shorter-duration events that better reflect the region's convective nature. While higher resolution improves event structure, the accuracy of mean precipitation depends strongly on parameterization. Sensitivity analysis reveals that cloud microphysics schemes primarily govern intensity, duration, and the timing of the diurnal peak, with the Thompson scheme best reproducing the nighttime peak observed in near-normal years. The planetary boundary layer scheme dominates precipitation frequency, with the MYNN2 scheme demonstrating robust performance across interannual variability. Comparisons with a convolutional neural network-based product and coarse-resolution reanalyses indicate that dynamical downscaling is more robust across interannual variability (dry versus wet years). Despite substantial uncertainty among satellite observational products, these findings show that optimized convection-permitting models capture realistic valley-scale gradients and diurnal propagation, providing essential guidance for hydrological modeling in complex terrain."

Biomass burning (BB) is a major BrC emission source, yet insufficient understanding of long-term emission trends from different sources and their underlying drivers hinders the accurate assessment of regional climate and environmental effects, as well as the development of targeted mitigation strategies. We integrated provincial socioeconomic data, remote sensing data, and source-specific emission factors to quantify the magnitude, spatial variations, and trends (1980–2023) of BrC emissions from BB in China. Furthermore, we analyzed the period-specific drivers and projected future emissions under different policy scenarios. The BrC emissions rose and then fell (1980–2023), peaking in 2014 at 433 (95% CI: 323–635) Gg, with an increasing contribution from open emissions. The major emission regions migrated from areas with intensive indoor biomass use (e.g., South-Central China) to those with main crop-producing regions (e.g., Northeast China). Agricultural expansion, energy structure changes, and policy controls are the primary factors driving emission variations, while the main drivers of indoor and open emissions varied across different periods. Projections of the baseline scenario indicate that open emissions should be paid more attention, given their continued contribution (94%, 2035). Maintaining existing control efforts may lead to a slight increase in emissions (11%) due to growing straw output and control uncertainties. More rigorous control of straw-burning policies and differentiated management strategies could decrease emissions."

Although catalytic oxidation is promising for their simultaneous removal, competitive adsorption and the selective reactivity of oxygen species limit its synergistic efficiency. Herein, Lanthanum (La) was introduced to modulate the electron localization at tetrahedral (Td) and octahedral (Oh) sites in CoMn2O4, thereby governing the distribution and reactivity of oxygen species, accompanied by an overall shift in surface acid–base properties. The large ionic radius and low electronegativity of La3+ induce pronounced lattice distortion and charge redistribution, particularly in tetrahedral sites of La0.1Co catalyst, activating otherwise inert CoTd-O units for efficient O2 activation and rapid replenishment of oxygen vacancies under high temperature conditions. Simultaneously, La doping weakens MnOh-O bonds at octahedral sites and stabilizes Mn4+ to enhance lattice oxygen mobility and reactivity. This dual activation enhances electrophilic attack on aromatic rings and promotes C–H bond activation, governing the oxidation of toluene and acetone. The overall optimization of  surface acid–base properties mitigates competitive adsorption and facilitates the degradation of reaction intermediates. Notably, for mixed VOCs removal, La0.1Co lowers the T90 for toluene by 45 °C and increases the specific reaction rate of toluene oxidation compared to pristine CoMn2O4. This work provides insights and modification strategies for designing efficient catalysts tailored to both single- and mixed-component VOCs."

Compared with traditional semiempirical parametrizations, the new scheme more accurately reproduced diverse literature-derived field observations, particularly in Asia and the Amazon region. The model estimated a global vegetation-mediated Hg0 dry deposition flux of 2257 Mg yr–1, with hotspots in tropical rainforests and industrialized regions of Asia driven by enhanced vegetation activity and intensive regional anthropogenic emissions.

These conditions were driven by high sea surface temperature in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, together with reduced moisture advection from the Atlantic, causing large vapor pressure and water deficits in the second semester of 2023. Here, we evaluate the response of the Amazon carbon cycle to this extreme event across different spatial scales. We combined atmospheric CO2 mole fractions and eddy covariance flux data from the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO, −2.1441, −58.99), low‐latency simulations by Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), an atmospheric inversion, and remote sensing data. We find that in 2023 the Amazon region was, including fires, a net carbon source of 0.01–0.17 PgC. Fire emissions (0.15 [0.13–0.17] PgC) were within typical variability of the 2003–2023 period, thus we attribute the weak carbon source to reduced vegetation uptake during the dry season (August–October). A stronger‐than‐normal vegetation uptake early in the year (January–April), consistent across data streams and spatial scales, mitigated the total carbon losses by the end of the year. We find a shift from carbon sink to source in May and a peak source in October. Our findings show a reduced vegetation carbon uptake over the Amazon region, leading to a weak carbon source that contributed up to 30% of the net carbon loss in the tropical land in 2023."

In the North Atlantic, regimes such as the North Atlantic Oscillation influence the jet stream and affect surface climate. Here we investigate the dynamics governing the interaction between these timescales, and how it is mediated by Rossby Wave Breaking (RWB) events. A simplified equation is derived to explore which processes contribute to RWB through a meridional overturning of high‐frequency potential vorticity, providing a dynamical recipe for when and where wave breaking occurs. We show that slowly varying regimes steer the tracks of high‐frequency systems, which in turn determine whether the frequency of cyclonic or anticyclonic RWB is enhanced or suppressed. The recurrence of same‐type RWB in a similar position can ultimately shape the mean structure of WRs. By linking the structure of WRs to the dynamics of wave breaking, our framework provides a dynamical basis for interpreting variability in midlatitude circulation."

Plane;Julián Villamayor;Alfonso Saiz‐Lopez,Shifts in Atmospheric Composition Since the Preindustrial Era Modified the Transport and Deposition of Mercury,"The atmospheric lifetime of mercury (Hg) determines its global spread and the delivery of this toxic pollutant to remote ecosystems. Previous studies have generally assumed that the chemical lifetime of elemental mercury (Hg0) has remained constant across historical time periods, mirroring present‐day (PD, 2010–2019) conditions. However, since preindustrial times (PI, 1850) anthropogenic emissions have altered the concentrations of key oxidants that affect the Hg0 lifetime, including bromine radicals (Br), hydroxyl radicals (OH), and ozone (O3). Here, we use chemistry‐climate modeling to analyze the changes in Hg redox chemistry between PI and PD and consequent impacts on Hg transport and deposition. While increasing concentrations of OH and O3 lead to 16% faster Hg0 oxidation in the PD Northern Hemisphere, the increased partitioning of Br to reservoir species slows Hg0 oxidation by 20% in the Southern Hemisphere compared to PI. On the global scale, these competing mechanisms lead to an overall buffering of the tropospheric chemical lifetime of Hg0. The shift from PI to PD atmospheric composition drives 15% more Hg deposition to tropical and subtropical fisheries, which are the major global source of toxic methylmercury for human exposure. The PI atmosphere was more conducive to the spread of Hg to the remote Southern Hemisphere extratropics, impacting the interpretation of historical records of Hg deposition from natural archives and the supply of Hg to the Southern Ocean marine sediment sink. This study reveals the previously overlooked role of changing atmospheric composition in aggravating human Hg exposure risk via altered deposition patterns."

Hereby we statistically investigate for the first time Es responses to variations of the northern polar vortex (represented by NAM index) using long‐term ionosonde observations over Japan (44 years) and Australia (34 years). The analysis reveals clear polar vortex modulation of Es, with increasing/decreasing foEs on low/high NAM days over Japan and decreasing foEs over Australia on low NAM days with a time lag of 5–7 days. This hemispheric asymmetry is largely attributed to nearly anti‐phase wind shear responses in two hemispheres. Our results demonstrate the modulation of deep connection between stratosphere dynamics and ionospheric irregularities, emphasizing the importance atmosphere‐ionosphere coupling. It suggests that the NAM index could be used to increase the accuracy of Es layer prediction and serve as indicator for assessing the risk of Es layer occurrence in advance.

This acceleration is primarily contributed by the normal component of the translation vector. For westbound TCs, translation speed and its normal component increase with intensity, particularly at typhoon strength and above. Numerical simulations and diagnostic analyses attribute the acceleration to horizontal advection and diabatic heating, primarily driven by land‐induced asymmetric flow and convection. These findings strengthen the current understanding of TC motion dynamics and support more effective disaster prevention and mitigation strategies as TCs approach coastal regions."

Mass flux calculations suggest that short‐lived convective cores (∼30 min) account for ∼2% of total vertical air mass transport relative to steady entrainment, increasing to ∼13% when the trailing stratiform regions are included.

Hypercapnic hypoxia mostly occurs during low tide, at low‐salinity sites, and in warm tropical regions. Climate change will decrease oxygen concentrations by 5%–35% and increase CO2 concentrations by 8%–60% in mangrove waters by 2100. Overall, hypercapnic hypoxia events will occur more frequently, last longer, and become more severe. These shifts will reduce mangrove biodiversity and deteriorate habitat quality for commercially valuable fish. The strongest impact is expected in tropical developing countries."

Understanding how surface temperatures during such events are regulated by soil evaporation (E) and vegetation transpiration (T) remains limited due to challenges in partitioning total evapotranspiration (ET). Here, high‐frequency turbulence methods are used to partition observed ET at 32 National Ecological Observatory Network sites across the contiguous United States. Heatwaves were defined as at least three consecutive days with daily maximum air temperature exceeding the site‐specific 90th percentile of the 2019–2021 record. Across 268 identified events, the T/ET ratio decreased by 32% ± 16% relative to the non‐heatwave baseline of 0.65, with greater reductions at lower biomass sites. The T/ET ratio was typically suppressed below non‐heatwave conditions during the early and middle stages of the heatwave (first two‐thirds of event duration), but was on average higher than non‐heatwave baseline levels during late stages (final third) due to extremely low soil evaporation. Of the studied heatwaves, 71% of these had surface temperatures above 38°C in their late stage; however, heatwaves sustaining higher evaporation fluxes (upper tertile of observed fluxes) during the late stage were associated with relative surface temperature anomalies that were on average 45% lower than those of heatwaves with lower evaporation fluxes (lower tertile). The commensurate surface cooling induced by higher transpiration was only 2% during heatwaves, suggesting that transpiration has a limited ability to mitigate extreme surface temperatures.

 Fast atmospheric particulate nitrate and sulfate formation under high-humidity conditions has been extensively observed; however, the underlying chemical mechanisms and their relative contributions remain poorly understood. This study examined the characteristic high-humidity events (HHEs) in southern China during spring, providing field observation evidence for the crucial role of NO2-driven multiphase reactions in particulate nitrate and sulfate formation. Our findings revealed efficient nitrate formation during early HHEs, likely facilitated by enhanced NO2 uptake via disproportionation reaction. As humidity increased and fog formed, S(IV) oxidation competitively consumed NO2 and N(III), causing rapid sulfate formation. The resulting N(III), produced from the oxidation of S(IV) by NO2 (aq), further oxidizes S(IV) effectively in droplets due to its slow liquid-gas mass transfer rate. A state-of-the-art multiphase box model demonstrated that NO2 uptake and SO2 oxidation by NO2/N(III) represent dominant formation pathways during HHEs, accounting for 45.4% and 63.6% of the total nitrate and sulfate production, respectively. These results highlight the critical importance of NO2-driven multiphase chemistry in particulate pollution under high-humidity environments."

 The Arctic-Boreal region is vulnerable to rapid climate change. Thawing of the permafrost and extended warm periods are expected to turn the region into a hotspot of enhanced CH4 emissions. We estimated CH4 fluxes by assimilating atmospheric CH4 mixing ratio data from a regional network into a global atmospheric inverse model, resulting in a mean uncertainty reduction of ~68% across the domain and improved agreement with observations. From 2010 to 2021, the Arctic-Boreal region emitted 45.4 ± 0.7 TgCH4 y−1 ( ~ 7% of global emissions), with no significant overall trend. However, on the regional scale a positive trend emerged in the Western Siberia Lowlands. Arctic-Boreal wetland emissions increased during warmer years, suggesting possible future increases as warming continues. Emissions varied regionally, with western Russia showing higher fluxes. Changes in winter hydroclimate significantly influenced emissions in the Western Siberian Lowlands, likely by enhancing the availability of soil moisture through snowmelt in spring.

 Long-term monitoring of urban infrastructure deformation is critical for city safety. Tomographic SAR (TomoSAR) enables precise layover scatterer separation via elevation-based imaging, serving as a key tool for urban monitoring. However, traditional TomoSAR methods are inefficient for new time periods due to repetitive computations and complex inversion algorithms, failing to meet rapid monitoring demands. This study proposes a dynamic inheritance-enhanced TomoSAR Imaging method using dual-task deep learning model. First, a dynamic scatterer sample set is constructed for new periods by efficiently screening and inheriting historical scatterer classes and elevation parameters. Next, the DT-TomoSARNet network is developed to simultaneously perform scatterer classification and elevation regression through a dual-task collaborative mechanism, optimized by a hybrid loss function that adaptively adjusts task weights. Finally, the Historical-constrained-BF algorithm leverages historical data constraints to rapidly update large-scale linear deformation velocities and thermal amplitudes. Experiments using 2015–2024 COSMO-SkyMed long time-series data from Shenzhen City demonstrate that the proposed method effectively inherits historical parameters, achieving a maximum weighted F1-score of 0.97 and a minimum average absolute error of 1.438 m in scatterer classification and elevation regression tasks. Furthermore, the global processing time is reduced to just one-sixth of that required by the traditional BF method, while maintaining high accuracy in physical parameter estimation. This method significantly enhances the applicability of TomoSAR for long-term dynamic urban deformation monitoring."

 Accurate delineation and mapping of forest burned areas (FBAs) are critical for assessing fire-induced ecological effects and informing post-fire management strategies. Although medium-resolution sensors (10–30 m) have advanced FBA detection, such detection at a finer spatial resolution remains challenging due to various confounding factors like cloud/terrain shadows and phenology-induced spectral confusions. To mitigate these false alarms, an accurate detection framework was developed, integrating active fire (AF) data with Sentinel-2 multi-temporal imagery. Potential candidates are identified using optimized spectral features across single- and dual-temporal scales. These candidates are subsequently refined by synergizing AF data and the novel smoothed Enhanced Burned Area Index (EBAI) imagery to enhance detection sensitivity. The EBAI leverages the temporal-spectral variations of FBAs, characterized by abrupt deviations from pre-fire reflectance and short-term post-fire anomalies, to highlight burned signals and suppress false alarms. Applied to the Amur River Basin, we generated the first 10-m resolution monthly FBA product (ARB_FBA) for 2020–2023. Validation with independent reference units demonstrated low commission errors (7.65–8.46%), low omission errors (9.43–13.02%), and high Dice coefficients (89.94–91.21%). ARB_FBA outperformed global products (GABAM, FireCCI51, and MCD64A1) by delivering more accurate, detailed, and extensive burned areas. Results indicated marked fluctuations in FBA, ranging from a minimum of 3.83 × 105 ha in 2021 to a peak of 1.08 × 106 ha in 2023. The 2023 surge was associated with record-breaking heatwaves and forest management deficiencies, while areal peaks confirmed spring (March to May) as the highest-risk period. These findings establish a robust foundation for post-fire impact assessments and offer actionable insights for forest management."

 Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) contains organic pollutants and microorganisms that interact with pulmonary fluids upon inhalation, potentially leading to lung microbiota dysbiosis and respiratory diseases. However, how lung fluids affect the bioaccessibility and transformation of PM2.5 remains unclear, impeding precision risk assessment. We extracted and incubated ambient PM2.5 samples in simulated lung fluids (SLFs) modeling extracellular healthy lung fluid (modified Gamble's solution, MGS) versus intracellular acidic lung fluid (artificial lysosomal fluid, ALF). Organic compounds and microorganisms were analyzed using ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS) and high-throughput sequencing, respectively. The results show fluid-dependent bioaccessibility and changes: seven most abundant organic compounds (e.g. malic acid) are exclusively bioaccessible in MGS, whereas four organics (e.g. 4-nitrophenol) are bioaccessible only in ALF. High-risk toxins like nicotine, skatole, and N,N-dimethylacetamide show high bioavailability in both fluids. While ALF extracts minimal microorganisms, MGS exhibits higher release for some pathogens including Corynebacterium, Staphylococcus, and Acinetobacter. After 96-h cultivation, MGS exhibits greater compositional shifts in both organic compounds (carboxylic acids, amine compounds, and pyridines) and microbiota (ten different genera including Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas) than ALF, owing to more pronounced microbial activities in neutral pH. In MGS, Acinetobacter and Pseudomonas were positively associated with carboxylic acids, amines, and aromatics, indicating putative microbe–organic interactions that require mechanistic confirmation. These fluid-specific patterns suggest that identical PM2.5 exposure may yield different health impacts from pollutants and microorganisms depending on an individual's pulmonary microenvironment. This study underscores the importance of incorporating bioaccessibility into PM2.5 risk assessments."

 Ozone (O3) pollution in eastern China has been worsening in recent years despite the implementation of effective control measures. Reactive chlorine plays a key role in regulating O3 formation by modulating atmospheric oxidative capacity. However, its impact on O3 formation in the context of land-sea interaction and long-range transport has not been fully explored in eastern China. In this study, we combined a chemical transport model (CTM) with meteorological and O3 observations, as well as backward trajectory analyses, to identify a typical long-range O3 transport episode in eastern China in autumn 2018. Three representative cities—Shanghai, Fuzhou, and Shenzhen—experienced significant regional transport impacts. During the typical transport episode, chlorine emissions aggravated O3 pollution, with peak increases exceeding 10, 12, and 8 μg m−3 in Shanghai, Fuzhou, and Shenzhen, respectively. Marine-derived chlorine dominated this contribution, accounting for 55.8%, 63.3%, 69.5% of the total chlorine impact in the above three cities. These findings highlight the critical role of chlorine emissions, particularly from marine sources, in enhancing coastal O3 levels."

In this study, PM2.5 and PM1.0 samples were collected for 15–20 days per season during 2020–2021 at an urban site in Seoul (SE) and a background site on Baengnyeong Island (BN), South Korea, to monitor PAHs and metals. Both sites showed higher Σ13 PAH concentrations in winter (SE: 12.6 for PM2.5 and 9.59 for PM1.0; BN: 9.37 and 5.58 ng/m3), while Σ10 metal concentrations increased in winter (SE: 769 and 373; BN: 660 and 340 ng/m3) and fall (SE: 503 and 248, BN: 403 and 223 ng/m3). Backward trajectory analysis identified northeastern and northern China and North Korea as major source regions. BN frequently experienced CHMs episodes associated with air masses transported from North Korea. SHAP results revealed that seasonal variables were primary drivers of CPAHs, whereas particle size was the dominant factor influencing CHMs. Cancer risk associated with PAHs was higher at SE (6.7 × 10−8 and 4.7 × 10−8), whereas that from heavy metals was higher at BN (1.0 × 10−5 and 5.6 × 10−6). Risk normalized by PM mass was significantly higher for PM2.5, indicating a more efficient enrichment of PAHs and heavy metals in the PM1.0-2.5 fraction.

 The vertical airflow velocity directly governs the growth and development of clouds. Accurately retrieving this velocity represents one of the pivotal and challenging aspects in cloud dynamics research. Unfortunately, no existing method can precisely retrieve the continuous vertical airflow velocity within clouds. To tackle this problem, this study assesses the feasibility of employing particles at the left end of the power spectrum as tracer particles by incorporating the intensity and critical threshold of tracer spectral points. Through an analysis of the impacts of turbulence, wind shear, and beam width on particles in various phases, the spectral width threshold is further established. Ultimately, the applicable conditions for the small particle tracing method are clearly defined. Additionally, based on power spectrum skewness and temperature, a method for retrieving vertical airflow velocity through spectral separation in a bimodal structure is proposed. The combination of these two methods can overcome the limitations inherent in single retrieval method and yield the vertical airflow velocity within the cloud's vertical structure under specific conditions."

 This research highlights the role of the summertime southward intrusion of the Siberian air mass in intensifying extreme precipitation over East Asia. We identify a recurrent cold-core anticyclone over Siberia termed the Summer Siberian High (SSH) and define its southward expansion as the Summer Cold Surge (SCS). Our analysis reveals that the frequency of SCS events has nearly doubled since the early 2000s. This increase is attributed to a regime shift in the precursor circulation, characterized by the intensification of thermally enhanced, quasi-stationary anticyclones over the Ural Mountains. Dynamically analogous to the winter cold surge, the SCS transports cold and dry air into East Asia. The interaction between this cold intrusion and the warm, moist flow from the Western North Pacific Subtropical High enhances low-level baroclinicity and frontal convergence, thereby intensifying heavy rainfall. These findings underscore the growing climatological importance of high-latitude systems during summer and suggest that understanding SCS dynamics is crucial for predicting extreme precipitation in a warming climate."

 As one of the prominent oceanic regions exhibiting high interannual variability of sea surface temperature (SST), the southern Indian and Atlantic Oceans have been found to exert strong impacts on January–February-March (JFM) rainfall in southern Tanzania. The JFM rainfall is found to be significantly linked to the subtropical Indian Ocean Dipole (SIOD)-like SST pattern over the southern Indian Ocean and southern Atlantic Ocean Tripole (SAOT)-like SST structure over the southern Atlantic Ocean. This relationship is linearly independent of the effects of El Niño–Southern Oscillation and the Indian Ocean dipole. The presence of a weakened Mascarene high associated with the negative SIOD phase leads to southerly wind anomalies across the Mozambique Channel, which enhances moisture transport into southern Tanzania and rainfall over the region. The SAOT, on the other hand, excites a zonal elongated wave train-like pattern that induces large-scale cyclonic circulation over the southern Indian Ocean. Subsequently, the western flank of the cyclonic circulation excites southerly wind anomalies traversing through the Mozambique Channel towards the study region, leading to rainfall over the study region. Moreover, the observed wave train-like pattern is echoed in the upper levels, but the anticyclonic center over southern Australia expands further towards northern Madagascar. At this position, the associated anticyclonic wind anomalies reach southern Tanzania to create a divergence condition, enhancing rainfall conditions. Finally, the joint SIOD and SAOT indices show enhanced contribution to the rainfall, explaining about 28% of rainfall variability."

 Sea fog is a hazardous weather phenomenon that poses significant risks to maritime operations. To describe its dynamic morphological evolution, this study introduces the concept of fog shaping—a process governed by cloud liquid water (CLW) advection coupled with thermodynamic transport. Using both idealized and real-case numerical simulations, we examine the role of CLW advection in driving fog shaping over the Yellow Sea. A key finding in idealized simulations is that CLW advection contributes 61%–93% of the total effect under horizontally uniform sea surface temperature, strongly promoting downwind fog propagation. This process is further enhanced by cold-air advection to accelerate spatial expansion. Based on these results, we propose a conceptual framework in which fog shaping is governed by the balance between advective transport (CLW/cold-air advection) and local thermodynamic processes (turbulent mixing, radiative cooling, microphysical phase transitions). The framework distinguishes three shaping patterns: rapid downwind expansion (Type-A), quasi-translational motion (Type-B), and bidirectional development (Type-C). Three-dimensional simulations of two real events validate the framework. The 25 March 2018 case shows rapid northern expansion (Type-A) driven by dominant CLW advection. For the 10 May 2018 case, one experiment reveals that quasi-translational motion (Type-B) resulting from a quasi-equilibrium between advective removal and local CLW generation, while another exhibits bidirectional development (Type-C) due to a surplus of local upwind generation combined with dominant downwind CLW advection. These results underscore the critical role of CLW advection in fog shaping."

However, due to the chemical complexity of atmospheric BrC, many questions remain about the specific BrC chromophores and physicochemical properties that primarily control 1O2* and 3C* production. In this study, we present a framework for apportioning photosensitizers and predicting the production of 1O2* and 3C* based on measurable physicochemical properties of BrC. This is achieved by combining photochemical experiments with absorbance and fluorescence measurements and statistical modeling of a year-long data set of PM2.5 extracts from Hong Kong SAR, China. Parallel Factor and Non-negative Matrix Factorization analyses of the fluorescence data revealed that highly oxygenated organic aerosols were the main contributors to 1O2* production, whereas less oxygenated organic aerosols were the main contributors to 3C* production. Next, we developed Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Multiple Linear Regression models that successfully predicted 1O2* and 3C* steady-state concentrations ([1O2*]ss and [3C*]ss) and quantum yields ( ΦO2*1 and Φ3C*) from standard optical measurements. These models revealed that while [1O2*]ss and [3C*]ss depended on parameters that reflected the quantities of BrC chromophores, ΦO2*1 and Φ3C* were influenced by the specific types (i.e., quality) of BrC chromophores present. Overall, this combined approach provides a powerful tool for identifying key BrC chromophore components and specific physicochemical properties that drive 1O2* and 3C* production."

Using multisource data sets and machine learning, we analyzed surface dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics and the percent saturation (DO%sat) in 11,571 Chinese lakes from 2000 to 2020, quantified CDHE impacts, and projected future trajectories under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. We found widespread and continuous deoxygenation in China, with 52.2% of lakes showing significant declines (average of −0.12 mg/L/decade and −1.28%/decade for DO and DO%sat, respectively), most pronounced on the Tibetan Plateau and Mongolian Lakes. Intensifying CDHEs, particularly in arid or semiarid regions, increasingly amplified lake surface deoxygenation through their duration and severity. Projections indicate nationwide declines of DO (0.73–1.01 mg/L) and DO%sat (4.08–10.73%) by 2099 under all SSP scenarios, with Tibetan Plateau lakes showing the most severe deoxygenation. From a long-term perspective, air temperature and precipitation dominate the climatic drivers of deoxygenation for low-elevation plain lakes, while wind speed and air pressure are key for high-altitude and semiarid region lakes.

The parameterized model also fails to realistically confine rainfall to a moist mode. Using concepts from statistical mechanics we relate TCV frequency and tendency, and isolate process contributions to tendency in TCV phase‐space. Where bimodality is lacking, we find an incorrect relationship between moisture flux convergence and TCV in environments with little or no rainfall. The resulting lack of a strong gradient in TCV tendency with respect to TCV is inconsistent with that expected to maintain a TCV frequency minimum.

Despite its large volume and mass, the periphery is still poorly understood. This study shows that the periphery is equally supplied by air coming from the core and skin. However, periphery air flows mainly toward the skin, with limited transport into the core. The skin contributes to the periphery primarily through transport associated with the toroidal vortex. Each zone also exhibits distinct microphysical properties, including differences in droplet mean radius, variance, and relative dispersion."

Using the state‐of‐the‐art aerosol‐climate model ECHAM6.3‐HAM2.3‐SALSA2.0: 10Be, we assess the impacts of three major volcanic eruptions: Agung (1963), El Chichón (1982) and Pinatubo (1991). All eruptions enhance stratospheric 10Be sedimentation, increasing atmospheric 10Be below the injection altitude for several months, followed by stratospheric 10Be depletion that takes years to recover. Increases in tropospheric 10Be and deposition coincide with periods of strong stratosphere–troposphere exchange. Aerosol‐induced sedimentation significantly enhances polar 10Be deposition subsequent to the Pinatubo and El Chichón eruptions but plays a limited role after the Agung eruption. Sensitivity experiments reveal that higher SO2 injections generally lead to nonlinear increases in global 10Be deposition. These results underscore the need to account for volcanic influences when interpreting and modeling polar 10Be records following major eruptions."

Krehbiel,The Microphysical Structure of Thunderstorms in the Horizontal Development of Lightning,"The shape of lightning channels reflects nature's intricate craftsmanship, shaped by intracloud electric fields influenced by the microphysical structure of thunderstorms. While previous studies have focused primarily on the relationship between vertically stratified charge structures and vertical lightning development, the relationship between thunderstorm microphysics and the horizontal development of lightning remains unclear. This study uses three‐dimensional radiation source data from the Lightning Mapping Array at New Mexico's Langmuir Laboratory and KABX radar data to examine how the types, number concentrations, and spatial arrangement of hydrometeors influence the horizontal development of lightning within a certain range of altitudes. The WRF‐Electric model is employed to validate the observations. The results show that horizontal microphysical heterogeneity alters the evolution characteristics of lightning channels: branching and acceleration often occur at boundaries between different types of hydrometeors, in regions with high particle number concentrations, and near regions of vertical ice. Simulations further reveal that turbulence strongly influences the distribution of hydrometeors and that the type of hydrometeor has a greater effect on the electric field variation than does the number concentration. This study establishes a clear correspondence between thunderstorm microphysics and the horizontal development of lightning, and clarifies how microphysical structure affects lightning development."

In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme DSs has underscored the urgent need to better understand their historical characteristics and dominant drivers. Here, we examined a 64‐year observational record (1961–2024) of springtime DS in China, emphasizing the spatiotemporal variations of DS across different intensities. A significant nationwide decrease in the frequency of DSs has been observed, primarily attributed to a reduction in lower‐intensity (ODS; ordinary DS) events. The proportion of severe and extreme dust storms (SEDS) has significantly increased since the early 2000s, suggesting a transition toward fewer but more intense occurrences. Using machine learning with interpretable methods, we show that ODS are primarily driven by synoptic‐scale dynamics, whereas SEDS are more sensitive to land‐surface deficits. SEDS frequency increases sharply when evaporation reaches extremely low values (<50 mm) and top‐layer soil temperature exhibits rapid warming (exceeding 290 K), These conditions indicate a precipitation‐limited surface state, with strong winds serving as the final trigger for SEDS. The increases in SEDS since 1990 in northwestern China coincide with intensifying spring drought and strengthening wind extremes, while in North China, despite only modest increases in wind speed, persistent surface drying has sustained elevated SEDS activity. In contrast, the eastern Tibetan Plateau exhibits a clear decline, consistent with progressive wetting and a notable weakening of near‐surface winds. Our findings identify early‐warning predictors that can improve the interpretation and development of future dust‐storm projections under climate change."

 Understanding the relationship between vegetation productivity and soil accretion is critical for assessing the resilience of deltaic wetlands to relative sea-level rise. This study integrates airborne imaging spectroscopy from NASA's AVIRIS-NG sensor with field measurements from the Delta-X campaign to quantify herbaceous vegetation contributions to vertical accretion processes in the Mississippi River Delta's coastal wetlands. We developed imaging spectroscopy–based products for live above- and belowground carbon (AGC, BGC), and aboveground necromass (AGN; or non-photosynthetic vegetation), the latter being derived using a novel combination of spectral unmixing and Random Forest regression. These vegetation maps were evaluated alongside in situ soil accretion measurements—including surface sediment accretion, soil bulk density, organic matter content, and soil organic carbon density—derived from feldspar marker horizons. These data were sampled concurrently with airborne campaigns conducted in April and August 2021 to coincide with the early- and peak-biomass season conditions. While vegetation metrics explained a limited fraction of variability in total vertical accretion, AGC, AGN, and BGC together accounted for a substantial portion of the variance in soil bulk density and organic carbon density, indicating that vegetation-driven organic matter inputs exert a stronger control on soil mass and carbon storage than on short-term elevation gain. These results demonstrate that airborne imaging spectroscopy can resolve distinct vegetation pools that differentially influence wetland soil properties, providing new insight into the coupled vegetation–soil processes underpinning blue carbon dynamics. This highlights imaging spectroscopy's value for advancing landscape-scale assessments of wetland resilience and informing management strategies in sediment-deprived coastal basins."

 Estuarine fronts represent critical submesoscale oceanographic phenomena that govern material transport, pollutant dispersion, and ecosystem dynamics in coastal environments. In this study, we developed a comprehensive remote sensing framework for monitoring suspended sediment fronts and plume fronts in the Yangtze River Estuary–Hangzhou Bay transition zone, a region of exceptional ecological and economic significance. Leveraging the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, we developed an integrated multi-algorithm approach that combines spectral index enhancement, automated thresholding, clustering analysis, and edge detection techniques for high-precision front feature extraction from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery spanning 2013–2024. Validation against high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle imagery yielded root mean square errors (RMSE) of 7.3–13.4 m and discrete Fréchet distances of 23.5–29.6 m, confirming robust algorithmic performance with decameter-level accuracy suitable for submesoscale front detection. Our analysis revealed the occurrence of pronounced spatiotemporal variability in front distributions: suspended sediment fronts exhibit distinct seasonal patterns with nearshore concentration (0–2 km) and peak occurrence around Nanhui Shoal, while plume fronts demonstrate greater offshore extension (2–5 km). Mechanistic analysis revealed that tidal forcing is the primary factor controlling the front dynamics, with suspended sediment fronts favoring neap tide conditions and plume fronts peaking during spring tide floods. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of estuarine front dynamics and provide quantitative frameworks for coastal environmental management and sustainable development strategies."

 Rapid urbanization necessitates accurate 3D building data for effective urban planning and analysis. Building height provides critical vertical information reflecting urban morphology, land use intensity, and energy demand. However, high-resolution large-scale 3D datasets remain limited, particularly in the Global South, due to the high cost and complexity of traditional methods. Although machine learning approaches have been widely explored, they often underperform in dense urban areas and tend to underestimate tall buildings due to limited training data and generalizability. In this study, we propose a novel framework for large-scale building height estimation using only free remote sensing data. Leveraging 0.5 m resolution open-access satellite imagery and ICESat-2 photons, we construct an accurate parallel projection model for each image. It enables the generation of dense height points via triangulation across image pairs without additional geometric parameters. The height points are then integrated with 2D building footprints to reconstruct building height maps. Validation results of the full urban area in Nairobi, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.338 m, demonstrated the feasibility of our framework. The method also exhibits strong temporal consistency, with a maximum mean deviation of only 1.93 m across multi-temporal height maps. Experiment results in the three additional Global South cities (Medellín, Salvador and Jakarta), achieving mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.867 m, 3.642 m, and 2.484 m, respectively, further confirmed the transferability of our framework. These results highlight our framework’s capability to deliver low-cost, accurate, and high-resolution 3D urban reconstruction, particularly in resource-constrained cities, providing a scalable tool for urban analysis, planning, and policy support."

 The steep eastern slope of the Tibetan Plateau (ESTP) is a key area for the construction of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway. Understanding the diurnal variation of summer precipitation is essential for both construction and operational safety. Using hourly CLDAS-V2.0 precipitation data from the National Meteorological Information Center for 2016–2021, this study examines the diurnal characteristics of summer precipitation over the steep ESTP. In combination with circulation classification, the underlying causes of this diurnal variation are also investigated from the perspective of regional precipitation events (RPEs). Results reveal a pronounced unimodal diurnal variation of precipitation over the steep ESTP, with a marked east–west contrast across 102°E in peak timing. The peak occurs near 18 local solar time (LST) in the western region (west of 102°E), whereas it shifts to around 23 LST in the eastern region (east of 102°E). The eastward RPEs, characterized by a west–east migration of the precipitation center, dominate the east–west peak-timing difference. Eastward RPEs can be further classified into two circulation types: a trough-dominated type (about 70%) and a western Pacific subtropical high type (about 30%). The east–west difference in precipitation peak timing arises from the temporal offset between moisture convergence and ascent, with anomalous ascent dominating under the trough regime and anomalous moisture convergence dominating under the subtropical high regime. These findings enhance understanding of diurnal precipitation over complex terrain and offer implications for hydrological risk assessment and railway planning."

 Coastal regions of India are characterized by rapidly evolving convective systems driven by complex land–sea interactions and orography, often producing high rainfall and intense thunderstorms. This study provides the first multi-region evaluation of three double-moment microphysics schemes (Thompson, Morrison, and WDM6) for pre-monsoon convective rainfall over distinct coastal climatic zones of India: Kerala, Odisha, and West Bengal. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, 45 simulations were performed for 15 rainfall events (2012–2024), with model outputs validated against multi-satellite observations (Kalpana, INSAT-3D, GPM) and ERA5 reanalysis. The assessment combined rainfall intensity, cloud-top evolution, vertically integrated moisture convergence (VIMC), and a group of thermodynamic stability indices (K Index, KI; Humidity Index, HI; Total Precipitable Water, TPW; and Total Totals Index, TTI), with detailed diagnostics for three recent high-impact events per region. Results reveal notable regional differences in scheme performance: Thompson shows optimal over Kerala (correlation: 0.70–0.76), Morrison over Odisha (0.67–0.78), and WDM6 over West Bengal (0.61–0.68). Beyond these local optima, WDM6 most consistently reproduces the observed regional differences in rainfall and convective parameters, while Morrison shows comparable rainfall skill but systematically overestimates instability. These findings highlight the critical need for region-specific microphysics tuning in convective rainfall forecasting, particularly in topographically complex coastal environments."

 Ongoing global climate change has yielded a myriad of catastrophic weather hazards, including extreme heat, drought, and severe fire weather conditions across global dryland environments. A massive wildfire ignited across the Texas Panhandle between 27 and 28 Feb 2024 (i.e., Smokehouse Creek Fire, the second largest wildfire in the US history), which consumed over 1,000,000 ha of land and resulted in an overall loss of greater than >$1 billion. Understanding aerosol mixing processes and the associated kinematics near the surface and within the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) during such wildfire events is crucial for various applications, including predicting and monitoring environmental air quality (AQ), weather forecasting and transport and dispersion modeling. This study provides, for the first time, an empirical evidence of how a nocturnal cold front amplified the wildfire impact on AQ at a site located 250 km downwind of the second largest US wildfire, yielding hazardous concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5–250 μg m−3). Using a combination of lidar-derived aerosol backscatter, vertical velocity and horizontal wind profiles, 10 m-tower observations of meteorological parameters, radiosonde-derived thermodynamics, and near-surface PM2.5 measurements, our analyses revealed that narrow and intense updrafts (i.e., vertical velocity of up to 5–10 m s−1) along the leading edge of a nocturnal cold front triggered the entrainment of an elevated smoke plume (∼1500-2000 m above ground) down to the surface via broader and weaker downdrafts (−0.5 to −2.0 m s−1). This helped explain the transport and vertical mixing pathway of the wildfire plume near ground and aloft. Results reported enhance our understanding of NBL processes and provide critical insights for improving AQ forecasting and validating aerosol transport in dispersion models."

Mahajan;Becky Alexander,Aerosol iodine recycling is a major control on tropospheric reactive iodine abundance,"Global chemical transport models previously treated aerosols as a sink for reactive iodine (Iy); however, aerosol iodide is also a source of Iy via heterogeneous reactions involving hypohalous acids and halogen nitrates. We implemented this chemistry into GEOS-Chem, in addition to explicitly representing three aerosol iodine types: soluble organic iodine (SOI), iodide, and iodate. We found that aerosol recycling of iodide to form Iy is more than twice as fast as the other Iy sources combined. 
 Tropospheric reactive iodine influences the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere and serves as an important source of ultra-fine particles.  However, the paucity of observations of gas-phase and aerosol iodine, combined with incomplete understanding and representation of iodine chemistry in models, leads to substantial uncertainties in understanding iodine abundance, speciation, and impacts. Motivated by known gaps in previous modeling studies, we introduced speciated aerosol iodine and aerosol iodide recycling to the global chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem.  Modeled aerosol iodine is speciated into fine and coarse mode soluble organic iodine (SOI), iodate, and iodide. Aerosol iodide is recycled into the gas phase via heterogeneous chemistry involving halogen nitrates and hypohalous acids to form I2, ICl, and IBr, which represents an additional source of gas-phase iodine to the atmosphere. Iodide dehalogenation doubles the tropospheric burden of reactive iodine (Iy) while reducing model-measurement bias for IO and aerosol iodine. The rate of aerosol iodine conversion to Iy is more than twice as fast as the combined rates of inorganic ocean emissions and the photolysis of organic iodine gases, suggesting that aerosols are important in mediating the abundance and lifetime of tropospheric Iy. The incorporation of SOI and iodate into the model prevents iodide dehalogenation by partitioning iodide into less reactive reservoirs, which has a stabilizing effect for reactive iodine chemistry. These findings have implications for reactive halogen abundances and global oxidant budgets in the troposphere."

We also discovered that humidity, acidity, inorganic sulfate and Ox mass concentrations play key roles in the formation of Aliphatic OSs. These findings improve our understanding of how air pollution forms in urban environments and are crucial for developing effective environmental policies. 
 Organosulfates (OSs) are important components of organic aerosols, which serve as critical tracers of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). However, molecular composition, the relationship between OSs and their precursors, and formation driving factors of OSs at different atmospheric conditions have not been fully constrained. In this work, we integrated OS molecular composition, precursor-constrained positive matrix factorization (PMF) source apportionment, and OS-precursor correlation analysis to classify OS detected from PM2.5 samples according to their volatile organic compounds (VOCs) precursors collected from three different cities (Beijing, Taiyuan, and Changsha) in China. This new approach enables the accurate classification of OSs from molecular perspective. Compared with conventional classification methods, we found the mass fraction of Aliphatic OSs (including nitrooxy OSs; NOSs) increased by 22.0 %, 17.8 %, and 10.3 % in Beijing, Taiyuan, and Changsha, respectively, highlighting the underestimation of Aliphatic OSs in urban regions. The formation driving factors of Aliphatic OSs during the field campaign were further investigated. We found that elevated aerosol liquid water content promoted the formation of Aliphatic OSs only when aerosols transition from non-liquid state to liquid state. In addition, enhanced inorganic sulfate mass concentrations, and Ox (Ox= NO2+ O3) concentrations, as well as decreased aerosol pH commonly facilitated the formation of Aliphatic OSs. These results reveal a significant underestimation of OSs derived from anthropogenic emissions in wintertime, particularly Aliphatic OSs, highlighting the need for a deeper understanding of SOA formation and composition in urban environments."

Climate model predictions suggest that the Arctic Ocean will become ice-free sometime between 2030 and 2050. The research presented here increases our knowledge of how aerosols, clouds and surface properties contribute to warming and the melting of sea ice in the Arctic. 
 Clouds have a major impact on rapidly decreasing sea ice in the Arctic, yet much is still unknown how cloud microphysics influences cloud development. In situ and remote data were collected by the NASA P-3 and SPEC Inc. Learjet research aircraft in Arctic stratiform boundary-layer clouds over the oceans and sea ice bordering northern Greenland between 25 May and 15 August 2024 during the ARCSIX project. Both aircraft carried a suite of nearly identical state-of-the-art microphysical sensors. Additionally, the P-3 was equipped with aerosol and remote-sensing instrumentation and the Learjet was equipped with a zenith/nadir Ka-band radar. The length of clouds examined remotely and in-situ by the two aircraft totaled 12 417 km, with 6966 km of in-situ measurements. Mixed-phase clouds were sampled during 60.5 % of time in cloud, and all-liquid clouds were measured 39.5 % of the time. Cloud-top temperatures were ≥-9 °C during 90 % of the stratiform boundary-layer cloud investigations. Single-layer mixed-phase clouds sampled with cloud-top temperatures ≥-4 °C often contained concentrations of ice particles more than five orders of magnitude higher than measured concentrations of ice-nucleating particles. Despite the high ice concentrations, microphysical conditions supporting secondary ice production were seldom present. In contrast, in some clouds where environmental conditions met commonly accepted criteria for secondary ice production, ice particle concentrations were closer to what is expected from primary nucleation. The quality of measurements was unprecedented, but results from our preliminary analysis raise more questions about primary and secondary nucleation mechanisms than they answer."

FEDS uses a state-of-the-art gas analyser linked to many sampling locations. Controlled amounts of methane were released to test the accuracy of the FEDS system. Results were promising even when using different models to estimate the amount of methane released. Results were better when the wind was consistent. FEDS could be used for measuring emissions over many months. 
 The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has developed and trialled a mobile and remotely-operated Fugitive Emission Distributed Sampling (FEDS) system for continuous measurements of emissions at the facility spatial scale. FEDS is capable of both locating and quantifying emission sources over long-term periods and has been deployed at sites around the UK to monitor methane emissions from the natural gas network, landfill, and waste treatment. This work presents assessment activities using a controlled release facility (CRF) to test the performance of the measurement system and two reverse dispersion models (Airviro and WindTrax) for emission quantification. The CRF was used to simulate a simple single-point methane emission source with constant release rate of 1 kg h−1 over four separate experiments. Emissions were quantified using prior knowledge of release timings as well as in the absence of this knowledge. High variability in wind direction was shown to negatively impact emission quantification accuracy (especially for Airviro). Emission results were improved by removing periods of high wind variability (low wind persistence) from analysis. Both models performed better when using daily-averaging periods for emissions (Airviro RMSE = 0.37 kg h−1 (37 % relative); WindTrax = 0.29 kg h−1 (29 %)) over shorter averaging periods, such as hourly data (Airviro RMSE = 0.77 kg h−1 (77 %); WindTrax = 2.19 kg h−1 (219 %)). Estimated emission rates were shown to be sensitive to the specified source release height for both models, with discrepancies in model release height relative to the true release height of more than 0.5 m yielding less accurate results."

The cutoffs were determined at several ambient and internal pressures and sample flows. During the first aircraft campaign TPEx we were able to identify possible new particle formation events. 
 Field measurements of aerosol number concentration and aerosol size distribution in the upper troposphere and lowermost stratosphere (UTLS) are crucial for understanding the influence of processes such as new particle formation (NPF) on aerosol budgets, cloud formation and climate. In this study, we present the multi-channel Condensation Particle Counter (mc-CPC) that was designed and set up for airborne measurements and tested during the TPEx campaign onboard a Learjet in 2024. The instrument uses FC-43 (C12F27N) as the working fluid and consists of three individual commercial CPCs (Grimm SKY-CPC), a pressure regulation system and a common inlet. By varying the temperature difference (ΔT) between each pair of saturator and condenser, the cutoff diameter (d50) of each CPC can be adjusted. For the cases presented here, we typically operated two of the CPCs at a ΔT of 36 °C for a direct comparison while the third CPC was set to a ΔT of 15 °C. Two independent calibration setups were used to determine the cutoff and size-dependent counting efficiency of the mc-CPC at various internal and external CPC pressure levels. The experiments in the laboratory showed that the cutoffs of the individual channels were rather independent of the external pressure pexternal and only slightly dependent on the internal CPC pressure pCPC, at least for a pCPC range between 200–350 hPa. A large fraction of flights during TPEx were conducted at an internal pressure of 250 hPa, and therefore the cutoff determined at 250 hPa was used as a fixed value for all internal pressures. For channel 1 and 2 that were operated at the same ΔT, this gave a d50 of 11.3 (±0.7) nm and 12.3 (±0.7) nm, respectively. Channel 3 was set to ΔT = 15 °C and a cutoff diameter of 14.9 (±0.9) nm was determined. In an internal pressure range between 200 and 400 hPa the cutoffs decreased slightly with increasing pCPC. Furthermore, our measurements also indicate that the cutoffs are not influenced by varying sample flows. The mc-CPC was operated for the first time on an aircraft during the TPEx campaign (TropoPause composition gradients and mixing Experiment) in June 2024. We present the first measurements of one research flight and discuss the uncertainties of the collected aerosol data."

The transfer-trained model shows superior performances compared to conventional algorithms and non-transfer trained mode. The model predicted more reliable diurnal behaviors, with daily amplitude and peak timing approaching radiosonde results. 
 Diurnal variations in planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) is highly linked to weather, climate, and environmental processes. However, remaining challenges persist in estimating its diurnal behavior at a large scale due to insufficient observations and limitations of operational retrieval algorithms. This study proposed a deep learning framework based on an attention-augmented residual neural network to estimate diurnal variations in near-global PBLH, incorporating profiles from an non-sun-synchronous lidar (Cloud-Aerosol Transport System: CATS) and meteorological fields. The framework can largely address the issue of multi-layer structures in space-borne lidar signals, significantly improving the accuracy of PBLH retrieval during morning and evening (with accuracy improvement approach 30 % compared to traditional algorithm). Due to insufficient observations aligned with CATS orbits, a pre-train model was firstly trained using pseudo-labels from reanalysis, and then was transferred to observation-based target labels. The transfer model demonstrates superior performance in most regions and periods, outperforming classical algorithm in capturing PBLH magnitude and its diurnal variations. Further assessments over different land covers show that the transfer model estimated PBLH and diurnal patterns were highly consistent with those from radiosondes, surpassing reanalysis outputs. For model capability, wavelet covariance transformation derived potential PBLH and temperature profiles emerged as dominant factors, with contributions exhibiting diurnal patterns. Overall, this work proposes a novel framework for large-scale PBLH estimation and provides insights for improving retrieval algorithms, particularly through integrating remote sensing and machine learning."

Kelly,Correction of PM2.5 underestimation in low-cost sensors under elevated dust loading using only sensor measurements,"We improved the accuracy of low-cost particulate matter sensor (PMS5003/6003) measurements under dust-dominated conditions common in arid regions. By applying sensor-specific particle mass ratios and a relative humidity cutoff, dust-influenced measurements were identified and PM2.5 concentrations corrected, reducing bias by ~ 50 % relative to regulatory monitors. This method enables real-time PM2.5 correction where reference data are unavailable. 
 The Plantower PMS5003/6003 sensor is widely used for low-cost monitoring of particulate matter (PM), but it substantially underestimates PM2.5 and PM10 during periods of elevated dust loading, when the particle size distribution is dominated by particles > 1 µm in diameter. This limitation is especially critical in the arid regions, such as the western United States, where windblown dust frequently degrades air quality, visibility, and public health. Accurate estimation of PM2.5 and PM10 concentrations during periods dominated by dust typically relies on federal reference or equivalent methods (FRM/FEM), but these resources have limited spatial resolution. This study investigates whether PMS5003/6003 measurements alone can be used to detect and to bias correct for these dust-dominant PM conditions. We analyzed measurements from 109 PMS sensors collocated or near 75 U.S. EPA monitoring sites with hourly FEM PM2.5 and/or PM10 between January 2017 to May 2025. Two cutoff thresholds (threshold1 and threshold2) were developed using relative humidity and the sensor-reported ratio of coarse (2.5–10 µm) to submicron (0.3–1 µm) mass concentration to identify potential periods dominated by dust when the PMS sensor underestimated PM2.5 concentration. The thresholds can be used in real time, relying on the preceding 336 hourly measurements (consistent with PurpleAir's public archive display). To improve PM2.5 estimates from the PMS sensor (pm2.5_alt, a common correction for Plantower PMS measurements reported by PurpleAir), this study used pm2.5_alt measurements identified as potential dust-dominated periods to develop a correction factor through non-linear regression. This correction reduced the mean bias error between PMS PM2.5 estimates (pm2.5_alt) and FEM PM2.5 by approximately 50 % for 97 sensors, and reduced the root mean square error by approximately 30 % for 84 sensors. This framework enhances the utility of PMS5003/6003 measurements during periods of elevated dust loading, extending monitoring capabilities in regions where regulatory coverage is limited."

Mackay;Natalia Piotrowska;Maarten Blaauw,A complete database of AMS radiocarbon estimates from Lake Baikal sediment cores with a lake-wide assessment of TOC age offsets,"Lake sediment cores are records of ancient climate change. Radiocarbon dates provide the records a timeframe. We present a database of radiocarbon data from Lake Baikal sediment cores to aid re-use of this data, and evaluate a key correction required to use radiocarbon data. Previous studies used corrections of 380–2100 years with an uncertainty of 90 years at most. Our results (1610 ± 760 years) highlight that age offset uncertainty has been underestimated and better estimators are needed. 
 We present a database of AMS radiocarbon dates from Lake Baikal sediment cores, encompassing 51 cores and 518 dates, providing a complete record from literature spanning 1992 to 2025 (with transcription errors corrected) and including 22 previously unpublished dates from cores CON01-603-5 and CON01-605-5. The dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.973799 (Newall et al., 2025). The most common material used for radiocarbon dating in our dataset is total organic carbon (TOC). Unfortunately, the interpretation of TOC ages in lake sediments is hindered by issues such as the reservoir effect, in situ contamination by old organic carbon, and/or the hardwater effect. These issues may culminate in age estimates thousands of years older than the true depositional age of that sediment, which we term the “age offset”. Linear regression of uncalibrated radiocarbon dates has previously been used to estimate the age offset in Lake Baikal, with results ranging from 0 to 1.5 14C kyr in different cores. Estimates from other methods have returned estimates of approximately 2 14C kyr. Despite this, most previous studies have not incorporated age offset uncertainty in their age depth modelling, or have included uncertainty of, at most, ±0.09 14C kyr. Furthermore, the varying age offset estimates have been interpreted by some as evidence that different regions of Lake Baikal have different age offsets, with implications as to the cause of the age offsets. We apply the linear regression age offset method to all suitable cores in our database, returning 21 estimates of age offset from throughout the lake. Our results return a lake-wide TOC radiocarbon age offset of 1.62 ± 0.76 14C kyr, suggesting previous studies in Lake Baikal have significantly underestimated the temporal uncertainty of radiocarbon ages from TOC. Furthermore, we find no statistically significant evidence for a systematic difference in age offset in different regions of Lake Baikal (specifically Academician Ridge and Buguldeika Saddle). Finally, our results are a caution that linear regression-based age offset estimates in lake sediments have a large uncertainty that might only be observable with multiple datasets."

Collected at three sites in French Guiana, Gabon, and Malaysia, these datasets are crucial for calibrating and validating earth observation-derived forest biomass estimates, therefore, expanding and enhancing their use, and aiding global conservation efforts. 
 The ForestScan project was conceived to evaluate new technologies for characterising forest structure and biomass at Forest Biomass Reference Measurement Sites (FBRMS). It is closely aligned with other international initiatives, particularly the Committee on Earth Observation Satellites (CEOS) Working Group on Calibration and Validation (WGCV) aboveground biomass (AGB) cal/val protocols, and is part of GEO-TREES, an international consortium dedicated to establishing a global network of Forest Biomass Reference Measurement Sites (FBRMS) to support EO and encourage investment in relevant field-based observations and science. ForestScan is the first demonstration of what can be achieved more broadly under GEO-TREES, which would significantly expand and enhance the use of EO-derived AGB estimates.We present data from the ForestScan project, a unique multiscale dataset of tropical forest three-dimensional (3D) structural measurements, including terrestrial laser scanning (TLS), unpiloted aerial vehicle laser scanning (UAV-LS), airborne laser scanning (ALS), and in-situ tree census and ancillary data.

This study innovatively generated hourly, angular-normalized, all-weather, high-resolution (0.01°) LST data from 2018 to 2023 using FY-4A official data, which support better LST-related studies of earth system science. 
 Land surface temperature (LST) is an essential climate variable in geophysical, ecological, and environmental researches. Remote sensing provides a unique observation approach for obtaining large-scale LST products. However, current official LST datasets (such as FY-4A) are limited by the unaddressed thermal radiation directionality effect, and suffer the spatial discontinuities due to the pervasive presence of clouds. What’s more, the geostationary LST products have relatively coarser resolution than those of polar-orbiting satellites due to trade-off between spatial and temporal resolutions. Based on the official hourly FY-4A LST dataset, this study proposes a novel framework for generating angular-normalized, cloud-filled, and 0.01°-downscaled LST (ANCFDS-LST) product, encompassing directional (Tdir), nadir (Tnadir), and hemispherical (Themi) LST layers. First, the angular-normalized Tnadir and Themi were generated using a time-evolving kernel driven model (TEKDM) with the inputs of multi-temporal FY-4A Tdir. Subsequently, hypothetical clear-sky LST were predicted using a CatBoost model optimized via Bayesian methods. The cloudy-sky LST values were then derived through a cloud radiation force (CRF) correction. Finally, the 0.05° all-weather Tdir, Tnadir, and Themi values were downscaled to 0.01° resolution using an improved hybrid downscaling algorithm (IHDA) combining fusion and kernel-based methods. Taking the daytime clear-sky near-nadir VNP21A1 LST as reference, the 0.05° Tdir before angular-normalization has a root mean squared difference (RMSD) of 6.21 K and a mean bias difference (MBD) of -4.04 K, whereas the angularly normalized Tnadir has a much smaller RMSD of 3.48 K and a better MBD of -2.13 K. For the all-weather Themi, temperature-based validation over 15 sites in the Heihe River Basin and the Tibetan Plateau shows a root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean bias error (MBE) of 2.99 K and -0.77 K under clear-sky conditions, 4.56 K and -1.56 K under cloudy-sky conditions. After the spatial downscaling, the 0.01° all-weather Themi with abundant texture details exhibits an RMSE (MBE) of 3.99 K (-1.32 K) over 15 sites. The generated LST products from 2018 to 2023 over the FY-4A disk exhibit enhanced angular consistency, spatial continuity, and finer resolution, offering valuable support for subsequent LST-related applications.

The FCI samples the visible, near-infrared, and shortwave infrared spectral windows with a spatial resolution at nadir between 500 and 1000 m, and a 10 min temporal sampling interval. This configuration offers a potential for methane retrievals using multiband multipass retrieval (MBMP) methods, as shown with other multispectral missions. The potential of the MTG-FCI system for the detection and monitoring of single methane plumes is evaluated in this article through different approaches. End-to-end simulations using high-resolution WRF-LES methane plumes over Algeria showed that MTG-FCI can detect emissions as low as 30 t/h, where initial plume signals become visible, with a clearer detection above 50 t/h. Additionally, mass-balance modeling estimated a minimum detection limit of 20–30 t/h across the central MTG-FCI disk (GSD ≤ 1 km) under optimal conditions. We illustrate the use of the MTG-FCI for the monitoring and quantification of methane plumes using a real transient emission detection from a compressor station in Algeria (34.676° N, 6.191° E) on September 29, 2023, capturing its full evolution from 10:48 to 15:58 UTC. This event corresponded to an emission rate of 389 ± 81 t/h and a total methane release of ∼320 tons, with results broadly consistent with independent satellite estimates. These findings highlight MTG-FCI’s ability to track large transient methane plumes in near real-time, complementing polar-orbiting sensors."

Multiple radionuclides (210Pbex, 137Cs, 240Pu/239Pu) were used to establish an accurate age-depth model and show the occurrence of French nuclear weapon test fallout in this remote region for the first time. Environmental changes related to the retreat of the Cook Ice Cap since the 1960s were found to be one of the major factors dominating the dynamics of anthropogenic lead deposition flux in the fjord through the release of long-range transported legacy anthropogenic lead. The released legacy anthropogenic lead was likely transported across the proglacial Ampere Lake by a hypopycnal plume to the fjord. Backward trajectories and lead stable isotopic signatures suggest the southern part of South Africa as a major source of anthropogenic lead transported to the Kerguelen Archipelago. In contrast, contamination by arsenic, molybdenum, antimony, and POPs was found to be more recent (since 2001). Fractionation of rare earth elements was observed in the sediment due to the formation of proglacial Ampere Lake, which acts as a sediment trap."

By incorporating full conformer populations and three scaling parameters, we approximate the experimental infrared spectra more effectively, enhancing the reliability of our predictions. The optimization of vibrational frequencies and intensities for a diverse data set of 38 fluorinated compounds enables us to refine radiative efficiency calculations and seamlessly integrate them into our lifetime calculating protocol. We obtain theoretical global warming potential (GWP) values with well-defined error bars, offering a significant improvement over existing computational methods. This enhanced framework provides a powerful tool for assessing the climate effects of fluorinated compounds, aligning with the objectives of the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. By delivering robust and reliable GWP estimates, our methodology informs policy decisions on the phasedown of high-GWP hydrofluorocarbons and the search for sustainable alternatives.

In arid regions, gypsum dissolution is typically assumed to be the dominant sulfate source, but conventional sulfur and oxygen isotope systems (δ34S–SO42– and δ18O–SO42–) struggle to distinguish it from overlapping atmospheric and anthropogenic sources. Here, we apply the triple oxygen value (Δ′17O–SO42–) in the Yellow River Basin─characterized by widespread agriculture, abundant gypsum, and minimal atmospheric deposition─to resolve these ambiguities. We observe strongly negative Δ′17O–SO42– values (as low as −0.3‰) in upper basin waters during high-discharge periods, which we attribute to fertilizer-derived sulfate flushing from agricultural soils. These negative anomalies diminish downstream, where gypsum contributions become dominant. Isotopic modeling reveals that traditional approaches may overestimate gypsum inputs by up to 40%. Our results demonstrate that Δ′17O–SO42– is a powerful tracer of anthropogenic sulfate inputs in modern rivers. Moreover, its nonconservative behavior during transport challenges the assumption that negative Δ′17O values in paleo-sulfate archives strictly reflect contributions of atmospheric oxygen to sulfate."

In this study, the below-cloud scavenging of BC from biomass burning (BCbb) and fossil fuel combustion (BCff) was investigated, using year-round in situ measurements in Nanjing, China. A statistical approach was developed to quantify the source-specific mass absorption efficiency (MAE). Results showed that BCff was less susceptible to scavenging than BCbb, with wet scavenging ratios of 0.13 and 0.45, respectively. Additionally, BCff exhibited a stronger light-absorbing ability than BCbb, with MAE values of 8.0–12.0 and 3.4–8.0 m2 g–1 (25–75th percentiles), respectively. Consequently, the MAE of BC increased significantly with precipitation amount, driven by a combination of a rising BCff proportion, a higher intrinsic MAE of BCff, and enhancement of the MAE for both BC types due to high humidity. Neglecting the source-specific MAE could lead to substantial biases in the estimated direct radiative forcing, which can exceed 20% in regions with high BCbb contributions. This study strongly suggests that BCff and BCbb should be treated separately in models to improve the simulation of atmospheric loadings and climate impacts."

Mahajan,Quantifying the Contribution of Stubble Burning to Glyoxal over Northwest India,"Glyoxal (CHOCHO) is a short-lived oxygenated VOC formed by VOC oxidation and serves as a tracer of secondary photochemical pollution and a precursor to a secondary organic aerosol. We investigate the contribution of crop residue burning to CHOCHO concentrations over northwest India, particularly in the states of Punjab, Haryana, and Delhi, using observations from TROPOMI, VIIRS, and Sentinel-3 satellites. These data sets are used to study the temporal and spatial patterns of CHOCHO and the influence of crop residue burning on CHOCHO levels. HYSPLIT back-trajectory simulations revealed the potential transport of pollutants from stubble-burning areas to Delhi. Large seasonal variations in CHOCHO concentrations were observed, with the highest levels occurring during the postmonsoon months (October–November) as a result of agricultural stubble-burning activities. During peak crop residue burning months, the mean CHOCHO VCD over Punjab exceeded 6 × 1014 molecules cm–2, about 3 × 1014 molecules cm–2 higher than the nonburning baseline. Over Haryana, the mean CHOCHO VCDs reached >5 × 1014 molecules cm–2, about 2 × 1014 molecules cm–2 above baseline. Delhi consistently shows elevated CHOCHO levels across all seasons, but a clear signal of agricultural stubble burning is still observed. We estimate that CHOCHO emissions from agricultural stubble burning in Punjab and Haryana average 1.19 ± 0.91 Gg yr–1, with ≈96.6% of the regional total emitted from Punjab. The contribution of stubble burning to CHOCHO concentrations over Delhi was validated using ground-based AMS measurements at Delhi.

The severe drought–heat event of 2023, marked by record temperatures and hydrological stress, offers an opportunity to examine the vulnerability of Amazon carbon sink under extreme conditions. In this issue, Botía et al. (2026, https://doi.org/10.1029/2025AV001658) presents a comprehensive, multi‐constraint assessment of the impact of 2023 drought‐heat extremes on the Amazon carbon cycle. Their synthesis suggests that the Amazon acted as a weak net carbon source in 2023, primarily due to suppressed plant growth during the drought‐affected second half of the year. The study also reveals discrepancies between local flux measurements, basin‐scale inversions, and dynamical global vegetation model (DGVM) simulations, highlighting persistent challenges related to scale dependence, model structure, and representation of drought processes in DGVMs. Together, these findings underscore both the growing vulnerability of the Amazon carbon sink and the urgent need for sustained, integrated observing and modeling systems to constrain its response to future climate extremes."

We compiled a global database of in situ soil‐emitted N2O isotopes from chamber‐ or probe‐based studies to examine the spatiotemporal variability and environmental controls. Croplands showed the greatest variability, with mean δ15Nbulk, δ18O, and δ15NSP values of −15.0‰, 35.3‰, and 13.7‰; natural soils were slightly 15N‐enriched, consistent with less anthropogenic influence. Using the Time‐resolved Fractionation and Mixing Evaluation (TimeFRAME) model, we estimated bacterial denitrification as the major N2O source process (45%–63%) and found a mean N2O reduction potential of 43%. Global distribution of isotope signatures reflected the edaphic drivers including positive δ15NSP–pH and negative δ15Nbulk–moisture relationship. Overall, this global inventory provides empirically constrained isotopic end‐members for improved source–sink attribution, new insights into terrestrial N2O cycling, and a benchmark for model evaluation."

Nevertheless, superelevation has been studied primarily in the laboratory because field measurements are difficult to obtain. This study assesses whether the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite can detect superelevation in meander bends. Plots of lateral water‐surface slope (LWS) reveal distinct superelevation in three sets of Mississippi‐River bends. As expected, the magnitude and direction of LWS are strongly correlated with channel curvature. Superelevation can also be detected on comparatively narrow Wabash‐River bends, but levels of noise are more pronounced than for the Mississippi bends. Mean flow velocities estimated from LWS based on theoretical considerations agree closely with gauge‐based estimates (±7%–35%). These findings confirm that SWOT data can be used to reliably detect superelevation in large river bends, providing the basis for global assessments of hydrodynamics in large meandering rivers."

Validated against ground stations in China, RePPIC-Net achieves a Critical Success Index for Phase and Detection of 0.1574 (snowfall) and 0.3147 (rainfall) for 0.1-5 mm/h precipitation, outperforming 4-hour latency operational products’ respective scores of 0.1001 and 0.3064.

By incorporating K-means temporal clustering, GRUBA sequentially refines each SAT cluster according to its distinct decadal variability.

This substantial improvement arises in part from the attention mechanism, which effectively reduces model spread. Furthermore, SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) analysis reveals that GRUBA assigns higher weights to better-performing ensemble members."

 Aerosols act as ice nucleating particles (INPs) in mixed-phase clouds and cause uncertainties in climate prediction of the Arctic, which is warming faster than the global average. Primary biological aerosols (PBAs) are important INPs; however, their spatiotemporal variability, sources, and ice nucleation microphysics remain poorly understood. Here, we performed microscopic analysis, online and offline observations, and model simulations to investigate ambient aerosol particles related to INPs collected during the R/V Mirai Arctic cruise in 2022. We found that PBAs, particularly spores, were transported from terrestrial sources in Alaska and Canada to the Arctic Ocean and contributed to elevated INP concentrations. In addition, the ice-nucleating efficiency of PBAs was suppressed when fresh sea salt attached to or coated INPs. This study reveals an additional source of INPs over the Arctic Ocean, highlights the importance of alterations in INP mixing state during transport. These findings improve understanding of PBA contributions to Arctic cloud formation and their implications for climate feedbacks."

 Stromatolites record interactions of the biosphere, atmosphere, and hydrosphere. The evolution of C-fixation via diverse metabolisms is linked to metal availability for enzymes such as carbonic anhydrase. Stable Cd isotopes fractionation during uptake into carbonic anhydrase by modern phototrophs is readily recorded in authigenic carbonates. Here we test whether this proxy can be expanded to trace carbonic anhydrase in the microbial rock record.

We record fractionated Cd isotopic compositions correlating with macro and micro-nutrients P, Cd and Zn, suggesting enzymatic metal-cycling in the Paleoarchean. Meanwhile, Rayleigh-type Cd isotope fractionation indicates its use as a co-factor in carbonic anhydrase from the Meso- to Neoarchean onwards.

 Marine cloud brightening (MCB), a geoengineering strategy that increases the cloud albedo, is potentially able to reduce the impacts of global warming. We simulate an MCB strategy to offset the warming induced by anthropogenic aerosol reduction following the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 1-1.9 carbon-neutral scenario. Injecting sea salt aerosol into four cloudy regions in the eastern Pacific Ocean every year from 2020 to 2100 effectively restrains the future global-mean surface air temperature and precipitation change to the 2020 level. Aerosol-cloud interaction dominates the cooling in this MCB strategy. However, this strategy does not fully offset the warming in Europe, the United States, northeastern China and downwind offshore oceans, partly related to the acceleration of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation driven by the MCB-induced hemispherical asymmetric radiation gradients. Considering both the anthropogenic aerosol reductions and the MCB sea salt injection, some regions would face unintended climate change. Our study highlights the need for a more careful implementation strategy to produce both widespread cooling and fewer regional climate risks considering the effects are highly dependent on the strategy and seeding location.

However, its radiative efficacy–defined here as globally averaged radiative forcing per unit of sulfur injection rate (SIR)–remains highly uncertain in model simulations due to complex particle size evolution and large variability in aerosol representation. In this study, we employ a state-of-the-art, size-resolved (sectional) advanced particle microphysics (APM) module within two global models (CESM2 and GEOS-Chem) to investigate the evolution and efficacy of stratospheric sulfate aerosols from both SO2 and accumulation mode sulfuric acid (AM-H2SO4) injection. Our comparison of SAI radiative efficacy based on various global models including the two APM-based (14 models in total for SO2 and 9 models for AM-H2SO4) shows a large spread, with lower and higher end values differing by a factor of ∼2.5–3. Our APM-based results for SO2 SAI efficacy, including its diminishing returns with increasing SIR, fall at the upper end of the inter-model spread. For AM-H2SO4 SAI, the APM-based models show significantly higher efficacy–by ∼50% to 200%–at lower SIR (⩽5 Tg(S) yr−1), followed by a steeper decrease in efficacy as SIR increases. Notably, the APM-based global model simulations show that AM-H2SO4 injections consistently exhibit higher efficacy than SO2 injections, yielding ∼55%–75% greater radiative forcing per Tg(S) yr−1 due to more favorable particle size distributions. Global sulfate burden increase, effective particle sizes, and particle size distributions based on different models are compared and possible reasons leading to different SAI efficacy are discussed. The new SAI efficacy findings, if confirmed in further studies and model intercomparisons, could have important implications for climate intervention strategies, cost-benefit analyses, and risk assessments."

These wind farms function by harvesting a part of the wind energy that is itself the main driver of upper-ocean mixing and near-surface circulation. It remains unclear what the local and regional impacts of offshore wind farm deployment could be on marine environments. Here we consider potential effects from future wind farm developments in the Baltic Sea, in particular quantifying the impacts on energy exchange across the air–sea interface. We use plans for future wind farm coverage as a basis to calculate turbine-modified surface winds, and implement these altered wind fields as forcing for a three dimensional ocean (and sea ice) model of the entire Baltic Sea. We run ten years of simulations and examine the mean anomaly across the ten years relative to a corresponding set of model runs with unaltered winds, focusing on energy exchange terms and on the mixed layer depth. Based on an idealized mixed layer energy budget, we identify two routes by which the wake effect alters vertical mixing in the upper ocean—mechanical wind work and buoyancy forcing—and ultimately show substantial reductions to mixed layer depth in the close vicinity of wind turbines. Our model outputs show that, despite far-reaching instantaneous wind-wakes, the time-averaged changes in winds and in upper ocean response are mostly limited to areas within a 10 km radius of the nearest wind turbine. This result suggests that even moderate changes to wind farm placement may considerably alter the local impact on the marine environment, highlighting the important role of careful spatial planning in regulating wind farm deployment."

While such events are projected to intensify and become more frequent, gaps remain in understanding which agrometeorological hazards are most strongly associated with yield anomalies and crop failures. Here, we use data from 1981–2016 to assess statistical associations between different hazard indices and yields of five major cereals (maize, millet, sorghum, rice and wheat) across SSA, combining national, subnational and gridded datasets. Drought- and heat-related indicators emerge as the dominant correlates of negative yield anomalies, with vapor pressure deficit (VPD) showing a consistent negative association across crops and scales. Yield anomalies in years classified as crop failures are more strongly linked to these hazards than overall interannual variability, indicating that severe yield losses are especially sensitive to agrometeorological extremes. Using interpretable machine-learning methods for maize and rice, two key staple cereals in SSA, we show that failure-year yield anomalies in maize are more strongly associated with drought-related indicators, whereas rice failures are more sensitive to temperature-related factors alongside drought metrics. Projections using combined Earth system and ensemble output of crop models reveal that under the high-emissions SSP585 scenario, both maize and rice-planting areas will face significant increases in heat and drought hazards by mid-century. Maize-growing regions are projected to experience a 1.8 °C rise in maximum temperature and a 0.14 kPa increase in VPD, while rice-growing areas may see a 1.5 °C rise in maximum temperature, a 15% increase in days above 35 °C, and a 0.13 kPa rise in VPD. These projected changes underscore the need for targeted risk management, improved agronomic practices and robust early warning systems to enhance the resilience of SSA’s agricultural sector in a warming climate."

Forest harvesting fundamentally alters the physical structure and composition of forests, with consequences for climate regulation services. It can impact the land surface temperature (LST) both diurnally and seasonally, but the net LST impact of historical forest harvesting activities in Europe is as yet unknown. This study integrates satellite-derived data for LSTs and forest harvesting for the period 2004–2023 to unravel spatial and temporal patterns of the surface temperature response to harvesting disturbances in Europe. We find a consistent diurnal asymmetry: harvesting induces daytime warming alongside nighttime cooling across all seasons and forest types. However, the magnitude, net effect, and temporal evolution have strong heterogeneity. Regionally, daytime warming dominates in Southern Europe (+0.075 ± 0.007 °C, mean ± standard error; +0.719 °C at the 90th percentile), peaking in the summer (+0.103 ± 0.010 °C; +0.823 °C), while Eastern Europe shows the strongest annual nighttime cooling (−0.060 ± 0.005 °C; −0.937 °C). The response is weaker in Western Europe. Seasonally, net daily cooling prevails in the spring, whereas net warming dominates in the summer. The forest composition modulates the response: needleleaf forests show the strongest diurnal contrast, broadleaf forests exhibit the weakest daytime signal, and mixed forests display spring daytime cooling. After harvesting, most regions transition from initial postharvest warming toward longer-term cooling or neutrality after one or two decades, with the postharvest pattern varying regionally and by forest type. Overall, this study elucidates strong spatiotemporal variations in net microclimate responses to forest harvesting across Europe, driven by geography, seasonality, and forest composition. By explicitly characterizing how forest harvesting alters surface temperature across space and time, these findings contribute to improved region-specific forest management strategies that can better balance timber production with climate regulation and biodiversity conservation under changing environmental conditions."

Overall, reservoirs and their adjacent river reaches exhibit significantly greater variability (in standard deviation) than their natural counterparts across almost all SWOT observed (e.g. water surface elevation) and inferred (e.g. discharge) variables. Natural lakes show strong same-day correlations between inflow and outflow discharge (median Spearman R = 0.8), whereas 76% of reservoirs exhibit maximum correlation when outflow is lagged, suggesting operations buffer seasonal flow variability.

We observed planetary waves in a ground-based data set spanning more than 30 years. The waves can be assigned to expected waves due to their periods. The wave activity is strongest in winter for waves with periods longer than 20 days and shows maxima around equinoxes for periods below 20 d. The long-term behaviour shows a quasi-20 year oscillation of the wave activity with respect to the magnitude of the wave amplitudes. 
 We analysed more than 30 years (1988–2021) of OH*(3,1) rotational temperatures observed from Wuppertal, Germany, with respect to periodic fluctuations (2 to 60 d) using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. The main type of fluctuation observed in the last decades shows a period of about 28 d. Other periods which are frequently found in the observations lie in the period ranges around 2, 5 to 6, 8 to 12 d, and around 15 d and can likely be assigned to the quasi-2-day, the quasi-5-day, the quasi-10-day, and the quasi-16-day wave, respectively.The occurrence frequency of the waves is typically higher in winter time than in summer time because of the different wave filtering in summer and winter. This winter to summer difference holds for waves with longer periods, but it breaks off in the case of shorter periods below about 20 d. The occurrence frequency of these waves with periods below 20 d exhibit two smaller maxima around the equinoxes. A further division of these observations shows that waves with periods below 10 d account for the majority of observations in the month April to September. Waves with periods between 10 and 20 d are more equally observed throughout the year except for summer.The long-term behaviour of the wave activity indicates a quasi-bidecadal, which is likely driven by the amplitude of the waves."

The joint characterisation of ice particle size, shape, and optical response shows that these clouds reflect substantially more solar radiation than is typically represented in models. The observations provide an empirical basis for improving the physical realism of ice cloud optical properties in climate models. 
 Cirrus clouds play a critical role in the Earth's radiation budget, yet their shortwave optical properties remain poorly constrained. In particular, the short wave asymmetry parameter (g), which governs the angular distribution of scattered light, is particularly sensitive to ice crystal morphology, a property that varies widely in cirrus. To provide observational constraints on g and to investigate its relationship with ice microphysical properties, we analysed simultaneous in situ measurements of particle morphology and angular light scattering using the Particle Habit Imaging and Polar Scattering (PHIPS) probe. The measurements were obtained during the Cirrus in High Latitudes (CIRRUS-HL) campaign in June and July 2021, sampling both mid-latitude and Arctic cirrus across a range of cloud types and temperatures down to −63 °C. Across both regions, we found consistently low median asymmetry parameters, with a campaign-wide median of 0.738. The observed g values were largely insensitive to variations in temperature, humidity, and crystal aspect ratio, and showed only minor differences between ice habits. In contrast, a systematic decrease in g with increasing particle size was identified, median g ranging from 0.777 for sub-30 µm particles in mid-latitude cirrus to minimum values of 0.719 and 0.713 for 175 µm particles in mid-latitude and Arctic cirrus, respectively. The measured values are substantially lower than those commonly used in current radiative transfer schemes, suggesting that the shortwave warming effect of cirrus clouds may be overestimated in many climate models. These results provide improved observational constraints for the representation of ice cloud optical properties and support efforts to reduce uncertainties in cirrus cloud radiative forcing."

C. Prévost;Leighton A. Regayre;Jill S. Johnson;Doug McNeall;Sean Milton;Kenneth S. Carslaw,Detection of potential structural deficiencies in a global aerosol model using a perturbed parameter ensemble,"Climate models rely on uncertain adjustable parameters. We tested millions of combinations of these inputs to see how well the model matches real-world data. We found that no single set of inputs can match several observations at the same time, which suggests that the issue lies in the model itself. We developed a method to detect these conflicts and trace them back trace them to their source. The aim is to help modellers target improvements that reduce uncertainty in climate projections. 
 Understanding and reducing uncertainty in model-based estimates of aerosol radiative forcing is crucial for improving climate projections. A key challenge is that differences between model output and observations can stem from uncertainties in input parameters (parametric uncertainty) or from deficiencies in model code and configuration (structural uncertainty), and these two causes are difficult to distinguish. Structural deficiencies limit efforts to reduce parametric uncertainty through observational constraint because they prevent models from being simultaneously consistent with multiple observations. However, no framework exists to detect structural deficiencies and assess their impact on parametric uncertainty. We propose a workflow to identify structural inconsistencies between observational constraints and diagnose potential structural deficiencies. Using a perturbed parameter ensemble, we sample uncertainty in aerosols, clouds, and radiation in the UK Earth System Model (UKESM), and evaluate model bias against in-situ observations of sulfate aerosol, sulfur dioxide, aerosol optical depth, and particle number concentration across Europe. Applying observational constraints reveals inconsistencies that no combination of the perturbed parameters can resolve. For example, sulfate concentrations in different regions cannot be matched simultaneously, and enforcing a compromise between regions reduces skill across most variables. Additional examples include an inter-region inconsistency in SO2 and an inter-variable inconsistency between aerosol optical depth and sulfate. By examining the parameter sets retained by constraints, we trace inconsistencies to the parameterisations that may cause them and propose targeted changes to address the underlying deficiency. This approach offers a pathway for evidence-based model development that supports more robust uncertainty reduction and improves climate projection skill."

 The Yinchuan metropolitan area in northwest China, situated between the Tengger and Ulan Buh Deserts, is influenced by both natural dust and anthropogenic emissions. However, the evolution of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its interaction with ozone (O3) under the region's arid climate remain poorly understood. This study integrates decadal observations (2015–2025) with in-situ measurements using an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor and a Vocus Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry during summer 2025 to elucidate the changing PM2.5–O3 relationship and sources of organic aerosols. A pronounced shift was identified: Phase I (2015–2018) featured a rapid decline in PM2.5 accompanied by a sharp O3 increase, while Phase II (2019–2025) exhibited stabilized PM2.5 and plateaued O3, indicating reduced O3 sensitivity to particulate controls. The average non-refractory PM2.5 concentration (16.8 µg m−3) was significantly lower than in eastern Chinese megacities, with organics accounting for ∼ 60 %. Positive matrix factorization resolved three organic aerosol factors, revealing dominant secondary organic aerosols (SOA, ∼ 74 %) derived from prolonged photochemical aging. Volatile organic compound analysis showed that anthropogenic and biogenic precursors, including urban terpenes and aromatic oxidation products jointly contributed to SOA formation. Back-trajectory and potential source analyses indicated that Yinchuan's summer air masses were mainly locally recirculated, with limited influence from long-range transport. These results demonstrate a regional transition toward SOA-dominated fine particles and decoupled PM2.5–O3 dynamics under cleaner conditions, highlighting the need for integrated VOC and oxidant controls to mitigate co-occurring O3 and PM2.5 pollution in arid northwest China."

Krieger,Photochemical and ozone-induced aging significantly alter the viscosity of aqueous trans-aconitic  acid aerosol particles,"Organic aerosols undergo changes when exposed to oxidants like ozone or UV (ultraviolet) light. This study looks at how both aging processes affect particle properties, using trans-aconitic acid as a proxy for secondary organic aerosols. We found that exposure to UV light and ozone causes mass loss and changes viscosity significantly, up to 4 orders of magnitude. This suggests that aged particles may take much longer than untreated particles to equilibrate under dry conditions. 
 Aging processes of organic aerosols, including reactions with gas phase oxidants, such as ozone (O3), as well as photochemical reactions, can significantly alter their physicochemical properties. While previous research has examined how photochemical aging and ozonolysis affect the physicochemical properties of organic aerosols, our study investigates the combined effect of photolysis and ozonolysis. We use aqueous trans-aconitic acid as a proxy for secondary organic aerosol particles (SOA), selected for its ability to absorb UV light and for containing a C=C double bond that is susceptible to ozonolysis. We observe significant mass loss in single particles levitated in an electrodynamic balance when exposed to either O3 or UV light (375 nm), as well as to both aging processes simultaneously, resulting from fragmentation reactions followed by the volatilization of some of the products. Viscosity measurements at 17 % relative humidity revealed an increase of nearly 4 orders of magnitude after both UV exposure and combined UV and O3 exposure at 60 % mass loss. Interestingly, continued UV-aging beyond 60 % mass loss resulted in a viscosity decrease, whereas combined UV and O3 exposure led to a further viscosity increase. Hygroscopicity exhibited only a modest decline after 20 % mass loss during UV-aging and remained constant with further UV exposure; this reduction was less pronounced when UV-aging occurred in the presence of O3. Overall, our results indicate that the mixing times within accumulation mode SOA particles may increase from 4 s to 4 h after aging under dry boundary layer conditions."

To address this gap, we studied an extreme wind gust event in Beijing on 30 May 2024. We used seven radar wind profilers to track how this gust developed. It formed when cold northeasterly air clashed with warm southerly winds as the storm moved downhill. Evaporation of rain cooled the air, boosting downward air movement and wind strength. The turbulence transferring energy from small to large eddies intensify winds. 
 Extreme wind gusts pose substantial threats to human safety and infrastructure, yet inadequate pre-onset observational constraints result in large uncertainties and inaccuracies in nowcasting and forecast. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth investigation of a record-breaking surface gust event (wind speed > 35 m s−1) that occurred in Beijing during the early afternoon of 30 May 2024. We analyze the event's dynamical characteristics utilizing a high-resolution meteorological mesonet, which includes seven radar wind profilers (RWPs), a meteorological tower, automated weather stations, radar and satellite data. Multi-source observational analyses reveal that multicellular storm developed ahead of a convergence line, where northeasterly cold outflows collided with environmental southerly winds during their downhill propagation. Evaporative cooling drove the generation of extreme winds, reinforced by downward momentum transport and pressure gradient forcing. After reaching the plain, two convective segments subsequently merged into a well-organized squall system embedded with a midlevel mesovortex with intense rear-inflow jet. Low-level frontogenesis and shearing deformation provided favorable conditions for sustaining mesoscale convection, which in turn fueled small-scale turbulent energy processes. Turbulent inverse energy cascades – energy transfer from small to large eddies – intensified markedly as wind speeds increased. This study offers valuable insights into the multiscale dynamical processes governing convective evolution – captured by the RWP mesonet – that would otherwise remain inaccessible via other ways. Importantly, these findings support the validation of numerical simulation outputs, refinement of boundary-layer parameterization schemes in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and ultimately the enhancement of forecast skill for convection-associated extreme gust events."

Moyer,A systematic comparison of ACE-FTS δD retrievals with airborne in situ sampling,"Water molecules comes in several varieties, of which H216O is the most common. These varieties behave differently enough under freezing to create strong changes in the ratio of heavy to light water molecules. Here we compare observations of these ratios from satellites and high-altitude airborne instruments. These observations provide information about how air reaches the upper parts of the atmosphere, so it is important to reconcile difference between different modes of observations. 
 The isotopic composition of water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) can be used to understand and constrain the budget and pathways of water transport into that region of the atmosphere. Measurements of the water isotopic composition help further understanding of the region's chemistry, radiative budget, and the sublimation and growth of polar stratospheric clouds and high-altitude cirrus, both of which are also important to stratospheric chemistry and Earth's radiation budget. Here we present the first intercomparison of water isotopic composition (δD) using in situ measurements from the ChiWIS, Harvard ICOS, and Hoxotope instruments and satellite retrievals from ACE-FTS. The in situ data come from the AVE-WIIF, TC4, CR-AVE, StratoClim, and ACCLIP field campaigns, and satellite retrievals of isotopic composition are derived from the ACE-FTS v5.2 data set. We find that in all campaign intervals, satellite retrievals above about 14 km altitude are depleted by up to 150 ‰ with respect to in situ measurements. This difference persists even in transit flights through stratospheric air in high-latitude regions, which should be relatively free of observational biases present in other regions. We also use in situ measurements from the ChiWIS instrument, which has flown in both the Asian Summer Monsoon (AM) and the North American Monsoon (NAM), to confirm the isotopic enhancement in δD observed in satellite retrievals above the NAM."

Using advanced lidar and photometer techniques the study reveals that fine-mode aerosols dominate, with pollution-driven regimes and seasonal influences by dust, biomass burning, and marine sources highlighting the impact of regional pollution and long-range transport on local air quality. 
 A decade-long (2015–2024) analysis of aerosol properties was conducted at RADO (Romanian Atmospheric 3D Observatory)-Bucharest station in Romania, a key atmospheric observational site at the Eastern border of the Aerosol, Clouds and Trace gases Research Infrastructure (ACTRIS). This study aims to characterize the optical and microphysical properties of aerosols, classify predominant aerosol types, and investigate their seasonal variability and transport pathways based on long-term multiwavelength Raman lidar and sun/sky/lunar photometer measurements.Results indicate a dominance of fine-mode aerosols, with an average Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) of ∼ 0.2 and Ångström Exponent (AE) values between 1.5 and 2.0, highlighting pollution-driven aerosol regimes. Seasonal variations were observed, with continental aerosols prevailing in winter, dust transport peaking in spring (altitudes of 2–8 km), and biomass-burning aerosols increasing during summer.Analysis of 408 aerosol layers using the NATALI (Neural network Aerosol Typing Algorithm based on LIdar data) identified complex aerosol mixtures, with 63 high-resolution cases revealing a predominance of “dust polluted” and “continental smoke” types.In the lower troposphere, the extinction-related Ångström exponent shows a narrow mono-modal distribution with the peak at 0.9, indicating predominantly medium-sized particles, whereas in the high troposphere it becomes bi-modal, reflecting alternating occurrences of small and large particles.Lidar ratio values have a distribution peak at around 48–49 sr in both altitude regions, but their spread is much wider in the lower troposphere – revealing frequent layers of highly absorbing aerosols – while lofted layers in the high troposphere exhibit a narrower range typical of moderately absorbing particles. Distinct differences between fresh and aged biomass-burning aerosols (smoke) are identified through their altitude, depolarization, Ångström exponent, and lidar-ratio characteristics, demonstrating microphysical change during transport.FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model) retro-plume simulations provided insights into aerosol source regions and transport patterns showing contributions from local emissions, long-range transported desert dust, and biomass burning events from Europe and North America.These findings emphasize the persistent influence of regional pollution and transported aerosols on air quality and climate. The integration of ground-based remote sensing and advanced retrieval algorithms like NATALI provides a robust framework for aerosol characterization, enhancing climate models and air quality assessments."

Edwards,An intercomparison of aircraft sulfur dioxide measurements in clean and polluted marine environments,"Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a key precursor to aerosol formation, particularly in remote marine environments, ultimately affecting cloud properties and climate. Accurate quantification of atmospheric SO2 is therefore crucial. This work compares a custom-built laser-based instrument to two commercial SO2 analysers during measurements from a large research aircraft. Our results show that this custom-built system offers greater sensitivity at time resolutions required for aircraft measurements. 
 The University of York's laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) instrument for measuring sulfur dioxide (SO2) was compared to a commercial pulsed fluorescence (PF) analyser and iodide chemical ionisation mass spectrometer (I−CIMS) aboard the UK FAAM research aircraft in both remote and ship-polluted marine environments. In high SO2 concentration plumes, the LIF instrument and PF analyser compared well, but LIF was the only instrument capable of SO2 measurements in the remote marine boundary layer due to its campaign limit of detection (LoD, 3σ) of 0.07 ppb at 10 s compared with 0.4 ppb for the PF analyser. Quantification of SO2 using I−CIMS was challenging due to a significant interference, but good signal correlation with the other instruments was observed in polluted air masses. A comparison of response time was also made, for which the I−CIMS and LIF instrument proved much faster than the PF analyser with 3 e-folding times of 0.6, 2 and 17 s respectively. This work demonstrates the importance of sensitive instrumentation like the LIF system for quantifying low concentrations of SO2, such as over remote marine environments, at the time resolutions required for a fast moving platform. This is particularly relevant now as a result of more stringent sulfur emission regulations for shipping, and likely more so in the future as anthropogenic SO2 concentrations continue to decline."

This study established an N2O-saturated condition to evaluate the kinetics and mechanisms of 185-nm UV direct photolysis and defluorination of three PFAS subclasses: perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs; CnF2n+1–COOH, n = 1–9), perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs). PFCAs and PFECAs underwent significant direct photolysis, whereas PFSAs remain resistant. First-order direct photolysis rate constants strongly correlated with molar absorption coefficients (68–3396 M–1cm–1), exhibiting enhanced kinetics for longer-chain PFCAs (n > 7), PFECAs (n > 6), and multiether PFECAs. 185-nm quantum yields ranged from 0.12 to 0.28 mol/Einstein, resulting in 30–84% defluorination. Products analysis identified neutral gaseous transformation products (e.g., CnF2n+1H and CnF2n+2), indicating dominant C–C cleavage for PFCAs and combined C–O and C–C cleavage for PFECAs. Kinetic modeling revealed that the contribution of direct photolysis to overall PFAS degradation in 185-nm water photolysis increased with decreasing pH, accounting for 87% at pH 7 and 10% at pH 11, respectively. This study discovered the existence and extent of direct PFAS photolysis at 185 nm and provided mechanistic insights for future UV PFAS water treatment."

Relative abundances of aromatic compounds decreased from the river to the coastal ocean, whereas aliphatic compounds increased. NMR spectroscopic features, commonly associated with carbohydrates, are probably related to flavonoid- and lignin-derived structural motifs. These structural features were more readily detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy, whereas aromatics were more effectively detected by FT-ICR-MS. We tentatively identified polycyclic aromatic sulfur-containing compounds as being predominantly derived from urban areas, whereas sulfurized aliphatic compounds originated from sulfidic mangrove sediments. Surprisingly, while the number of DOM molecular formulas decreased along the river-to-coastal continuum, coastal marine DOM exhibited greater structural diversity than terrigenous DOM. Here, we showed that the interplay of distinct molecular pathways, particularly (photo)oxidation processes and sulfur incorporation, structurally diversifies DOM in coastal marine environments."

When applied in the Yellow River Estuary, this approach revealed key findings: Ecotoxicoproteomic analysis of sentinel species, crucian carp (Carassius auratus), identified membrane receptor integrin αvβ3 as a key biomarker linked to neurotoxicity-related AOs. An in vitro competitive binding assay revealed higher integrin αvβ3 binding activity in mainstream versus tributary samples. Comprehensive chemical analysis identified triethyl phosphate (TEP) as the primary causative toxicant, accounting for over 46% of integrin αvβ3 binding activity. In vivo studies confirmed that TEP induced dose-dependent neurodevelopmental toxicity and locomotor dysfunction in crucian carp, with a benchmark dose lower confidence limit of 120 ng/L, aligning with environmental concentrations of 87.52–328.84 ng/L in the mainstream. This study substantiates TEP as an emerging stressor that induces locomotor dysfunction in fish within the study area.

Catalytic elimination faces a big challenge in improving the fluorine resistance of the catalysts. Herein, a ZrO2-supported Ru single-atom and WOx cluster (Ru1–WOx/ZrO2) catalyst with Ru–O–Zr and W–O–Zr dual interfaces was prepared, featuring abundant oxygen vacancies and highly active Zr-WOx clusters, which collaboratively facilitated the activation of reactant molecules. Ru1–WOx/ZrO2 exhibited excellent catalytic activity (T90% = 434 °C at a space velocity of 20,000 mL g–1 h–1) and outstanding durability for the typical hydrofluorocarbon (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, HFC-134a) removal under humid conditions, which significantly outperformed most of the previously reported catalysts for HFC-134a removal. The atomically dispersed Ru1 optimized the electronic structure of Zr and achieved the rational regulation of ZrO2 crystal phase, thereby forming coordination-unstable Zr4+/Ruδ+ (0 < δ < 4) sites and three-dimensional distorted Zr-stabilized WOx clusters. The structure with abundant redox centers closely coupled with multiple acid centers facilitated the migration of fluorine and stimulated the interaction of water with the surface adsorbed or lattice oxygen species to generate highly reactive oxygen species.

Emerging evidence has associated individual exposure to particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter ≤ 2.5 μm (PM2.5) or ozone (O3) with GDM risk, but their synergistic effects and underlying metabolic mechanisms remain unclear. In this nested case-control study involving 90 matched GDM–control pairs, we employed high-resolution metabolomics to identify co-exposure- and GDM-related metabolic signatures across four exposure scenarios: low-PM2.5/low-O3, high-PM2.5/low-O3, low-PM2.5/high-O3, and high-PM2.5/high-O3. We found that PM2.5 and O3 co-exposure exerted synergistic effects on maternal metabolism. Dysregulated aspartate/asparagine and amino-sugar metabolism potentially bridge PM2.5–O3 co-exposure to GDM pathogenesis. High-dimensional mediation analysis revealed a meet-in-the-middle-derived factor that significantly mediated the co-exposure-GDM association (mediation proportion, 13.7%). Among 1945 metabolic features linked to PM2.5/O3 exposure and 271 correlated with GDM, 12 were confirmedly annotated. Incorporating these 12 metabolites into a classical risk factor-based receiver operating characteristic model increased area under the curve from 0.64 to 0.77 (p = 0.003). This study identifies PM2.5–O3 co-exposure as a controllable GDM risk factor, mechanistically linked to aspartate/asparagine and amino-sugar metabolic disruption.

Using validated, publicly available data, we computed the global distribution of populations with the highest indoor humid-heat risk and deprivation index and then employed the most widely adopted urban module of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to estimate the electricity and carbon dioxide required to provide equitable air-conditioning cooling to these groups. Our results indicate that India exhibits the highest combined indoor humid-heat risk and deprivation index, while the top ten countries are dominated by low-income nations in Africa. If these regions were to receive equitable access to air-conditioning cooling, they would consume 1,652 terawatt-hours of electricity and generate an additional 607 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2050. Achievable mitigation pathways include improving building-envelope performance and enhancing the cooling coefficient of performance (COP) of air-conditioning systems, challenges that demand new building materials and next-generation air-conditioning technologies for energy efficiency. Given that some of our data are static, our results entail a degree of uncertainty; they are credible at the order-of-magnitude scale, and fully precise projections will be refined once dynamic data become available in the future."

The study compared lightning and non‐lightning profiles, pre‐ and post‐convective profiles, and varying lightning flash rates. In total, 137,501 quality‐controlled measurements from 2006 to 2018 were used, along with 327 convective parameters. Their performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). The Lifted Index (LI) and its effective version (LI_eff) are the most robust predictors of lightning. Other useful parameters are CAPE in a hail growth zone (CAPE_HGL), cold cloud depth (Cold_layer), and equilibrium level temperature and height (EL_tmp, EL_hgt). 1–4 km relative humidity (RH_14 km) is important for thunderstorm development in warm environments, while in the cold season lightning is associated with stronger atmospheric flow.

This study applied a population balance method incorporating the transport (TR) effect to examine transport influence in three distinct regional (banana‐shaped) NPF events and one non‐regional NPF event in the Pearl River Delta region. In the non‐regional NPF event, particle changes due to transport closely align with observed particle concentration trends. In regional NPF events, the role of transport is also significant and cannot be overlooked. During the initial phase of NPF, transport exerts a positive effect, leading to an increase in particle concentration. However, as the boundary layer height increases, possible enhanced dilution led to a transition to a negative effect, resulting in particle loss. Ultimately, transport has a net positive effect in local new particle formation events, with the average contribution to particle concentration changes ranging from 47% to 68% across different cases. Incorporating the transport (TR) term reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) between simulated and observed particle number concentrations (NCN) by 28%–55% and increased the average coefficient of determination (R2) from 0.82 to 0.93 across the three cases. Moreover, including the TR term improved estimates of CCN concentration at 1.0% supersaturation (SS), though deviations persisted due to variations in background particle concentrations. Future studies should further investigate the size‐dependent influence of transport and its potential impact on CCN activation under lower SS to better constrain transport‐related processes in regional NPF events."

Their simulations suggest that dense phytoplankton at the surface would have created a greener ocean which may have prevented sunlight from reaching subsurface levels and contributed to reduced ocean productivity. 
 Geological records suggest that marine phytoplankton might have arisen in the Proterozoic while zooplankton remained absent, and marine productivity was not excessively low. However, quantitative estimates of phytoplankton biomass and net primary productivity remain elusive. Here, we use the Community Earth System Model version 1.2.2, modifying biological module and boundary conditions, to simulate marine biogeochemical cycles in the Proterozoic. The simulations demonstrate that, within the expected range of nutrient levels, phytoplankton at sea surface was more than 2 times denser than present, sustaining a greener ocean due to the absence of predators. Heavier surface chlorophyll in the Proterozoic would block sunlight from reaching subsurface layers. This so-called self-shielding effect would decrease subsurface net primary productivity significantly. Simulations show that, through the combined influence of low nitrate level under a low-oxygen environment, the absence of diatoms, and self-shielding, the Proterozoic net primary productivity was only approximately 60% and 30% of the present level in warm (almost ice-free) and cold (sea-ice reaches around 30°N/S) periods, respectively. These findings are subject to uncertainties in model framework and Proterozoic nutrients levels; a slightly less green ocean or more productive ocean was possible if the phosphorus level was much lower or higher than the present level. Here, the authors leverage the Earth system model CESM1.2.2 to simulate Proterozoic marine biogeochemical cycles.

 Jezero crater is located in Mars’ largest olivine-rich region, which is variously interpreted as lava flows, intrusive plutons, clastic sediments, or pyroclastics. In Jezero crater, several olivine-rich units have been investigated by the Perseverance rover, including an olivine cumulate in the crater floor (Séítah formation) and the enigmatic “Margin Unit”; an olivine- and carbonate-rich unit commonly interpreted as either a lake shore deposit or a local expression of the regional olivine-carbonate unit. We developed a method incorporating X-ray diffraction energy and spatial information to accurately determine the forsterite content (molar percentage of MgO/(MgO+FeOT)) of monocrystalline olivine encountered by Perseverance. Forsterite content in clastic sediments of the western Jezero fan indicate multiple olivine sources. In contrast, forsterite content analysed in the Margin Unit is similar to the Séítah formation, suggesting that at least some of the Margin Unit may represent an altered igneous cumulate with similar origins to the Séítah formation.

 Earth observations from satellites are the primary information source for Numerical Weather Prediction models. While some land surface variables, such as surface soil moisture, are assimilated to improve initial land conditions, the use of additional satellite-derived land surface and vegetation products remains limited partly due to systematic model biases. Here we examine the potential of satellite-derived land surface temperature and vegetation indicators to enhance near-surface temperature forecast skill. We build deep learning surrogate models for Numerical Weather Prediction using Long Short-Term Memory networks. Results show that including these satellite datasets improves temperature forecast skill globally across lead times from 1 to 12 days, with the largest improvements at 4-day lead time. Satellite-based predictors are the most relevant variables in about 60% of global grid cells. Among them, sun-induced fluorescence is the most important predictor, reflecting vegetation photosynthetic activity and its influence on surface energy partitioning and near-surface temperature.

 Whether drought-induced vegetation loss risk and ecosystem resilience in arid regions evolve synergistically or trade off remains unclear. Here, we project that medium-to-high risk areas in global drylands will expand by 9.9%–15.3% in the future. By developing a multi-model vegetation resilience trajectory diagnostic framework, we found that 57.4% of vegetated areas experienced declining resilience historically. In a low-emissions pathway, the fraction with declining resilience drops from 51.2% during 2015–2060 to 42.6% during 2061–2100, but rises to 64.8 ± 2.0% under medium- and high-emissions pathways. Rising risk is mainly driven by intensified atmospheric drought, while declining resilience results from weakened carbon dioxide fertilization and aggravated aridity. The centroids of high-risk and low-resilience regions will shift toward the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau in Asia and southward in South America; ecologically sensitive zones with high risk and decreasing resilience (32.0–50.1% of drylands) warrant precise prevention and management.

 Land use and cover changes (LULCC) have profoundly influenced global soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, yet SOC responses to LULCC are among the largest but least quantified uncertainties in estimating land carbon emissions. Here we comprehensively estimated the LULCC-induced SOC changes over the past century using data from three widely recognized model inter-comparison projects. A refined multi-dimensional diagnostic framework was employed to dissect the underlying processes governing SOC changes following LULCC. Results revealed notable discrepancies among models. Despite varying magnitudes, soil carbon residence time consistently contributed negatively to LULCC-induced SOC changes. Conversely, net primary productivity (NPP)-driven SOC changes emerged as the largest source of uncertainty, predominantly fueling SOC gains in some model ensembles but depletion in others. Our findings underscore the need to better constrain simulated NPP and soil turnover processes to improve the accuracy of LULCC-induced SOC change predictions, pivotal for advancing global carbon management and climate mitigation strategies.

 Tropical forests enhance regional rainfall but a robust analysis of this benefit is lacking. Consequently, the rainfall generating services of tropical forests are rarely accounted for in policymaking. We synthesised observational and model-based values of the reduction in rainfall due to tropical deforestation to quantify rainfall generation. Across these studies, we estimate that each meter squared of forest contributes 240 ± 60 L each year to regional rainfall. The Amazon forest has an even stronger rainfall benefit, with each meter squared of forest contributing 300 ± 110 L each year. Using a simple approach that assumes a constant water unit price, we estimate that Amazon forest rainfall generation is worth US$59.40 per hectare annually and the Brazilian Legal Amazon delivers rainfall generation worth US$20 ± 7 billion annually. Recognizing the economic value of tropical forests’ rainfall provision will unlock crucial investment and transform policy discussions on payments for forest protection.

 Microbes in hyper-arid and oligotrophic ecosystems like Antarctica rely on energy from atmospheric trace gas oxidation to support persistence, primary production, and carbon mitigation. Hydrocarbon contamination is common around Antarctic research stations, yet its implications for these critical ecological processes are unknown. Here, we examined the soil microbial communities of Bunger Hills, East Antarctica, including the impact of a 40-year-old legacy petroleum spill. Metagenomic analysis and gas chromatography revealed significant shifts in microbiome composition and function in contaminated soils, including severely reduced hydrogen oxidation rates, and higher (14CO2) carbon fixation rates. We reconstructed 300 microbial genomes across 16 prokaryotic phyla, describing 24 novel candidate species. Our results demonstrate the long-lasting effects of pollutants on polar microbial ecosystems, highlight the role of trace gas scavengers and hydrocarbon degraders in regulating key ecological functions, and advance our understanding of anthropogenic impacts on microbial nutrient and energy acquisition in dry desert environments.

 Oxygen minimum zones are large-scale subsurface oxygen-deficient layers experiencing rapid reconfiguration under climate change, partly driven by changes in ventilation whose mechanisms remain poorly understood. Along the eastern South Pacific oxygen minimum zone, a subsurface salinity maximum associated with equatorial subsurface water creates thermohaline gradients that trigger salt-finger instabilities across the lower oxycline. Here we show, using high-resolution microstructure, velocity, and oxygen observations, that these instabilities enhance diapycnal mixing and drive significant oxygen fluxes into the oxygen-deficient layer. While the upper oxycline is dominated by shear-driven turbulence, strong stratification suppresses vertical mixing, resulting in low diffusivities where sharp oxygen gradients are present, whereas salt fingering below yields high diffusivities where gradients are weaker, leading to comparable oxygen fluxes across both boundaries. The widespread occurrence of salt-finger-favorable conditions across the eastern South Pacific suggests that this mechanism plays a persistent and previously unrecognized role in the oxygen minimum zone ventilation.

 Atmospheric drought stress limits mangrove photosynthetic activity, and this constraint can be further amplified by high salinity, yet their combined global effects remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated multi-source Earth observation and geoinformation datasets, including Sentinel-2 red-edge position (a proxy for canopy photosynthetic activity), vapor pressure deficit from TerraClimate, seawater salinity from Copernicus reanalysis, to investigate how salinity regulates the sensitivity of mangrove photosynthesis to atmospheric drought stress during 2019–2023. Datasets were harmonized and analyzed through reproducible geoinformation workflows at 10 m–0.5° resolutions, enabling large-scale coupling analyses between remote sensing proxies and climate drivers. We found that drought stress constrained mangrove photosynthetic activity worldwide, with stronger limitations in tropical savannahs than in tropical rainforests. Marine mangroves exposed to persistent high salinity were more sensitive than estuarine mangroves influenced by freshwater inflow. These results reveal a global pattern in which salinity amplifies atmospheric water constraints on mangrove photosynthesis. Mangroves in dry climates and high-salinity habitats are therefore most vulnerable to future warming and drying. Our findings confirm that integrating multi-source satellite observations with geoinformation analysis provides an effective, large-scale approach for assessing vegetation vulnerability and identifying conservation priorities in climate-sensitive mangrove ecosystems."

 Solar radiation is a fundamental driver of ecological and climatic processes, with downward surface solar radiation (DSSR), ultraviolet radiation (UVR), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) exerting distinct influences on energy systems, human health, atmospheric environment, and ecosystem dynamics. However, high-resolution radiation data remain scarce due to the complexity and cost of nationwide observations. In this study, an advanced Transformer-based deep learning model (FT-Transformer) was developed based on multi-source data (e.g., ground observations, reanalysis data, and satellite products) to generate hourly 0.1° resolution datasets of DSSR, UVR, and PAR in China from 2005 to 2023, which achieved high accuracy with R2 values of 0.78–0.83, 0.87–0.89, and 0.96–0.98 at hourly, daily, and monthly levels, respectively. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to provide interpretability of model estimations. These products are more reliable and accurate through independent validation against ground-based observations and comparisons with widely used products (e.g., CERES, CAMS, and ERA5). Spatiotemporal analyses of the reconstructed datasets indicate that DSSR and UVR exhibit significant increases across most regions after 2013 primarily driven by reductions in aerosol pollution, whereas PAR shows an overall declining tendency with pronounced regional contrasts. Attribution analysis suggests that interannual variations in aerosol loading and cloud cover explain a substantial fraction of DSSR and UVR variability in eastern and central China, accounting for approximately 80%–93% of the variance.

 The planetary boundary layer (PBL) height is a crucial meteorological parameter for climate and air pollution dispersion studies. This paper examines the long-term variability of PBL heights across South Africa using daily soundings collected from eight atmospheric sounding stations and PBL height estimates from one South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON) flux tower and three Expanded Freshwater and Terrestrial Environmental Observation Network (EFTEON) flux towers over the period from 2012 to 2024. PBL heights were estimated from the radiosonde vertical profiles using the parcel and surface-based temperature inversion methods. Mean convective boundary layer (CBL) heights ranged below 931 m along coastal areas and exceeded 1728 m over inland regions. In contrast, mean stable boundary layer (SBL) heights reach up to 363 m in inland and 764 m in coastal regions. Flux tower data indicated that the morning transition from SBL to CBL occurs between 0500 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and 0600 UTC, while the evening transition occurs between 1500 UTC and 1600 UTC. CBL heights typically peak during the spring and summer months and reach their minimum in autumn and winter. In contrast, SBL heights exhibit the opposite pattern, with maximum heights observed in autumn and winter and minimum heights in spring and summer months. Overall, CBL heights were generally higher over inland regions than coastal regions, while SBL heights remained relatively comparable across the regions."

Using aircraft observations and a global 3-D chemical transport model, we show that ozone in the lower atmosphere in East Asia has risen in part due to intensified transport from the upper atmosphere. This rising natural background limits the effectiveness of local pollution controls, with major implications for air quality policy. 
 Severe surface ozone pollution in South Korea and China in May–June is due in part to an elevated background subsiding from the free troposphere (750–350 hPa). Using IAGOS commercial aircraft observations and the GEOS-Chem model, we show that free tropospheric ozone over East Asia in May–June is the highest in the world and has increased from 68 ± 3 ppb (mean and interannual standard deviation) in 2000–2004 to 78 ± 4 ppb in 2015–2019. Free tropospheric ozone over East Asia is highest when carbon monoxide (CO) is low, both in the observations and GEOS-Chem, implying a large stratospheric influence on ozone. We find from GEOS-Chem that East Asia is a global hotspot for stratospheric downwelling of ozone and that this makes a major contribution to the free tropospheric ozone over the region in May–June. Stratospheric downwelling of ozone over East Asia in GEOS-Chem increased by 40 % from 2000–2004 to 2015–2019, which can explain the observed free tropospheric ozone increase over this period. Increased stratospheric downwelling over East Asia appears to be driven by a strengthening of the jet stream. The large and increasing stratospheric contribution to the surface ozone background over East Asia is a major impediment to meeting ozone air quality standards."

Our study uses an atmospheric transport model (STILT) to connect the atmospheric signal to the ecosystem-level model. We show that this inclusion of atmospheric information meaningfully improves the model's representation of the interannual variability of the global net flux of CO2. 
 Global estimates of the net ecosystem exchange of CO2 (NEE) from data-driven models differ widely depending on their underlying data and methodology. Bottom-up models trained on eddy-covariance data are most informative at the ecosystem-level. Top-down models, such as atmospheric inversions, produce regional and global results consistent with the observed atmospheric growth rate, accurately capturing the interannual variability (IAV) of NEE. Both approaches have limitations estimating NEE across scales: Bottom-up models can miss large-scale dynamics of NEE when aggregated globally. Top-down approaches have difficulty relating the large-scale atmospheric signal to biophysical processes at smaller scales. To address these limitations, we create a model that uses a hybrid combination of direct observations and atmospheric dynamics to integrate ecosystem-level eddy-covariance data and atmospheric CO2 mole fraction data into a single coherent ecosystem-level flux model.Aggregated globally, our new model estimates an annual sink with a low bias, and consistent IAV when compared with independent estimates. The IAV of the estimated NEE is closer in magnitude to an ensemble of atmospheric inversions, and our model produces a higher temporal coefficient of correlation with these data than state-of-the-art bottom-up data-driven models. This improvement in IAV is achieved without direct access to the observed variability of the atmosphere: the model is trained using only one year of daytime observations from 3 tall-tower observatories. No atmospheric information is available to the model during the production of global NEE estimates. This shows the efficiency of our method in synthesizing top-down information into bottom-up mapping of flux-environment relationships."

PM2.5 (particulate matter) decreased by 9.1-31.4 μg/m³ and PM10 by 9.8–42.9 μg/m³. Weather factors like humidity, air pressure, and rainfall influenced pollution, with tailored solutions needed for different regions. 
 Accurately quantifying the relative roles of anthropogenic emissions and meteorological conditions is essential for understanding long term changes in particulate matter (PM). Using ground observations from 40 cities, GEOS-FP meteorology, CEDS emissions, and monthly LightGBM models, this study assesses the drivers of PM2.5 and PM10 across the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) regions during 2015–2022. The models demonstrate strong predictive skill (R/R2=0.82/0.67 for PM2.5 and 0.81/0.65 for PM10), with consistently high performance across cities. Both pollutants exhibit significant decreasing trends over the study period. Counterfactual experiments show that emission reductions overwhelmingly dominate these improvements. PM2.5 emission driven changes intensify from −9.1 µg m−3 in 2016 to −31.4 µg m−3 in 2022, while PM10 reductions strengthen from −9.8 to −42.9 µg m−3. Meteorology driven contributions appear as positive net anomalies at the interannual scale (approximately +2–4 µg m−3 for PM2.5 and +0.5–3 µg m−3 for PM10), indicating that air quality improvements were achieved despite year to year meteorological influences. SHAP attribution highlights 2 m air temperature (T2M), humidity (QV2M), and key precursors as dominant predictors. Interaction diagnostics further indicate that meteorological conditions modulate the effectiveness of precursor emissions, without implying direct causal mechanisms. These results provide a comprehensive data driven assessment of the factors shaping PM evolution in two major urban clusters of China."

Oxygenated VOCs were the most abundant and showed strong daytime increases due to sunlight-driven chemistry.  Air-mass analysis showed that transport from Middle East strongly influenced aromatic VOC levels. Climate–chemistry modeling underestimated most VOCs, highlighting gaps in current emission and chemical processes. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are key precursors of tropospheric ozone and secondary organic aerosol formation, yet multi-year observations in the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East (EMME) remain limited. This study presents multi-year (April 2022–June 2024) high-resolution measurements of 76 VOCs using PTR-ToF-MS at a rural background site in Cyprus, combined with HYSPLIT air-mass analysis to examine the effects of regional transport on VOCs variability. Oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) dominated the VOCs burden (∼ 79 %), followed by aliphatic hydrocarbons, aromatic hydrocarbons, and terpenes. Most VOCs exhibited clear diurnal patterns, observed highest during 08:00–14:00 UTC, varying by species, due to enhanced photochemical activity and temperature-driven emissions. Terpenes, particularly isoprene, increased exponentially with temperature upto 35–38 °C but decreased beyond this threshold, indicating heat-stress inhibition. Monoterpenes showed elevated levels both day and night, reflecting contributions from both biogenic and anthropogenic sources. OVOCs, including acetone, acetaldehyde, methanol, and acetic acid, showed sharp enhancement above 35 °C, consistent with intensified primary emissions and secondary formation under extreme heat. Aromatic hydrocarbons were mainly higher during winter, linked to combustion processes, but benzene levels were highest during summer particularly when temperature rose above 35 °C from evaporative and potential stress-related biogenic sources. HYSPLIT air-mass trajectory analysis revealed dominant contributions from Europe and Northwest Asia (∼ 68 %), transporting aged OVOCs, while Middle East winter inflows enhanced aromatic hydrocarbons. While WRF-Chem captured seasonal trends, most VOCs were underestimated, highlighting under-representation of emission sources and oxidation pathways in the model. Overall, the study emphasizes temperature and regional transport as key drivers of VOC variability in the Eastern Mediterranean."

We combine active and passive satellite aerosol products to dynamically estimate dust lidar ratios over a 12-year period. The results reveal pronounced and physically meaningful regional variability, improving aerosol characterization and supporting climate and air-quality applications. 
 North Africa and the Middle East encompass the most active dust sources on the planet. Due to the limited availability of ground-based aerosol observations across the deserts, spaceborne retrievals represent the most reliable source of information for monitoring dust particles over these vast areas. In the current study, we present a synergistic approach incorporating aerosol retrievals acquired by active (CALIOP) and passive (POLDER-3, MODIS) instruments mounted on satellites of the A-Train constellation. Our main objective is to dynamically (in terms of space and time) estimate the dust lidar ratio (LR) at 532 nm throughout a 12-year period (2006–2017) by collocating columnar aerosol optical depth observations (POLDER-3/GRASP, MIDAS) and vertically resolved dust aerosol profiles obtained by CALIPSO. According to our findings, the derived dust LRs reveal a clear spatial variability. The highest LRs are found over major Saharan source regions such as the Bodélé Depression and the Libyan Desert, while moderate to low values dominate the Arabian Peninsula. Enhanced values also appear across Central Asia, particularly over the Karakum and Kyzylkum deserts. The corresponding uncertainty fields demonstrate that LR estimates are most robust over regions with a larger number of dust cases, whereas higher uncertainties occur along transition zones – such as the Sahel and parts of Central Asia – where dust mixing or aerosol-type misclassification increases retrieval variability. A key objective of this work is to establish a robust methodology for deriving aerosol-speciated LRs using synergies between active and passive observations. Although focused here on dust over North Africa and the Middle East, the same framework can be readily applied to other CALIPSO aerosol subtypes – such as marine, polluted dust, or smoke – when implemented over regions where these aerosol types predominate. The advent of the EarthCARE satellite mission, along with the incorporation of new aerosol models into the forthcoming CALIPSO Version 5 aerosol retrieval algorithm, will serve as a reference for our calculations. In this context, our findings also highlight that a synergy of multisensor aerosol products with modelling tools can enhance the spatiotemporal representation of aerosol properties, such as the LR, further improving retrieval utility."

Manz,Quantifying PFAS-Omics Burden Scores for Nontargeted Analysis Using Multidimensional Item Response Theory: An Exploratory Analysis of Novel and Legacy PFAS in Cord Blood,"Fetal development is a vulnerable period for exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). However, certified analytical standards do not exist for many PFAS, limiting our ability to quantify overall exposure burden to PFAS as a chemical class. PFAS-focused nontargeted analysis (NTA) enables detection of PFAS for which chemical standards may not exist. The overall objectives of this study were to provide a more comprehensive picture of PFAS exposure in cord blood, develop cumulative exposure burden scores for the PFAS detected, and evaluate differences in the infant’s PFAS burden score with respect to mother’s parity. We measured PFAS using targeted and NTA methods in cord blood samples collected between 2003 and 2006 in the HOME Study (Cincinnati, Ohio). Using NTA, we putatively identified 42 PFAS in cord blood, 4 of which were also detected in targeted analysis. We summarized an infant’s overall prenatal exposure burden to PFAS using item response theory methods. We constructed two scores, one based on PFAS concentrations from targeted analysis (“PFAS exposure burden scores”), and one based on relative abundance from NTA (“PFAS-omics scores”). As expected, infants with multiparous mothers had significantly lower PFAS exposure burden scores than those with nulliparous mothers, but these disparities were not present when comparing their PFAS-omics scores. Our results show that infants are exposed to a wide range of PFAS, including perfluorinated chemicals, polyfluorinated chemicals, and fluorotelomers, before birth. Further, PFAS-focused NTA can help estimate total exposure to PFAS. Lastly, reported disparities in PFAS exposure burden across parity may depend on the panel of assessed PFAS and their half-lives."

AMI undergoes rapid direct photodegradation (t1/2 = 14.5 min at pH 8.0), whereas SUL degrades 28 times more slowly (t1/2 = 407.7 min). Theoretical calculations revealed that the disparity originates from their primary photoexcitation mechanisms. AMI retains planarity and exhibits a strong π→π* transition, while torsional distortion in SUL results in a weak, partially forbidden n→π* transition, making SUL far more dependent on the photodegradation involving •OH, CO3•–, and self-sensitized 3SUL*. Experiments with NO3–, HCO3–, and Br– demonstrated pronounced acceleration of SUL photodegradation in natural and simulated waters, confirming the key role of indirect pathways for SUL and their minimal contribution to AMI. Six AMI and four SUL transformation products (TPs) were identified exclusively from direct photodegradation, arising from sulfone cleavage, ring oxidation, and N-dealkylation. Toxicity predictions showed that SUL photodegradation leads to detoxification, whereas AMI produces multiple transformation products with higher predicted toxicity. These findings demonstrate that −NH2 positional isomerism governs photoexcitation, indirect photoreactivity, and environmental risk."

To accomplish this, Ru was adopted to decorate a Tb2Ce2O7+x solid solution in its lattice (Ru-TC) or on its surface (Ru/TC-DP). The addition of Ru promotes the formation of catalytically critical Ru–O–Ce/Tb interfacial bonds and abundant oxygen vacancies, both of which are more numerous in Ru/TC-DP. DFT calculations confirm that Ru lowers the oxygen vacancy formation energy and the O2 adsorption energy, especially on Ru/TC-DP, enhancing the generation of reactive oxygen anions (O2–, O22–). Isotopic 18O2-TPSR-MS shows that Ru/TC-DP has a better capability to activate O2 than Ru-TC. Furthermore, Ru/TC-DP owns more surface Ru0 sites conducive to activating gaseous O2. Quasi in situ XPS revealed that Ru decoration promotes the dual Tb4+/Tb3+ and Ce4+/Ce3+ redox cycles, particularly with Ru/TC-DP. The excellent performance arises from synergy among three components: metallic Ru0 sites adsorb and weaken O2, Ru–O–Ce/Tb interfacial bonds act as electron transfer channels that drive −–O cleavage and stabilize oxygen vacancies, and the abundant vacancies serve as acceptors for activated oxygen species. This cooperative mechanism establishes an efficient cycle for continuous oxygen activation and lattice oxygen replenishment. Consequently, Ru/TC-DP exhibits remarkable soot combustion activity (T50 = 333 °C, TOF = 2.90 × 10–3 s–1). This work demonstrates that loading Ru onto the surface of Tb2Ce2O7+x provides a cost-effective strategy for designing high-performance soot combustion catalysts through multisite synergy."

However, its formation mechanisms in these cold environments, particularly at night, remain poorly understood. Here, we present experimental evidence that the dark freezing of iodide-containing bulk solutions and droplets activates iodide (I–) without any added catalysts or oxidants. This I– activation is markedly enhanced during the freezing of iodide-containing droplets, leading to substantial I2 production in both the gas and the aqueous phases. The production follows a Langmuir–Hinshelwood formalism, indicating a surface-mediated process at the frozen air–water interface. A detailed mechanistic investigation reveals that the production of I2 is driven by the hydroxyl radicals (OH·) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) formed at the frozen interface, which subsequently oxidize I–. We attribute the formation of OH· and H2O2 to the high electric field possibly induced by the Workman–Reynolds freezing potential. This work identifies a previously unrecognized nighttime formation mechanism of I2 in atmospheric snow and ice, which has implications for atmospheric multiphase chemistry in cold environments."

Whereas this can lower emissions of toxic organic chemical and therefore human and wildlife exposures in countries with consumer economies, manufacturing countries and those involved in the handling of waste are “virtually importing” emissions and exposures. Here, we illustrate the feasibility of characterizing toxic chemical emissions, exposures, and health risks embodied in international trade using the example of the fungicide chlorothalonil applied in the cultivation of bananas in Costa Rica, which are exported to Europe and North America. The international virtual flow of chlorothalonil embodied in the banana trade is in the 100s of tonnes per year and exceeds by many orders of magnitude the flows via long-range atmospheric transport and as residue in the traded commodity. Quantifying the flows of toxic chemicals embodied in international trade in chemicals, products, food, feed, and waste, and the resulting exposure and health effects, is key to revealing the responsibility of consumers for the risk associated with toxic chemical use."

However, knowledge of the emission of imidazoles (IMs) in nitrogen-containing BrC and their transformation remains limited. This study investigated the emissions of IMs from 11 solid fuel combustions and subsequent photochemical evolution. The reaction pathways and light absorption of IMs were estimated through quantum chemical calculations. The potential toxicity of IMs for aging products was predicted with machine learning. The results showed that emission factors (EFs) of IMs were higher from biomass burning (BB) than from coal combustion (CC). Maize stalks exhibited the highest ∑IMs EFs, while anthracite coal showed the lowest ones. Alkyl IMs (Alk-IMs) and benzene-ring IMs (Bn-IMs) dominated the ∑IMs in BB (85%) and CC (52%). During aging, Alk-IMs underwent •OH substitution reactions, forming poorly oxygenated hydroxyimidazole derivatives (O/N = 0.5). Conversely, based on density functional theory calculations, •OH oxidation of Bn-IMs and carboxyl IMs occurred more easily, forming highly oxygenated imidazole derivatives (O/N = 1–2) with carboxyl groups. The light absorption of these highly oxygenated derivatives decreased by 17–28%, while their health risk probability increased by 1.12–2.27 times compared to those of their precursors. These findings improved our understanding of the residence time and interaction with other pollutants of IMs."

About 20% of the events are quasi‐laminar, showing single power‐law spectra, whereas ∼80% are turbulent, exhibiting a spectral break separating inertial and kinetic ranges. A dawn–dusk asymmetry is identified: inertial‐range slopes are systematically shallower on the dawnside, whereas kinetic‐range slopes are steeper, indicating more developed turbulence there, consistent with the higher occurrence of reconnection‐related processes on the dawnside. Component analysis shows that the transverse components, orthogonal to the tail‐aligned principal field (BX), display shallow slopes near −1 in the inertial range, suggesting energy injection at ion scales rather than a classical inertial range.

The study considered three atmospheric statistics and dynamic factors: latitude, wind vertical shear, and horizontal grid scale, to develop an L $L$ parameterization scheme by deep neural network (DNN). For different resolutions, the simulation accuracy of this parameterization scheme can basically be maintained at R2 ${R}^{2}$ above 0.9, which significantly surpasses that of other traditional overlap schemes.

Using observational data sets and CMIP6 simulations, here we quantify how long‐term warming and the AC contribute to changes in seasonal onset across Northern Hemisphere midlatitudes during 1950–2014. While long‐term warming drives a widespread advance of summer onset, regional, and latitudinal contrasts arise primarily from AC variations. In North America and northern Asia, these cycle changes offset the warming‐induced advance and contribute at magnitudes comparable to long‐term warming, highlighting their critical role in shaping regional climate responses. Based on single‐forcing experiments and a simplified surface energy balance model, we further show that greenhouse gases enhance damping and reduce effective heat capacity, advancing the AC phase, whereas aerosol forcing increases effective heat capacity and weakens damping, thereby delaying summer onset."

Here, we combine a δ18O‐based PDV index derived through paleoclimate data assimilation (PDA) framework, with existing PDV reconstructions and climate models to identify the preferred time scales of the PDV. We show that the PDV in the last millennium is dominated by two modes of preferred time scales: multi‐decadal mode (50–70‐yr) and bi‐decadal mode (20–40‐yr). The former is prevalent during quiescent volcanic period; however, the latter is more common during periods with intensive volcanic activities.

Atmospheric absorption, the difference between ERF at TOA and the surface, shows a net absorption of +9.29 W/m2, dominated by SW absorption from direct aerosol‐radiation interactions (SW Atm.Abs.ARI), contributing +8.99 W/m2, with LW absorption from aerosol‐cloud interactions (LW Atm.Abs.ACI) adding +1.83 W/m2. These findings highlight the dominant role of aerosol‐cloud interactions in cooling at both TOA and the surface and the significant contribution of direct aerosol interactions to atmospheric absorption over the Indian region. This underscores the need to consider both aerosol effects in climate models to improve regional climate predictions and support effective mitigation and adaptation strategies."

To clarify its mechanisms, we measured gaseous and particulate concentrations of PAHs in the East China Marginal Sea (ECMS) to develop an improved model integrating thermodynamic interactions between PAHs and distinct aerosol carbonaceous fractions. Aerosol samples were thermally divided into 6 carbonaceous fractions: OM1 to OM4 (organic matter), EC1 and EC2 (elemental carbon). A systematic surrogate method was employed to simulate the absorption/adsorption process of PAHs in each fraction, and a computational enumeration framework coupled with the Abraham solvation parameter model was implemented for model parameterization. Compared to conventional models, this model improved the prediction accuracy for logarithmic gas‐particle partitioning coefficient (log KP) by 34%. It also clarified that OM3 exhibits the strongest absorption capacity, likely driven by polar‐induced interactions between this fraction and PAHs, whereas PAH adsorption onto the EC1 and EC2 proceeded homogeneously. Additionally, the model identified adsorption onto elemental carbon as the dominant partitioning mechanism for 3‐ and 4‐ring PAHs, while for 5‐ring PAHs, the contribution of absorption into OM3 becomes comparable to that of adsorption. The prediction deviations of log KP for 3‐ring PAHs by this model suggested that adsorption onto inorganic aerosol constituents may also influence their gas‐particle partitioning. This study elucidated the interactions between PAHs and different carbonaceous fractions in aerosols and advanced mechanistic understanding of the gas‐particle partitioning."

 Anthropogenic nitrogen (N) pollution is a cause of eutrophication globally1. However, recent datasets indicate that some ecosystems may be experiencing widespread oligotrophication—declining N availability—which is suggested to be a response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2)2. Plant N isotope (δ15N) chronologies have served as primary evidence for oligotrophication, but there is wide disagreement whether rising CO2 or temporal changes in N deposition explain these patterns3–6. Here we construct δ15N tree-ring chronologies using archived samples from Sweden’s 23.5-million-hectare forest area from 1961 to 2018. The study area spans a 1,500-km latitudinal distance where N deposition varies fourfold, but where rising CO2 is spatially uniform. Our data show declining δ15N chronologies throughout Sweden, including forests in the far north where atmospheric N deposition rates are very low. Linear mixed-effects models showed that rising CO2 is the strongest predictor of δ15N values, whereas N deposition variables, temperature and forest basal area had lower explanatory power. Our findings suggest that elevated atmospheric CO2 is causing oligotrophication in boreal forests, which has implications for predicting their future role as sinks in the global carbon cycle7–9.

 Off-season landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) in the western North Pacific show evidence of increased frequency between 1981–2022. We identify convectively coupled equatorial Rossby waves (CCERWs) and the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) as key physical modulators of off-season landfalling TC frequency, while long-term asymmetric Pacific warming drives systematic spatial reorganization of cyclogenesis. Our analysis reveals that over 70% of off-season landfalling TCs form during supportive CCERW phases, with fourfold higher daily formation probability—significantly stronger coupling than during the peak TC season. Physical mechanism analysis demonstrates that CCERWs create “windows of opportunity” for cyclogenesis. Positive IPO phases correlate strongly with landfalling TC frequency but show no relationship with non-landfalling systems, suggesting preferential steering-flow modulation. Long-term asymmetric Pacific warming appears to contribute to a systematic westward shift in TC genesis locations, bringing more cyclones coastward. These multi-scale physical mechanisms provide new insights into off-season TC behavior during periods of reduced preparedness."

 Mangrove forests offer nature-based solutions for climate change mitigation by storing atmospheric CO2, while also supporting biodiversity, livelihoods, and coastal protection. Yet, they face increasing threats from deforestation, salinity, and extreme weather events. Here, we assessed and explored the resilience of Sundarbans mangrove forests and associated drivers using satellite-derived vegetation indices, biodiversity, and environmental data, within a structural equation modeling framework. We found 1–8 major perturbations at 250-meter spatial resolution, with the lowest resilience to disturbance or stress in the central and southeastern zones of the Sundarbans. Approximately 610 to 990 km² (~10-15% of the total Sundarbans area) of mangrove forests exhibited declining resilience. The functional composition of maximum canopy height (MCH) was the strongest driver of mangrove forest resilience (β= 0.61), followed by specific leaf area (SLA; β= 0.56) and precipitation (β= 0.44). Structural diversity (β= 0.22), though weakly associated, mediated the positive association of species richness with resilience. Perturbation frequency had a significant negative direct (β= −0.29) and total (β= −0.33) association on resilience, whereas temperature exhibited only a total negative association (β= −0.20). Based on these findings, we hold that for enhancing mangrove forest resilience against disturbances and stressors, (re-)establishment and conservation efforts should focus on maintaining site-specific dominant species with tall canopy height and specific leaf area —supplemented by a few complementary species— to increase structural diversity and facilitate recovery rates. Mangrove forest resilience in Sundarbans is supported by tall canopy height and large specific leaf area during perturbations, 2000-2024, as indicated by vegetation indices, biodiversity, and environmental data analysis."

 The absence of plate tectonics and the young surface age (0.3-1 billion years) of Venus have led to diverse geodynamic models for Venus. The energetics of the Venusian interior drives these models; however, the lack of direct constraints on surface heat flow hampers their quantitative assessment. Here we present a global heat flow map for Venus, as well as estimates of the total heat loss, obtained from an inversion of geophysical data, including lithospheric effective elastic thickness, crustal thickness, and radioactive heat production. Heat flow on Venus is lower and less geographically structured than on Earth, with an average of 31 mW m—2, but with highs associated to rifts systems reaching values typical of active terrestrial areas. The obtained total heat loss is 11-17 TW, similar to estimates of the total radioactive heat production. Therefore, at present, Venus proportionally dissipates much less heat than Earth.

 High-resolution remote sensing data are essential for monitoring forest health and detecting changes such as tree mortality. This study evaluates low-level segmentation methods for delineating standing dead trees (SDTs) using widely available true-color (RGB) aerial orthoimagery, independent of near-infrared (NIR) or LiDAR data. The analysis was conducted across eight forest sites in northern Poland, dominated by coniferous species such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies L.).Four representative superpixel-based algorithms were tested — Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC), its zero-parameter variant (SLIC0), scale-adaptive superpixels (adaptels), and a spatially regularized watershed transform (waterpixels). All methods represent preprocessing approaches designed to reduce image complexity and preserve meaningful spectral–spatial structures prior to object-based image analysis (OBIA). In addition, the impact of converting imagery to the perceptually uniform CIELAB color space was assessed to enhance spectral separability and reduce illumination effects. Segmentation accuracy was evaluated against a manually verified reference dataset of 1,200 SDT crowns using multiple quality metrics.The results indicate that the adaptels algorithm, particularly when combined with the CIELAB color transformation, achieved the most balanced performance across all evaluation metrics, defined by a simultaneous reduction of segmentation fragmentation and boundary generalization errors while maintaining high overall detection accuracy. This combination proved to be an efficient and cost-effective solution for SDT segmentation using standard RGB orthophotos. The findings highlight the potential of perceptually uniform color transformations as practical tools for scalable, reproducible, and low-cost forest monitoring. The study also provides a reference database of standing dead trees to support further research and future integration with deep learning-based detection frameworks."

 The Arctic Ocean is among the world’s most hazardous maritime regions, where sea ice, uncharted bathymetry, and limited emergency infrastructure threaten vessel safety. Recent advances in remote sensing now provide critical spatial data that can mitigate these risks. This study proposes a GIS-based framework for monthly Arctic navigation risk assessment by integrating sea ice, bathymetry, satellite communication, and accessibility to rescue and evacuation infrastructure. Using Spatial Multi-Criteria Evaluation (SMCE) with Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), risks were evaluated from September 2022 to April 2023 with ICESat-2 observations. Five vessel classes were analyzed, from non-icebreaking ships to those with maximum icebreaking capacities of 1.0 m, 1.5 m, 2.0 m, and 2.8 m. The resulting maps delineate monthly risk zones and reveal spatial and temporal variability across the Arctic. These outputs provide decision support for safer routing, operational preparedness, and policy development. The framework also demonstrates practical relevance for e-Navigation systems and advances methodological approaches to maritime risk assessment."

 Identifying local and regional air pollution events in developing regions remains challenging due to the lack of monitoring infrastructure. This study applied an integrated monitoring approach (combining low-cost sensors (LCS), reference-grade data, mobile measurements and satellite observations) to characterize the influence of residential wood combustion (RWC) and wildfire smoke on particulate pollution in two cities of central Chile during 2022–2023. LCS data proved to be a reliable indicator of particulate pollution, providing a relative measure of PM2.5 concentrations and effectively flagging extreme events. They revealed strong winter pollution episodes, with PM2.5 concentrations exceeding those recorded at coastal reference-grade stations. An atypical PM2.5 peak exceeding 100 μg/m3 in February 2023 was linked to long-range transport of smoke from severe wildfires in central-south Chile, through a combination of aerosol optical depth, fire radiative power and HYSPLIT trajectories. Winter field measurements of black carbon (BC) and particle number (PN) provided additional source-specific insights. On average, fixed-site BC showed a morning peak (BC370 = BC880 = 4.69 μg/m3), associated with traffic, and an evening peak (BC370 = 6.16 μg/m3; BC880 = 4.39 μg/m3) associated with strong RWC contributions (Ångström exponents >1.1).

 The Southern Sichuan city group in China has experienced severe PM2.5 pollution in recent years, especially in Luzhou. Elucidating the key drivers of PM2.5 is essential to curb further deterioration of PM2.5. This study used Machine Learning (ML) models combined with Shapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) and Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) to explore the impact of various drivers (including meteorological factors, chemical components, and sources) on the formation of PM2.5 in Luzhou from January to December, 2023. Secondary ions (NO3−, SO42−, and NH4+) were identified as the most influential species, particularly under polluted conditions, thereby amplifying PM2.5 accumulation. Meteorological factors, especially low temperature and high humidity, further exacerbated pollution episodes by suppressing dispersion and favoring secondary aerosol formation. Source apportionment showed that secondary (46.5%) and industrial emissions (22.2%) were the primary sources overall, but the influence of industrial and combustion sources intensified markedly during heavy pollution periods. These findings point to secondary aerosol formation, amplified by unfavorable meteorology, as the principal driver of PM2.5 pollution in Luzhou. Therefore, the results provide scientific evidence for prioritizing precursor emission controls and implementing timely interventions during stagnant cold weather to curb severe haze events."

 In this study, we examined 364 space leaders in 18 negative natural cloud-to-ground lightning strokes whose stepped leaders created new channels to ground. All strokes were captured on ultra-high-speed video cameras operating at frame rates ranging from 400k to 783k frames per second. Additionally, broadband electromagnetic field measurements were available for a subset of these strokes. The median space leader inception-to-attachment-point length and retrograde propagation speed towards the pre-existing leader channel (PELC) were 8.2 m and 4.0 x 106 m/s, respectively. Space leader lengths were longer and retrograde propagation speeds faster for return strokes with higher peak currents. This is likely due to the relative proximity of space leader inception points to the PELC, which makes the electric field produced by the PELC line charge density one of the primary factors in determining space leader characteristics. Space leader characteristics were weakly related to their inception altitude. We observed bursts of very high frequency (VHF) emissions preceding, by around 0.5 – 1 μs, electric field leader-step pulses; visible-frequency-range luminosity pulses started during the step pulses. The median downward leader propagation speed for all 18 strokes was 4.3 x 105 m/s; leader propagation speeds were generally faster for return strokes with higher peak currents. Also, leaders appeared to accelerate (on their way to ground) at altitudes lower than about 200 and 1000 m above ground level for strokes in the 10 – 60 and 84 – 228 kA peak current ranges, respectively."

 Disdrometers are widely used to measure the microphysical properties of precipitation, synthesised by the drop size and fall velocity distribution, and to infer integral properties like rainfall intensity, kinetic energy, visibility and radar reflectivity. Although often used to validate other methods of inferring precipitation products, including radar, satellite and opportunistic sensors, the accuracy and reliability of disdrometer measurements are rarely quantified. This study is the first to traceably and systematically quantify the instrumental bias of optical disdrometer measurements in the laboratory. We tested two widely used optical transmission disdrometers, the OTT Parsivel2 and the Thies LPM, using a raindrop generator that was specifically developed for calibrating non-catching precipitation measurement instruments. We also conducted tests using metallic spheres and demonstrated that the calibration obtained using artificial particles is not appropriate for optical disdrometers. The instruments investigated significantly underestimate drop size by up to 20%, with peaks of up to 40% for the Thies LPM when using the internal post-processing algorithm. The OTT Parsivel2 overestimates fall velocity by about 5 to 10%, while the Thies LPM underestimates it by up to 15%. Slight linear trends of the percentage relative bias with drop size are observed for both drop diameter and fall velocity. However, adjustment of field measurements may be challenging, given the large dispersion observed. The mean bias and dispersion of drop size and velocity measurements vary along and across the laser beam, especially for the Thies LPM, with differences of up to 30% observed between drops falling at the opposite edges of the beam. Integral properties are largely underestimated, particularly at low rainfall intensity, although performance improves as intensity increases. These results highlight the importance of laboratory calibration to assess and quantify the instrumental bias of disdrometer measurements prior to their use in research or operational applications, especially when used to calibrate meteorological radars or to compare integral measurements with those of other instruments that measure precipitation in situ. While they provide relevant information about individual drop size and velocity, optical disdrometers need to be further improved before they can compete reliably with traditional rain gauges in measuring rainfall intensity."

On 2D substrates, the arrays act as FlexoSERS interfaces with high sensitivity, uniformity (RSD = 7.2%), and durability, maintaining stable SERS signals under 100% strain and after 2500 cycles. On 3D porous sponges, the NWs serve as dry bioelectrical electrodes, enabling stable electrocardiogram (ECG) and electromyogram (EMG) monitoring with long-term stability. Continuous ECG recording, combined with deep learning analysis, enables accurate classification between sleep and wake states. Meanwhile, the EMG signals capture subtle motor activities such as finger bending, typing, and clicking.

The mechanism and predictability of MJO propagation remain elusive, partly because relevant multiscale processes are poorly understood. Here, we reveal chaotic MJO propagation arising from cross-scale nonlinear interactions, based on 4000-member ensemble simulations of two MJO events with a global cloud-system–resolving model. Against conventional linear thinking, multiple regimes with distinct timings of MJO propagation emerge under a single atmosphere-ocean background. The emergence of regime bifurcation depends critically on the equatorial asymmetry of climatological sea surface temperature. Selection of the bifurcated regimes is probabilistic, influenced by whether tropical-extratropical interplay promotes moistening associated with westward-propagating tropical waves over the western Pacific. These results contribute to a more complete MJO conceptual model and help foresee when coherent MJO propagation emerges."

Significant increases in SFW occurred during 1979 to 2024, with more than a twofold increase observed in most regions.

Internal modes of climate variability strongly influence SFW in several regions, including Equatorial Asia, which experiences 43 additional intraregional SFW days during El Niño years.

Observation-based estimates of instantaneous radiative forcing from ACI (RFaci; the Twomey effect) rely on the choice of aerosol quantities as proxies for cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations, which differ in their ability to represent cloud-base CCN and data accuracy. Using diverse observations and aerosol-climate models, we evaluate the utility of different proxies with two independent approaches. Both approaches reveal that surface CCN exhibits the smallest bias in predicting RFaci(+5%), followed by aerosol index, surface sulfate and column CCN with similar biases of +25%, while aerosol optical depth and column sulfate show the largest biases (−60% and +92%). Constraining RFaciwith the optimal proxy reduces uncertainty from 66 to 43%, yielding a less negative RFaci(−1.0 W m−2) than the unconstrained case (−1.2 W m−2). Our findings highlight the crucial role of proxy constraint in reconciling and improving RFaciestimates."

As a result, several Earth system tipping elements could, at least temporarily, have their tipping points surpassed, posing risks of large-scale and profound structural change. Tipping does not always occur immediately upon crossing such a critical threshold. If the length of time the driver is beyond the critical level is short enough, tipping could still be avoided for some slow-responding elements of the climate system. An improved understanding is therefore needed of whether tipping remains avoidable, for which systems, and under what conditions. Here, we review how minimising the magnitude and duration of any temperature overshoot beyond 1.5 °C could decrease tipping risks. Tipping elements with fast response times, such as warm-water coral reefs, are especially vulnerable to overshoot. In contrast, those with slow response times, such as polar ice sheets, may be less sensitive to temporary overshoot. Potential interactions between tipping elements and additional human pressures, such as deforestation in the Amazon or pollution and overfishing of coral reef habitats, may further lower tipping points, narrowing the range of overshoot trajectories that can still avoid it. The vulnerability of many tipping elements, even under shorter overshoot conditions, underscores that global warming must peak below 2 °C above pre-industrial levels, return to below 1.5 °C as quickly as possible (i.e. within this century), and to around 1 °C thereafter to limit tipping point risks."

To quantify this R–P relation, we define the CRE parameter, which exhibits significant disparities across global climate models (GCMs), with most overestimating it relative to the observation. Given the strong correlation between the CRE parameter and both historical and future extreme precipitation, an emergent constraint on the hydrological cycle projection is constructed. It lowers the fractional increase in the 99.9th percentile of tropical precipitation by the end of the 21st century from 29% to 24% under the high-emission warming scenario, with a 58% reduction in uncertainty. Overall, GCMs tend to underestimate the intensity of tropical extreme precipitation while overestimating its fractional increase.

Results show that these two schemes can yield substantially different aerosol burdens, radiative changes, and impacts when simulating the same injection scenarios. These findings suggest that more sophisticated aerosol models may be necessary to accurately assess the efficacy, side effects, and climate impacts of SAI. 
 Significant differences exist between Earth System Models in simulating the efficiency of stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) experiments, particularly in terms of aerosol burden, radiative forcing, and impacts, such as tropical lower stratospheric heating and changes in ozone. However, the primary reasons for these differences have not been identified. Previous studies have proposed that these differences can be attributed to the use of different aerosol microphysical schemes, model resolution, or other physical parameterizations. Here, we compare two sets of SAI experiments using the same modeling framework of the Community Earth System Model, differing only in their aerosol microphysical schemes: the modal aerosol model (MAM4) and the sectional aerosol model (CARMA). We analyze scenarios varying in injection location (point vs. regional), amount (5 vs. 25 Tg S yr−1), and material (sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas vs. accumulation-mode sulfuric acid (AM-H2SO4) aerosol). Our results suggest that the SAI radiative efficiency may be substantially overestimated when using the modal aerosol model, particularly at higher injection rates, with implications for other impacts, including stratospheric ozone. While both sets of models confirm that AM-H2SO4 injections are more effective than SO2 injections in reducing net top-of-the-atmosphere radiative forcing, MAM4 yields significantly larger aerosol burdens and weaker size-dependent sedimentation, particularly at 25 Tg S yr−1. In contrast, CARMA produces a smaller aerosol burden, with more mass shifted into larger particles and a declining radiative efficiency at increased injection rates. These findings suggest that more sophisticated sectional models may be necessary to accurately assess the efficacy, side effects, and climate impacts of SAI."

We improved their representation in the EC-Earth model by introducing an aerosol-sensitive scheme for ice formation and a machine-learning approach for secondary ice production. These advances produce more realistic cloud properties and radiative effects, highlighting that both processes are essential for reliable climate projections. 
 Clouds and aerosol–cloud interactions remain major sources of uncertainty in climate projections. Here, we improve the representation of mixed-phase clouds (MPCs) in the EC-Earth3-AerChem Earth System Model by replacing the default temperature-dependent nucleation scheme with a physically based aerosol-sensitive heterogeneous ice nucleation parameterization. This scheme accounts for immersion freezing by K-feldspar, quartz, and marine organic aerosols, and is combined with a machine-learning-based parameterization of secondary ice production (SIP) to represent ice crystal multiplication processes.The new configuration improves agreement with global in situ ice nucleating particle (INP) observations and reveals realistic spatial patterns of ice crystal number concentrations (ICNC) across diverse environments. While these improvements do not eliminate the persistent structural cloud biases in EC-Earth3-AerChem, the aerosol-sensitive primary ice production scheme increases supercooled liquid water and cloud cover, particularly in the extratropics. Critically, the addition of SIP rebalances the cloud phase by enhancing ICNC in regions with low primary ice formation.Compared to the default scheme, the aerosol-sensitive primary ice production configuration with SIP reduces cloud radiative effect biases at mid- and high latitudes, while increasing them in the lower latitudes, leading to comparable global biases across configurations. Our results highlight the importance of explicitly representing both aerosol-sensitive nucleation and SIP for realistic simulations of MPCs and their radiative impacts. Unlike previous schemes, in which ice concentrations depend directly on INPs, the presence of effective SIP enhances ice formation in all MPCs and reduces the sensitivity of ICNC to aerosols, especially at low INP levels."

They benefit from regular, in-season adjustments – monthly recalibration proved most effective – to deliver reliable data. Using an uncommon recalibration method and state-of-the-art air sensor test protocols for evaluation, we showed the importance of recurrent calibration to maximize sensor performance and to broaden their scope of application, particularly for ozone monitoring. 
 The appropriate period of collocation of a low-cost air sensor (LCS) with reference measurements is often unknown. Previous LCS studies have shown that due to sensor ageing and seasonality of environmental interferences periodical sensor calibration needs to be performed to guarantee sufficient data quality. While the limitations are well-established it is still unclear how often a recalibration of a sensor needs to be carried out. In this study, we demonstrate how widely used air sensors (OX-B431 and SPS30) for the relevant air pollutants ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) by two manufacturers (Alphasense and Sensirion) should be recalibrated for real-world monitoring applications. Sensor calibration functions were built using Multiple Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Random Forest and Extreme Gradient Boosting. We use multiple novel test protocols for air sensors provided by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the European Committee for Standardization for evaluative guidance and to identify possible applications for OX-B431 and SPS30 sensors. We conducted a yearlong collocation campaign at an urban background air and climate monitoring station next to the University Hospital Augsburg, Germany. LCSs were exposed to a wide range of environmental conditions, with air temperatures between −10 and 36 °C, relative air humidity between 19 % and 96 % and air pressure between 937 and 983 hPa. The ambient concentration ranges for O3 and PM2.5 were up to 82 ppb and 153 µg m−3, respectively. For the baseline single training of 5 months, the calibrated O3 and PM2.5 sensors were able to reflect the hourly reference data well during the training (R2: O3 = 0.92–1.00; PM2.5 = 0.93–0.97) and the following test period (R2: O3 = 0.93–0.98; PM2.5 = 0.84–0.93). Additionally, the sensor errors were generally acceptable during the training (RMSE: O3 = 0.80–4.35 ppb; PM2.5 = 1.45–2.51 µg m−3) and the following test period (RMSE: O3 = 3.62–5.84 ppb; PM2.5 = 2.04–3.02 µg m−3). We investigated different recalibration cycles using a pairwise calibration strategy, which is an uncommon method for recurrent LCS calibration. Our results indicate that a regular in-season recalibration is required to obtain the highest quantitative validity and broadest range of applications (indicative and non-regulatory supplemental measurements) for the analysed LCSs. Monthly recalibrations are observed to be the most suitable approach. The measurement uncertainties of the calibrated O3 LCSs and PM2.5 LCSs were able to meet the data quality objective for indicative measurements for different calibration models. In-season recalibration, rather than reliance on a single pre-deployment calibration, should be adopted by end-user communities. This approach is required for certain real-world applications to be performed reliably by LCSs and to achieve sufficient information content."

A systematic −20 % bias in Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy compared to direct-sun ultraviolet and infrared data is linked to limited sensitivity above a few kilometers and simplified vertical profiles assumptions. Using model-based priors and accounting for vertical sensitivity removes these differences, improving consistency for satellite validation. 
 MAX-DOAS (Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy), direct sun DOAS (DS) and FTIR (Fourier Transform InfraRed) measurements are considered nowadays as reference data for the validation of HCHO satellite observations. Recognizing their strengths and limitations, as well as evaluating their consistency, is crucial for generating robust and reliable validation datasets. So far, only a handful of studies have explored the complementarity between MAX-DOAS and direct sun FTIR HCHO measurements and the question of the consistency of the ground-based retrievals within the different networks currently used for satellite validation is still relevant. Here we take advantage of the presence of a MAX-DOAS spectrometer, incorporating a direct sun viewing mode capability, and an FTIR instrument operating in parallel at the Xianghe site (39.75° N, 116.96° E, China), to compare the retrieved HCHO vertical columns and investigate the reasons for the observed differences. First, we compare the UV and IR HCHO vertical column densities (VCDs) in the direct sun geometry, for which the uncertainty due to the light path is negligible. We find an excellent agreement between the measurements obtained in both wavelength ranges, with a median difference of less than −0.5 × 1015 molec. cm−2 (−6 % ± 11 % for (FTIR − DS) / DS). Second, the MAX-DOAS data from different retrieval strategies implemented within the European Space Agency Fiducial Reference Measurement centralized processing facility for DOAS observations are compared to the DS and FTIR ones. The MAX-DOAS HCHO columns correlate well with the direct sun DOAS and FTIR data, but underestimate them by about 20 %. Focusing on the vertical profiles, we show that this bias cancels out when taking properly into account the different a priori profiles and the respective vertical sensitivities of the MAX-DOAS and FTIR measurements. The underestimation in the current MAX-DOAS VCDs is coming from the limited vertical sensitivity of the technique and from the choice of the a priori profile, which neglects the free-tropospheric contribution (above 4 km), where the MAX-DOAS has no sensitivity. We test and suggest possible improvements to the current centralized MAX-DOAS HCHO retrievals processing, like  using more appropriate a priori profiles, based on the CAMS and TM5 chemical-transport models (CTMs) that better estimate the HCHO content above 4 km."

We see a ground projection of these methane plumes from the satellites that, similarly to clouds or buildings, are distorted depending on the observation and illumination angle. Here we highlight this issue and propose a methodology to account for it using simulations that could enhance current and upcoming retrieval and quantification algorithms. 
 A growing constellation of methane-sensitive instruments from space is making it possible to monitor methane point-source emissions from different industries and activities. Advanced plume simulation methods are becoming key to better understanding the uncertainties in the plume detection and quantification processes. This paper describes how observation and illumination angular configuration affects satellite-derived methane enhancement fields and, more critically, the calibration and uncertainty of semi-empirical emission rate estimation models, using simulated datasets. We review the mathematical expression of the retrieval and quantification methodologies to determine the uncertainty sources. We implement a method to simulate the apparent displacement of the plume when projected on the ground due to tilted illumination and observation (i.e., parallax effect). We apply this method to methane plumes generated from 3D spatial distributions of methane using the Weather and Research Forecasting Model in large-eddy simulation mode (WRF-LES). The results in the methane enhancement (ΔXCH4) maps show large spatial variations of the plumes with respect to a reference case with nadir observation and zenith illumination. In short, it suggests that the spatial distribution of the plumes is largely determined not only by the turbulence in the atmosphere but also by the acquisition's illumination and observation geometry. We tested the impact in the methane flux rate using the integrated mass enhancement (IME) method. Assuming nadir observation, these errors have a polar dependence with the solar angles that for our training dataset at 20 × 20 m2 reaches values as high as the 30 % error for high sun zenith angles orthogonal to the direction of the plume. The errors in the IME method are explained by the changing plume area with angular projection on the ground. Furthermore, it also has an impact on the probability of plume detection (PoD). The PoD is significantly reduced in the orthogonal plane to the wind direction and increases in opposite directions to the wind where the plumes are compressed. The dependence of the PoD on the angles increases with high values of U10 with differences of up to 4 times between angular configurations at high sun zenith angles. Our results illustrate the importance of considering acquisition and observation geometry when analysing plume maps with a spatial sampling of 20 m or better."

Validation is conducted under diverse atmospheric conditions, including cloudiness and aerosols, using input data from ground-based measurements and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS). Results indicate that simulations are reliable under most conditions, with overestimations occurring during intense dust events. 
 Accurate PV power production modelling requires precise knowledge of the distribution of solar irradiance among its direct and diffuse components. Since this information is rarely available, this requirement can be addressed through the use of diffuse fraction models. In this study, we try to quantify the errors in PV modelling when measurements of the diffuse solar irradiance are not available. For this purpose, we use total and diffuse solar irradiance data obtained from ground-based measurements of BSRN to simulate the PV electric output using GSEE. We have chosen five sites in Europe and North Africa, with different prevailing conditions, where BSRN measurements are available. GSEE incorporates an implementation of the Boland-Ridley-Lauret (BRL) diffuse fraction model, along with a Climate Data Interface that enables simulations across different time scales. We evaluate the capability of BRL in providing accurate estimations of the diffuse fraction under diverse atmospheric conditions, with particular attention on the presence of clouds and aerosols and assess the extent to which its associated errors propagate to energy production modelling. Furthermore, we compare GSEE outputs when using CAMS radiation time-series as input instead of ground-based measurements, to quantify the impact of the CAMS radiation product uncertainties in PV modelling."

We show the first evaluation of Greenland clouds in the Regional Atmospheric Climate Model (RACMO2.4) with new EarthCARE satellite data. Comparing lidar and radar observations and retrieved cloud profiles with co-located RACMO output, we find RACMO captures low ice clouds but underestimates high clouds, mid-altitude liquid clouds, and snowfall. These results highlight EarthCARE's potential to improve polar climate models. 
 Clouds present one of the major challenges for polar climate modeling and significantly contribute to uncertainties in climate and ice sheet mass balance projections, as their radiative effect can strongly impact ice and snow melt. Therefore, a reliable representation of clouds in polar climate models is essential, yet the observations necessary for their evaluation remain sparse. The launch of the Earth Cloud, Aerosol, and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) satellite in May 2024 helps bridge this gap by offering cloud observations in unprecedented detail using multiple instruments. Here, we demonstrate the potential of using these novel observations to evaluate cloud representation over the Greenland ice sheet in the regional climate model RACMO (version 2.4p1). To this end, we show along-track comparisons of co-located RACMO cloud profiles with EarthCARE lidar and radar observations. We compare both lidar backscatter and radar reflectivity observations, as well as retrieved cloud properties, with simulated RACMO profiles for two selected case studies. These first results indicate that RACMO simulates low- and mid-altitude ice clouds and snowfall at the correct locations, but fails to capture thinner high-altitude clouds. Additionally, RACMO typically underestimates cloud ice and snow water content, in particular in precipitating systems, where RACMO underestimates snowfall rates. Regarding supercooled liquid and mixed-phase clouds, RACMO does not always reproduce these, especially when they are located at higher altitudes. These first comparisons highlight the potential for using EarthCARE observations to evaluate regional climate models and provide directions for further development of RACMO."

It further includes a novel estimate of organic carbon across diverse water bodies and the results of an optical water type classification. The dataset and its underlying algorithm provide a valuable foundation for future oceanographic and limnological analyses. 
 Despite advances in remote sensing, consistent monitoring of water quality across freshwater-marine systems remains challenging due to methodological fragmentation. Here, we provide an overview of an exemplary dataset on water quality characteristics in inland waters, coasts, and the open sea estimated from optical satellite data (https://doi.org/10.26050/WDCC/AquaINFRA_Sentinel3_v2, Hieronymi et al., 2025). Specifically, this is Sentinel-3 OLCI (Ocean and Land Colour Instrument) data for the entire North Sea and Baltic Sea region for the period June to September 2023. The dataset includes daily aggregated observational data with a spatial resolution of approximately 300 m of reflectance at the top-of-atmosphere and for cloud-free water areas remote-sensing reflectance, inherent optical properties of the water, and an estimation of the concentrations of water constituents, e.g. related to the aquatic carbon content. These are the results of the novel A4O atmospheric correction and the ONNS water algorithm. The dataset serves as a prototype for understanding the processing chain and interdependencies, but also for developing a high degree of connectivity for answering various scientific questions; we do not perform an actual validation of the 73 individual parameters in the dataset. The challenges of a validation covering all water types are illustrated using one parameter, the particulate organic carbon concentration in water. The aim of this work is to show how fragmentation in water quality monitoring along the aquatic continuum from lakes, rivers to the sea can be overcome by applying an optical water type-specific and neural network-based processing scheme for Copernicus satellite data. Emphasis of this work is on analysing the optical complexity of remote-sensing reflectance in the North Sea, Baltic Sea, coastal, and inland waters. Results of a new optical water type classification show that almost all (99.7 %) remote-sensing reflectance spectra delivered by A4O are classifiable and that, based on this data, the region exhibits the full range of optical diversity of natural water bodies. The dataset can serve as a blueprint for a holistic view of the aquatic environment and is a step towards an observation-based digital twin component of the complex system."

Here we present the Global Forest Cover map of year 2020, derived from the combination of most recent publicly available land cover and land use datasets. The map is a globally-consistent representation of the presence/absence of forests based on EUDR definitions, but its use is not mandatory, not exclusive and not legally binding. 
 Remote sensing-based observations are used to map tree cover extent, estimate canopy height, detect disturbances, and classify land cover and land use. However, comprehensive global information on forest cover, capturing both physical characteristics and land use components as defined by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), remains limited. Here, we present a harmonized and globally consistent map of forest presence or absence at 10 m spatial resolution for the year 2020, hereafter referred to as GFC2020. Our approach combines multiple spatial datasets, primarily derived from Earth observation (EO), to harness their complementary strengths within a transparent, flexible, and open science framework. GFC2020 maps 4562 million hectares (Mha) of forests globally, which is 9.5 % more than the estimate from latest FAO Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) for 2020. GFC2020 forest area does not include 578 Mha of tree cover (11 % of the global tree cover area) because these areas do not meet the height threshold or occur on agricultural or urban land. Conversely, around 0.6 % (∼ 25 Mha) of the area classified as forest in GFC2020 is unstocked, due to forest management practices or natural disturbances such as fire. Based on the reinterpretation of a previously collected reference set of 21 752 sample units, GFC2020 achieves an overall accuracy of 91 %, with a commission error of 18 % and an omission error of 8 % for forest. Improvements in EO products, such as better detection of trees in dry and open landscapes, distinguishing natural from human drivers of forest disturbance, mapping tree crops at high spatial resolution or identifying agroforestry systems, will contribute to enhancing future versions of GFC2020. The shift from tree cover to forest cover mapping is not only essential for ecological and climate-related applications but also provides new opportunities to support policy needs. GFC2020 is one of many tools to inform the deforestation risk assessments under supply chain oriented regulations such as the European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR).

Using artificial intelligence, we mapped global atmospheric ice. This continuous record fills critical gaps in observation. It provides scientists with a vital tool to improve weather forecasts and better understand how atmospheric ice interacts with the global climate system. 
 This study introduces FYAI, a global, long-term atmospheric ice water path (IWP) and suspended ice water path (SIWP) dataset spanning 2010–2024, derived from passive microwave observations (MWHS-I/II) onboard China's Fengyun-3 series satellites. The dataset is generated using a machine learning framework featuring a lightweight multilayer perceptron architecture enhanced with gated residual units. This design robustly handles the inherent uncertainties in satellite brightness temperatures and the spatial mismatch between passive microwave footprints and active radar/lidar training data. By establishing rigorous spatiotemporal collocation with CloudSat 2C-ICE products, FYAI provides two operational product levels adhering to standard Earth observation data processing definitions: (1) Level-2 (L2) products, offering instantaneous orbital-resolution IWP and SIWP at a nominal 15 km nadir resolution for 2010–2024; and (2) Level-3 (L3) products, comprising monthly global gridded composites at 1°×1° resolution (2010–2024). FYAI bridges the gap between instantaneous pixel-level precision and broad spatiotemporal coverage, offering a comprehensive, decadal-scale record of global atmospheric ice content. This dataset, specifically designed to support long-term climate analysis and model validation, is openly available in netCDF4 format for community use (https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.303143, Yang et al., 2025)"

Using careful quality checks and two new methods, we improved the accuracy of these atmospheric profiles. The dataset reveals a gentle warming close to the surface and frequent wintertime temperature inversions, which rise during heavy pollution. These findings help improve weather, climate, and air-quality studies. 
 Ground-based microwave radiometers (MWRs) are indispensable instruments for the continuous observation of atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles. The reliability of brightness temperature (TB) measurements and the accuracy of retrieved atmospheric profiles are fundamental to their effective use in both research and operational applications. In this study, we present a long-term dataset of multi-channel microwave brightness temperature observations and corresponding retrieved atmospheric profiles derived from the RPG-HATPRO MWR deployed at the Xianghe Integrated Observatory (XH) in Hebei Province, China, covering the period 2013–2022. Minute-level TB observations over the 10-year period were integrated with collocated infrared cloud detection data to establish a comprehensive dataset featuring a detailed weather-type classification. The quality of the observed TBs was carefully evaluated using a radiative transfer model. The results demonstrate excellent agreement between simulated and observed multi-channel TBs, with correlation coefficients typically exceeding 0.96 and mean biases within 1 K, confirming the stable and reliable performance of the XH MWR throughout the entire observation period. Based on the quality-controlled TBs, two retrieval schemes for atmospheric temperature and humidity profiles were developed using collocated radiosonde observations and ERA5 reanalysis data. For clear-sky conditions, an optimal estimation (OE)-based retrieval model was employed, whereas a deep neural network (DNN)-based model was designed for cloudy-sky retrievals. Validation against radiosonde measurements shows that both retrieval schemes achieved substantially improved accuracy up to 35 % for temperature and 25 % for humidity profiles by compared with the MWR’s self-developed products. Combining the two retrieval models with the 10-year quality-controlled TB dataset, we constructed a comprehensive data record characterized by decadal-scale, high temporal resolution (1~10 min), and integrated MWR observations and profiles dataset. Based on the long-term dataset, it reveals a weak but consistent near-surface warming trend across 100–1000 m. They also capture the frequent surface-based inversions, occurred from 6 % in summer to 68 % in winter. Critically, SBI occurrence increases with PM2.5 levels, reaching >60 % under severe pollution (>250 µg m⁻³).

It fills a critical data gap, enabling detailed spatiotemporal analysis of these events. This validated resource provides a solid foundation for investigating stratosphere-troposphere transport and its impacts on near-surface air quality and extreme weather. 
 Tropopause folds are a primary mechanism for stratosphere-to-troposphere transport (STT), significantly influencing tropospheric ozone, air quality, and regional weather. However, a multi-year, high-resolution folding dataset for China has been lacking. To address this gap, we developed a comprehensive tropopause folding dataset for China and its surrounding regions using the ERA5 reanalysis data and a three-dimensional labeling method for the period 2014–2023. This dataset is distinguished by its decade-long coverage (2014–2023) and an unprecedented combination of high spatial (0.25°×0.25°) and temporal (hourly) resolutions across 37 vertical levels, which collectively facilitate a detailed analysis of the spatiotemporal characteristics of folds in these regions. We validated the dataset's accuracy and its capability to capture the full evolution of folding events by comparing it with global datasets and multiple case studies of stratospheric intrusions. The high-resolution dataset not only aligns with large-scale climatology from previous studies but also resolves finer details that were previously smoothed out. Furthermore, this dataset reveals the distinct spatiotemporal distribution of tropopause folds over China. Folding events over China were found to occur predominantly in winter and spring, with significantly lower frequencies in summer and autumn. Spatially, shallow folds are concentrated along the subtropical jet stream, while medium folds peak over the Tibetan Plateau and Sichuan Basin in winter. Deep folds, though less frequent, have a notable impact on southwestern China, including the Tibetan Plateau, where they can substantially affect surface ozone levels. This dataset provides a solid foundation for in-depth investigations of STT mechanisms and the subsequent impacts of tropopause folds on near-surface atmospheric composition and extreme weather events, thereby serving as a valuable resource for the atmospheric science community."

However, the metabolic transformation of soot particles, a key link between soot exposure and health outcomes, remains poorly understood. Here, we develop a novel bottom-up method to rapidly synthesize 13C-labeled soot, enabling in vivo tracking of soot metabolism by mass spectrometry. In vitro metabolic experiments utilizing human liver postmitochondrial liver supernatant (S9) fractions show the potential involvement of soot in human endogenous metabolism. Using animal exposure models combined with nontargeted metabolic flux analysis, we further demonstrate that soot particles can be utilized as a carbon source by the organism and directly integrated into biological metabolic processes, subsequently affecting metabolites and potential pathways associated with diseases. Our findings suggest that no clear-cut boundary exists between exogenous inert soot particles and endogenous metabolites, offering novel insights into the “black box” of internal exposure of air pollution and their associated pathogenic mechanisms."

Here we show that SO2 autoxidation is largely accelerated by surface-active organic acids such as dicarboxylic acids (DCAs) in deliquesced organic aerosol particles. Specifically, the sulfate formation rate in DCA particles (i.e., glutaric, succinic, and malonic acids) is 2–3 orders of magnitude higher than in inorganic particles under identical buffered pH and ionic strength conditions, and is 4–5 orders of magnitude higher than in solutions. We find that the reaction rate is proportional to the surface-to-volume ratio (1/R) of individual deliquesced aerosols by TEM-EDS, suggesting that the aerosol surface is involved. Combining experimental results with theoretical simulations, we reveal that the enrichment of DCAs at the air–water interface of aerosols enhances SO2 autoxidation by promoting the surface uptake of SO2 and accelerating the oxidation of HSO3– by O2 within a distinct subsurface region. These findings suggest that the subsurface of aerosols may serve as a previously unrecognized hotspot for multiphase oxidation of SO2, and that organic-acid-accelerated SO2 autoxidation can occur at rates comparable to the H2O2 oxidation pathway."

Here, we report that Mn minerals exhibit unexpectedly high photochemical reactivity for the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). Through systematic evaluation of five representative Mn minerals (pyrolusite, psilomelane, rhodochrosite, hausmannite, and vernadite), we revealed •OH production rates reaching 16.2–168.6 μM over 120 min sunlight irradiation. Both valence band (VB) water oxidation and conduction band (CB) oxygen reduction contributed to ROS productions, with relative contributions varying among minerals. Remarkably, ROS yields from Mn minerals exceed those from Fe minerals by more than an order of magnitude; for instance, vernadite exhibited a steady-state •OH concentration of 4.9 × 10–16 M, compared to 9.5 × 10–18 M for hematite. Higher ROS production correlated with greater charge separation efficiency, as indicated by high photocurrent densities (e.g., 2.5 × 10–6 A cm–2 for vernadite) and substantial photoinduced surface potential shifts (e.g., +150 mV for vernadite). The •OH generated by Mn minerals oxidized aromatic-rich natural organic matter (NOM) into more labile forms and reshapes the microbial community composition. These results indicate that Mn minerals are an important and previously underappreciated source of ROS in sunlit environments, with implications on oxidative processes at mineral–water interfaces and their role in global biogeochemical cycles."

Herein, we investigate the spatiotemporal patterns of perchlorate contamination in China’s largest fireworks production regions, observing a significant ″accumulation corridor″ aligning with the industrial clustering zones. We developed a knowledge-guided framework, integrating process-based hydrology with deep learning, to predict perchlorate concentration dynamics at the basin scale. The model outperforms traditional data-driven approaches in capturing long-term trends and episodic peaks while leveraging Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) gates to distinguish point versus nonpoint sources. We demonstrate that industrial point sources contribute ∼65% of total corridor loads, whereas nonpoint loads are seasonally amplified, with rainy-season fluxes 1.7–2.8× higher than dry seasons. Attention analysis identifies that average fireworks factory density, precipitation, and soil properties are dominant drivers for nonpoint perchlorate sources. Furthermore, multiscenario simulations indicate that coordinated controls on point, nonpoint, and upstream boundary inputs substantially reduce exceedance frequency within the simulated ensembles. This work provides a transferable framework that converts fragmented observations into basin-scale diagnosis and scenario-based decision support for industrial contaminant risks, contingent on local monitoring, industrial structure information, and regulatory setting."

While studies in heavily polluted megacities (e.g., Beijing) have typically revealed high nucleation rates coupled with slow particle growth, the mechanisms governing NPF under moderate pollution regimes remain poorly understood. Here, we report a distinct NPF pattern in the coastal city of Xiamen, characterized by relatively low nucleation rates but exceptionally rapid particle growth. Field observations and model simulations show that anthropogenic oxygenated organic molecules (OOMs), rather than sulfuric acid, dominate particle growth from the sub-3 nm size range. Despite a modest nucleation rate (J1.7 = 1.2 cm3 s–1), the observed high growth rate (GR7–15 = 7.2 nm h–1) is largely attributable to condensable organic vapors from anthropogenic sources. This efficient, anthropogenically driven growth pathway suggests that NPF could play a more substantial role in aerosol formation in many moderately polluted urban environments than currently recognized. We therefore urge the integration of such anthropogenic organic-driven growth mechanisms into atmospheric models to improve climate predictions."

In natural waters, cyanobacteria are often surrounded by symbiotic bacteria, whose influence on ozonation performance and underlying mechanisms remains unclear. Herein, we found that axenic filamentous cyanobacteria (Leptolyngbya sp.) exhibited strong resistance to ozonation (0.3 mg L–1, 20 min), whereas the presence of surface-associated bacteria markedly increased the cell rupture rate from 12 ± 6% to 76 ± 2%. Removal of loosely bound extracellular polymeric substances (LB-EPS) significantly reduced ozonation resistance in axenic cyanobacteria but unexpectedly enhanced that of xenic cultures. By integrating reactive oxygen species identification, extracellular metabolomics, and metabolic reconstruction, we demonstrate that surface-colonizing bacteria degrade the algal LB-EPS envelope, releasing metabolites that facilitate hydroxyl radical formation during ozonation, thereby intensifying cell rupture. Our results highlight surface-associated bacteria as a critical yet overlooked factor shaping cyanobacterial responses to preozonation, underscoring the need to re-evaluate ozone application strategies in bloom-impacted waters to minimize cell rupture and byproduct formation."

OA undergoes dynamic aging processes in the atmosphere, with photolytic aging induced by ultraviolet solar irradiance being an important yet poorly characterized mechanism. Knowledge gaps persist regarding the role of volatility transformations during photolytic aging on the OA mass decay kinetics and the evolution of climate-relevant properties, such as hygroscopicity, hindering the model evaluation of OA spatiotemporal distributions and atmospheric budgets. In this study, we conduct isothermal photolytic aging experiments on both laboratory-generated secondary organic aerosols and ambient-collected particles from urban Atlanta, utilizing a high-sensitivity Quartz Crystal Microbalance. Our results reveal that photolytic aging reduces 40–66% of the low-volatility OA mass with lifetimes ranging from 8 to 200 h under solar irradiance, and 44–92% of the photolytic mass loss is through slow evaporation of semi- or intermediate-volatile products, kinetically limited by their volatility. We observe up to ±50% changes in OA hygroscopicity with the transformation of fresh OA to photorecalcitrant low-volatility products, associated with changes in oxygen-to-carbon ratio and molecular weight. A kinetic model incorporating photolytic volatility transformation provides a cohesive explanation for the observed photolysis-induced changes in mass, volatility, and hygroscopicity. Our results can help constrain model representation of the dynamic evolutions of mass and climate-relevant properties during photolytic aging processes of the ambient OA, improving our understanding of OA atmospheric behavior and climate impact."

However, the origins of the critical class of small-molecule OSs (e.g., C2–C3 OSs) in ambient aerosols remain ambiguous. We investigated the abundance and composition of C2–C3 OSs in wintertime PM2.5 across 11 Chinese cities, along with their occurrence in primary aerosols from biomass burning, coal combustion, and vehicle emissions. Total C2–C3 OS abundance was higher in northern China than in southern China. The transformation of biogenic volatile organic compounds was a larger source of C2–C3 OSs in southern China (∼66%), whereas anthropogenic contributions (including biomass and coal combustion) dominated in the north. All investigated C2–C3 OSs were detected in primary combustion aerosols. The emission factor of total C2–C3 OSs in fresh PM2.5 generated from biomass burning was 0.42 ± 0.20 mg kg–1. The contribution of primary combustion sources likely led to a decrease in the proportion of secondarily formed C2–C3 OSs, particularly in northern China. Furthermore, reducing primary emissions caused by clean heating policies can markedly mitigate aerosol C2–C3 OS pollution, as exemplified by Beijing. This study provides novel field evidence for the primary emissions of aerosol C2–C3 OSs."

Impacts in many areas begin during the mid‐Holocene but emergence of a signal varies spatially with earliest impacts over Europe, China and the North Atlantic.

Triton's orbit around Neptune, whilst nearly completely circular, is highly inclined, with an inclination of approximately 157° to Neptune's equator. This results in a rotation signal strength and frequency which has significant orbital dependence, unlike at other ocean worlds.

These pollution events coincide with agricultural waste burning, emitting large quantities of carbon monoxide (CO) into the troposphere. Using 18 years of Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) measurements from the Metop satellites, we examined the interannual variability of CO concentrations over the IGP during the post‐monsoon season from 2007 to 2024. We focused on three representative years with varying CO levels (2011, 2017, and 2024) to determine whether CO pollution events in the IGP were more influenced by fire intensity, represented by the Fire Radiative Power (FRP) from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometers, or by meteorological parameters, particularly average winds in the 0–2 km layer, provided by ERA5 reanalysis. The comparison of wind patterns and FRP showed that surface winds primarily drive CO pollution severity. Extreme CO concentrations were found in 2017 and 2024 which coincided with prolonged periods of weak surface winds. In contrast, 2011 exhibited moderate CO concentrations throughout the post‐monsoon season due to stronger winds, despite higher FRP. Our findings highlight the influence of surface winds in conditioning extreme post‐monsoon pollution episodes in the IGP and demonstrate the ability of IASI for long‐term monitoring of regional air pollution caused by agricultural waste burning. However, these results rely on the accurate detection of fire activity, which remains challenging due to limitations in satellite observations and changes in agricultural practices."

Here, combining oxygen isotope records with isotope-enabled climate simulations, we identify a pronounced east-west contrast in glacial-interglacial oxygen isotope amplitudes between South Asia (larger changes) and eastern China (muted signal), despite comparable precipitation changes. This contrast is driven primarily by ice-sheet forcing, with opposing effects from orbital and greenhouse-gas further damping the isotope response in eastern China. Water-tagging experiments reveal that the weaker eastern China signal reflects competing processes: depletion primarily driven by increased Pacific-sourced moisture from a strengthened northwestward-shifted Western Pacific Subtropical High, alongside enrichment resulting from reduced rainout and enhanced local recycling over the marginal seas. These findings mechanistically reconcile puzzling differences between water isotope and other hydrological proxies across monsoon region on glacial-interglacial variability. A weak glacial-interglacial isotopic signal in eastern China reflects compensatory processes in atmospheric moisture routing and local recycling, primarily orchestrated by ice-sheet forcing, according to speleothem records, climate simulations, and water-tagging experiments."

 Alpine rivers are becoming increasingly exposed to atmospheric heatwaves. Because of their strong relationship with air temperature, rivers can experience persistent heat anomalies, known as riverine heatwaves, which can have serious consequences for river ecosystems and the economy. This study aims to improve our understanding of how river water temperature responds to atmospheric heatwaves by focusing on the interplay of various hydro-climatic variables that can strengthen or weaken the thermal sensitivity of rivers to such events. Our results show that the response of water temperature to atmospheric heatwaves can vary substantially, with only 47% of atmospheric heatwaves leading to riverine heatwaves. Riverine heatwave development can be prevented by positive anomalies in discharge and meltwater, while negative anomalies in discharge strengthen the link between atmospheric and river temperatures. Future changes in these hydro-climatic conditions will likely increase the sensitivity of Alpine rivers to atmospheric heatwaves. Only half of atmospheric heatwaves trigger riverine ones because high discharge and meltwater act as buffers while low discharge strengthens the air-river temperature link, according to water temperature and discharge observations from 275 Alpine catchments."

 A 10-fold enhancement of lithium atoms was detected at 96 km altitude by a resonance lidar at Kühlungsborn, Germany, approximately 20 hours after the uncontrolled re-entry of a Falcon 9 upper stage. The upper-atmospheric extension of the ICON general circulation model, nudged to ECMWF, was used to calculate winds. Backwards trajectories, including wind variability as measured by radar, traced air masses to the Falcon 9 re-entry path at 100 km altitude, west of Ireland. This study presents the first measurement of upper-atmospheric pollution resulting from space debris re-entry and the first observational evidence that the ablation of space debris can be detected by ground-based lidar. The analysis of geomagnetic conditions, atmospheric dynamics, and ionospheric measurements supports the claim that the enhancement was not of natural origin. Our findings demonstrate that identifying pollutants and tracing them to their sources is achievable, with significant implications for monitoring and mitigating space emissions in the atmosphere.

VH. 
 This study aims to investigate the potential of sub-diurnal C-band radar data for maize crop monitoring. To this end, a tower-based experiment equipped with a C-band radar antenna (15-min acquisition interval) was conducted in a maize field in 2021. In situ measurements of soil and vegetation were carried out between September and December 2021. To analyze the radar response to plant water stress, a period of induced stress was implemented around the development peak. Both the temporal coherence (ρ) and radar backscattering coefficient (σ 0) are analyzed. The analysis shows that the temporal coherence exhibits a marked daily cycle. More specifically, a morning drop (Δ|ρ|morning) was observed prior to the onset of wind. Previous studies on wheat crops and olive orchards have attributed this drop to the onset of the plant's physiological activity at dawn. The daily mean σ0 values across all three polarizations were strongly correlated with both evapotranspiration (ETR) and evaporative fraction during both the growth and maturity stages (r > 0.60). This observed correlation is due to structural changes in the canopy as vegetation grows, associated with increased transpiration. Despite significant differences in acquisition configurations between tower-based radar measurements and Sentinel-1, a remarkable overall agreement is observed between both datasets. In contrast to ρ, Sentinel-1 σ 0 detects the water stress period, with a decrease of about 2 dB coinciding with intensifying water stress. These findings emphasize the importance of disentangling physiological drivers from structural indicators when interpreting σ0 dynamics in relation to plant–water interactions."

 Understanding the temporal scales that govern aerosol build-up and persistence is essential for diagnosing urban air-quality variability under complex atmospheric forcing. This study develops a multi-parametric, frequency-domain framework for 131 non-attainment cities across India’s National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) using CEEMDAN decomposition. A combined Earth Observation and reanalysis dataset is used to extract frequency-domain variability, with independent in-situ PM2.5 observations employed for validation.Each parameter is decomposed into Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs), and their normalized energies are integrated into multi-parameter spectral signatures to identify coherent regimes of atmospheric variability. Seven characteristic cluster types are identified, reflecting synoptic-dominated regimes, turbulence-driven regimes, hybrid synoptic–turbulent modes, and mixed regimes shaped by persistent thermal or moisture anomalies. These signatures differentiate cities regulated by slow-evolving aerosol–moisture coupling from those driven by rapid boundary-layer or wind-shear fluctuations. Winter clusters capture inversion-linked stagnation, pre-monsoon clusters reflect dust-modulated synoptic forcing, monsoon clusters align with convective–stratiform transitions, and post-monsoon clusters are shaped by biomass burning and shallow boundary layers.The framework translates frequency-domain variability into physically interpretable ventilation regimes, offering the first demonstration of how signal decomposition can quantify intrinsic atmospheric capacity for pollutant accumulation and dispersion at the city scale. These insights enable a process-based classification of NCAP cities, supporting dynamic airshed characterization and season-specific emission-control planning."

Alongside orographic influences, urban areas can also act to intensify storms, but their impact on heavy rainfall in high elevations has not yet been investigated in detail. Here, we quantify the contribution of a high-altitude city to both rainfall intensification and its daytime and nighttime patterns, focusing on the city of Cuenca in the Ecuadorian Andes. Modeling several observed storms with and without the city suggests that the urban area can enhance downstream precipitation by over 20% over a pre-existing hotspot of orographically induced precipitation. This urban-induced rainfall intensification seems to exceed that observed for cities of comparable size outside mountainous regions. This may be explained by Cuenca’s valley setting and its high humidity compared to its surroundings, suggesting that high-altitude cities with similar morphologies could amplify combined orographic-dynamic and urban-thermodynamic effects."

Understanding the drivers of N2O fluxes remains elusive, making it difficult to predict emissions in time and space and to develop and evaluate ways to lower emissions through management. Major scientific uncertainties underlying the understanding of the drivers of N2O fluxes identified in a workshop of N2O emissions experts include poor process-based understanding of controls on soil N2O emissions in the field; insufficient data to reduce uncertainty in N2O budgets from the field to regional scales, including N2O emission measurements and importantly, field-scale N balances; and high uncertainty in model predictions of soil N2O emissions across environmental and management conditions. To reduce these uncertainties, we present the concept of N2Onet, a global collaborative initiative to accelerate advances in N2O measurement, analyses, and mitigation. N2Onet will serve as an observational network of supersites with multi-scale measurements; a database hub for N2O flux and ancillary data; and a catalyst for community building, information sharing, and training.

However, such extreme events are mostly studied based on air temperature that does not fully capture thermal stress on Earth’s surface layer. Here we explored the evolution of global heatwaves from near-surface air, land surface, to subsurface soils worldwide during 1980–2024. Results show heatwaves have strengthened across all layers, with a pronounced acceleration since the early 21st century. Relative to air and land surface, soils generally exhibit a greater heatwave exposure and severity. The peak intensity weakens as depth increases, with inter-layer differences closely linked to soil moisture, clay, and organic carbon content. The northern high latitudes are more prone to events of greater severity, particularly during summer, while lower latitudes and the Southern Hemisphere are characterized by events of greater persistence. Forests tend to buffer heat extremes, whereas non-forest land covers readily amplify heat exposure. Our findings imply that reliance on air temperature alone might underestimate heatwave risks to soil ecosystems, and soil temperature should be incorporated into monitoring and early-warning systems."

This study identified distinct QDV in TCG during June–October, characterized by two leading empirical orthogonal function (EOF) modes. The first mode (EOF1) exhibits a north-south dipole pattern and is indirectly modulated by solar variability through circulation anomalies over the mid-latitude North Pacific. The second mode (EOF2) exhibits a west-east dipole pattern and is driven by internal variability linked to the Pacific Quasi-decadal Oscillation (PQDO), represented by sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTa) in the tropical central Pacific (TCP). Both modes strongly correlate (r > 0.83) with key regional indicators: regional mean 200 hPa geopotential height (150° E–180°, 34° N–44° N) and SSTa (164° E–164° W, 10° S–10° N). The direct influence of solar variability on TCG is weak, primarily due to offsetting effects of solar-associated in-phase SSTa between the mid-latitude North Pacific and the TCP. Solar variability and PQDO affect TCG primarily through dynamic factors, explaining about 85% of TCG changes, with relative vorticity contributing around 30%. These findings highlight the complex interplay between solar and internal forcings in modulating TCG, providing valuable insights for improving long-term TC forecasts."

While the amplification of intraseasonal rainfall variability across Australia has been reported, the spatial heterogeneity of this intensification has been overlooked. Here, we observe that the intraseasonal rainfall variability has been intensified, particularly over northeastern Australia during the wet season (November–April) over the past four decades. The intensified intraseasonal rainfall variability is primarily attributed to enhanced intensity of precipitation events, rather than drier spells. Moisture budget analysis indicates that the intensification of intraseasonal abnormal rainfall events over northeastern Australia is primarily due to the strengthened vertical advection of background moisture caused by the intraseasonal vertical motion anomalies. In this process, the strengthening of intraseasonal vertical velocity driven by changes in intraseasonal wind convergence plays a dominant role, accounting for over 90%, whereas the effect of background moisture changes is relatively less significant. Our findings highlight northeastern Australia as a hotspot for amplified intraseasonal rainfall variability, rather than the whole of Australia. This study provides fundamental insights into northern Australia’s changing climate, and highlights the important role of intraseasonal circulation on northeastern Australia rainfall variability."

The results showed that COF2 has a much lower global warming potential than conventional fluorinated gases. Thus, it validates the use of COF2 as a sustainable alternative for reducing the climate impact of semiconductor and display manufacturing processes. 
 Carbonyl fluoride (COF2) has gained interest as a low-GWP replacement candidate for the high-GWP fluorinated gases employed in semiconductor and display manufacturing. In this study, the infrared absorption cross-section of COF2 was experimentally measured using Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, and its radiative efficiency was determined to be 0.119 W m−2 ppb−1 using the stratospheric-adjusted Pinnock curve. Atmospheric e-folding lifetimes derived from exponential decay measurements were 7.56 h in dry O2 and 54.86 and 36.67 min under low- and high-humidity ambient air, respectively. Incorporation of these lifetimes into the absolute GWP framework yielded GWP100 values of 4.05×10-4 (dry air), 6.82×10-6 (low humidity), and 3.16×10-6 (high humidity), demonstrating that rapid hydrolysis in the presence of water vapor suppresses the climate impact of COF2 to effectively zero under typical tropospheric conditions. Because CO2 is the terminal atmospheric degradation product, the long-term climate impact of COF2 emissions is equivalent to releasing only the stoichiometrically corresponding amount of CO2. These findings provide a fully experimental basis for determining the GWP100 of COF2 under atmospherically relevant conditions and demonstrate that its GWP100 is effectively near zero. This experimentally validated assessment confirms that COF2 is a viable low-GWP replacement gas for chamber-cleaning applications in semiconductor and display manufacturing."

Ozone concentrations at this level have important implications for atmospheric chemistry and circulation. In this work, we explore how tropical tropopause ozone varies in observations and chemistry-climate models. We show that fluctuations in the elevation of the tropical tropopause play a role in controlling the nearby ozone levels, with implications for future climate and stratospheric ozone. 
 Ozone is a key radiative species near the tropical tropopause, which acts as a gateway to the stratosphere for ascending air. Ozone concentrations at fixed heights in this region fluctuate seasonally and interannually as the strength of stratospheric upwelling varies, influencing local temperatures and stratospheric composition. Models ranging in complexity suggest that an accelerated stratospheric circulation, along with tropospheric expansion, could reduce tropical lower stratospheric ozone following surface warming. These modes of variability are often equated with variability at the tropical tropopause; however, tropopause height varies seasonally and interannually, and it is expected to rise as Earth's surface warms. Here, we explore how tropical tropopause ozone varies when considering changes to tropopause pressure. We first examine 15 years of MERRA-2 reanalysis data to distinguish variability at the tropical tropopause from nearby fixed pressure levels on annual-to-interannual timescales. We show that changes to tropopause pressure drive ozone's annual cycle at the tropical tropopause to be substantially smaller and out of phase from those at 95 or 105 hPa. We then investigate how tropical tropopause ozone responds to surface warming under a range of forcing scenarios using output from the Chemistry-Climate Modeling Initiative (CCMI). We find that pressure-dependent ozone production coupled with tropospheric expansion leads tropical tropopause ozone variability to remain distinct from fixed pressure levels following surface warming, with divergent trends in the strongest forcing scenario. Finally, we show that increases to tropical tropopause ozone correspond with local warming in CCMI projections, while tropospheric expansion increases lower stratospheric ozone."

 Since the Clean Air Act was implemented in 2013, China has witnessed a reduction of over 50 % in the annual average concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Despite emission cuts, the formation mechanism of secondary organic aerosols (SOA), a crucial constituent of PM2.5, remains inadequately understood. In this study, we performed a model-assisted analysis of field sampling data collected in Shijiazhuang. The results show that, compared to 2014, the contribution of SOA to the total organics (from 27 % in 2014 to 75 % in 2024) exceeded that of primary organic aerosol (POA) during the winter haze in 2024. The current model, which includes SOA formation pathways involving aromatic oxidation, aqueous formation, and SVOC/IVOC oxidation, underestimates the measured SOA levels by 60 % in 2024. However, incorporating the transformation of transported POA into SOA (accounting for up to 50 % of SOA) under high relative humidity (RH) conditions helps bridge the gap between model predictions and field measurements. The pathway of SOA formation via POA aging is consistent with the identified POA aging factor derived from biomass burning and coal combustion. The increase in SOA contribution occurred amidst large emission reductions, which accounted for 70 % of the decline in POA levels, while meteorological factors contributed an additional 10 %. Increased contribution of SOA was also found in other North China Plains areas, which underscores the pressing necessity for coordinated regional initiatives to effectively mitigate SOA levels across the NCP, thereby tackling the transboundary nature of air pollution."

Welton,Volcanic plume height during the 2021 Tajogaite eruption (La Palma) from two complementary monitoring methods – implications for satellite-based products,"This manuscript describes the instrumental coverage deployed during the Tajogaite eruption (19 September–25 December 2021) by the Instituto Geográfico Nacional (IGN), the Spanish State Meteorological Agency (AEMET), and other Spanish members of ACTRIS (Aerosol, Clouds and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure) to monitor its atmospheric impact. Two complementary methods provide consistent plume height data for future operational surveillance. 
 Volcanic emissions from the Tajogaite volcano, located on the Cumbre Vieja edifice on the island of La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain), caused significant public health and aviation disruptions throughout the eruption (19 September–13 December 2021, officially declared over on 25 December). Nonetheless, it is considered the most significant volcanic event in Europe over the past 75 years due to the substantial amount of SO2 released into the atmosphere. The Instituto Geográfico Nacional (IGN), the authority responsible for volcano surveillance in Spain, implemented extensive operational monitoring to track volcanic activity and to provide a robust estimation of the volcanic plume height using a video-surveillance network. In parallel, the State Meteorological Agency of Spain (AEMET), in partnership with other Spanish ACTRIS (Aerosol, Clouds, and Trace Gases Research Infrastructure) members and collaborating institutions, conducted an unprecedented instrumental deployment to evaluate the impacts of this volcanic event on atmospheric composition. This effort included a network of aerosol profilers surrounding the volcano. A total of four profiling instruments were installed on La Palma: one MPL-4B lidar and three ceilometers. Additionally, a pre-existing Raman lidar on the island contributed valuable data to this study. These efforts are undertaken due to the importance of monitoring volcanic plume height in terms of air quality (necessary for the implementation of effective civil protection policies), volcanic activity surveillance (for tracking and forecasting eruptive behaviour), and, from a scientific perspective, for improving our understanding of the climatic and radiative impacts of this type of aerosol.In this study, the eruptive process was characterised in terms of the altitude of the dispersive volcanic plume (hd), measured by both IGN and AEMET-ACTRIS, and the altitude of the eruptive column (hec), measured by IGN. Modulating factors such as seismicity and meteorological conditions were also analysed. The consistency between the two independent and complementary datasets (hd,IGN and hd,AEMET) was assessed throughout the eruption (mean difference of 258.6 m).Our results confirmed the existence of three distinct eruptive phases, encompassing a range of styles from Strombolian explosive to effusive activity. While these phases have been characterised in previous studies, the results of the present work provide complementary information and novel insights from an alternative observational approach, which may be of use in future volcanic crises and will be applied to operational surveillance during such events.A subsequent comparison of hd,AEMET with the Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol layer height product (ALHCALIOP) revealed a systematic underestimation by the satellite product, with a mean difference of 392.2 m.Finally, the impact of using hec in estimating SO2 emissions from the NASA MSVOLSO2L4 satellite-based product was evaluated. When a fixed (standard) plume altitude of 8 km was used instead of the observed hec, the total SO2 emission was significantly underestimated by an average of 56.2 %, and by up to 84.7 %. These findings underscore the importance of accurately determining the volcanic plume height when deriving SO2 emissions from satellite data."

The O3 pollution was found to be transported from inland areas to coastal areas. The transport process can be roughly divided into three phases: downdraft control, horizontal transport, and vertical mixing. 
 Tropical cyclones (TC) exert a profound influence on the dynamics of ground-level ozone (O3) pollution in the Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China's Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao. Although TC-related O3 transport processes are well recognized, their three-dimensional characteristics are still inadequately characterized. This study provides the first comprehensive observational analysis of O3 pollution transport mechanisms in the GBA under the influence of TC, integrating high-temporal-resolution wind profile measurements with hourly meteorological and air quality data and model simulations. The findings indicate that TC activity accounts for 39.9 % of O3 pollution episodes in the region, with pollutants advection from northern mainland areas to coastal cities. When TCs are located at a distance of approximately 1800–2000 km, horizontal transport mechanisms dominate (about 54.26 %), facilitating the conveyance of inland ozone to coastal regions. As the proximity of the TC decreases to within 1000–1700 km, the descending air currents intensify, driving ozone from coastal areas into the boundary layer and resulting in reduced O3 concentrations inland while they increase along the coast. In particular, when TCs approach Taiwan (less than 800 km, NE), increased vertical wind shear occurs about 34.25 % than before, with the contribution of vertical mixing also sharply rising by over 34.15 %. This is especially evident over coastal zones, where it facilitates the injection of free-atmosphere ozone into the boundary layer. This mechanism prolongs surface O3 pollution episodes. Our findings offer critical insights for O3 pollution mitigation strategies in the GBA and are of relevance for other globally significant bay regions susceptible to TC impacts, including Hangzhou Bay (China), Tokyo Bay (Japan), and the Bay of Bengal (India)."

 We describe Global Atmosphere 8.0 and Global Land 9.0 (GA8GL9) that are science configurations of the Met Office Unified Model and Joint UK Land Environment Simulator (JULES) land surface model developed for use across weather and climate timescales. GA8GL9 builds upon GA7GL7. It not only consolidates the changes made for the climate branch configuration GA7.1GL7.1 (the atmosphere and land components of the physical model used in HadGEM3-GC3.1, UKESM1 and UKESM1.1 which were all used in the Met Office's CMIP6 submissions) and NWP branch configuration GA7.2GL8.1 (the operational global NWP model at the Met Office between 2019 and 2022), but also includes developments to most areas of the science. Some of the key changes include: prognostic-based entrainment, which adds convective memory and improves precipitation rates and spatial structures; time-smoothed convective increments, which improves the convection-dynamics coupling and greatly reduces the detrimental dynamical effects of convective intermittency; a new riming parametrisation, which increases the amount of supercooled water and hence reduces Southern Ocean biases; and a package of land surface changes, which improves the forecast of near-surface fields and hence removes the need for the aggregate surface tile in NWP applications. Several changes are  made that reduce numerical artefacts and improve the numerical stability of the model. The NWP and climate performance of GA8GL9 is evaluated against the previous configuration, GA7GL7. In NWP tests GA8GL9 is shown have reduced errors and improved spatial structure. The mean climate in GA8GL9 is shown to be improved relative to GA7GL7 with notable improvements in the top of atmosphere outgoing shortwave radiation. GA8GL9 is the atmosphere and land component of GC4, and GC4 has been used as the operational global NWP model at the Met Office since May 2022."

The absence of a validated UV-LED reactor or a validation protocol may limit its application. The first full-scale UV-LED280 reactor in the Americas was installed at a municipal well for Legionella pneumophila disinfection. USEPA guidance was used to design validation bench- and full-scale tests with two surrogates (MS2 and T1UV). Full-scale parameters were varied over relevant ranges (893–1000 GPM, 90–99% UVT280, 12–100% power levels, and varying LED280 bank operation) to understand effects on performance. The Calculated Dose Approach successfully generated L. pneumophila-tailored UV intensity setpoints and a validated reduction equivalent dose (RED) monitoring equation. Validated L. pneumophila REDs of 3.7–47 mJ/cm2 were found through the incorporation of an L. pneumophila UV sensitivity factor in the equation, not only reducing RED over/underestimation but also removing the need for UVDGM bias factors. The UV-LED280 REDs exceeded the requirements under a variety of extreme conditions. Although this study successfully demonstrates a UV-LED280 reactor and validation approach, guidance specifically addressing UV-LED would provide clarity and assurance to utilities seeking to implement and receive treatment credit with this promising new technology."

Policy gaps and inadequate enforcement exacerbate pollution transfer to under-regulated regions, causing substantial environmental and health problems. To address this, we investigated chronic exposure hazards and developed rapid pollution identification technologies. We recruited 2028 participants from e-waste recycling sites and other industrial parks, profiling their urinary organic pollutant exposome (>200 chemicals), oxidative damage, and metabolome by integrating nontargeted and targeted screening methods. Results showed that exposure to pollutant mixtures was significantly associated with increased oxidative damage to nucleic acids and cholesterol. Moreover, these pollutant mixtures collectively explained 46.2% of the variance in urinary metabolome alterations among e-waste workers. The affected metabolites were primarily associated with inflammatory diseases, metabolic disorders, neurological conditions, and cancers. By identifying e-waste exposure characteristic pollutants, we further developed accurate e-waste exposure prediction models (AUC > 0.986; ACC > 0.938) and derived simplified prediction functions and diagnostic indexes with comparable efficacy, which performed well across populations and industrial settings. Overall, this study underscores the significant health risks of e-waste exposure in occupational workers and offers rapid screening tools for e-waste pollution in informal settings, advancing the repurposing of large-scale national exposure monitoring databases for pollution tracking."

Their occurrence in groundwater, an important drinking water resource, remains underexplored. We investigated 180 PM chemicals in 82 groundwater samples across Saxony, Germany, using freeze-drying and supercritical fluid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (SFC-HRMS). 163 PM chemicals were determined, including pesticides, pharmaceuticals, PFAS, other industrial chemicals, and transformation products; concentrations of 72 compounds are reported in groundwater for the first time; 57 chemicals exhibited detection frequencies >50%. The median total PM chemical concentration was 23 μg L–1, with pesticides (0.77 μg L–1) and pharmaceuticals (0.69 μg L–1) of similar totals and industrial chemicals being much higher (19 μg L–1). Trifluoroacetic acid was the dominant single compound (median of 3.0 μg L–1, n = 81). Median concentrations of single chemicals correlated with physicochemical properties (water solubility, lipophilicity, etc.). Site-specific factors (nitrate, dissolved organic carbon, depth) were also associated with PM chemical levels.

We experimentally determined Kca for 46 diverse VOCs, including carbonyls, aromatics, amines, amides, alkenes, acids, alcohols, furan, and siloxanes. Results showed that compounds with a lower vapor pressure and higher molecular weight exhibited stronger sorption. Water sorbed in cotton contributed less than half an order of magnitude to Kca for most VOCs, except for some highly water-soluble species. Octanol–air partition coefficients (log Koa) correlate well with log Kca for homologous compounds but demonstrate limited predictive capacity across different VOC classes. The predictions of log Kca using methyl cellulose as a cotton surrogate led to deviations of up to one log unit. We developed a polyparameter linear free energy relationship (pp-LFER) model for log Kca prediction based on the experimental data. The model shows good agreement with experimental data (adjusted R2 = 0.73, root-mean-square error ∼ 0.55 log units), providing a useful tool for chemical distribution and exposure assessment. Field investigations further demonstrated that environmental factors (temperature, humidity, particle deposition, and interfering compounds) can induce 1–2 orders of magnitude variation in Kca values compared to controlled laboratory measurements."

However, laboratory studies often examine MP transformation at micromolar (μM) levels due to analytical constraints, potentially overlooking certain MP behaviors under environmentally relevant concentrations. This study investigated the oxidation kinetics (kobs) of model MPs across a wide range of initial concentration (C0), with particular emphasis on the distinct roles of short- and long-lived reactive species (SLRS and LLRS) formed in irradiated dissolved organic matter (DOM) solutions. A generalized kinetic framework was developed and revealed that SLRS, such as triplet-state DOM, dominated MP oxidation at higher C0 (≥μM), while LLRS, primarily DOM radicals, drove MP degradation at sub-μM levels. Laser flash photolysis confirmed that LLRS exhibits much longer lifetimes (∼ms) than SLRS (∼μs), enabling elevated LLRS concentrations under trace MP conditions and significantly enhancing MP oxidation. The observed kobs–C0 relationship features a characteristic “three-platform” behavior governed by RS formation rates, reactivities, and lifetimes. These findings advance our understanding of MP fate under real-world conditions and underscore the critical yet often overlooked role of LLRS in aquatic systems."

Identifying its precursors in source water is necessary for reducing or eliminating NDMA formation. Previous studies focused on model precursors with a dimethylamine group (DMA: −N(CH3)2), missing precursors without DMA that can form NDMA during chloramination. Here, we aimed to develop a new approach enhancing the discovery of various NDMA precursors. By analyzing MS/MS spectra of 39 model NDMA precursors, we identified three diagnostic fragment ions: [C2H6N]+, [C2H7N]•+, and [C2H8N]+. Using these fragments to query the NIST23 MS/MS library revealed 763 candidate compounds. Among 21 commercially available candidates, seven were experimentally confirmed as NDMA precursors through chloramination─four with DMA moieties and three without. Additionally, five drugs lacking DMA were newly identified as NDMA precursors. To facilitate large-scale screening, we developed NitrosAmine Precursor eXplorer (NitraPreX) for nontargeted LC-HRMS analysis. When applied to analyze Suwannee River Humic Acid reference material and real local water samples, NitraPreX tentatively identified over 200 potential NDMA precursors and confirmed two non-DMA-containing compounds, hydroxychloroquine and N,N-bis(2-hydroxyethyl)dodecanamide, as NDMA precursors.

To address this limitation, we developed the HEDGE index (Hazard and Exposure Index from Data-Driven Generation), a data-driven framework integrating real-world exposure with multidimensional hazard profiles. We classified 16 priority PAHs into three distinct hazard subgroups (High-, Medium-, Low-Risk) using an ensemble clustering approach on 16 toxicological and environmental fate descriptors. Subsequently, an interpretable XGBoost machine learning model was trained to identify the key structural drivers, such as density, underlying these classifications. Epidemiological case study in Guangzhou, China, demonstrated that the HEDGE index exhibited improved model fit for daily nonaccidental mortality compared to the traditional toxic equivalency quantity (TEQ) approach (ΔAIC = 6.2). An interquartile range increase in HEDGE-weighted exposure corresponded to a 14.7% (95% CI: 12.5%, 17.0%) rise in total mortality, a risk estimate substantially greater than that from TEQ. The association was robust after adjusting for copollutants.

Analysis of tissue distribution revealed that perfluorophosphonates (PFPAs) preferentially accumulated in liver, exhibiting a pattern similar to but more pronounced than that of legacy PFAS with equivalent chain lengths. Comparison between finless porpoises and minke whales indicated lower PFPA accumulation in the latter, potentially due to reduced metabolic efficiency.

Pellets collected from an affected beach located in Galicia, Spain, along with solvent extracts and aqueous leachates, were subjected to both target and nontarget chemical analyses and tested in a battery of toxicity assays including a green microalga (Raphidocelis subcapitata), a marine copepod (Apocyclops royi), a fish model (Danio rerio), and a human cell line. Chemical screening identified on the order of 50 chemical substances in addition to Tinuvin UV-622, including a range of known plastic additives and nonintentionally added substances (NIAS). Toxicity assays revealed significant growth inhibition and stress-induced cell aggregation in R. subcapitata and acute toxicity causing immobilization in copepods, which could have potential implications in the environment via the disruption of primary producers and food web dynamics. In contrast, zebrafish embryos showed no significant developmental effects, while human cells exhibited modest, time-dependent reductions in viability.

Nevertheless, little is known about how the natural polyphenols influence the environmental behavior of copper sulfide minerals and reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation. In this work, the role of natural polyphenols in the degradation of waterborne emerging contaminants during CuS-x (a composite of Cu2S and CuS) oxygenation was investigated, where protocatechuic acid (PCA) was selected as a representative natural polyphenol. It was demonstrated that PCA could significantly enhance the degradation of target contaminant by substantially boosting surface-bound •OH (•OHbound) generation via a three-electron O2 activation pathway. Experimental analysis and theoretical calculations unveiled that PCA favored the adsorption and activation of O2 on the CuS-x surface, thus facilitating the formation of O2•– (an important precursor of both •OH and singlet oxygen (1O2)). The contributions of 1O2 and •OHbound to contaminant degradation in the CuS-x/PCA system were 31.8% and 60.2%, respectively. Notably, besides PCA itself, the oxidation products (i.e., ortho-quinones and semiquinone radicals) and S vacancies also played a crucial role in accelerating the Cu redox cycle to activate O2. These findings provide valuable insights for advancing sulfide mineral-based green remediation technologies."

The kinetic and mechanisms of PAR reactions with dissolved organic matter (DOM), a major sink and reactive matrix in natural waters, have been poorly understood. In this study, we quantitatively characterized the reactivity of PAR toward diverse DOM isolates using a competitive kinetic method. The second-order rate constants between PAR and DOM isolates (kPAR,DOM) were determined, ranging from (4.0 ± 0.2) × 101 to (4.0 ± 0.2) × 102 L mgC–1 s–1 at pH 7.3. Our results demonstrated that phenolic moieties are the dominant PAR-reactive sites in DOM. The measured kPAR,DOM values correlated strongly with bulk DOM properties, including the phenolic content, electron-donating capacity (EDC), and optical E2/E3, enabling empirical prediction of DOM reactivity toward PAR. Beyond quenching, DOM exhibited dual effects on PAR-mediated contaminant oxidation. Anilines or phenols with an electron-drawing group (e.g., −CN and −Cl) were inhibited through back reduction of their radical cations by DOM, while those with an electron-donating group (e.g., −CH3) were promoted through secondary oxidation by reactive DOM-derived intermediates (RIsDOM).

To facilitate intraurban studies in Denver, Colorado, we developed land use regression models for seven species─copper (Cu), iron (Fe), titanium (Ti), zinc (Zn), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg). As part of the Healthy Start Cohort study, we collected filter-based PM2.5 using personal air samplers at 67 locations across Denver. Sample collection occurred from May 2018 through March 2019, accounting for all meteorological seasons. Exposure models were informed by 83 geospatial covariates, with traffic-related predictors as the strongest and most consistent across models. Model performance was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation and overall, varied by sampling campaign and season, with R2 values ranging from 0 to 0.63. At best, our model predicts Cu and Fe during fall (R2 = 0.56 and 0.63, respectively); whereas it fails to capture species unrelated to traffic year-round (R2 < 0.40). This highlights the influence of missing predictors (e.g., wildfire smoke, atmospheric transport and other meteorological factors) on PM2.5 concentrations and spatial gradients.

There has been growing interest in relying less on accounting-style methods and more on direct emissions measurements. However, translating raw emission measurement data, whether from continuous monitoring systems, aerial flyovers, or operational cause analyses, into emissions inventories is nontrivial, and inventory numbers published by operators often lack any information about the methodology used to produce them. In this paper, we introduce the concept of a comprehensive measurement-based emissions inventory, which represents all emissions across the entire time frame, across all assets, and of all emission sizes for the target scope. We introduce practical extrapolation methods to account for incomplete measurement data across time, space, and emission sizes and focus on the impact that different extrapolation methods can have on the resulting emissions estimate. Understanding these methods is essential to create defensible and comparable emissions inventory reports that adhere to reporting frameworks such as Veritas and the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership 2.0."

Recent field observations reveal a systematic three‐phase evolution in BC coating thickness during plume aging: rapid initial growth, quasi‐equilibrium, and gradual coating loss. Current models misrepresent this evolution due to oversimplified treatment of organic aerosol volatility. Here we demonstrate that incorporating semi‐volatile organic partitioning through the MATRIX‐VBS model fundamentally improves simulation accuracy compared to traditional non‐volatile approaches. Evaluation against four field campaigns spanning fresh to aged plumes shows MATRIX‐VBS successfully captures the observed three‐phase pattern, and global application reveals universal three‐phase evolution with substantial regional variations. These advances address critical gaps in aerosol mixing state representation and provide essential improvements for climate model predictions in wildfire‐affected regions."

Using high‐precision measurements from the Sanya incoherent scatter radar, we discovered a previously overlooked decrease in electron temperature. We report a daytime event and a nighttime event. During daytime, the electron temperature first decreased sharply by ∼650 K within 5.5 min, then increased by ∼1000 K before gradually recovering over ∼1 hr. Multi‐beam observations indicated that this cooling was localized near the rocket trajectory, much narrower than the accompanying electron density depletion. Moreover, the ion temperature increased by 550 K. The nighttime electron and ion temperatures decreased by ∼450 and ∼150 K, respectively, without subsequent electron temperature increase. Analysis indicated that these temperature perturbations resulted from the initial expansion cooling following the exhaust injection and the subsequent hole formation, which disrupted the thermal equilibrium in the ionosphere."

While the plasma instrument, PLS, could have provided an independent density measurement and resolved ambiguity in the PWS analysis, calibrated PLS data were never published from E12. Here we present high‐resolution (∼18 s) PLS moments and velocity distributions from E12. Plasma densities near closest approach were between 398±72cm−3 $398\mathit{\pm }72\,{\text{cm}}^{-3}$ (assuming m/q=16 $m/q=16$) and 563±103cm−3 $563\mathit{\pm }103\,{\text{cm}}^{-3}$ (assuming m/q=32 $m/q=32$), in agreement with the original interpretation of PWS densities by Kurth et al.

In this study, we assess how this relationship is represented in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) at low (110 km), high (25 km), and ultra‐high (3.25 km, SCREAM) resolutions, using the Stage IV and IMERG data as observational references. The convection‐permitting SCREAM performs well in capturing the EPI variations with temperature and saturation deficit under a wide range of atmospheric saturation levels. When the near‐surface atmosphere is close to saturation, observations show a continuous increase in EPI with temperature, a pattern qualitatively well reproduced by SCREAM, although its short simulation of 40 days limits the range of temperature variation needed for a quantitative scaling rate comparison. In contrast, E3SM at 110 and 25 km resolutions produces an increase of EPI with temperature, followed by an erroneous negative scaling at high temperatures, even in saturated conditions. These comparisons are robust across all sample regions covering the midlatitudes, tropics, high altitudes, and mountainous areas, revealing that unless the spatial resolution is high enough to resolve deep convection, model physics dominates over spatial resolution in improving the performance in capturing the emergent relationship between EPI and the environmental drivers. Among other factors, our analyses indicate that the biased EPI scaling with temperature in the low‐ and high‐resolution E3SM simulations might be related to deficiencies in parameterizing the dependence of atmospheric convection on relative humidity."

The flashes occurred in two summer thunderstorms in Florida and were bipolar in that some of the strokes (leader/return‐stroke sequences) in a given flash transported to ground positive charge, while others transported negative charge. Positive strokes tended to have higher NLDN‐reported peak currents and all terminated essentially on the ground surface, each time forming a new channel. Negative strokes tended to terminate on tall towers and all that did so produced characteristic wideband E‐field signatures that exhibited oscillations after the initial peak. Additionally, we examined a negative flash composed of seven strokes all of which terminated on a tall tower. There were a total of three tall (451–497 m) towers involved, with one of them (497‐m tall) being strike object for each of the four flashes examined here. The maximum GLM group energy for positive strokes was one to two orders of magnitude higher than for negative strokes. The oscillating E‐field signatures are indicative of bouncing current waves that are manifestations of the transient response of a tall object to the lightning‐caused excitation at or near its top (e.g., Rakov, 2001, https://doi.org/10.1109/15.974646); it is due to impedance discontinuities at the lightning attachment point and at the ground.

Understanding how rising temperatures influence VPD dynamics is therefore crucial in the context of global warming. In this study, we reconstructed April–August VPD variability from 1864 to 2022 using a composite tree‐ring stable carbon (δ13C) and oxygen (δ18O) isotope chronology derived from Chinese pine (Pinus tabuliformis) in Eastern China, a typical monsoon region. Our reconstruction shows that VPD from 1864 to 2022 has generally increased, and the drying trend is more significant since 1955. This accelerated VPD rise is attributed to both increasing temperature and decreasing precipitation, with temperature being the dominant driver. Future projections from the IPSL‐CM6A‐LR model, validated against our reconstruction, point to a marked and sustained increase in VPD across all four scenarios over the next century, thereby constituting a fundamental threat to regional ecosystems."

Here we introduce the first record of 60 million avalanche deposits across 10,701 small catchments, compiled from 33 years of Landsat data from 1990 until 2022 using a snow index. Potential damages from avalanches in areas at risk in HMA include nearly 20% of the buildings and up to 22% of the road network annually blocked by deposits temporarily disconnecting villages from food, energy, medicine, and communication infrastructures. Across 85% of HMA, no long‐term trends of deposits were detected due to variable snow and temperature during winter. Nonetheless, in 15% of the 214 larger aggregated catchments comprising HMA, the number of deposits increased by 10 every year. Multivariate analysis among these increases of deposits and winter snow and temperature parameters from reanalysis data revealed that a few areas of western HMA experienced increases in snow water equivalent (5 mm in three decades) and air temperature (2°C) contributing to the increase of avalanche activity. There, a decrease in snowfall of 50 mm, with an increase of rainfall, contributed to the formation of weak and unstable snowpacks. Most deposit trends could not be explained by snow‐temperature variables because of the complex and variable interactions between avalanches and climate. These results call for an adoption of mitigation measures in HMA to address avalanche impacts on infrastructure and human lives, especially in areas where avalanche occurrence may increase with time due to climate tendencies."

 Ultrathin, broadband microwave absorbing materials (MAMs) are crucial for weight-sensitive and space-constrained applications. This study introduces the electromagnetic frequency dispersion coefficient (EFDC), a synergistic dielectric-magnetic parameter that moves beyond conventional complex mechanisms. Our model directly links EFDC to microwave absorption (MA) performance, guiding the design of advanced MAMs. By optimizing EFDC, we achieved an ultra-wide effective absorption bandwidth (EAB) of 7.04 GHz at 1 mm and 9.28 GHz at 1.3 mm. Moreover, the temperature invariance of EFDC ensures consistent MA performance from 298 K to 473 K, despite the differing thermal responses of permittivity and permeability. This principle outlines a systematic design strategy for fabricating ultrathin and broadband MAMs, establishing a robust framework for developing high-attenuation absorbers suitable for complex frequency and thermal environments.

Here, the authors show this expansion is part of a global cycle of currents and plasma flows shaped by dayside and nightside reconnection. 
 Geomagnetic substorms transfer solar wind energy into the planetary magnetosphere and ionosphere, producing auroral displays and ground magnetic disturbances, particularly intense during the expansion phase. Despite decades of study, the mechanisms governing the expansion phase remain unresolved. Based on coordinated observations of storm-time intense substorms, we reveal that substorm expansion is temporally embedded within a global cycle of field-aligned currents and auroral electrojets, coupled to large-scale plasma convection. The cycle manifests as a coherent movement of current peaks across magnetic longitude and latitude—first antisunward and equatorward, then sunward and poleward—and coincides with enhanced sunward ionospheric convection. This cycle involves two components of the auroral electrojets: the convection-driven DP-2 current and the expansion-phase DP-1 substorm current. The antisunward-equatorward phase, corresponding to intervals of dominant dayside reconnection, begins with DP-2 and can stepwise transition into DP-1. During the subsequent sunward-poleward phase, reflecting intervals of dominant nightside reconnection, DP-1 either persists from the earlier interval or develops within this phase. These observations show that expansion onset can occur under dominance of either dayside or nightside reconnection, while the full development of DP-1 generally involves nightside reconnection, providing insight into substorm evolution. Geomagnetic substorms abruptly release energy, producing intense auroras and magnetic disturbances during an expansion phase. Here, the authors show this expansion is part of a global cycle of currents and plasma flows shaped by dayside and nightside reconnection."

 The spatial heterogeneity of meteoroid impact flux has shaped the space weathering environment across the lunar surface, driving key evolutionary processes such as crater degradation, regolith gardening, and soil grain exposure. This study investigates the spatial weathering environment of the Chang’E-6 (CE-6) landing site using a comprehensive approach combining remote sensing analysis, gardening simulations, and soil measurements. Our results reveal that meteoroid fluxes at sub-meter scales exhibit remarkable similarity between the lunar nearside and farside over million-year timescales, resulting in analogous regolith gardening and crater degradation patterns. Lunar soil samples primarily originate from an impact ~17.5 Myr ago. Soil gardening simulations estimate a grain exposure duration of ~1.54 Myr, consistent with the measured exposure age of 1.76 ± 0.88 Myr. These findings demonstrate that the exposure history of CE-6 lunar soil grains is principally governed by the most recent major impact event.

 The Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite altimetry mission, with its high spatial resolution and global coverage, offers unprecedented opportunities for studying coastal environments. Although primarily designed for observing open ocean and inland water bodies, recent studies have demonstrated its ability to capture intertidal topography at low tide. One key challenge in such applications lies in separating intertidal pixels from water ones, as current SWOT classification lacks a dedicated intertidal class. This study introduces a standalone methodology that relies exclusively on SWOT level-2 High Resolution (HR) pixel cloud dataset. Intertidal pixels are identified using a simple approach based on the probability distribution function (PDF) of sea surface height anomalies relative to a nearby reference open water point. This method was applied to the macro-tidal, geographically complex coastal region of Pertuis Charentais along the French Atlantic coast. Validation against airborne LiDAR topography shows good agreement, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) below 30 cm for both single-cycle and temporally stacked SWOT observations. Performance was consistent across different bottom types, with highest accuracy over low slope (<1°) muddy and sandy bottoms and moderate degradation over rocky bottoms. Elevation profile analysis suggests that SWOT has a potential for detecting spatiotemporal morphological evolution in highly dynamic environments. While single-cycle observations are limited by inherent interferometric noise, annual stacks show promises in resolving long-term changes. These findings highlight SWOT's potential to fill key observational gaps in intertidal mapping, supporting coastal morphodynamic studies, hydrodynamic modeling and climate resilience efforts in data-sparse or rapidly evolving environments."

 Remote sensing technology development has facilitated the emergence of numerous vegetation-related indicators, which may reflect the hydrological and sediment transport processes operating at different scales. However, few studies have investigated which vegetation-related indicator can best capture the variability in runoff and sediment discharge at multiple time scales, especially in ecologically fragile karst regions where the relationship between vegetation and hydrological process is highly complex and variable. To address this issue, five satellite-derived vegetation-related indicators (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI), Leaf Area Index (LAI), and Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF)) were selected to assess their associations with runoff and sediment discharge across six karst catchments in Southwest China during 2003–2020, and these associations were conducted in nine karst catchments of France and Central United States to validate the findings of this study. The Mann–Kendall trend test results indicated a significant increasing trend in vegetation, whereas sediment discharge generally exhibited a decreasing trend. Continuous Wavelet Transform analysis detected significant cyclic oscillations in runoff (9-13 months) and vegetation-related indicators (8-16 months), but no persistent periodicity was observed for sediment discharge. The Cross Wavelet Transform and Wavelet Coherence analyses were then applied across all 15 karst catchments. The proportion of areas showing significant coherence between vegetation and runoff ranged from 4% to 33%, whereas this proportion between vegetation and sediment ranged from 6% to 29%. Subsequently, the technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution was employed to evaluate the relative explanatory capacity of hydrological variables for vegetation-related indicators. The results identified SIF as the most effective explanatory variable for both river runoff and sediment in global karst areas. These findings provide new insights into the complex relationships between vegetation and hydrological processes in karst catchments and offer valuable guidance for improving water and soil resource management strategies."

 Accurate assessment of grassland ecosystem structural and functional indicators, such as percent canopy cover (CC) and aboveground biomass (AGB), are crucial for sustainable rangeland management. Conventional CC and AGB mapping studies lack extrapolation robustness and induce uncertainty as they upscale limited in situ samples to broad spatial extents. Therefore, we proposed and tested a spatial cross-scale approach. We integrated small unoccupied aerial systems (sUAS) imagery as a bridge to upscale in situ data to satellite-based estimates across Mongolia (MN) and Kazakhstan (KZ). We sampled in situ herbaceous CC (%) and AGB (g/m2) and conducted sUAS overflights in 84 sites (n = 252) across two provinces in KZ (North to South gradient in 2022) and dominant grassland steppe types of MN (East to West gradient in 2023). We employed a random forest (RF) regression model first to scale up quadrat-based field estimates to site scale (3.5 cm resolution) using spectral-textural-structural metrics from drone imagery and then to regional-scale (10 m resolution) using predictor variables from Sentinel-2 imagery and environmental covariates from various satellite sensors. We derived per-pixel uncertainty estimates to quantify the reliability of CC and AGB predictions. Results showed superior RF model performance during the cross-scale approach with an estimated R2 (RMSE) of 0.83 (10.4%) and 0.83 (31.74 g/m2) for upscaling CC and AGB estimates, respectively, from quadrat-to-site and 0.85 (5.14%) and 0.69 (31.8 g/m2) from site-to-regional. Notably, the cross-scale approach improved predictions over the conventional approach, with 44.0% and 43.7% lower RMSEs for CC and AGB, respectively. We produced the first fine-resolution (10 m) gridded herbaceous CC and AGB estimates for KZ and MN by leveraging extensive in situ sampling and robust upscaling approaches. This study demonstrates the sUAS capability for upscaling ground data to satellite imagery across large spatial scales and estimating wall-to-wall CC and AGB across diverse regions and ecosystems."

 Accurate delineations of Earth’s surface features are crucial for environmental science, but for dynamic landscapes like thawing permafrost, these datasets rapidly become outdated and inaccurate. Manual refinement of these outdated labels is prohibitively slow, while existing foundation segmentation models often fail to accurately segment complex natural features in satellite images. To address this, we aim to use inaccurate labels as geospatial priors to prompt a vision foundation model for zero-shot semantic segmentation of Earth observation objects with current satellite imagery. We developed an interactive segmentation framework that synergistically combines the Segment Anything Model (SAM) with expert oversight. Our system features two components: (1) a scalable automated pipeline that uses historical delineations as a strong geospatial prior for prompting SAM, and (2) an interactive tool that enables experts to refine outputs and create new, high-fidelity labels rapidly. Using the challenging case study of retrogressive thaw slumps, we demonstrate that this human–AI partnership achieves robust segmentation performance, with a best Intersection over Union of 0.80 ± 0.10 for routine updates. This approach matches the quality of manual expert digitisation but at twice the efficiency. This model- and task-agnostic framework offers a practical, transferable solution for generating the dense, time-series data required to monitor landscape changes, transforming a laborious mapping task into an AI-assisted, expert-overseen workflow."

 Water scarcity and unprecedented rapid depletion of groundwater reserves are challenges for global sustainable agricultural development. Understanding water usage is especially critical in key agricultural production regions. In this study, we focus on the Lower Mississippi Alluvial Plain (LMAP) region, one of the most important intensive agricultural regions in the United States and facing severe groundwater depletion. However, the total consumptive water use and its relationships with drought events across different land cover types remain a key unknown in this region. Here we use recently developed field-scale monthly evapotranspiration (ET) data from OpenET to investigate water use dynamics over multiple years under various drought conditions. Water use patterns for soybeans, corn, cotton, rice, and surrounding forests are analyzed, with drought impacts assessed using the U.S. Drought Monitor (USDM). The results show that the water consumption for all four crops peaks in July, but early-season patterns differ by crop type and water use practices. Rice shows the highest average total ET for the growing season (688 mm), while cotton has the lowest (612 mm). In comparison, forest ET is higher than crop ET in the LMAP and also shows a seasonal peak in July. Crops show higher variability in ET than forests during the growing season, with larger differences in standard deviation in drought years. Across the three mid-drought years during the study period, groundwater consumption by the four major crops exceeded that of forests by an average of 109 m3 per growing season.

 Accurately distinguishing between natural forests and planted forests underpins effective biodiversity monitoring and climate policy, yet their spectral similarity and limited reference data challenge large-scale classification efforts. This study focuses on Guangxi Province, China, combining Sentinel-2 imagery, multi-source ecological indicators—including vegetation traits such as leaf chlorophyll content and LAI—and over 12 million visually interpreted forest stands to map the distribution of natural and planted forests. We assessed pixel- and object-based classification models under various sample scenarios, with accuracy independently validated using additional samples interpreted from high-resolution Google Earth imagery. Model evaluation relied primarily on random splits, supplemented with spatially stratified validation across ecological sub-regions to assess spatial generalization. Results show that the object-based random forest classifier achieved the highest accuracy (OA: 84.52%, F1: 84.04%), with topographic and vegetation functional traits as key predictors. Spatially, natural forests dominate mountainous zones, while planted forests prevail in flatter areas. This work delivers the first 10 m resolution forest type map for Guangxi based on a uniquely large training and validation dataset and demonstrates that combining functional traits with robust sampling improves classification performance. Our framework supports scalable forest monitoring and contributes to improved management and conservation strategies."

 Driven by global carbon neutrality initiatives, China’s rapid expansion of photovoltaic (PV) power generation necessitates large-scale and precise extraction of photovoltaic power stations (PPS) for effective resource management. However, in 10 m resolution remote sensing imagery, PPS targets frequently exhibit multi-scale and fragmented spatial distributions. Such characteristics often lead to limited model generalization, high omission rates, and elevated commission errors, particularly under sparse-sample conditions. To address these challenges, this study introduces PPS-SAM, a spectrum- and structure-aware extraction framework developed for sparse-sample scenarios based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM). PPS-SAM integrates a Spectral Enhancement Encoder to fuse near-infrared (NIR) and shortwave-infrared (SWIR) bands, thereby improving the spectral separability of PV targets from heterogeneous backgrounds. It also incorporates a High-Quality Mask Decoder to maintain edge integrity and delineate fragmented arrays more effectively. Evaluated on a newly developed 10 m multispectral PPS dataset (MSPV-Dataset), PPS-SAM demonstrated robust segmentation performance with only 11 training samples (F1: 91.47% ± 0.13%; mIoU: 91.40% ± 0.08%), notably surpassing baseline models trained on the complete 634-sample dataset. Ablation and generalization assessments indicate the effectiveness of each module in enhancing foreground detection and background suppression, with stable performance across diverse, unseen terrains and environmental disturbances (F1: 92.19%; mIoU: 92.19%). Applying this framework, nationwide PPS distribution maps for 2022 and 2024 were generated (excluding distributed rooftop systems). The results indicate that the total PPS area expanded from 3,486.41 km2 to 5,900.89 km2, representing an increase of approximately 70%. Regional analysis shows that Northwest China was characterized by predominantly centralized growth (78.77%), whereas eastern and southwestern regions exhibited significant distributed expansion. Although national spatial clustering weakened slightly (Global Moran’s I decreased from 0.4155 to 0.3112), it intensified within central and southwestern provinces. Land-use transition analysis suggests that new PV installations primarily originated from grasslands (59.04%) and barren lands (96.40%), highlighting substantial land-cover conversion. These spatio-temporal patterns underscore regional disparities in PV expansion and shifting spatial structures. This study offers a robust methodological framework for high-precision PPS identification at 10 m resolution under sparse-sample constraints, supporting efficient renewable energy management and evidence-based policy formulation.

 The tidewater glacier in Marian Cove has retreated substantially toward the coastal cliffs over the past six decades. Using 19 satellite and aerial images from 1956 to 2022, we quantified frontal changes along 17 transects defined by glacier orientation and topography. The glacier exhibited a non-linear retreat pattern, alternating between phases of rapid retreat, slower retreat, and short advances. Mean retreat rates fluctuated from −10.8 to 178 m year−1 over the study period. From 1956 to 1978, the terminus remained stable while grounded on a shallow sill, but detachment from this topographic control initiated sustained retreat. The onset of major retreat coincided with a transition from negative to positive Southern Annular Mode (SAM) anomalies, which enhanced atmospheric warming and promoted oceanic heat delivery. Retreat accelerated during positive ocean and air temperature anomalies, whereas cooler phases slowed retreat. Variability across transects was strongly linked to bathymetry and vertical temperature stratification. Time series of surface elevation revealed land ice thinning after 2017, corresponding to the rapid retreat observed between 2017 and 2019. By integrating the longest record of glacier frontal change in Marian Cove with environmental observations, this study demonstrates how coupled fjord geometry–ocean–atmosphere interactions govern retreat behavior. These findings improve understanding of the sensitivity of tidewater glaciers in the northern Antarctic Peninsula under climate change."

 Urbanization in arid regions simultaneously intensifies air pollution and urban heat stress, yet their coupled interactions remain poorly understood. This study investigates the spatiotemporal relationships between land surface temperature (LST) and atmospheric pollutants in Urumqi, a representative arid-zone megacity of Northwest China, during 2019-2024 by integrating multi-source satellite retrievals and numerical simulations. MODIS LST and Sentinel-5P column pollutant data (O3, NO2, SO2, CO, CH2O) were analyzed using trend statistics and spatial autocorrelation methods. Results show that daytime LST exhibited a decreasing trend, whereas nighttime LST increased significantly, reflecting an enhanced nocturnal urban heat island. Pollutants displayed distinct seasonal cycles, with O3 increasing and NO2 declining over time. Bivariate Moran's I and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) revealed that O3 exhibited the strongest positive spatial coupling with LST, especially at night, whereas NO2 and SO2 showed weaker and seasonally variable correlations. To explore mechanisms, WRF and WRF-Chem experiments for February 2023 indicate that ozone and co-emitted pollutants enhanced near-surface warming, leading to daytime temperature differences of about 0.4-1.6 °C and to ozone-linked nocturnal warming when O3 exceeds its multi-day mean. These results highlight ozone as a dominant driver of pollutant-temperature feedbacks in arid urban ecosystems and provide a quantitative basis for jointly managing air quality and urban heat risks in arid basin cities."

 On 18 August 2022, an exceptionally intense and fast-moving convective system crossed the western Mediterranean and parts of central Europe, causing widespread wind damage, large hail, and storm surges. Wind gusts exceeding 60 m/s were reported and the event exhibited the typical structure of a derecho, extending over 1000 km and resulting in 12 fatalities and over 100 injuries.This study provides a detailed analysis of the event's evolution and its impacts along the northwestern Italian coastal regions. The analysis is based on observational data, reports, and post-event surveys. The atmospheric characteristics conducive to the extreme event are reconstructed through high-resolution numerical simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, in a configuration that includes the assimilation of RADAR and lightning data (3DVAR). The simulations realistically reproduced the two main convective pulses that affected Liguria and northern Tuscany, capturing both the timing and the spatial distribution of maximum wind gusts (30–40 m/s) and rainfall.Post-event surveys documented wind damage up to EF2/IF2 intensity and confirmed the occurrence of downburst-like phenomena in Liguria. Soundings and model diagnostics indicated extreme instability (CAPE >4000 J/kg), strong low-level shear (> 40 m/s), and a dry mid-level layer favorable to intense downdrafts. A concurrent marine heatwave (SST anomalies up to +3 °C) likely enhanced low-level moisture fluxes and convective potential.The results emphasize that such marine heatwave–supported derechos represent a growing threat to Mediterranean coastal regions and highlight the need for improved short-term forecasting frameworks."

 The Fengyun-4A (FY-4A) Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager (AGRI) provides high-resolution observations that contain cloud structure and distribution information. Previous studies have shown that all-sky assimilation of AGRI data can improve numerical weather prediction. However, the associated nonlinear and non-Gaussian characteristics still pose challenges. This study develops an assimilation framework based on the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) and the Data Assimilation Research Testbed (DART) using the Community Radiative Transfer Model (CRTM) with the scatter capability that supports the all-sky satellite observations, and applies a Localized Particle Filter (LPF) method to assimilate the observation from FY-4A AGRI water vapor channels. A series of cycling assimilation experiments are conducted for the “23.7” extremely heavy rainfall event in northern China. Sensitivity experiments demonstrate that the localization and inflation strength are critical for LPF. In this case, the LPF performs better under all-sky than clear-sky, and exhibits superior performance with more reasonable hydrometeor adjustment and better simulation of rainfall compared to the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), which demonstrating the advantage of the LPF in handling non-Gaussian problems. Specifically, the precipitation skill scores in terms of equitable threat score and fraction skill score are improved by 5.3% (24.8%) and 2.6% (15.2%) respectively compared with the EnKF (LPF but under clear-sky). Such improvements are accompanied by more coordinated moisture, thermodynamic and dynamic conditions conducive to precipitation development. These results demonstrate the potential of LPF in all-sky infrared data assimilation."

 As a key indicator for water vapor, precipitable water vapor (PWV) presents the total atmospheric water vapor along a vertical column, but it cannot reflect the detailed information on the vertical distribution of water vapor. Various techniques, including radiosonde and GNSS tomography, have been developed to obtain the layer water vapor because of its important role in climate change and weather forecasting. However, high temporal-spatial and vertical resolution LPW data remain scarce due to the sparsity of the distribution of radiosonde stations, the limitation of detection time, and the instability of tomography algorithms. Therefore, this study generates refined layer precipitable water vapor (LPW), which is based on the numerical integral using the geostationary interferometric infrared sounder (GIIRS) mounted on FengYun-4B satellite (FY-4B). The performance comprehensively evaluated across seasonal, spatial, and climatic perspectives for conventional LPW and refined LPW using ERA5 reanalysis data as reference. The continental LPW shows RMSE of 3.50 / 1.72 / 2.03 / 1.27 mm for PWV, LPW low, LPW middle and LPW high. The refined LPW enhance the advantages of continental LPW, further provide vertical distribution of water vapor, and the RMSE ranged from 1.72 mm in sigma 0.9 to 0.01 mm in sigma 0.1. Although water vapor is generally slightly underestimated and the MAPE is marginally higher in the upper layers, strong overall accuracy and correlation are retained throughout the vertical layer. This study made the first attempt to retrieve more finer LPW from the FY-4B/GIIRS, which fill the data gap for high vertical resolution and more detailed water vapor information."

 The implementation of PM2.5-focused control strategies in China has inadvertently contributed to the emergence of compound pollution, characterized by the co-occurrence of PM2.5 and O3 pollution. Biomass burning (BB) in Southeast Asia is a significant natural source of PM2.5 and Ozone (O3) in southwestern China. However, the regulatory mechanisms by which BB influences PM2.5 and O₃ concentrations remain poorly understood. In this study, a multi-source dataset together with the backward trajectory model and WRF-Chem were used to investigate the underlying mechanisms governing concurrent PM2.5 and O3 pollution. Four distinct pollution regimes were identified as: (1) PM2.5-dominated, (2) O3-dominated, (3) PM2.5-O3 pollution, and (4) clean episodes. HYSPLIT results reveal that both O3-dominated and PM2.5-O3 pollution regimes share consistent potential source regions, with >90% of air trajectories originating from northern India, southern Bangladesh, and northern Myanmar. The WRF-Chem simulations further demonstrate that BB contribute 96 μg/m3 to surface PM2.5 and 2 ppb to O3. Additionally, the enhanced atmospheric oxidation capacity, induced by elevated O3 concentrations, significantly promotes the formation of secondary inorganic aerosols, particularly sulfate (SO42‐), nitrate (NO3‐) and ammonium (NH4+), contributing substantially to PM2.5. Integrated process rate (IPR) analysis reveals that vertical mixing positively contributes to O3 enhancement, and chemical process shows greater impact on inland versus border cities. These findings establish a scientific basis for designing region-specific and optimized control strategies to address the intertwined compound pollution challenges in southwestern China."

 The quantitative effect of aerosol-cloud interactions (ACI) on O3 concentrations remains unclear after implementation of anthropogenic emission controls in recent years. This study investigates the effects of the aerosol-radiation interactions (ARI) and ACI on O3 concentrations during four PM2.5–O3 compound pollution episodes (Episode 1: 19–26 July 2019, Episode 2, 25 April to 2 May, Episode 3: 20–26 September, and Episode 4: 20–29 September 2022) in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region (BTH) and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) by conducting sensitivity experiments using the USTC-version WRF-Chem model with an embedded integrated process rate (IPR) analysis scheme. Both ARI and ACI reduce daytime surface downward shortwave radiation (SWDOWN), but their spatial influence varies: ARI has a stronger effect in the BTH (2–89 W m−2) than in the YRD (1–42 W m−2), whereas ACI exerts a more substantial reduction in the YRD (2–89 W m−2) than in the BTH (1–45 W m−2). This reduced SWDOWN disrupts the near-surface energy balance, leading to lower 2-m temperatures, higher humidity, weakened convection, and a decreased planetary boundary layer height (PBLH). For liquid water path, ACI increases it (4–128 g m−2) which is much larger than the decrease (2–34 g m−2) induced by ARI. ARI and ACI consistently increase PM2.5 concentrations but decrease O3 levels. Averaged at all the compound pollution sites of the four episodes, ARI elevates PM2.5 more in the BTH (6.1 μg m−3, 15.7%), while ACI-induced PM2.5 enhancements are more pronounced in the YRD (7.0 μg m−3, 16.6%). The corresponding ARI-induced O3 reduction is 4.6 μg m−3 (5.4%) in the BTH and 2.3 μg m−3 in the YRD (2.9%), while the ACI-induced O3 reduction is more extensive in the YRD (4.9 μg m−3, 6.3%) than that in the BTH (2.6 μg m−3, 3.1%). ARI exerts a more pronounced influence in more polluted regions, while ACI has a more significant impact in cloud-covered areas. ARI and ACI significantly suppressed photolysis rates (J[O1D]) while elevating precursor (NOx, NOy, and VOCs) concentrations indicating that the suppression of photolysis rates and chemistry production as the primary reason for O3 reduction, which is also confirmed by IPR analysis. The IPR results further indicated that vertical mixing reduced surface O3 by facilitating its transport to middle altitudes. The study concludes that under future strict emission controls, the reduction in PM2.5 may weaken ARI and ACI, potentially increasing O3 concentrations predominantly clear sky or lightly clouded meteorological scenarios. Therefore, strengthening controls on O3 precursors and optimizing regional joint prevention mechanisms are crucial to counteract this risk."

Given the large-scale coupled variability of western boundary currents and extensions (WBCEs), further investigation into its seasonality, predictability, and potential future changes is needed. Observations and high-resolution climate simulations reveal distinctive covariance between North Pacific and North Atlantic WBCE sea surface temperatures during boreal summer, possibly linked to preceding Arctic sea-ice variability. Model simulations suggest that cold-season Greenland and Barents Sea ice loss enhances anomalous planetary-scale atmospheric waves and meridional jet shifts, contributing to summertime WBCE temperature anomalies. Although we show that summer WBCE covariability arises from intrinsic variability, future climate projections and targeted model experiments imply that this internal coupled variability may be modulated by radiatively forced changes. Our findings suggest that summer WBCE covariability has increased in the historical record but may weaken in response to future reductions in Arctic sea ice under higher radiative forcing."

Fires at the WUI are therefore more common, and structural materials make up more of the wildfire fuel mass. While emissions from biomass fires are fairly well understood, volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions from structural fires are less constrained. In this study, we perform measurements of VOC emissions from small-scale laboratory burns of 18 different structural materials across 78 experiments using a Vocus proton-transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) to better understand these unique emissions. We calculate emission factors for 73 VOCs across all materials, including aromatics and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). We compare the emissions from both flaming and pyrolysis, which separate the processes of direct release of VOCs from combustion formation. Mass spectra comparisons were used to qualitatively highlight high-emission compounds across materials and identify notable emissions (e.g., nylon monomers) and potential tracers (e.g., halogen species) for WUI fires. Using these data, the emissions from a whole-house fire were compared with those from an equivalent mass of wood, and we found that some aromatic and nitrile species may be suitable WUI fire tracers."

Despite their lower fluorine content (<30% by mass), these pharmaceuticals accounted for 28–42% of the extractable (organo)fluorine (EOF), with sitagliptin, bicalutamide, and celecoxib carboxylic acid being important drivers of the EOF. The inorganic fluoroanions hexafluorophosphate and tetrafluoroborate were coextracted and contributed 7–19% of the EOF. The multisorbent approach also captured polar cationic pharmaceuticals, substantially influencing the EOF composition. These findings highlight the complexity of fluorine mass balance in municipal wastewater and the need for advanced methods to uncover unidentified organofluorine."

Brackish water, rich in sulfate (SO42–), offers a potential alternative for CH4 mitigation. However, its effectiveness and dominant mechanisms across different coastal land uses remain unclear, hindering broader application. Here, we conducted a four-month incubation experiment using intact soil cores from eight drained coastal peatlands representing four land-use types: grass-cut, grass-graze, arable, and unmanaged. We assessed CH4 emissions from soils rewetted with either natural brackish water (SO42– = 392 ± 2 mg L–1) or synthetic water containing 0% (simulating freshwater), 50%, or 100% of the natural SO42– concentration. Results showed that natural brackish water significantly suppressed CH4 emissions by ∼90% compared to freshwater, with stronger suppression in grass-cut, arable, and unmanaged soils, but limited effects in grass-graze sites. Such differences were attributed to land-use-induced soil variations, where higher pH and lower methanogen relative abundance enhanced suppression. Mechanistically, natural brackish water primarily suppressed CH4 via physiological inhibition of methanogens (likely through salt stress and hydrogen sulfide toxicity). This effect persisted after SO42– reduction inhibition (day 90) and lasted until the end of incubation, reflecting resilience to short-term SO42– depletion. Our study advances understanding of CH4 dynamics and informs targeted use of brackish water rewetting for CH4 mitigation in coastal peatlands."

In this study, we describe scanning electrochemical microscopy (SECM)-based approaches to characterize the nitrate reduction reaction (NO3RR) on Ti and Cu. These methods facilitate the assessment of catalytic activity, product selectivity, and surface-adsorbed intermediates. By combining tailored chronoamperometric protocols, we achieved operando visualization of NO3RR onset potentials (−0.35 V vs RHE for Ti and −0.16 V vs RHE for Cu) and verified potential-dependent nitrogen product distributions through stepwise quantification of ammonia, hydroxylamine, and nitrite. Furthermore, in situ surface interrogation SECM directly titrates surface-adsorbed H* and O*, revealing their coverage shifts under varying potentials and reaction times during the NO3RR and providing evidence for a hydrogen-mediated pathway on Ti. The methodology establishes a robust SECM-based platform for systematically benchmarking electrocatalyst performance and is readily applicable to the NO3RR on other catalysts and even other reactions that produce a complex array of intermediates."

Chow,Hourly PM2.5 Estimates across California from 2018 to 2023,"This study presents a new data set of hourly PM2.5 concentrations across California from 2018 to 2023 at a three-kilometer resolution. This data set was developed by assimilating observations from PurpleAir and the U.S. EPA Air Quality System monitors into wildfire smoke forecasts from the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh Smoke (HRRR-Smoke) model using the Gridpoint Statistical Interpolation (GSI) three-dimensional variational data assimilation framework. Archived forecasts of modeled wildfire smoke PM2.5 from HRRR-Smoke create the background field for assimilation, which is then corrected using surface observations of total PM2.5. The resulting reanalysis from GSI provides an estimate of total PM2.5 that minimizes error from both the observational and the model data. Validation results indicate strong performance, with monthly R2 values ranging from 0.73 to 0.91 across the six-year data set, comparable to other PM2.5 data sets. Case studies are presented for three major fire events, the 2018 Camp Fire, 2019 Kincade Fire, and 2020 Lightning Complex Fires to demonstrate the data set’s fidelity in resolving plume dynamics and local exposure patterns. Root-mean-squared error averaged over each month scales with average PM2.5 concentrations, resulting in a low error under typical conditions but higher absolute errors during extreme smoke events. This is the first long-term, hourly PM2.5 data set of its kind for California and enables the generation of subdaily exposure metrics, such as peak hourly concentrations, exceedance durations, and time-of-day exposure peaks. The novelty and strong validation of this data set make it a compelling resource for future studies on the impact and significance of subdaily PM2.5 exposure."

Continuing to refine quantifications of the atmospheric impacts of urban wildfires is an important goal to improve predictions of future events relevant to both the global carbon budget and public exposure. Here, we analyze the January 2025 Los Angeles (LA) wildfires by integrating satellite imaging, meteorological models, advection and diffusion models, and dense ground-level air quality observations from both low-cost sensors and reference-grade instruments. Focusing specifically on the Eaton fire, we demonstrate how its emissions were transported across LA, noting the rate of spread and the magnitude of pollutant enhancements achieved. We complement our measurements with bottom-up estimates of the carbon content lost from the fires and corroborate our approach through a Gaussian dispersion plume analysis. Our analyses indicate that the Eaton fire consisted of two distinct periods of burning which differentially consumed structures and vegetation, and our bottom-up budget and atmospheric observations agree that the combustion of structures released significantly more carbon than that of vegetation. During the period of most intense burning, emission rates of CO (CO2) were estimated to be approximately 21.2–37.6× (0.9–1.2×) greater than average daily anthropogenic contributions. Subsequent observational evidence of pollutant concentrations also highlights the outsized contribution of wildfire CO emissions, relative to normal conditions. The impact of wildfire emissions on fine particulate matter is then assessed through the lens of both primary emissions and potential secondary formation. Additionally, we note how spikes in methane concentrations point to wildfire-driven destruction of natural gas infrastructure. Together, these results demonstrate the value of our multimodal approach in elucidating a holistic picture of the consequences of urban wildfires with respect to public health and greenhouse gas emissions."

Using a novel combination of PTR-TOF-MS and FTIR in laboratory simulations, this study found that shifting AC operation from 16 to 26 °C triggers a rapid pulse release of key OCs, including acetaldehyde, acrolein, acetone, acetic acid, acrylic acid, and propionic acid. Concentrations surged within 5 min (e.g., acetic acid rose 11.06 ppbv), peaked around 12 min (19.20 ppbv), and stabilized after approximately 16 min. Total acetic acid emitted in the first 5 min was 736.18 μg. The primary sources were hydrophilic top coatings, whose VOC emission profiles correspond to operational odors under specific thermo-humidity conditions. Secondary sources included acrylic sealants, which released temperature-dependent acids such as acrylic acid, and filter modules, which partially reduced odors via adsorption. The underlying mechanism is described as “low-temperature condensation and enrichment followed by thermally-induced pulse release” driven by variations in the temperature and humidity. Subsequent optimization cut key VOCs within 5 min, achieving 100% propionic acid and 99.88% acetic acid reduction. This work elucidates the physics-driven origin of AC odors, paving the way for next-generation odor-free AC through source-control engineering."

The commercial kitchen underwent a ventilation intervention to improve the efficiency of the kitchen’s range hood and reduce fugitive cooking emissions into the building’s air. We assessed gas-phase organic compound levels before and after the ventilation intervention was installed via a hybrid targeted analysis and nontargeted positive matrix factorization (PMF) approach. None of the quantified target gas-phase organic compounds exceeded their occupational exposure thresholds before or after the ventilation intervention was installed. However, the behavior of compounds in and beyond this quantified target set was dynamic and complex with many measured species decreasing in intensity as the ventilation intervention was implemented but many also increasing. To understand the temporal patterns of these individual species and those from a nontargeted analysis across all measured gas-phase species, we investigated their indoor sources via PMF. The cooking-related factor, as identified via PMF, accounted for up to 72% of total measured PTR-MS ion signal during the highest intensity cooking time (11:00–15:00) with occupancy-related emissions contributing up to 38% of the total PTR-MS signal during this time. The cooking-related factor did not show a statistically significant change in signal during the ventilation intervention, suggesting the intervention was ultimately ineffective."

Sokol;Timothy M. Merlis;Stephan Fueglistaler,No “Wet Gets Wetter” in Kilometer‐Scale Mock‐Walker Circulations,"Many climate model simulations and limited observations indicate that regions of tropical ascent and precipitation contract in response to surface warming. This response has well‐studied implications for the width of the zonal‐ and annual‐mean Intertropical Convergence Zone, but its applicability to zonally asymmetric circulations such as the Pacific Walker circulation remains unknown. Here, we investigate the impact of warming on the area of large‐scale ascent in kilometer‐scale, mock‐Walker simulations with both fixed and interactive surface temperatures. Contrary to the “wet‐gets‐wetter” and “upped‐ante” paradigms of precipitation change, the simulations show a “wet‐gets‐drier” response to warming in which the ascent region becomes larger and, on average, drier. We attribute these changes to rapid circulation weakening, which limits the transport of moisture into the ascent region. To meet the growing moisture demand for precipitation, local evaporation within the ascent region must increase rapidly, and the ascent region expands to draw moisture from a larger surface area. We link the slowdown of the circulation to increases in gross moist stability driven by a previously unknown mechanism. Central to this mechanism are changes in the vertical structure of the circulation, which features two vertically stacked overturning cells reminiscent of some tropical convergence zones. These results challenge long‐held paradigms of tropical precipitation change and show that the vertical structure of tropical circulations can play a critical role in the hydrological response to warming."

Plants preferentially utilized NO3− (54 ± 18%) over Red‐N (46 ± 18%), despite NO3− was four times less than Red‐N in soils. Increased N deposition, rather than climates, was the main factor enhancing soil NO3− availability and plant NO3− uptake.

After rapid growth, the high‐frequency portion of the Pi2 waves and the Pi1 waves in a tailward region for pseudosubstorms are notably weaker and decrease faster than those for substorms. These results suggest that instabilities related to high‐frequency Pi2 and Pi1 waves are essential for a full‐fledged substorm and auroral poleward expansion."

However, the drivers of seasonal variations in DOM stoichiometry and their relationship to nutrient cycling remain poorly understood. Here, we present a seasonal synthesis of dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and phosphorus (DOP) distributions across the surface North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG) with associate biogeochemical measurements. In the central NPSG, summer exhibited elevated DON and depleted DOP, coinciding with a fourfold increase in N2‐fixation rates compared with winter. This seasonal shift reflects preferential DOP utilization and accumulation of DON via N2‐fixation. Mass and isotopic balance models confirm that DOP can supply about 40%–100% of summer phosphorus demand while about 50% of fixed nitrogen partitions into DON. These findings demonstrate that seasonal DOM stoichiometric flexibility encode dynamic nutrient cycling, highlighting the fundamental role of DOM transformation in regulating ocean biogeochemical processes."

Here, using a deep‐learning model trained with an ensemble of 10 Earth System Model (ESM) simulations, we identified the climate‐warming signal in satellite‐derived global Chl‐a fields. By comparison, a null model trained on ESM simulations forced only by natural variability was unable to identify a warming signal, confirming the role of climate warming.

Existing studies primarily attribute wintertime midlatitude near‐surface temperature variability to tropospheric large‐scale advection, assuming minimal land influence. However, nudging the model's circulation toward observations yields little improvement in wintertime temperature variance over Northern Hemisphere land, suggesting that land‐atmosphere interactions also warrant attention. We introduce a new scaling framework for temperature variance that incorporates local land‐atmosphere feedbacks. Comparing our framework to the mixing length approach—which links temperature variance to the meridional temperature gradient and air parcel displacement (mixing length)—shows that land‐atmosphere feedbacks are inherently embedded in the mixing length, a connection previously overlooked. Roles of land–atmosphere feedbacks are evaluated via model experiments with perturbed circulation, land, or both. We find that longwave radiative damping dominates temperature variance responses over meridional temperature gradient when both land and circulation are perturbed."

The model characterizes the interplay between convective transport and chemical reactions using two parameters: convective turnover time and the species' chemical lifetime. Using airborne measurements of 42 trace gases from the CONvective Transport of Active Species in the Tropics field campaign, we show that this model reproduces over 90% of the observed variability (R2 > 0.9) in the observed ratio of upper troposphere (UT) to boundary layer mixing ratio—the UT fraction—across the 42 species, with the UT fraction serving as an indicator of convective venting efficiency. A key insight is that this efficiency is well captured by the ratio of chemical lifetime to turnover time. The turnover times derived from the box model are consistent with the mean transit time from the Transit Time Distribution framework of earlier studies. This physically intuitive box model provides an observation‐based diagnostic for evaluating convective transport in global chemistry‐climate models and for improving our understanding of chemistry‐climate interactions."

Here, an ice core from Mont Blanc (French Alps) was analyzed to investigate the δ15N(NO3−) record over the past 1,000 years. Atmospheric isotopic fractionation, including gas‐particle partitioning, introduces a limited and quantifiable effect on δ15N(NO3−)—up to 2.4 ‰ in extreme cases. Thus, the glacially‐archived NO3− reliably reflects a record of Western European NOx emissions by comparing δ15N and concentrations of NO3−, and isotope–concentration mixing relationships (Keeling plot) with historical emission inventories. An increase in δ15N(NO3−) in the 1800s reflects the dominance of NOx emissions from coal combustion. During the 20th century, the δ15N(NO3−) value substantially decreased, from (4.7 ± 1.5) ‰ in 1900 to (−1.9 ± 1.4) ‰ in 1990, and Keeling plot interpretation attributes this decrease to increasing oil combustion emissions. Between 1750 and 2016, the ice core's δ15N(NO3−) record generally aligns with existing NOx inventories for Western Europe. However, during the early 20th‐century, low ice core δ15N(NO3−) values suggest that the inventories may have underestimated NOx emissions resulting from agriculture. Since 2000, the decreasing NO3− concentrations and δ15N(NO3−) values highlight the success of mitigation policies in reducing fossil fuel‐induced NOx emissions, albeit with a delay of 20 years relative to emission inventories, that can be attributed to gas‐particle partitioning and mis‐quantification of NOx sources. This work reaffirms the value of alpine ice cores for understanding aerosol sources."

 Floodplain sediments play a central role in redox-driven biogeochemical cycles through their electron exchange capacity, yet its origin remains unclear because of strong chemical heterogeneity. Here we quantified the electron-accepting and electron-donating capacities of 45 sediments from two Yangtze River floodplains using mediated electrochemical analysis. We identified that electron-accepting capacity was controlled by acid-extractable reactive ferric iron associated with iron (oxyhydr)oxides and expandable phyllosilicates. Electron-donating capacity was mainly contributed by terrigenous humic fractions (12.9–61.2%) and reactive ferrous iron (38.8–87.1%). Lignin-like compounds with low double bond equivalent were the dominant organic contributors to electron-donating capacity. For ferrous iron, its contribution to sediment electron-donating capacity was much smaller than predicted by chemometric analysis because a large fraction of ferrous iron associated with phyllosilicates was redox-inert due to chemical and structural constraints. The composition of electron exchange capacity dictated microbial selection of terminal electron acceptors, driving the conversion of high-redox-potential electron-accepting capacity into electron-donating capacity. This transformation of electron exchange capacity has important implications for suppressing methanogenesis in floodplains and for oxidant consumption during contaminated aquifer remediation.

We show that these landslides removed 2.72 ± 0.52 Tg of organic carbon in the upper Min Jiang. While its oxidation releases CO2, rapid revegetation offsets this, making the earthquake a net carbon sink. Time-series data indicate that vegetation carbon stocks will recover to 50% of pre-earthquake levels in 74 ± 5 years, whereas soil organic carbon recovery to 50% may take 500–850 years. This study highlights the decadal to centennial-scale impact of extreme events on carbon cycling. Earthquake-triggered landslides initially release carbon, but rapid revegetation and organic carbon burial later outweigh these losses, shifting affected mountain landscapes from a carbon source to sink over decades to centuries, based on field data and remote sensing."

 Droughts have intensified under climate change, threatening ecosystem stability. While rising atmospheric CO2 concentrations may enhance vegetation drought resistance, the net effect remains uncertain amid concurrent warming. Here we combine ecological modeling with multi-source observations to investigate how CO2 and warming jointly regulate vegetation drought responses on the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau, a sensitive alpine region exposed to escalating drought threats under changing precipitation regimes. Using factorial scenarios to isolate individual forcings, we show that 40-year CO2 rise mitigated drought-induced productivity losses by 5.7 ± 0.9% under constant temperature. However, in the presence of warming, rising CO2 intensifies drought stress by 5.2 ± 0.5%, reflecting increased plant water demand and disrupted regional water supply-demand balance. Permafrost areas experienced the strongest CO2-driven drought alleviation under constant temperature, but also the greatest warming-induced reversal. These findings reveal interacting CO2-warming impacts on alpine vegetation drought responses, highlighting ecological risks for the plateau and other permafrost-dominant regions under future warming. Rising CO₂ levels reduced drought stress on plants on the Qinghai–Tibetan Plateau over the past four decades, but this benefit is largely cancelled out by warming that increases plant water demand, as revealed by ecological modelling and multi-source observations from 1979 to 2018."

 Mapping mangrove species is crucial for mangrove biodiversity protection and ecological restoration. Existing mangrove classification methods mostly rely on the height and intensity metrics of rasterized lidar point clouds, which lead to the partial loss of fine three-dimensional (3D) structural information, and are difficult to distinguish among small inter-class differences, complex structures (dense canopy and aerial roots), and uneven mangrove stands. To directly capture the species community structure of mangroves from a 3D perspective, this study develops a point-wise deep learning species classification method specifically for mangroves—called Mangrove Multi-stage Attention Fusion and Class Token Network (Mangrove-Net), using UAV lidar point clouds and RGB imagery fusion data. Mangrove-Net uses a multi-stage attention fusion and class token mechanism to balance local geometric representation with global semantic perception, effectively capturing representative features among mangrove species. To address sample-imbalanced classification tasks, Mangrove-Net introduces a weighted cross-entropy loss function. We tested the proposed method on a typical mangrove forest dataset (from the Hainan Qinglangang Provincial Nature Reserve, China) and on the open dataset ModelNet40. The results indicated that Mangrove-Net showed superior performance compared to six state-of-the-art point-based deep learning methods (such as PointNet++, Point Transformer, PointMLP, and GPSFormer) in mapping fine-grained mangrove species, with a minimum improvement of 6.60% and 7.71% in overall accuracy (OA) and mean category accuracy (mAcc), respectively. Multi-scale visualization (sample, local, and study area) showed that the mangrove species maps generated by our proposed method had higher spatial continuity and ecological consistency. Evaluated on the ModelNet40 dataset, Mangrove-Net also surpassed those baseline methods, further demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of the method. This study provides a reliable point-wise deep learning method specifically for mangrove species classification to support various tasks in fine-grained precision mangrove forestry."

 High-spatiotemporal-resolution sunshine duration (SD) data has consistently been a significant concern in critical domains and provides strong support for estimating incident solar radiation (Rs). To achieve highly precise hourly estimations of both SD and Rs, this study developed a ‘multimodal hourly SD model to SD-based hourly Rs model’ framework using FY-4 and Advanced Himawari Imager (AHI) data spanning 2019–2024. Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT) classification model combined with transformer regression model was constructed for hourly SD model, and a radiation transfer empirical model based on grid SD data was constructed for grid SD-based hourly Rs model. The models were trained, tested, and validated using ground measured data from Chinese Meteorological Administration (CMA) stations. Validation results demonstrated high performance: the estimated hourly SD showed a correlation coefficient (R) of 0.96 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.11 h, while the estimated hourly Rs achieved an R of 0.91 and an RMSE of 97.31 W/m2 against ground-measured data. Furthermore, an analysis of the impacts of climatic conditions on SD-based hourly Rs model showed that water vapor content and temperature were positively correlated with both R and RMSE. Our methodology offered a new perspective for hourly SD and Rs inversion, which combined multi-source geostationary satellite remote sensing and ground-based observation data."

 After a long period of stability from 2000 to 2007, global methane (CH4) concentrations have been increasing every year, and this increase has been mainly related to increased emissions from anthropogenic sources. The Amazon is the largest tropical forest in the world and has been experiencing major impacts due to dominantly biogenic sources. In this study, we present data obtained from vertical profiles measured between 2010 and 2023, which allow us to understand the role of the Amazon Forest in the global growth of CH4 emissions, as well as the impact of reduced precipitation on regional emissions. Annual growth rates ranged from 9.7 to 10.3 ppb ⋅ year−1 in the regions northwest (TAB_TEF_CZS), northeast (SAN), southwest (RBA), and southeast (ALF) from Amazon. These values are similar to the global average (9.7 ppb year−1), indicating that the Amazon follows the global trend of increasing CH4 concentrations. Although much of the Amazon is seasonally or permanently flooded, emissions from flooded areas alone are not sufficient to explain the upward trend in CH4 concentrations. Monthly and annual flux calculations indicate regional emission patterns. The results reinforce the relevance of human action in the variability of methane emissions in the Amazon."

 Air pollution in major Indian cities is a growing concern for human health and pollution control authorities require reliable air quality prediction to manage deteriorating air quality. A total 131 cities with million plus population have been identified in India as non-attainment cities where pollution level is beyond National Ambient Air Quality Standards for consequently five years. The reliable air quality early warning system is an essential requirement by air pollution control authorities and other decision makers to effectively manage deteriorating air quality and implement pollution control measures in advance particularly in cities. The Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) has launched an air quality early warning system (AQEWS) in India, developed in collaboration between the India Meteorological Department (IMD) and the Finnish Meteorological Institute (FMI). This system utilizes the SILAM (System for Integrated Modeling of Atmospheric Composition) chemistry-transport model to provide hourly predictions of air quality for the next 72 h, covering all criteria pollutants, including particulate matter and gaseous species, in a dynamic framework for the domain 60o – 100oE, 0 - 40oN. The meteorological forcing is provided from the operational 3 km IMD Weather Research Forecast (IMD-WRF) model at 3 km × 3 km spatial resolution. The SILAM simulated PM2.5 mass concentration is compared against the in-situ observations over major cities of India such as Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Bengaluru, Hyderabad, Lucknow and Patna. The evaluation of air quality forecasts for PM2.5 concentrations reveals that SILAM excels in predicting episodes of Unhealthy air quality, but shows moderate skill in predicting Very Unhealthy episodes. Moreover, SILAM demonstrates strong statistical performance in predicting PM2.5 concentrations, with results falling within anticipated uncertainty ranges. The air quality early warning system enables decision-makers to take proactive, science-based measures to prevent air quality deterioration, informed by reliable forecasts."

 With the increasing frequency of tropical cyclones (TCs) due to global climate change, their impact on air pollution, particularly particulate matter and Ozone (O3), in China has become more evident. However, the effects of TCs on organic aerosol (OA) formation remain less understood. This study examined the influence of TCs on the abundance, chemical composition, and origins of atmospheric OA, using PM2.5 samples collected from a coastal city in southern China before and after two TCs in October 2021. The average OA concentration before the TCs (5.64 ± 3.00 μg·m−3) was higher than after TCs (4.45 ± 1.38 μg·m−3). Pre-TC OA levels were primarily linked to stagnant weather conditions, whereas post-TC levels were influenced by regional transport of anthropogenic OA and aqueous-phase secondary formation processes. Fluorescence spectra analysis revealed that OA was predominantly composed of protein-like substances (57 ± 10%), with changes in composition driven by oxidized humic-like substances, especially the low-oxygenated component. Using a dispersion-normalized method, we found that primary anthropogenic emissions and O3-driven oxidation consistently made significant contributions to OA throughout the study period. However, during the stagnant phase of the pre-TC period, OA concentrations normalized by dispersion were low, likely due to reduced primary emissions and lower isoprene SOA production yields. Furthermore, OA levels decreased during the pre-TC period, which was associated with increases in temperature and changes in NOx/O3 ratios, thereby affecting gas-phase photochemical reactions. Our study reveals for the first time the impact of TCs on OA formation, offering new insights into the occurrence of summer particulate matter pollution and the feedback mechanism between aerosols and meteorological conditions."

This work provides a comprehensive review of 6PPD and 6PPD-q in the environment, focusing on four key aspects: source, occurrence, transformation, and toxicity. Key findings include the following: (1) Tire wear particles are the main source of 6PPD and 6PPD-q in the environment, with their release directly linked to traffic density. (2) Ozone levels, temperature, climate conditions (e.g., snowmelt and rainy seasons), and environmental settings (e.g., roadways, tunnels, and parking lots) can greatly affect exposure levels. (3) In addition to atmospheric ozonation, oxidation in the atmosphere, free radical oxidation, and photocatalytic oxidation also play key roles in transforming 6PPD to 6PPD-q within aquatic systems and soils. (4) URMS is caused by 6PPD-q attacking the organs of fish, leading to blood–brain barrier and vascular dysfunction, with observed interspecies differences in sensitivity; these differences may be linked to variations in metabolic capacity. (5) Both 6PPD and 6PPD-q can enter the human body through the food chain, but their metabolic mechanisms and pathological changes are still unclear. Given the significant research gaps, this review concludes with proposed future research directions to deepen understanding of 6PPD’s and 6PPD-q’s environmental impacts."

Here, we introduce the Pretrained Remote sensing pIxel-based Spatial-teMporal Deep Neural Network (PRISM-DNN), an advanced deep learning framework that couples unsupervised pretraining on vast unlabeled satellite data with supervised fine-tuning using ground-based measurements. PRISM-DNN extracts rich spatiotemporal features and produces stable, robust global fAOD and cAOD retrievals for 2001–2024. Compared with established satellite products (POLDER and MISR), PRISM-DNN achieves markedly higher correlation coefficients with AERONET, reaching 0.94 for fAOD (+26%) and 0.91 for cAOD (+58%) relative to their mean performance. The model also performs well on additional ground networks excluded from training with correlation coefficients of 0.84 and 0.80 for fAOD and cAOD, respectively. The 24-year data set reveals pronounced regional disparities, with eastern China showing substantial declines in both fAOD and cAOD consistent with long-term emission control efforts, whereas parts of India exhibit increasing fine-mode aerosol loading associated with intensified human activities.

Here we show the experimental investigation of the sulfuric acid weathering of olivine under simulated FT conditions (193–293 K). Our results reveal that FT cycling enhances both mechanical and chemical weathering processes, with the lifetime of olivine decreasing 23 times compared to those under continuous freezing conditions. Cryogenic weathering promotes olivine hydroxylation and generates secondary phases (e.g., hydrated sulfates and amorphous silica) that collectively retain substantial water in the solid phase. Quantitative comparisons show these cryogenic weathering products retain approximately sevenfold higher water content per unit ion release compared to equivalent materials formed at ambient temperatures.

Our study combines sea surface height observations from SWOT with in situ measurements conducted in the Raroia lagoon and theoretical calculations based on an eigenvalue model.

The Naval Research Laboratory's Ground‐to‐Space (G2S) model is widely used for this purpose, yet discrepancies between G2S predictions and observations highlight the need for improvement. Here we develop Radiosonde‐to‐Space (R2S) specifications by merging direct radiosonde‐based observations of the lower atmosphere with G2S profiles aloft, producing continuous profiles from the ground surface elevation to 150 km. We compare more than 6,000 G2S–R2S pairs for Albuquerque, New Mexico, and conduct propagation modeling on representative endmembers spanning the range of differences. While G2S typically reproduces most R2S‐predicted arrivals, important exceptions occur that would affect event interpretation in real world scenarios. These results demonstrate that although G2S provides robust global coverage, predictions can change when direct lower‐atmosphere observations are incorporated, motivating broader integration of real‐time radiosonde data into global atmospheric specifications."

Neyestani;Jiachen Zhang,Quantifying Urban Morphology‐Induced Uncertainty in Urban Meteorology and Heat Stress Simulations in Southern California,"Accurate representation of land use and urban morphological parameters (UMPs), particularly building height, road width, and roof width, is critical for urban climate/weather modeling. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) coupled with the Single‐Layer Urban Canopy Model (SLUCM) has been widely used; however, few studies have quantified urban modeling uncertainties associated with UMPs in Los Angeles, a key metropolitan area. This study assesses the impact of UMPs on WRF–SLUCM simulations in Los Angeles and quantifies UMP‐induced uncertainties in 2‐m air temperature (T2), relative humidity (RH), wind speed and other outputs by integrating Polynomial Chaos Expansion, Sobol sensitivity analysis, and Monte Carlo methods. We apply urban Local Climate Zone (LCZ) land use data and find that incorporating accurate UMPs based on Los Angeles County improves wind speed simulations compared with default LCZ UMPs. Uncertainty analyses reveal strong sensitivities of urban meteorology to 50% UMP perturbation. The resulting average standard deviations of 2‐m air temperature are 0.02 K (day) and 0.23 K (night), while those of urban canyon temperature are 0.51 K (day) and 1.03 K (night). Wind speed uncertainties are also notable, reaching 0.42 m/s (day) and 0.27 m/s (night). Among UMPs, building height has the strongest influence on urban T2, RH, and wind speed. Furthermore, uncertainties in urban meteorology propagate into heat stress estimates, where different indices show different spatial patterns of uncertainty. These findings underscore the importance of accurately representing UMPs in urban climate/weather simulations and their implications for assessing urban heat stress."

This study investigates how In‐Fa remotely influenced the 21·7PRE by decomposing atmospheric fields using the multiscale window transform into basic‐scale (>64 days), intraseasonal‐scale (16–64 days), and synoptic‐scale (<16 days) motions. A prominent mid‐to‐lower‐tropospheric anticyclone, located approximately 880 km west of In‐Fa, acted as intermediary circulation linking the typhoon and the rainfall event. The anticyclone channeled moisture into Henan, producing pronounced meridional moisture convergence and supplying ∼64% of the total moisture during the event. Meanwhile, intraseasonal‐scale easterlies between In‐Fa and the western Pacific subtropical high facilitated westward wave‐energy propagation, which intensified an upper‐level divergence zone over Henan Province. This upper‐level divergence, together with local mesoscale cyclone activity, played a critical role in sustaining the extreme rainfall. These results indicate that Typhoon In‐Fa exterted a substantial remote influence on the 21·7PRE through a synoptic‐scale, cold‐core anticyclonic anomaly that mediated wave‐energy propagation and organized moisture transport. The findings highlight a dynamical pathway by which tropical cyclones can affect distant predecessor rain events beyond classical moisture‐conveyor and subtropical‐high paradigms."

However, the connection between these droughts and the atmospheric water cycle remains unclear. Here, we applied two process‐based models—the Dynamic Recycling Model (DRM) and the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model—to investigate the characteristics and mechanisms of atmospheric water cycles during SCB summer droughts from 1979 to 2022. The results show that the climatological mean precipitation recycling ratios for June, July, and August were 12.92%, 13.04%, and 12.63%, respectively, indicating the SCB's strong dependence on externally transported moisture. Most droughts are linked to deficits in external moisture transport. However, in the later stages of the most severe droughts (e.g., August 2006 and 2022), the drought evolves from preceding external moisture reduction into an internal‐moisture‐depletion regime. This shift is driven by extreme soil moisture depletion, which markedly intensifies land–atmosphere coupling and ultimately leads to the collapse of local moisture recycling. Moisture tracking further reveals that droughts with external deficits are associated with reduced oceanic inflow, while those with internal deficits exhibit reduced terrestrial moisture contributions despite sufficient oceanic supply, reflecting low efficiency in converting available moisture into rainfall. Large‐scale circulation systems, especially the Western Pacific Subtropical High and mid‐latitude westerlies, play a key role in shaping these drought‐related anomalies by regulating moisture transport and precipitation efficiency, while land–atmosphere coupling further amplifies these anomalies. These findings provide new insights into summer drought dynamics in the SCB and inform improved drought prediction under a changing climate."

Over 45% of dust events were recorded at two sites in the Chihuahuan Desert. The intensity of dust events, indicated by regional average concentration of PM10 (particulate matter with diameter ≤ 10 μm) during these events, decreased by −0.24 μg/m3 per year compared to −0.10/m3 per year on non‐dust days.

The variability of dust event frequency was strongly associated with that of Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The increasing wind speed has a stronger effect on the dust activity in the Northwest, whereas in the Southwest, the decreasing soil moisture has a larger impact on the increase in dust event frequency.

 Developing a practical and robust cloud removal method has long been a crucial research objective in the field of remote sensing. Existing multi-temporal approaches typically adopt cloud-free images from other acquisition dates as training targets. However, the inherent temporal heterogeneity of optical observations introduces intrinsic limitations to this paradigm. To overcome these issues, we propose a novel cloud removal strategy based on a Generate-to-Remove (G2R) self-supervised framework. Unlike conventional methods, G2R employs the cloudy image itself as the supervision target, thereby introducing temporal constraints into the reconstruction process and enabling faithful recovery of the original surface features beneath cloud-covered regions. Furthermore, to address the insufficient capability of existing multi-temporal networks in modeling spatio-spectral dynamics and cross-dimensional interactions, we design the Spectral–Spatial Mamba network (SSMamba). Built upon a structured state space model, SSMamba adopts dual spectral and spatial branches tailored for multi-temporal inputs, achieving coordinated representation learning and efficient feature interaction. This design allows for fully exploiting spectral consistency and spatial dependencies across temporal observations, leading to improved detail restoration and stronger generalization. Experimental results on multiple real-image scenes demonstrate that the proposed framework not only achieves accurate reconstruction of cloud-covered regions but also delivers substantial advantages over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting its strong potential for operational applications."

 Large-scale rice mapping is crucial for agricultural management and climate change studies but is hampered by challenges such as the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of high-quality data, sample scarcity, and limited model transferability. To overcome these barriers, this study presents a pioneering framework that shifts the paradigm from traditional reconstruction of spectral data to the reconstruction of time-continuous classification model sequences guided by phenological knowledge constraints. Unlike traditional methods that focus on reconstructing raw spectral data, our approach models the continuous evolution of parameters of classification models throughout the growing season. By training discrete Logistic Regression (LR) models regularized by their temporal predecessors, we ensure biophysical realism and link model dynamics directly to rice canopy development. This sparse sequence is then interpolated into a continuous trajectory also under the constraints of rice canopy development. The model-space interpolation enables optimal handling of observations from any arbitrary date and facilitates robust, sample-free model transfer. Long-term validation (1984–2024) and cross-regional rice mapping applications across China, Japan, Italy, and the USA demonstrate that our method achieves high classification accuracy (OA > 0.95) and robust generalization (relative errors < 10%). This study demonstrates that reconstructing model parameter sequences—rather than the raw data itself—is a feasible and powerful strategy for large-scale rice mapping across diverse climatic zones. Beyond rice mapping, the proposed strategy of reconstructing model parameter sequences may offer a transformative perspective for the broader Earth observation community. It demonstrates that when direct high-quality observations are intermittent, modeling the continuous evolution of the classification logic itself under phenological or geographic knowledge is a powerful alternative to data imputation. This conceptual shift provides a scalable solution for monitoring various highly dynamic Earth surface processes, such as forest phenology, and land degradation, where temporal consistency and physical interpretability are paramount."

 The Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) Plain in north China has experienced significant land subsidence due to long-term groundwater overexploitation. Although water diversion project and climate change have improved groundwater conditions overall, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in land deformation responses to groundwater recovery remains unclear. This study reconstructs and identifies differentiated deformation patterns across the BTH Plain under the new hydrological background, revealing their multi-scale response mechanisms to groundwater change. After mosaicking Time-Series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (TS-InSAR) deformation fields, we reconstructed the seasonal and long-term components of deformation. A long-term deformation characteristic-constrained K-means clustering method was developed to classify distinct deformation evolution patterns. Coupling these patterns with groundwater-level (GWL) observations to further distinguish the annual lag and long-term delayed response of deformation to GWL changes. From 2016 to 2024, the BTH Plain exhibits clear spatial partitioning of deformation behaviors, categorized as 10.14% continuous subsidence, 18.86% reduced subsidence, 46.09% stable deformation, and 24.91% slight rebound. Uncertainties in the reconstructed deformation reflect short-term fluctuations driven by extreme hydrological or anthropogenic disturbances. Short-time Fourier transform analysis reveals periodic response of deformation to GWL change and annual lag: elastic deformation dominated areas lag GWL by ≤ 2 months, whereas clay-rich persistent subsiding areas lag 4–6 months. The exponential decay model further indicates that the recovery of subsidence funnels is governed by geological structures: funnels intersecting faults show the slowest subsidence decay along their edges, while those without faults display a more uniform edge-to-center recovery pattern."

 Accurate and efficient monitoring of seedling emergence is critical for early-stage crop management and yield forecasting in sugarcane production. To meet this practical demand for precise field phenotyping, this study developed a high-throughput phenotyping framework leveraging unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) remote sensing data and machine learning. This framework addresses the critical agricultural challenges of inefficient manual counting and the need for plot-scale monitoring in sugarcane production by enabling high-throughput sugarcane seedling number prediction through the integration of UAV-acquired RGB and multispectral imagery. Specifically, the sugarcane canopy was accurately segmented from the background using K-means clustering, a step that enabled the extraction of canopy area and the generation of a mask for obtaining canopy-level average features (including vegetation indices and texture features). These features together form a comprehensive feature set. Subsequently, six different feature selection methods were used to optimize the feature set, and eight machine learning models were combined for training and evaluation. The results showed that the combination of Gradient Boosting Regression (GBR) and KBest-F feature selection method yielded the optimal prediction performance, with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.7641, a root mean square error (RMSE) of 19.42, and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 15.93. Further analysis identified canopy area, the Normalized Difference Red Edge Index (NDRE), red edge contrast, and green entropy as core predictive features. They collectively contribute over 60% of total feature importance, and their synergistic effects support accurate seedling number estimation. This framework offers an efficient, scalable tool for plot-scale seedling monitoring, with substantial potential for precision field management of high-density crops."

 Artificial light at night (ALAN) influences safety perceptions, public health, energy use, and biodiversity, yet its eye-level impacts remain difficult to quantify at city scale. Meanwhile, reducing outdoor lighting is especially contested because the widely held belief that “brighter is safer” sustains excessive ALAN even in low-crime cities such as Hong Kong. We assert that unveiling the threshold effect of brightness on perceived safety and human behavior is crucial for shifting the linear paradigm and informing acceptable lighting adjustments. However, auditing urban-scale nighttime perceived safety is challenging because nighttime street view imagery (SVI) is almost nonexistent. Most studies rely on limited nighttime samples, satellite radiance, or daytime SVI as proxies, ignoring the spatial heterogeneity of nightscapes and differences between day and night. Moreover, lighting intensity is often examined in silo; how it interacts with urban forms is underexplored. To address these gaps, we developed a multimodal diffusion model trained on 2600 paired day–night SVIs and conditioned on SDGSAT-1 radiance (40 m) and POI context to synthesize context-aware nighttime scenes from 58,500 daytime SVIs (50 m spacing) across Hong Kong. A validated vision-language model was used to score perceived nighttime safety from generated images, while semantic area, brightness, and depth (ABD) features were extracted to model their interactions. To characterize human behaviors, approximately 150,000 volunteered trajectories of physical activities were collected. The ABD interactions extracted from eye-level nightscapes alone explained 49.3% (36.5%) of the variation in day–night activity disparities (perceived nighttime safety), significantly outperforming satellite-based radiance. Near-field, line-of-sight lighting on facades, trees, and sidewalks is consistently associated with higher safety and stronger nighttime activity retention. Brightness shows diminishing gains beyond ∼ 40–60 luma DN (∼19–40 lx as an interpretive reference from our DN–lux field cross-walk) on nighttime perception and physical activity across heterogeneous urban contexts, indicating significant potential for reduced light pollution in overlit areas. This study demonstrates the necessity and provides a scalable toolkit for auditing nighttime environments at eye level to support sustainable and healthy cities."

 China's effective control of PM2.5 has coincided with increasing ozone concentrations and frequent compound pollution of PM2.5 and O3 (co-pollution), indicating the critical role of aerosols in air pollution. To investigate the impact of aerosol extinction on ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosols (SOA), the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model, incorporating an enhanced Mie scattering parameterization, was applied to simulate a co-pollution episode (25–30 September 2022) in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region. The improved single-scattering albedo (mean bias decreased by 87%) provided a robust foundation for aerosol extinction assessment. During the episode, aerosol extinction suppressed surface photolysis rates, reducing regional surface O3 concentrations by 2.59 ± 4.6% and increasing SOA concentrations by 3.40 ± 9.90%. Although SOA increased across the region, it decreased in heavily polluted Beijing under the influence of aerosol extinction, exhibiting variations consistent with those of O3. Process analysis in Beijing indicated that within the planetary boundary layer (PBL), aerosol extinction lowered O3 by suppressing daytime chemical production and inhibiting SOA formation mainly by suppressing aerosol-phase conversion, with the strongest effect occurring near the surface and gradually diminishing with altitude. However, at the top of the PBL, aerosol extinction resulted in elevated O3 and SOA levels, strengthening vertical gradients and promoting downward transport, which offset ∼70% of the decrease in O3_CHEM and SOA_AERO below 440 m at midday. Furthermore, aerosol extinction led to greater decreases in pollutants in urban regions than in suburban areas, narrowing the urban–suburban concentration gap and thereby suppressing the outward transport of urban pollutants. The quantified role of aerosol extinction in O3 and SOA formation and transport provides critical insights into how declining aerosol concentrations may reshape future regional air quality."

 This study proposes a novel framework, GeoGMI, to generate virtual 89 GHz horizontally polarized brightness temperatures (TBs) of the GPM Microwave Imager (GMI) on the geostationary Geo-Kompsat-2 A (GK-2 A) platform. The study aims to overcome the temporal sparsity of low-Earth orbit microwave (MW) observations during tropical cyclone (TC) events by leveraging the high-temporal resolution of GK-2 A. In contrast to conventional statistical techniques, GeoGMI employs a conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) that integrates optimized input feature selection with a composite loss function to learn storm-scale spatial structures effectively. Quantitative comparisons demonstrate the clear advantage of the proposed deep learning framework: the multiple linear regression (MLR) baseline shows limited predictive skill, with a correlation coefficient (CC) of 0.531 and a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 15.599 K, whereas GeoGMI achieves a higher CC of 0.647 and a lower RMSE of 14.429 K. These improvements indicate that GeoGMI more faithfully reconstructs physically meaningful deep convective cores, capturing nonlinear relationships that linear models do not represent. Nonetheless, despite the enhanced performance, the reconstruction of fine-scale TC structural features remains less accurate than that from direct instrument observations, highlighting the need for further refinement to resolve sub-storm-scale variability. However, the generated 10-min interval virtual GMI-like TB fields effectively bridge the temporal gaps between GMI overpasses and enable continuous MW-like monitoring of TCs. GeoGMI offers a promising approach to improve near-real-time monitoring of a TC's internal structures using only geostationary satellite observations, thereby enhancing nowcasting capability and reducing disaster-related risks."

 The Tienshan Mountains of Central Asia, a key region in global arid and semi-arid zones, faces highly uneven precipitation distribution due to its unique topography and climate. While extreme heavy precipitation has been widely studied, research on extreme light precipitation is limited. Additionally, spatial distribution patterns and driving mechanisms of extreme events under varying climatic and geomorphic conditions remain underexplored. This study systematically examines the spatial-temporal trends of extreme hydro-climatic events, focusing on both extreme heavy and light precipitation, to provide insights for water resource management and disaster prevention. A distinct hydrological regime shift has occurred since 2000. The frequency anomaly of extreme light precipitation events (R1p) plunged from positive to negative, indicating a marked decline, whereas extreme heavy precipitation events (R99p) surged, reflecting a substantial increase in frequency. Spatially, a prominent dipole pattern is identified around 80°E, where extreme heavy precipitation frequency increases eastward and decreases westward. Vertically, the mid-altitude zone acts as an amplification center, exhibiting the sharpest intensification of heavy precipitation and the steepest decline in light precipitation frequency. These patterns result from the combined effects of Tibetan Plateau thermal dynamics and monsoon-driven moisture transport, creating distinct differences in extreme precipitation between the eastern and western Tienshan. Future studies should explore the interactions between the plateau and atmospheric circulation to improve the prediction and mitigation of extreme events, aiding water resource management and disaster preparedness."

 Recent studies have shown that the global temperatures are rising dramatically affecting the water and energy balances in the atmosphere, in turn, altering the precipitation regime and evaporative processes. These changes may cause aridification that can be estimated by the Aridity Index (AI), the ratio between the Precipitation (P) and Reference Evapotranspiration (ET0). High-resolution P and ET0 datasets are essential for accurate estimation of AI, as both variables exhibit strong spatial variability in topographically and climatically diverse regions. In this study, aridification in Europe is examined during the 1950–2024 period using the recently available ERA5-Land high-resolution climate reanalysis dataset, and it is integrated and bias-corrected with ground observations. The analysis covers three consecutive 25-year intervals to evaluate temporal shifts in aridity with particular emphasis on the quantitative contributions from P and ET0. Land classifications based on AI thresholds are also applied following the UNEP criteria, to examine both the temporal evolution and spatial distribution of humid, sub-humid, semi-arid, and arid zones. In addition to a domain-wide assessment, the analysis also investigates trends across distinct elevation bands and disaggregates findings at the national scale. This study provides one of the most comprehensive assessments of recent European aridification, demonstrating a clear acceleration and a fundamental shift toward evapotranspiration-driven aridification in the twenty-first century across large parts of the continent. Although aridification may be unavoidable in the near future, the fine resolution analysis presented herein provides a scientific basis for identifying vulnerable regions and development of targeted adaptation strategies."

 Stratospheric intrusions (SI) are natural and uncontrollable phenomena that pose challenges for improving air quality. This study introduces the STARFusion technique, a novel and versatile framework that integrates multi-source observations with modeling to identify both direct (DSI) and indirect (ISI) stratospheric intrusion events. The strength of STARFusion lies in its ability to establish direct links between stratospheric sources and receptor regions in the troposphere, including near-surface layers, by considering the dynamics of inclined transport. This study focuses on spring-summer SI events in Eastern China (EC) during 2019. Results highlight the distinct behaviors of ISI and DSI events. For tropospheric ozone, SI impacts are altitude-dependent. Compared to intrusion-free periods, ozone vertical profiles during SI events exhibit a pronounced curvature towards the tropopause with increasing ozone, with stronger effects from ISIs compared to DSIs. For near-surface ozone, ISI events lead to the highest frequency of exceedance, occurring 2.4 times more frequently than intrusion-free periods. These exceedances affect half of the monitoring sites, predominantly in the eastern coastal region of EC. Air quality standard violations are not observed during DSI events. Near-surface ozone exceedances exhibit a spatial drift towards the downwind regions influenced by SI. Additionally, we conduct detailed assessments of hourly, site-level SI contributions (14% to 26%), with exceedance cases halved after excluding SI-influenced site data. The STARFusion technique effectively disentangles stratospheric signals from anthropogenic pollution, which has scientific implications for deepening the understanding of SI occurrence, development, and its atmospheric mechanisms."

By combining lab experiments with real-world data from a mountain site in Italy, we found that the correction factor for this instrument varies mainly due to particle size and measurement conditions. Understanding these influences helps improve air quality monitoring, which is important for assessing pollution impacts on health and climate. 
 The dual-spot aethalometer AE33 is a widely used instrument for measuring the aerosol absorption coefficient, but the accuracy of its measurements is heavily dependent on the multiple scattering correction factor (C), which compensates for multiple scattering effects in the filter matrix. Despite its widespread use, several aspects influencing the variability of C, particularly those related to aerosol microphysical properties, are still not fully constrained.In this work, we explore the variability of C for the AE33 in a wide range of conditions and aerosol properties by combining chamber experiments with freshly emitted laboratory-generated soot and ambient data from a mountaintop site in Italy (Monte Cimone, CMN). The C factor is derived by comparison with independent filter-based instruments such as the MAAP (Multi-Angle Absorption Photometer) and MWAA (Multi-Wavelength Absorption Analyzer) at CMN and the extinction-minus-scattering (EMS) approach in chamber experiments.The mean C value at a wavelength of 637 nm derived at CMN is 2.35 with a standard deviation of 0.58, while the average values obtained in chamber experiments in different conditions range from 2.89 ± 0.03 to 3.9 ± 0.06. The variability of C at CMN appears to be primarily influenced by the signal-to-noise ratio of the instruments, especially during the colder months when absorption coefficient values fall below 1 Mm−1. In contrast, in the chamber experiments, the variability is mainly driven by particle properties. The C value at 637 nm, derived from measurements at CMN, increases with increasing single scattering albedo (SSA), particularly for SSA values above 0.94, while showing no statistically significant spectral variability. Both ambient and chamber experiments highlight the dependence of the C factor on particle size, with C increasing as particle diameter decreases below 200 nm. This size dependence is relatively small (within 25 %) under ambient conditions dominated by mostly scattering aerosols, but it leads to changes greater than 60 % for highly absorbing soot particles. These results are relevant for improving the accuracy and comparability of aerosol absorption measurements performed by aethalometers, particularly within monitoring networks. The observed dependence of C on particle size suggests that differences between urban and remote sites, or between periods dominated by nucleation versus coarse-mode particles (e.g., dust), may contribute to the variability reported across locations. Understanding these dependencies is essential for refining correction approaches and reducing inter-site discrepancies in network datasets."

It identifies 25 sources, including agriculture, wetlands, and fossil fuels, enhancing India’s global data representation. Emissions peak in the Indo-Gangetic Plain and coastal states, highlighting mitigation priorities. Urban emissions are lower, suggesting underestimation. This dataset helps policymakers design targeted reduction strategies, supporting India’s climate goals and global efforts. 
 Methane (CH4) is a predominant climate-forcing agent and has become a focal point of global climate discussions, owing to its significant contribution to atmospheric warming. The ambiguity surrounding the relative contributions of various natural and anthropogenic sources, coupled with associated uncertainties, poses significant challenges to assessing methane emissions in developing nations like India. To address these challenges and better understand the methane-emitting sources, this study presents a comprehensive high-resolution gridded (0.1° × 0.1°) inventory of CH4 emission by including 25 distinct anthropogenic and natural sources in India for 2023 by adopting the IPCC bottom-up approach. The estimated CH4 over India is 37.79 Tg yr−1, which will redefine the contribution of various sources. The agriculture sector contributed ∼50 % followed by wetlands (22.8 %), fossil fuel (8.9 %) and waste management (8.4 %). This study reports the first-ever comprehensive emissions from natural sources like wetlands and termites. The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) and coastal states show elevated emissions with Uttar Pradesh contributing the highest (10.8 %) followed by Gujarat (9.4 %), and Maharashtra (8.6 %). However, surprisingly cities exhibit lower CH4 as compared to other semi-urban/rural regions. This developed dataset can be a valuable input to optimize the climate study by filling the data gap, enabling policymakers to formulate various mitigation measures.

It includes eight meteorological variables and eleven high-impact weather events related to power generation, grid transmission, and electricity demand. CNPS-Met outperforms other existing datasets in accuracy for most meteorological variables. We also quantified the frequency hotspots and intensity extremes of high-impact weather events. 
 The new-type power system exhibits pronounced “weather dependency”, wherein high-impact weather events can significantly exacerbate operational security risks. A high-quality gridded dataset that involves both meteorological variables and high-impact weather events is of great significance for new-type power systems. In this study, a spatially adaptive optimal interpolation scheme is developed and applied to generate the China New-type Power Systems Meteorological (CNPS-Met) dataset. The CNPS-Met dataset spans from 1980 to 2016 and covers the entire Chinese mainland, with a daily temporal resolution and a 25 km spatial resolution. It includes eight meteorological variables and eleven high-impact weather events, categorized from generation-side, grid-side and demand-side perspectives relevant to new-type power systems. Validation with existing datasets indicates that the CNPS-Met dataset generally exhibits superior performance in meteorological estimation. Specifically, the estimated mean relative errors for 2-m air temperature, 2-m specific humidity, 10-m wind speed, precipitation and surface pressure averaged over the Chinese mainland could be reduced by 1.7 %–18.5 %, 9.0 %–29.6 %, 1.9 %–8.5 %, 2.7 %–18 % and 4.9 %–5.2 %, respectively. On this basis, a series of high-impact weather events critical to the operation of new-type power system are identified. The spatial distribution of their frequency hotspots and intensity extremes are further analyzed. The CNPS-Met dataset is expected to benefit research and applications at the intersection of meteorology and new-type power systems."

Barrett,A Multi-Method Antarctic Atmospheric Blocking Dataset (1979–2024),"Atmospheric blocking near Antarctica drives long lasting circulation anomalies and extreme events, yet it remains poorly understood. We created a new public dataset for 1979 to 2024 using global reanalysis data and several detection methods applied in a consistent way. We found strong method dependent differences in how often, where, and how long blocking occurs, showing that no single approach captures all forms of Antarctic blocking. 
 Atmospheric blocking is a key driver of persistent circulation anomalies and associated extreme events in the Southern Hemisphere, yet its characteristics around Antarctica remain poorly understood due to methodological diversity and the absence of a consolidated, long-term dataset. This study presents a new multi-method Antarctic atmospheric blocking dataset covering the period 1979–2024, derived from ERA5 reanalysis and constructed using multiple blocking detection approaches applied consistently across the Southern Hemisphere (25° S–90° S). The dataset integrates diagnostics based on 500 hPa geopotential height and vertically integrated potential vorticity within a unified framework for spatial filtering, event definition, and temporal tracking. It provides instantaneous blocking masks, spatiotemporally tracked event catalogues, time series, and aggregated climatologies that are directly comparable across methods. The results reveal only weak large-scale similarities in Antarctic blocking across detection approaches, mainly related to high latitude occurrence and seasonal modulation. In contrast, pronounced method dependent diversity is evident in blocking frequency, spatial extent, the number of detected blocking events, and persistence. Geopotential height-based methods identify a broader spectrum of anticyclonic flow regimes, including events extending into the Antarctic interior, whereas potential vorticity-based methods isolate fewer, more spatially confined events that emphasize dynamically coherent upper-level disturbances near the polar vortex. Event-based diagnostics further reveal systematic trade-offs between event frequency and duration, illustrating how different methodological choices preferentially capture either shorter-lived circulation anomalies or more persistent blocking structures. These contrasts arise from the diverse dynamical expressions of blocking at high southern latitudes, indicating that no single diagnostic fully captures Antarctic blocking behavior. Key uncertainties relate to threshold sensitivity, spatial filtering, and diagnostic formulation, which should be considered when interpreting blocking statistics and inter-method differences. By providing a consistent and openly accessible resource, this dataset allows direct intercomparison of blocking definitions, supports evaluation of climate models over Antarctica, and provides a foundation for future studies of blocking-related circulation variability and extreme events."

By linking 2 million profiles to nearby eddies, we built a large dataset that reveals how these features reshape ocean temperature and salinity structure, alter mixing, and transport heat and salt. The dataset supports better assessments of oceanic thermohaline environment variations, extreme events, and climate-related changes. 
 Mesoscale eddies are a fundamental component of ocean circulation and play a crucial role in shaping the three-dimensional distribution of ocean temperature and salinity. However, observational constraints have long limited systematic, global-scale quantification of eddy-induced thermohaline variability. Here, we present a global eddy-collocated historical temperature and salinity profile dataset spanning 29 years (1993–2021), constructed by integrating in situ hydrographic profile observations with satellite-derived mesoscale eddy tracking products. The dataset contains 2.35 million quality-controlled temperature-salinity profiles, each collocated with the nearest mesoscale eddy on the sampling day that may have influenced the observed water column. The profiles provide broad global coverage, with most 2°×2° grid boxes containing more than 150 observations, enabling statistically robust analyses from regional to global scales. Validation against well-documented regional eddy signatures shows that the dataset consistently reproduces well-established eddy-induced temperature and salinity anomaly structures across diverse ocean regions. Example applications demonstrate the dataset’s capability to investigate the spatial heterogeneity and vertical extent of eddy-induced thermohaline anomalies, eddy impacts on mixed-layer depth and stratification, eddy contributions to subsurface extreme temperature events, and eddy-driven heat and material transports. This dataset provides a comprehensive observational foundation for advancing quantitative assessments of mesoscale eddy impacts on regional to global ocean physical environment, heat budgets, and climate change."

Interaction between H2 and CH4 is important for hydrogen’s global warming potential (GWP). Global models do not represent this interaction well; H2 or CH4 are prescribed at the surface. We implement an interactive H2 scheme into a global model coupled with interactive CH4. We simulate scenarios demonstrating its capability, improving model performance and more accurately representing H2-CH4 interaction. 
 Hydrogen is a potential candidate for an alternate energy source and carrier. As usage of hydrogen in industry rises, leakages into the atmosphere may occur, causing an increase in the global atmospheric hydrogen concentration. Hydrogen is an indirect greenhouse gas, known to increase methane, stratospheric water vapour, and tropospheric ozone. Methane and hydrogen are closely coupled, with the main atmospheric destructive pathway of both species being via reaction with the hydroxyl radical (OH). Currently, most earth system models (ESMs) simulate hydrogen or methane with a prescribed lower boundary condition, which suppresses chemical feedbacks at the surface. In this work, we implement hydrogen emissions and a hydrogen soil uptake scheme into an ESM with free-running methane to demonstrate the capability of a fully interactive hydrogen and methane emissions-driven ESM. We show that the model is able to capture long term trends and seasonal cycles of both species when compared to observations, and find that the inclusion of both fluxes does not impact other chemical species in the model, such as tropospheric ozone. We show that the model can be used under pre-industrial conditions and present day scenarios. The ESM with fully coupled hydrogen and methane chemistry has great potential to be used in future scenarios and to estimate a more accurate global warming potential of hydrogen."

Here, we assess five Improved Forest Management projects in China by constructing baselines using ex-post counterfactual methods based on satellite observations from 2001 to 2020. Applying methods including synthetic control, statistical matching, and machine learning, our counterfactuals, which accurately tracked pre-intervention carbon dynamics, reveal systematic underestimation of carbon sequestration in the reported baseline scenarios. We find that project forests would have continued to accumulate carbon stock naturally, contrary to the projects’ static and artificially low baseline projections. Using our empirically derived baselines, we find no evidence that management activities are additional across our study samples. These biased baselines contribute to systematic over-crediting: ex-ante projected emission reductions exceed our estimates by a factor of 3.7 (uncertainty range: 1.7–5.7), while ex-post issued carbon credits exceed our estimates by a factor of 1.7 (uncertainty range: 0.8–2.5). These findings expose a fundamental limitation of current offset protocols, which fail to account for real and dynamic forest trends, leading to inflated climate benefits.

Prevot,Unappreciated Role of Photochemical Aging of Biogenic Organic Nitrates in Atmospheric Ozone Formation,"Biogenic organic nitrate compounds (BONs) are major components of atmospheric secondary organic aerosols (SOA) and significantly impact the production of O3 through photochemical aging. However, the photolysis mechanisms and roles of BONs, especially the highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs-BONs), in the formation of the O3 remain unclear. By combining lab chamber experiments, numerical model simulation, and field observation, here we show that under our experimental conditions, the O3 formation rate through α-pinene-ONs photolysis is ten times greater than that of isoprene-ONs. This enhancement arises from stronger intramolecular interactions between the carbonyl and nitrooxy functional groups in α-pinene-ONs, which promote ultraviolet absorption and accelerate photolytic decomposition. The photolysis pathways of those BONs are different. While isoprene-ONs undergo photolysis through an initial cleavage of the O–NO2 bond followed by RO fragmentation, α-pinene-ONs undergo multigeneration photolysis commencing with C(O)–C bond cleavage and subsequent O–NO2 bond dissociation. We found that these BONs are actually oxidized by OH radicals via H abstraction from the peroxyhydroxyl group (−OOH) rather than the traditional thought from aldehyde (C(O)–H) or hydroxyl groups (−OH). Currently, the contribution of BONs photolysis to O3 formation is significantly underestimated in models, mainly due to neglecting the photolysis role of HOMs-BONs. Our study is the first to reveal a non-negligible contribution of α-pinene-ONs to atmospheric ozone formation, which should be accounted for by photochemical models in the future."

Here, we overturn this paradigm by reporting a widespread yet overlooked nanoscale phenomenon. Using a newly established suite of in situ atomic force microscope (AFM) techniques, we first visualized the dynamic formation of PFAS nanoclusters at the interface of naturally extracted dissolved organic matter (DOM). We further deciphered the underlying mechanism by probing intermolecular interactions, demonstrating that strong binding forces between PFAS molecules and specific DOM functional groups yield numerous small nanoclusters, whereas weaker interactions result in larger, sparser nanoclusters. This mechanism is quantified by a strong negative correlation (R = −0.983, P = 0.017) between nanocluster size and abundance across diverse PFAS structures (nonionic, anionic, cationic, zwitterionic). Crucially, plant exposure experiments demonstrate that this nanocluster formation universally mitigates PFAS phytotoxicity in rice seedlings. Compared to its molecularly dispersed state, the nanoclustered PFAS exhibit significantly reduced uptake, sequestered on root surfaces as a physical barrier. This work identifies the DOM-induced nanoclustering as a critical interface process that governs the bioaccessibility and risks of PFAS, thereby offering a transformative perspective for their environmental assessment and remediation."

Products formed under varying NOx levels were then classified using volatility and reactivity in aerosols and applied to the UNIfied Partitioning Aerosol Phase Reaction (UNIPAR) model, which predicts secondary organic aerosol (SOA) mass via multiphase reactions of hydrocarbons. UNIPAR was demonstrated using chamber data generated under varying environments. Daytime SOA formed dominantly by oxidations with OH radicals, and its order in SOA yields is as follows: 3-methylcatechol > o-cresol > o-catechol ≈ phenol. The NOx dependency of daytime SOA was weak and varied for each hydrocarbon. The methyl group on o-cresol and 3-methylcatechol increases SOA yields compared to phenol and o-catechol, respectively. With 50 ppb hydrocarbon under varying NOx levels, daytime o-cresol SOA yields are 0.46–0.68, which are 2-times larger than phenol, and those of 3-methylcatechol reach to 0.86, which is nearly 3-times higher than o-catechol. Nighttime oxidation of o-catechol (0.31) and 3-methylcatechol with O3 or NO3 produces considerable SOA yields 0.67 for 3-methylcatechol and 0.31 for o-catechol. OH-substituted aromatic HCs in wildfire smoke substantially form SOA through day and night oxidations in environments where O3 and NOx are abundant and influence air quality."

Gray;Molly Trudgill;Madison Shankle;Sarah Eggleston;Casimir de Lavergne;Eric D. Galbraith,Disequilibrium and Soft Tissue Pump Contributions to Glacial CO2 Drawdown,"A more “efficient” biological pump is thought to have played a key role in glacial CO2 drawdown, with two principal mechanisms invoked to stem the CO2 “leak” from the modern Southern Ocean. The first sees a strengthened soft tissue pump, associated with a reduction in the ocean's “preformed” nutrient inventory. The second sees an increase in air‐sea CO2 disequilibrium (termed the disequilibrium pump). We use an Earth system model (CM2Mc) to show the tracers radiocarbon (Δ14C) and oxygen (O2) exhibit distinct sensitivities to these two pumps within the deep ocean: Δ14C is more sensitive to disequilibrium pump changes, whereas O2 is more sensitive to soft tissue pump changes, as expected from the underlying processes. We apply these pump‐specific tracer stoichiometries to available deep ocean Δ14C and O2 proxy data from the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). Despite the sparsity of O2 data, the results show a consistent increase in soft tissue and disequilibrium DIC within the deep ocean of ∼135 μmol/kg, with broadly comparable contributions from the two pumps. Our results imply a reduction in air‐sea gas exchange (likely linked to expansion and/or increased isolation of Antarctic Bottom Water), as well as a slowdown of deep ocean overturning and Southern Ocean upwelling at the LGM. Notably, current ocean models struggle to simulate both of these changes simultaneously under glacial forcings. The combined changes in the soft tissue and disequilibrium DIC are of sufficient magnitude to explain the glacial reduction in atmospheric CO2 once a whole ocean alkalinity increase is accounted for."

However, it has been proposed that the higher stratospheric Δ17O(O3) can't be preserved en‐route to the troposphere given the rapidly re‐established isotopic equilibrium by photochemistry. Here, we reported Δ17O(O3) data mainly from the Tibetan Plateau, and found the relatively high Δ17O(O3) at Mt. Everest can't be explained by in situ photochemistry. Instead, the distinct diurnal cycle with elevated nighttime value at Mt. Everest is associated with the katabatic wind bringing stratosphere‐sourced O3 with high Δ17O. This demonstrates that the high Δ17O(O3) can be preserved at troposphere at some circumstances. Given the fast transfer of Δ17O(O3) to atmospheric nitrate, it might be potential to probe past STT of O3 using nearby ice core records of nitrate."

We estimate trends in effective radiative forcing (ERF) by separating TOA flux changes into forcing and response components, using feedback parameters derived from observed and simulated interannual variability and the CO2‐forced response. From 2010 to 2024, ERF trends are ∼1.0 W m−2 per decade for both net and shortwave fluxes, exceeding those for 2001–2024 and substantially larger than projections from state‐of‐the‐art models. This discrepancy persists across a wide range of climate sensitivities and forcing scenarios and shows limited sensitivity to feedback assumptions. The largest contribution arises from the shortwave component, with spatial patterns indicating particularly strong forcing increases over northern midlatitude oceans.

However, under the severe oceanic and atmospheric conditions of these storms, even spaceborne microwave radiometers struggle to retrieve reliable humidity data. This limitation stems primarily from heavy precipitation, which masks the water‐vapor signal in the observed brightness temperatures. To overcome these challenges, this study introduces a two‐pronged approach: (a) a neural network‐based screening of brightness temperatures to filter out precipitation‐contaminated measurements, and (b) the first use of low‐frequency microwave channel for humidity estimation in tropical cyclones. Comparisons with independent in situ observations demonstrate that our method provides more accurate near‐surface humidity estimates than previous techniques that do not use low‐frequency channels. These improvements will enhance the estimation of ocean‐to‐atmosphere enthalpy fluxes during tropical cyclones and may support better understanding of air‐sea interaction processes under extreme weather conditions."

Smith,Climate Implications of Hydrogen Deployment Considering Changes in Emissions From Direct and Indirect Forcers,"Hydrogen could help to decarbonize hard‐to‐electrify end uses in future energy systems. While increased hydrogen production, transmission, distribution, and use may lead to an increase in hydrogen emissions, both greenhouse gas (GHG) and non‐GHG emissions could decline as hydrogen displaces incumbent fuels and energy carriers. The full suite of potential climate forcing changes from hydrogen deployment has not been fully examined, in part because it requires combining information from different fields. This study addresses this gap by using a well‐known integrated assessment model (the Global Change Analysis Model) to combine (1) credible hydrogen deployment scenarios that illustrate which fuels and energy carriers could be displaced by hydrogen; (2) information about emissions of hydrogen and other forcers by technology, sector, region, and time; and (3) a simple climate model capable of translating relevant emissions into changes in radiative forcing. Across all scenarios considered, when compared to a scenario without expanded hydrogen deployment, reduced forcing from lower CO2 emissions is larger than other forcing changes by 2050 even after accounting for hydrogen and other indirect forcers. Forcing attributable to methane emissions may increase or decrease depending on how much hydrogen is produced with natural gas and how much natural gas is displaced as a fuel. Lastly, the net forcing change from changes in emissions of the indirect forcers CO, NOx, NMVOC, and H2, including their impact on methane's lifetime, is always small and in most cases negative at midcentury. These findings raise important questions for technology assessment regarding the treatment of indirect forcers and aerosols."

We conducted a long-term modeling study for the Rhine and Elbe basins and their 146 subbasins from 1950 to 2021 to quantify the roles of diffuse and, in particular, point sources in driving stream NO₃–N concentrations. In both basins, simulated results show a decline in point source contributions from 1950 to 2000, followed by a relatively stable level at around 25% in the Rhine and fluctuations around 30% levels in the Elbe. The decline in the simulated stream NO₃–N concentrations in both basins after 1990 was largely driven by a decrease in point sources, and stream NO₃–N concentrations remained high (∼2 mg l−1) during 2010–2021, even when point sources were excluded. At the subbasin level, changes in point source contributions and stream NO₃–N concentrations reflected the overall trends of their respective basins, although individual subbasins exhibited diverse patterns. In subbasins with high stream NO₃–N concentrations during 2010–2021, point source contribution accounted for around 30% (median values across subbasins), and the fractions of agricultural, urban, and industrial land cover were relatively high. These results highlight that point source management alone is not sufficient to reduce stream nitrate to a good ecological status (< 2 mg l−1), and spatial targeted management is required to achieve good ecological status at both the regional and local levels."

This study modeled CCN and chemical composition, aerosol size and hygroscopicity (κ) of SOA using a model treating every single step. We evaluated the model ability and limitations in simulated chemical composition, κ, particle size distribution and CCN as a potential benchmark model and found that the accurate simulation of SOA size and κ is essential for reliable CCN prediction. 
 Secondary organic aerosols (SOA) contribute significantly to cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), which depend on particle size distribution (PSD), chemical composition and the hygroscopicity parameter (κ). Simulating SOA and CCN in chemical transport models relies on parameterizations, which need to be evaluated and improved against process-level models as a benchmark. Here, we simulated SOA concentration, chemical composition, PSD, κ, and CCN in α-pinene ozonolysis, a classical system for SOA studies, using a process-level box model PyCHAM with near-explicit chemical mechanisms. We assessed how CCN, chemical composition, PSD and κ can be modelled against measurements and evaluated the influence of these factors on CCN simulation. The model well simulated SOA mass concentration but overestimated O : C and H : C ratios, suggesting a possible lack of particle-phase chemistry. Highly oxygenated molecules (HOMs) contributed substantially to SOA mass. Simulated κ closely agreed with measurements at moderate supersaturation (0.37 %) but was overestimated at low supersaturation (0.19 %) and underestimated at high supersaturation (0.55 % and 0.73 %). Particle growth and number concentrations were reasonably reproduced, though the simulated PSD was broader and flatter than measurement. Simulated CCN concentrations agreed well with measurements at moderate to high supersaturation (0.37 %–0.73 %) but were overestimated at low supersaturation (0.19 %). Sensitivity analysis highlights the importance of accurately representing both PSD and κ for reliable CCN prediction, especially at supersaturation < 0.4 %. This study also highlights that HOM formation, finer PSD resolution and improved κ parameterizations are warranted in future chemical transport models, and evaluates the ability and limitations of this benchmark model."

Buehler;Luisa Ickes,Advancements and continued challenges in observations and global modelling of atmospheric ice mass,"Our study shows that accurately representing atmospheric ice mass remains a major challenge. We compared climate models to satellite data, finding that conventional models consistently underestimate the amount of ice. While new, higher-resolution models perform better, both models and observations still have significant discrepancies. These shortcomings limit our confidence in cloud-related climate feedbacks, which are critical for our predictions of the future climate. 
 We assess the current status of atmospheric ice mass estimates by first critically comparing satellite-based datasets, then examining global circulation and global storm-resolving models. The analysis focuses on the frozen water path, which offers a more consistent measure across modelling and observational datasets than cloud ice or other partial quantities. As a reference, we use three retrievals derived from the CloudSat mission. Despite using the same input data, these retrievals exhibit a significant spread. Still, common biases cannot be ruled out, and we argue that the uncertainty in overall means can be as high as 30 %. A recently developed machine learning product based on passive thermal infrared observations greatly extends the spatial and temporal coverage available for comparisons, but its local precision is limited compared to radar-based retrievals.Global circulation models continue to underestimate frozen water paths compared to the observational benchmark and fail to provide consistent representations of regional temporal changes or the annual cycle. Storm-resolving models, which operate at finer grid spacing and explicitly resolve convective dynamics, show better representation of total ice mass, with variations among them similar to the observational uncertainty. However, several issues were noted, such as apparent deviations in the spatial structures of tropical deep convection, and they differ significantly in their relative amounts of cloud ice, snow, and graupel. Together, these findings reveal progress but highlight continuing uncertainties that limit confidence in projections of cloud-related climate feedbacks."

BrC’s photobleaching has been determined as a key reason to the uncertainty in its global radiative effect, which has been poorly constrained. This study revelas the source-dependent BrC photobleaching rates, and explained this difference from molecular perspective. Consequently, the OH oxidation reactivity of molecular composition of different types of BrC determines their distinct photobleaching rates. 
 The global radiative effect of brown carbon (BrC) remains highly uncertain. BrC's photobleaching, which significantly affects its radiative effect, has been still poorly constrained. This study investigates and compares photobleaching rates of laboratory-synthesized secondary BrC (aq-BrC), biomass burning-derived BrC (b-BrC), and ambient PM2.5-derived BrC (p-BrC) to illustrate the variability in BrC photobleaching kinetics from different types of BrC reported in prior studies. Our results reveal a source dependence in BrC photobleaching rates. The highest photobleaching rate constant (kBrC) is observed for aq-BrC (1.13 ± 0.08 h−1), followed by p-BrC (0.12 ± 0.02 h−1) and b-BrC (0.05 ± 0.01 h−1), indicating the stable light-absorption capacity of b-BrC in the atmosphere. Integration of these rate constants with data derived from previous studies highlighted the differences in photobleaching behaviors among BrC from different sources. The OH oxidation of imidazole-2-carboxaldehyde (2-IC) and methylglyoxal oligomers, nitrophenols (including phenols), and lignin derivatives governs the photobleaching of aq-BrC, p-BrC, and b-BrC, respectively. The high kBrC of aq-BrC is attributed to the high reactivity of the chain structures in 2-IC and methylglyoxal oligomers. In contrast, the highly conjugated structures of lignin derivatives in b-BrC impart stability against OH oxidation, resulting in a low kBrC. Our findings reveal the significant differences in the photobleaching behavior of BrC originated from different sources, underscoring the crucial need to account for source differences in assessments of BrC's global radiative forcing effect."

 Pesticide residues are ubiquitous in the atmosphere in the North China Plain (NCP), with concentrations largely determined by application patterns and physicochemical parameters such as persistence and volatility. However, knowledge of gas-particle partitioning of pesticides remains limited, hindering a comprehensive understanding of their abundance, transport, and health risks. Here, we aim to elucidate the underlying mechanism of gas-particle partitioning for pesticides. In this study, 14 pairs of air and particulate matter samples were collected simultaneously in Quzhou County, the NCP. A total of 19 pesticides were observed in both gas and particulate-phases. Average pesticide concentrations in particulate phase (2025.76±1048.83 pg m−3) were significantly higher than in gas phase (143.38±146.31 pg m−3), accounting for 93.4 % of the total atmospheric pesticide mass.

A positive correlation between temperature and particulate-phase pesticide concentrations was found, as indicated by rising of logKp values which is likely attributable to an interplay of pesticide physicochemical properties, ambient relative humidity, particle phase state and pesticide use patterns. Gas-particle partitioning model simulations showed absorption as the main mechanism of gas-particle partitioning, indicating atmospheric pesticides are absorbed into the interior organic film of particulate matter."

 The eastern Tibetan Plateau has a high elevation, with a cold and dry atmospheric background. The features of the raindrop size distributions (DSD) in this region have notable differences from those in the plains. The general empirical relationships for retrieving parameters of precipitation from radar observations are not applicable in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. In this study, we developed a new method based on optimal estimation theory to retrieve the vertical profiles of N0 and Dm from a Ka-band zenith-pointing Doppler radar. Validation by a field campaign during the summer of 2024 indicates that the mean bias in the log 10(N0) and Dm derived from the PARSIVEL2 disdrometer and the retrieved values are 0.12 and −0.1 mm respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the retrieved DSD parameters in this region. Based on the retrieved vertical profiles of DSD parameters, some unique characteristics are found. The heavy precipitation (the maximum value in the reflectivity profile exceeding 30 dBZ) exhibits a higher particle number concentration above 2 km and larger raindrop size in the bottom of the rainfall on average. The mean values of Dm above 2 km are approximately 0.5 mm, for heavy precipitation, the value increase as the raindrops fall, reaching a peak at around 0.5 km. Precipitation that occurs after the nighttime cooling usually has higher particle concentrations and smaller particle sizes. Based on the above research, empirical relationships for the quantitative precipitation estimates (QPE) and attenuation correction using Ka-band radar in the eastern Tibetan Plateau are established."

Each sample is paired with Sentinel-2 image time series and 27 auxiliary environmental variables, encompassing bioclimatic, geographic, and soil data. The dataset is partitioned into GlobalGeoTree-6M, a large subset for model pretraining, and curated evaluation subsets, primarily GlobalGeoTree-10kEval, a benchmark for zero-shot and few-shot classification. To demonstrate the utility of the dataset, we introduce a baseline model, GeoTreeCLIP, which leverages paired remote sensing data and taxonomic text labels within a vision-language framework pretrained on GlobalGeoTree-6M. Experimental results show that GeoTreeCLIP achieves substantial improvements in zero- and few-shot classification on GlobalGeoTree-10kEval over existing advanced models.

Here, we compiled an open global soil methane uptake database from the 1980s, covering most regions in multi-timescale along with the soil moisture and temperature data. The data show strong seasonal changes and different controls across biomes, helping improve climate estimates, models, and satellite evaluations. 
 Soil methane uptake (SMU), the second-largest and represents a biologically mediated sink for atmospheric methane (CH4) in terrestrial ecosystems, plays a non-negligible role in regulating the global CH4 budget. Field SMU observations have been conducted since the 1980s, but have not yet been systematically compiled within any unified and openly available framework. Here, we present the global Soil Methane Uptake Database (SMUD), which includes 2427 site-level records from 920 peer-reviewed publications spanning 1986 to 2025. SMUD contains SMU measurements at multiple temporal scales, including daily (n = 1425), monthly (n = 2001), seasonal (n = 1720), and annual (n = 1098), along with soil moisture and temperature data at daily and monthly scales. The collected datasets cover all major climatic zones and ecosystem types, across which SMU exhibits pronounced spatial and temporal variability. We found that seasonal- and biome-specific variations were key to understanding intra-annual changes in SMU. In particular, the effects of soil temperature and moisture on SMU are biome-specific: observations from Temperate Grassland are primarily associated with temperature changes, whereas those from Tropical Rainforest and Desert are mainly controlled by moisture, and other biomes show a mix of controlling factors. Overall, SMUD provides a comprehensive basis for understanding the global patterns of SMU, unraveling the underlying mechanisms, and estimating the global SMU budget. The database, associated data, and code to reproduce the results can be found at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18299391 (Jiang et al., 2026). We aim to establish SMUD maintenance as a collaborative, community-driven, shared, and user- managed database within the research community."

Ng,MEthane Tracking Emissions Reference (METER): A global database of methane-emitting infrastructure,"The MEthane Tracking Emissions Reference (METER) database hosts 12 million potential methane-emitting sources globally from 200+ countries. It includes oil and gas facilities, coal mines, and other sources. We used machine-learning and satellite data to map the first global landfill dataset (~13,000 landfills >2.5-ha in size). METER should improve inventories of methane emissions by enhancing infrastructure counts and provides locations for tasking satellite detections. 
 Methane (CH4) is the most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas for warming after carbon dioxide (CO2). Methane is also more potent than CO2 ton for ton, with a global warming potential (GWP) > 80-times higher than CO2 over the first two decades after release and ~30-times greater over a century. Currently, approximately 160 countries and the European Union are attempting to reduce global methane emissions through the Global Methane Pledge. Accurate assessments of methane emissions are needed to track progress and verify emission reductions. Satellites are one of the tools being used to do this work, but satellites require accurate counts and locations of infrastructure types for tasking their imagers. Here, we introduce the first version of the MEthane Tracking Emissions Reference (METER) database. METER is a publicly available, global database of methane-emitting infrastructure, designed as a platform to be updated with new datasets identified by users. We combined public datasets and machine-learning (ML) identifications based on satellite imagery. We processed public databases of a given infrastructure type, using the collected databases as training and validation data to ML models on multiple sources of remotely sensed data to detect infrastructure globally. This synergy of ML with earth observation enabled a substantial increase in the completeness of multiple types of facilities represented in METER. It contains more than 12.3 million locations of methane-emitting infrastructure in more than 200 countries globally. The locations represent most major methane-emitting infrastructure types, from the fossil fuel industry (including oil and gas wells and wellpads, pipelines, refineries, terminals, and compressor stations) and from additional methane-emitting sources that include landfills, power plants, and coal mines. For some infrastructure types, most of the locations were made using ML. These determinations include to our knowledge the first global estimate of landfill locations (~13,000 landfills >2.5-ha in size), three-quarters of which came from ML approaches, storage tanks on oil and gas well pads (100 % ML determinations for both storage tanks and well pad determinations). We identified >170,000 new well pads globally, including ~40,000 well pads in Russia, one of the world’s largest oil and gas producers, where to our knowledge no prior sources or public data existed previously. METER is already playing an important role in satellite tracking of methane emissions, providing satellite providers with infrastructure locations such as landfills to track. It should also prove useful for updating bottom-up inventories of methane emissions through more accurate infrastructure counts or “activity factors.”"

We examined critical windows for the associations between heat exposure during pregnancy and fetal growth and investigated the role of air pollution, vegetation, and social stressors in these associations. Weekly exposure to ambient temperature and air pollutants (PM2.5, NO2, O3) from highly resolved spatiotemporal models, vegetation, and contextual deprivation were estimated for 20,904 French women (2002–2017). Distributed lag nonlinear models evaluated associations between heat and term birth weight (tBW), tBW Z-score, and small-for-gestational-age. We further adjusted our models for air pollutants and stratified on vegetation and social determinants. Heat exposure during the first two trimesters was associated with reduced fetal growth. A mean temperature of 21.6 °C (95th percentile vs median 13.6 °C) during weeks 2–15 was associated with a reduced tBW (−199 g [95% CI: −268; −131]). These associations differed after adjusting for O3 exposure. Trends for stronger associations were observed in women with low vegetation exposure, low social position, and high contextual deprivation.

Yang;Ziyi Li,Enhancing Sorbate–Sorbent Interactions via Anchoring Multiple Nitrogen Sites into Multilayered Porous Carbons Enables Superior Toluene Capture,"Toluene, a toxic aromatic pollutant widely present in air, poses serious risks to environmental health, especially at trace concentrations. Although porous carbon stands out as one of the most potentially useful materials for toluene capture, achieving superior toluene capture from real-world ambient conditions remains a tough challenge, attributed to weak sorbate–sorbent interactions and competitive adsorption from ubiquitous water vapor. Herein, we propose a design concept centered on driving the tight binding between toluene and sorbent through multiple π–π complexation and point-to-point interactions by anchoring multiple nitrogen sites into multilayered porous carbon (FPC) via a urea-mediated pyrolysis approach. This strong sorbate–sorbent interaction mechanism imparts effectively enhanced adsorption and selectivity for toluene. This behavior enables FPC to achieve a remarkable toluene uptake of 344 mg·g–1 at trace concentration (400 ppm), surpassing previous benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains 97% efficiency even at 70% relative humidity, a performance unparalleled in known porous carbons. This work demonstrates a practical and scalable approach to designing high-performance carbon adsorbents through molecular-level functionality modulation, providing a feasible solution for the removal of aromatic pollutants under realistic conditions."

We measure Hg concentrations and isotopic compositions in 12 major Chinese rivers during 2021–2022 to constrain riverine Hg sources and evaluate trends and drivers of national riverine Hg export. We determine a two- to twentyfold decrease in THg levels in 2021–2022 (mean: 6.69 ± 4.74 ng L–1) compared with previous observations since 2008. The median δ202Hg, Δ199Hg, and Δ200Hg values of riverine THg are −1.22‰, 0.01‰, and 0.01‰, respectively. Hg isotope mixing model results reveal that soil erosion, wastewater discharge, and rainfall input contribute ∼51%, ∼33%, and ∼16%, respectively, to riverine Hg. The estimated riverine THg export in 2021–2022 was 45.1 ± 12.1 Mg yr–1, ∼46% lower than the 2016 estimate. We combine source identification and atmospheric Hg observations to demonstrate that water pollution controls contribute ∼95% to recent riverine THg export declines. Using new riverine Hg isotope data, we estimate that riverine export contributes ∼67% and ∼45% to estuarine and continental shelf sediment Hg, respectively, in East Asia. These findings highlight the co-benefits of water pollution controls in reducing riverine Hg pollution, potentially mitigating Hg risks in coastal ecosystems."

In this study, systematic screening of nitrogen-containing compounds showed that discrete inorganic nitrogen species (e.g., ammonium and nitrate) failed to induce any measurable degradation or defluorination of PFOA. In contrast, nitrogen-containing compounds with lone-pair electrons (e.g., glycine and nitrilotriacetic acid) acted as effective promoters, enabling a maximum PFOA removal efficiency of 88.4% within 300 min. Using glycine as a representative additive, mechanistic investigations demonstrated that cooperative coordination among glycine, PFOA, and the Pt electrode surface promotes anodic direct electron transfer. In parallel, glycine-assisted electrochemical processes generate reactive oxidizing species, particularly reactive nitrogen species (e.g., •NO3) and hydroxyl radicals (•OH), which contribute to indirect oxidation pathways. These two processes act synergistically to govern the PFOA degradation. Fluorine mass balance analysis further revealed that stepwise defluorination via CnF2n+1• and COF2 formation dominated mineralization, accounting for 85.4–97.9% of fluorine release, whereas short-chain intermediates constituted only a minor route. Overall, this study elucidates the coupled roles of interfacial coordination regulation and reactive nitrogen chemistry in electrochemical PFAS degradation, providing mechanistic guidance for effective electrochemical treatment systems."

Herein, we quantitatively elucidate the interaction forces between aged polystyrene MPs (PSMPs) and self-assembled monolayer (SAM)-functionalized surfaces at the solid/water interface using colloidal probe atomic force microscopy (AFM), complemented by quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) analysis. The results reveal that adhesion forces are strongly influenced by aqueous salinity and pH, with π–π stacking and electrostatic/cation−π interactions likely contributing predominantly on phenyl- and amino-terminated surfaces, respectively. A robust correlation between nanoscale adhesion forces and macroscopic adsorption capabilities is established, enabling predictive understanding of aged MP–surface interactions. Guided by these mechanistic insights, a tannic acid-modified chitosan biomaterial integrating amino and phenyl functionalities is developed, achieving over 92.1% removal efficiency for aged PSMPs across diverse water chemistries at an environmentally relevant initial MP concentration of 1 mg L–1. This work provides an intermolecular force–driven design paradigm that bridges nanoscale intermolecular interaction mechanisms with macroscopic material performance, offering theoretical and practical guidance for next-generation remediation strategies targeting environmentally aged MPs."

A key SOA formation pathway is the reactive uptake of isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX), a process influenced by multiple environmental factors. Here, we simulate the spatial distribution and interannual trend of IEPOX-SOA over Eastern China from 2014 to 2019 using CMAQ and quantify the contributions of different factors. Our results indicate that ambient IEPOX-SOA concentrations are elevated in central and northeast China, averaging 135 ng·m−3 and with a recent declining trend between −19.1 and −34.8 ng·m−3·yr−1. Long-term trends of IEPOX-SOA are primarily driven by changes in sulfate (−50.5 ng·m−3·yr−1), which serve as seed aerosols, while a decrease in organic carbon reduces the coating effects and partially offsets (+16.1 ng·m−3·yr−1) the decline. Aerosol acidity plays a key role in governing its spatial distribution by affecting reactive rates. In Eastern China, high ammonia levels effectively neutralize acidity, thereby suppressing abundant IEPOX-SOA formation, resulting in lower concentrations compared to other regions, such as the United States. Sensitivity tests indicate that substantial future NH3 reductions in China could increase the IEPOX-SOA by up to 100%.

Pyrite was substituted with trace levels of Ni and Co to systematically investigate the influence of their incorporation on interfacial reactions and the generation of redox active species under light irradiation. Photocatalytic degradation of model organic matter and a pollutant in the presence of pyrite was significantly accelerated by the trace Ni/Co substitution. Trace Ni/Co substitution was found to significantly enhance the photochemical reactivity of pyrite through altering the pathways of interfacial redox reactions, accelerating the release of Fe2+, sustaining the production of redox active species, and suppressing the oxidation of sulfur. Specifically, Ni substitution increased •OH production by 1.80-fold, mainly via a photoelectron-driven reduction that sustains the photo-Fenton process. Co substitution increased •OH production by 1.64-fold, primarily through photo-Fenton and ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT) processes. Dual substitution with Ni and Co leads to cooperative enhancement of •OH production by 1.97-fold through multiple pathways, including photo-Fenton, LMCT, and reactions involving Fe2+/sulfur intermediates and O2.

However, the vertical variations of NO3 chemistry within the nocturnal boundary layer remain poorly understood, owing to the stratification of air masses and complex vertical chemistry. Here, we combined vertical and ground-based measurements of NO3 precursors from diverse atmospheric environments with model simulations to investigate the vertical structure of nocturnal NO3 oxidation and its long-term trend. Our results indicate that the nocturnal enhanced NO3 chemistry aloft event occurs far more frequently in megacities (64–72%) than in representative clean areas (16%), with a median enhancement factor of 2.7 relative to the surface. The event largely promotes the formation of secondary pollutants aloft rather than at the surface. We further show the event is more prevalent in China and India, attributed to intense ground-level NOx emissions, than in the United States and Europe. However, its frequency has declined rapidly in China in recent years, closely linked to the implementation of NOx emission controls. These findings highlight the critical role of vertical gradients in nocturnal NO3 chemistry on surface air pollution and underscore the need for comprehensive vertical measurements to support further improvement of urban air quality."

Substantial field surveys have been undertaken to explore the dynamics of MPs in urban runoff within small catchments (typically below 1000 km2). Nevertheless, identifying potential sources of MPs in large regions remains a challenging task. In this study, we provide a polymer-type-specific exploration of MPs in a large metropolitan area located on a piedmont alluvial fan, spanning over 16 000 km2. A total of 20 759 MPs (size ranging from 20 to 500 μm), representing 11 polymer types, were identified using laser direct infrared (LDIR) chemical imaging spectroscopy. Different sampling types, including impervious surfaces, roof drainage, and soil slopes across both hilly and plain areas, were included in this study. Multivariate statistical analyses, including partial least squares path modeling, showed that the abundance of MPs was influenced by precipitation characteristics, topography, and degree of rurality. Furthermore, multiple lines of evidence from abundance, polymer type, oxidation, and fouling characteristics suggested contributions from both local mobilization of soil MPs and atmospheric deposition.

Satellite-derived data show limited attainment of NCAP goals: 44 cities met the 20% PM2.5 target and one met the PM10 target; six cities achieved the 30% PM2.5 target and one met the 40% target. Average improvements were 12% (8.2 μg m–3) for PM2.5 and 4.9% (5.7 μg m–3) for PM10. Monitoring data indicate similarly modest progress: 7 of 29 cities met the 20% PM2.5 target and 43 of 96 met the PM10 target.

Current models often oversimplify SSA composition while neglecting the potential impact of wind speed variability. Here, we present the first direct measurements of SSA chemical mixing state under controlled wind speeds (11–18 m/s) in the Scripps Ocean-Atmosphere Research Simulator (SOARS). These experiments isolate the impact of wind speed on SSA chemical mixing state while limiting biological variability. Increasing wind speed drives a transition toward more homogeneous, salt-enriched SSA, increasing from 46% at 11 m/s to 80% at 18 m/s. Simultaneously, aerosolized coastal water pollutants decline sharply, while organic-enriched and biologically influenced particles increase, consistent with wind-driven disruption of the sea surface microlayer. As the size of SSA particles approaches the CCN-relevant range, we observe enhanced organic fractions, largely associated with sea salt. Moreover, the rise in larger accumulation mode SSA (>700 nm) enriched with biological species at high wind speeds is consistent with observed increases in INP concentrations in parallel SOARS measurements. This study demonstrates how wind-driven changes alter SSA mixing state, underscoring the need to incorporate these effects when modeling SSA climate properties and aerosol–cloud interactions."

Using the WRF-CMAQ model, this study constructs city-specific EKMA diagrams by perturbing O3 precursor emissions across the Greater Bay Area (GBA) of China and integrates source apportionment to quantify these biases. Results reveal that such isopleths overestimate city-specific control efficacy by approximately 58.7% on average across the GBA cities, based on monthly O3 metrics, with biases persisting as high as 47.2% even in relatively stagnant meteorological conditions. This indicates that local isopleths derived from regional emission perturbations inadequately represent the effectiveness of local emission controls. Reinterpreting the city-specific isopleths from a regional emission reduction perspective and applying multiple air quality indicators, we observe O3 concentration rebounds in numerous GBA cities due to inappropriate NOx reductions. Nonetheless, when shifting to a risk-based perspective, short-term NOx reductions achieve overall health benefits by offsetting greater NO2 risks, which outweigh the elevated O3-related risks in VOC-limited regimes. These insights provide evidence supporting governmental efforts to prioritize short-term, cost-effective NOx-focused controls, which deliver immediate health benefits, particularly in high-NOx urban cores. Additionally, this study offers positive incentives for adopting long-term attainment strategies with balanced NOx:AVOCs (anthropogenic VOCs) ratios of 1:1 or even 2:1 to achieve air pollution abatement and decarbonization in the GBA simultaneously. Our work highlights the imperative of aligning EKMA-RAQMs diagram interpretations with experimental designs and provides a novel perspective for holistically evaluating regional emission control policies."

The latter is ∼4X the precipitation change observed since 1950. Glacier morphology and topographic setting explain 32% of ΔELA variance, likely reflecting differing sensitivities to climatic shifts and elevation‐dependent warming. Spatially interpolated ΔELA residuals are most strongly correlated to winter precipitation (r = −0.67).

Two Polar Radiant Energy in the Far Infrared Experiment (PREFIRE) satellites, PREFIRE2 (SAT‐2) and PREFIRE1 (SAT‐1), were launched in 2024. They measure spectrally resolved radiances from 5 to 53 μm at 0.84 μm spectral resolution. Deriving spectral outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and tracking its changes relative to other polar climate factors are key focuses of the PREFIRE mission. We describe a set of algorithms developed to estimate spectral OLR from the PREFIRE L1B‐calibrated radiances. Spectral angular distribution models were developed to invert spectral radiance to spectral flux. For the spectral region not covered by the PREFIRE measurements, a principal‐component‐based linear regression scheme is used to estimate the spectral flux. When the clear‐sky spectral OLRs derived from the PREFIRE SAT‐2 measurements are compared with counterparts derived from in situ measurements, the mean differences in broadband and far‐IR OLR are 7.5 and 3.4 Wm−2, respectively. The results are also evaluated against collocated broadband and other spectral satellite measurements. The difference (mean ± standard deviation) between the collocated PREFIRE SAT‐2 and CERES broadband OLR is 2.8 ± 5.7 and 2.7 ± 6.5 Wm−2 for clear‐sky and cloudy‐sky footprints, respectively. Similar agreements can be seen from the comparisons with spectral OLR derived from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder and Cross‐track Infrared Sounder measurements. In general, spectral OLR derived from SAT‐2 has better agreement with other collocated measurements than that from SAT‐1, which can be attributed to the higher noisy performance of the SAT‐1 instrument."

Based on 23 years (2001–2023) of multiple observational data sets, our study provides the first comprehensive observational assessment of RCE applicability over the TP. We find that the TP exhibits a pronounced annual‐mean energy imbalance (−15.9 W/m2), characterized by strong seasonal asymmetry. Summers show intense positive energy imbalance (+56.0 W/m2) driven by latent heating from precipitation, while winters show extreme radiative cooling (−71.8 W/m2). Transitional months (April/September) alone achieve transient energy balance. The TP manifests four energy imbalance regimes, categorized by precipitation intensity and radiative cooling thresholds. These regimes transition seasonally, with Strong Precipitation‐Weak Cooling dominating summer monsoonal regions and Weak Precipitation‐Strong Cooling prevailing in winter and autumn. Daily near‐RCE conditions occur transiently with only 5%–10% frequency across all spatiotemporal scales, contrasting sharply with tropical regions where equilibrium emerges through spatial aggregation. Analysis of extreme events reveals that intense latent heating drives a positive imbalance during summer heating events, which is compensated primarily by enhanced vertical dry static energy divergence. Persistent radiative cooling creates a sustained negative imbalance during winter cooling events, which is countered by vertical divergence of dry static energy flux and meridional cold air advection. These results challenge the direct application of tropical RCE paradigms to the TP region and highlight the need for a skewed RCE framework that explicitly incorporates the TP's unique thermal forcing effects."

This work presents a chameleon-inspired electronic skin for adaptive electrochromic thermal regulation with minimal energy input and scalability potential. 
 Maintaining thermal comfort sustainably is critical to reduce the share of global energy used for heating and cooling. However, current radiative materials for personal thermal management typically offer a singular direction of operation (either heating or cooling), lacking intelligent and sustainable adaptability to fluctuating environments. Here we report an all-solid-state autonomous colour-changing skin (ACCS) that integrates both solar heating and radiative cooling within a single energy-efficient platform. Inspired by the adaptive behaviour of chameleon skin, the ACCS enables continuous modulation of emissivity across the solar (0.3–2.5 µm) and mid-infrared (8–13 µm) spectra. The device tunes solar absorptivity by ~40% and infrared emissivity by over 50% under a voltage bias of only ±1.3 V, maintaining each state for more than 24 h without power consumption. Outdoor tests revealed reversible temperature differences of up to 15.5 °C between heating and cooling modes, while a single smartphone battery can power over 200 full-range switching cycles. The solution-processable functional layers permit scalable fabrication via drop-casting and roll-to-roll techniques, extending applications from wearable devices to large-area environmental control. This flexible, energy-neutral platform advances adaptive personal thermoregulation and illustrates how multispectral electrochromic design can decouple human comfort from fossil fuel-based climate control, contributing to global sustainability goals.

 Antarctic fast ice is essential for ice shelf stability and the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water, which are critical for global ocean circulation. Despite its importance, the variability of fast ice has not been extensively studied. Here, we investigate the influence of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) on fast ice variability in March. We find that circum-Antarctic fast ice variability in March is significantly associated with the strength of SAM in the previous September, particularly in the regions of Dronning Maud Land (DML), the Amundsen Sea (AS), and the Australian sector (Aus). In DML and AS, positive SAM induces northward sea ice drift near the coast, which can contribute to reduced surrounding sea ice during spring. This sea ice loss is further amplified by increased net solar radiation associated with reduced albedo. In turn, ocean swell near the coast increases during summer, contributing to the reduction of fast ice in March. In contrast, fast ice variability in the Aus region is less linked to coastal sea ice loss. Instead, in this region, where north–south-oriented coastal features are prominent, fast ice formation is associated with westward pack ice advection driven by the Antarctic Coastal Current. Positive SAM enhances eastward sea ice drift, hindering westward ice advection and reducing springtime fast ice, ultimately leading to decreased fast ice in March."

 Addressing the limited compatibility, generalizability, and interpretability of prevailing methods for evaluating the cooling effects of urban blue–green spaces (BGS), this study proposes a Land Surface Temperature Parameterization Method (LSTPM). Based on local temperature gradients and divergence, LSTPM physically characterizes the dominant cooling influence of BGS to derive four indicators: cooling intensity (CI), cooling distance (CD), cooling efficiency (CE), and cooling gradient (CG). Using 208 BGS within Beijing's Sixth Ring Road and multi-temporal Landsat imagery, we compare LSTPM with the Buffer Method (BM) and Gaussian Model Method (GMM). Results indicate that: (1) The BM was the most permissive, identifying valid cooling effects in over 60% of samples across all seasons, whereas the GMM was the most conservative and unstable. (2) Numerically, LSTPM and BM showed strong consistency in CI (r = 0.68 in summer) but diverged significantly in CD (r = 0.17), highlighting LSTPM's distinct spatial delineation capabilities. (3) Validity tests using built-up land as a negative control demonstrated that LSTPM offered the strongest discrimination, whereas the BM frequently misclassified built-up areas as cooling sources. (4) Sensitivity analysis revealed that while the BM is highly robust (CI relative change <18% under 0.3σ noise), the LSTPM is more sensitive to data quality (CI change up to 71.5%). Consequently, LSTPM is best suited for precise, explanatory analyses with high-quality data; the BM for general, robust applications; and the GMM for small-sample exploratory modeling. Grounding identification in physical processes, this study refines methodological choices for urban thermal management."

 Remote sensing text–image retrieval (RSTIR) aims to retrieve the matched remote sensing (RS) images from the database according to the descriptive text. Recently, the rapid development of large visual-language pre-training models provides new insights for RSTIR. Nevertheless, as the complexity of models grows in RSTIR, the previous studies suffer from suboptimal resource efficiency during transfer learning. To address this issue, we propose a computation and memory-efficient retrieval (CMER) framework for RSTIR. To reduce the training memory consumption, we propose the Focus-Adapter module, which adopts a side branch structure. Its focus layer suppresses the interference of background pixels for small targets. Simultaneously, to enhance data efficacy, we regard the RS scene category as the metadata and design a concise augmentation technique. The scene label augmentation leverages the prior knowledge from land cover categories and shrinks the search space. We propose the negative sample recycling strategy to make the negative sample pool decoupled from the mini-batch size. It improves the generalization performance without introducing additional encoders. We have conducted quantitative and qualitative experiments on public datasets and expanded the benchmark with some advanced approaches, which demonstrates the competitiveness of the proposed CMER. Compared with the recent advanced methods, the overall retrieval performance of CMER is 2%–5% higher on RSITMD. Moreover, our proposed method reduces memory consumption by 49% and has a 1.4x data throughput during training. The code of the CMER and the dataset will be released at [Link]."

 In the framework of vegetation modelling, the accurate representation of spatial heterogeneity is a challenge for remotely sensed radiative transfer models (RTMs). On the one hand, one-dimensional RTMs are highly realistic on homogeneous surfaces but have limitations when modelling complex structures, while three-dimensional RTMs, although physically detailed, have a high computational cost and greater complexity in parameterisation. In this paper, we present the SILVO (Simplified Light-Vegetation Overlay) model as a streamlined ray-tracing tool that allows the generation of basic spatial metrics (gap fraction, scene vegetation density) on a geometrical representation of the canopy. The model is driven by a simplified scene description and solar illumination conditions, and has been implemented in parallel with OpenMP to provide a computationally efficient solution. The results obtained in a real heterogeneous forest scene demonstrate the ability of the model to capture the essential aspects of the canopy’s spatial structure, facilitating the extension of 1D RTMs for more realistic representations of heterogeneous canopies. An indicative comparison with LiDAR-derived structural proxies is also reported (R2 = 0.774 for vertical vegetation density; NRMSE = 11.7% for gap fraction), while acknowledging that this does not constitute a full validation exercise. As it is an active project, and in search of integration with future developments, its code is available under the AGPL license in a public repository."

 Accurate canopy-height information in steep mountain forests is essential for biomass estimation, habitat characterization, and monitoring climate-sensitive ecotones, yet the reliability of spaceborne LiDAR height products in rugged terrain remains poorly constrained. Here we benchmarked Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) footprint canopy-height metrics and two GEDI-derived global canopy-height products (GFCH 2019 and GCH 2020) using a 1 m UAV-LiDAR canopy height model acquired along a ∼ 2,000 m elevational transect in the central Himalayas, Nepal. We show that GEDI RH95, paired with the UAV P95 reference in a like-with-like percentile comparison, reproduces the overall canopy-height distribution with minimal systematic bias but substantial footprint-scale dispersion, with errors that are spatially structured by terrain and sub-footprint heterogeneity. A footprint-shift experiment indicates that plausible horizontal misregistration contributes comparatively little to overall uncertainty reinforcing that topography and within-footprint variability dominate the error budget in this setting. At the map scale, GFCH 2019 captures broad elevational patterns but systematically underestimates tall canopy heights and exhibits terrain-dependent residual structure, whereas GCH 2020 shows widespread positive bias and spatially patchy coverage over the LiDAR-mapped domain. Together, these results provide a rare UAV-LiDAR benchmark for interpreting GEDI footprint heights and GEDI-derived canopy height models in a data-scarce, high-relief mountain forest, and highlight the need for terrain-aware uncertainty characterization and local calibration when these products are used for biomass, habitat, and treeline/upper-montane applications."

 Accurate road extraction from remote sensing imagery is vital for urban planning and intelligent transportation. However, its accuracy is often limited by complex backgrounds, spectral ambiguity, and diverse road shapes. Recent deep learning methods have made strong progress, including topology-aware designs that explicitly encourage structural consistency; however, performance can still degrade under weak textures, occlusion, and rapidly changing orientations, where thin roads become fragmented and boundaries blur. To address these limitations, RoadAttNet is developed to enhance road network integrity and boundary delineation. The architecture integrates multidimensional physical priors through a learnable weighting mechanism. Furthermore, an Oriented Coordinate Attention (OCA) module is incorporated to reinforce directional continuity and refine boundary precision via oriented pooling operations. Feature representation and training stability are further optimized through an adaptive deep supervision strategy. Quantitative evaluations on the Massachusetts and Lanzhou datasets demonstrate the superiority of RoadAttNet over existing benchmarks. Compared to state-of-the-art methods such as MSMDFF-Net, the proposed architecture achieves improvements of up to 2.3% in IoU and 1.43% in F1-score. Additionally, the clDice connectivity metric increases by 2.1%, indicating a substantial reduction in network fragmentation and enhanced topological consistency.

 Although the adverse health effects of particulate matter (PM) are often considered in terms of mass and particle size, a growing number of studies now focus on new health metrics such as the oxidative potential (OP) of PM, highlighting the role of certain metals, among them copper (Cu), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) for their capacity to impact OP levels in ambient air. In this study, we built on a previously-developed European anthropogenic emission inventory for Cu, Fe and Mn to simulate PM10 concentrations of these metals within PM10 during a two-year period with the WRF-CHIMERE chemistry transport model, applying a source-tagging method. We also estimated the contribution of erosion dust (mostly of African origin) and urban dust (mostly road and construction dust) as significant sources for each of these metals.For validation purpose, we compared the simulation results with a large database of measurements collected from various sources and locations. The medians of the fractional mean biases for Cu are close to zero for both rural and urban background sites, indicating that the emission in the inventory adequately represent atmospheric Cu concentrations. However, the biases are highly negative for Fe and Mn in a simulation when only considering anthropogenic emissions. The correlation coefficients obtained for (rural and urban) background stations range from 0.4 to 0.6, with urban sites showing slightly higher correlations for Fe but slightly lower ones for Cu and Mn. The inclusion of desert dust sources improves the correlation for some rural stations, while including local urban dust has a less pronounced effect.

 Air pollution poses a significant environmental risk, necessitating effective mitigation and management strategies. The Yellow River Basin (YRB), being a critical region for air pollution control, as it contains 20 cities with the poorest air quality in China, making it one of the area's most severely affected by smog pollution. Understanding the spatiotemporal variations, extreme events, and abrupt changes in aerosol optical depth (AOD) across the YRB is crucial for optimizing measures for air pollution prevention and control measures. This study employs a comprehensive approach, utilizing Rotated Empirical Orthogonal Function (REOF) analysis, Mann-Kendall tests, HYbrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory model (HYSPLIT), and circulation field synthesis to investigate AOD variations across different subregions of the YRB from 2000 to 2023. Result reveals a significant abrupt change in 2019, marking a transition from an increasing to decreasing trend. Regionally, AOD slightly increased in the western part, while notable decrease was observed in the central and eastern parts. Among different pollutants, dust contributed the most to AOD, followed by SO2, SO4, and OC, with sea salt and BC are contributing the least. At the synoptic scale, air masses originating from the eastern regions of YRB contributed to higher AOD values, whereas those from the western contributed to lower values. Furthermore, air subsidence under high–pressure control and low planetary boundary layer height (excluding western YRB) hampered vertical diffusion, and failed to explain observed AOD change, underscoring the substantial influence of human interventions. Anthropogenic emissions and policy interventions are significant drivers of AOD variations, indicating that targeted interventions need to be done to improve the air quality."

 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are hazardous air pollutants with significant environmental justice (EJ) implications for communities located near industrial zones. In this study, we deployed an integrated monitoring framework combining online thermal desorption–gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (TD-GC-MS), proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-QMS), and targeted offline sampling to characterize toxic VOCs in an EJ community adjacent to two industrial complexes. A total of 86 toxic VOCs were monitored at high temporal resolution over one month, supported by inter-comparison with offline canisters and PTR-QMS validation. Our study underscores the value of real-time plume detection, which is indispensable for two purposes: facilitating source investigation and accurately assessing health risks. Time-resolved measurements revealed frequent episodic plumes that are often missed by offline methods, with benzene, vinyl chloride, and carbon tetrachloride dominating both non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health burdens. For example, benzene contributed approximately 40–45% of the total cancer risk, followed by vinyl chloride (30–35%) and carbon tetrachloride (15–20%). In contrast, risk estimates based on offline canister data were lower by nearly 50–60%, highlighting the substantial underestimation of episodic exposures when relying on canister sampling. Trajectory analysis linked emission spikes to specific industrial sectors, including textile dyeing, plastics, and solvent use, with sorbent sampling confirming sources. The detection of carbon tetrachloride, a banned ozone-depleting substance, underscores its persistent emissions. This integrated monitoring approach demonstrates the critical role of high-resolution VOC data in health risk assessment, pollution forensics, and targeted mitigation in vulnerable EJ communities."

 Understanding the response of the global hydrological cycle to anthropogenic warming is critical for advancing water resources management and mitigating hydrological risks. This study employs a multi-model ensemble from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to quantify projected changes in key global hydrological components, including evaporation, precipitation, total column water vapor (TCWV), and ocean-to-land moisture transport, under medium-emission (SSP2–4.5) and high-emission (SSP5–8.5) scenarios. Our analysis demonstrates a robust and progressively intensifying hydrological cycle throughout the 21st century, with substantially stronger changes under SSP5–8.5. Relative to 1995–2014, TCWV increases by 5.5% (2021–2040) and 16.8% (2081–2100) under SSP2–4.5, and by 6.3% and 34.8% under SSP5–8.5. A pronounced land–ocean asymmetry emerges: land regions exhibit more pronounced changes than oceans, with increases in terrestrial precipitation approximately 1.10–1.40 times greater than the corresponding oceanic rates, indicating stronger land amplification. Ocean-to-land moisture transport rises by 6.2% under SSP2–4.5 and 13.5% under SSP5–8.5 by the end of the century, contributing significantly to enhanced land precipitation and highlighting the importance of atmospheric moisture redistribution in shaping continental water availability. This study consolidates the quantitative sensitivity of the global water cycle to emission pathways and provides critical insights to support climate adaptation strategies."

 The distinctive light-absorption properties of elemental carbon (EC) emitted from solid fuel combustion significantly influence both regional and global climate systems. This study investigated the mass absorption efficiency of EC (MAEEC) at 633 nm wavelength using laboratory-simulated biomass and coal combustion combined with carbon analysis. Diagnostic ratios of carbon components, including EC/PM2.5, organic carbon (OC)/EC, and char-EC/soot-EC, were investigated to characterize the difference in crop residue, wood, and coal combustion emissions. The average MAEEC values varied significantly among fuel types, with crop residue burning showing the highest value (11.2 ± 3.2 m2 g−1), followed by coal combustion (5.5 ± 2.2 m2 g−1) and wood burning (3.0 ± 0.9 m2 g−1). Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that OC/EC ratio was the primary factor influencing MAEEC values, possibly attributed to the lensing effect of OC coating. An optical emission inventory of EC from residential solid fuel combustion in the Guanzhong Plain was further developed using our experimentally determined MAEEC, referenced mass emission factors of EC, and county-level activity data to quantify regional optical impacts. These results should advance the understanding of EC radiative effects from residential solid fuel combustion and provide crucial scientific evidence for developing targeted emission reduction policies."

 Aqueous secondary organic aerosol (aqSOA) contributes substantially to organic aerosol (OA), affecting air quality, human health, and climate. However, the molecular composition and processing of aqSOA in clouds remain unclear due to limited online field measurements. We measured molecular composition of OA online (time resolution 20 s) and tracked its processing at a mountain site in southeastern China, using an Extractive ElectroSpray Ionization inlet coupled with a Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometer (EESI-ToF-MS). We identified 2084 molecular formulas and compared OA composition from three sample types: cloud droplet residuals (CDR), interstitial aerosol particles (INT), and cloud-free aerosol particles (CF) in representative cloud episodes. CHO class was the dominant constituent, followed by CHON class. In most cloud episodes, the fraction of CHO was lower in CDR than that in INT and CF, while the fraction of CHON was higher, which may result from the uptake of organonitrates or nitration in cloud water. Compounds in CDR had more carbon number and higher molecular weight than CF, which is attributed to accretion reactions in cloud water. We identified 39 significantly enriched compounds in CDR compared with CF, which could be potentially used as aqSOA tracers formed via cloud processing. This study also reveals rapid changes in aqSOA composition, which highlight the necessity for high time resolution measurements to capture the processing of aqSOA in clouds. Overall, this study provides clear information on processing of aqSOA in clouds and highlights the importance of accretion reactions, which have implications on the composition and physicochemical properties of SOA."

After correcting for drift and checking the sensor performance, we found that local factors like traffic, public events and vegetation affect CO2 levels. Even though the sensors have higher uncertainties than other sensors, the lower cost allows for a denser network with detailed insights into CO2 levels across the city, helping cities track emissions and support climate action plans. 
 As part of the ICOS Cities project, a network of low-cost NDIR (non-dispersive infrared) CO2 sensors was set up across the city of Zurich (Switzerland), known as ZiCOS-L. The network consists of 56 sites with paired low-cost sensors spread out over the urban area of Zurich. This publication focuses on the period from August 2022 to July 2024. The sensors require in-field training for model calibration before deployment and further post-processing steps to account for drift and outliers. After data processing, the hourly mean root mean squared error (RMSE) was 13.6 ± 1.4 ppm and the mean bias 0.75 ± 1.67 ppm when validated against parallel reference measurements from the mid-cost sensor network ZiCOS-M. CO2 concentrations were highly variable with site means in Zurich ranging from 438 to 465 ppm. These differences can largely be explained by the nearby surroundings, with vegetation, traffic density and human activity being dominant factors while altitude and distance from the city centre had a minor effect. Vegetation (mainly grassland) amplified the morning concentration in summer by up to 20 ppm due to ecosystem respiration, while heavy traffic increased the morning rush hour concentration by 15 ppm. Human activity was shown to locally enhance CO2 concentrations during two public events. Despite its lower measurement accuracy, the ZiCOS-L network enables the study of concentration dynamics at a spatial and temporal scale that could only be achieved at much higher cost  with mid-cost or high-precision instrumentation. The observations generated by ZiCOS-L will be further used in ICOS Cities activities to validate CO2 emission inventories with inversion modelling systems."

This method can detect many gases, including volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxide released by plants and human activities. We tested it in two locations and found it agreed well with standard instruments, while offering improved performance. Our results show this approach can provide broad and sensitive monitoring of air quality and chemical processes in the atmosphere. 
 We evaluate the capability of chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) using benzene cations as reagent ions (benzene CIMS) for detecting atmospheric trace gases. We characterize the ionization pathways and product ion distributions for 27 analytes spanning diverse chemical classes. To interpret the complex ion chemistry involving two reagent ions (C6H6+ and (C6H6)2+) and multiple ionization pathways (charge transfer, proton transfer, adduct formation, and hydride abstraction), we introduce a thermodynamics-based framework that classifies analytes into three categories based on their ionization energy (IE), relative to those of benzene monomer (9.24 eV) and dimer (8.69 eV). Each class exhibits distinct ionization mechanisms and product ions. Analytes with IE smaller than 8.69 eV (low IE) undergo charge transfer with both reagent ions; analytes with IE between 8.69 and 9.24 eV (mid IE) undergo charge transfer with C6H6+ and potential adduct formation with (C6H6)2+; analytes with IE larger than 9.24 eV (high IE) could undergo adduct formation, proton transfer, or hydride abstraction. Analytes within each class also show similar sensitivity, enabling sensitivity estimation for compounds lacking calibration standards. In addition to volatile organic compounds (VOCs), benzene CIMS detects nitric oxide (NO) with a detection limit of 5 pptv for 1 min integration time, exceeding the performance of most commercial NOx analyzers. Field deployments in Chicago and St. Louis demonstrate good agreement with reference NO measurements. Isoprene measurements show good agreement with a co-located gas chromatography–photoionization detector (GC-PID) in St. Louis, but exhibit substantial positive bias in Chicago, likely due to interferences from anthropogenic VOCs in the polluted urban environment. These results highlight the potential of benzene CIMS for concurrent measurements of NO, VOCs, and their oxidation products using a single instrument, while also underscoring challenges in complex atmospheric conditions."

The validation results confirm that the average accuracy of the SWOT internal wave dataset is 91.21 %.

 This manuscript presents a comprehensive and evolving novel in situ dataset of water levels and wave parameters collected from March 2023 onward in the St. Lawrence Estuary and Saguenay Fjord (Quebec, Canada), supporting validation activities for the Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite mission. The dataset integrates water level measurements from 18 barometrically-compensated pressure transducers and, where possible, corrected for water density using collocated salinity and temperature data, supplemented with 13 GNSS-Interferometric Reflectometry (GNSS-IR) sensors. All water level data are referenced to a common vertical datum via real-time kinematic (RTK) GNSS corrections. Three directional wave buoys provided supplementary observations of surface wave conditions, including bulk parameters and directional spectra. Quality-controlled and rigorous processing protocols were implemented across all sensor types, with particular attention to referencing accuracy and correction for environmental influences. The observational network has the densest spatial coverage of water level and wave measurements ever achieved in this region, offering unprecedented opportunities for validation of SWOT’s nadir and wide-swath altimetry products, as well as for hydrodynamic model calibration and spatio-temporal studies of tidal and wave processes in complex estuarine environments.

 Southeast Asia (SEA) contributes substantially to tropical agriculture, but remains underserved by high-precision cropland data due to persistent cloud cover, fragmented farming, prevalent shifting cultivation, and complex phenology. Here, we developed a 10-m annual cropland dataset for SEA (SEA_Cropland10) covering 2019–2024 using a random forest model on Google Earth Engine. The model integrated 88,088 Sentinel-1 SAR scenes, 599,255 Sentinel-2 optical images, and Google AlphaEarth embeddings, and was trained using 37,192 visually interpreted samples. An independent accuracy assessment was performed using 1,200 samples stratified by land-cover change trajectories to validate both temporal dynamics and spatial extent. SEA_Cropland10 achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.67 % (±1.47 %) for cropland dynamics, with annual static accuracies consistently exceeding 92.42 % (±1.50 %). The incorporation of AlphaEarth embeddings proved critical, improving model performance by 5.81 %. Compared to existing global products (e.g., GLAD, WorldCereal), SEA_Cropland10 improved OA by 14.56 %–19.97 % and substantially enhanced the detection of sloping cropland (>5°) in mountainous regions of SEA, increasing producer’s accuracy in global baselines from below 29.7 %–32.9 % to 89.0 %–99.1 %. Consequently, we identified three- to fourfold more sloping cropland area than GLAD and WorldCereal reported.

By developing a novel algorithm that harmonizes disparate observation schedules into a single temporal definition, we unlock a substantially larger fraction of the world's sub-daily reports. GLBD-FED offers a new ""global thermometer"" for the sectors that demand consistent, quality-controlled daily temperature information. 
 Large amounts of sub-daily temperature data are shared globally through the Global Telecommunication System (GTS) in near-real time and through international data exchanges. However, converting these data into a global daily temperature dataset with a uniform definition – especially for daily maximum (Tmax) and minimum (Tmin) temperatures – has proven challenging due to the independent observation schedules across the world. To address this issue, we developed a new method that decomposes sub-daily Tmax and Tmin records from the Integrated Surface Database (ISD) into finer intervals, subsequently reaggregating them into daily Tmax and Tmin based on prospective dateline. This new method increased the global daily Tmax and Tmin counts by 64 % and 45 %, respectively, compared to the original method, which relied on either two consecutive Tmax/Tmin records over 12 hours or a single Tmax/Tmin record over 24 hours. The Global Land Base Dataset-First Estimate Daily Data (GLBD-FED) was established for the period from 1981 to 2024, following corrections for misrecorded Tmax and Tmin and quality control. GLBD-FED includes daily maximum (Tmax), average (Tave), and minimum temperature (Tmin) from approximately 17,000 global sites, with daily data amounts reaching about 10,000 entries per day in the current decade. When compared to the Global Summary of the Day (GSOD) dataset, GLBD-FED exhibits more temperate performance over the last 40 years, showing a slightly lower daily Tmax (around -0.3 °C) and a higher daily Tmin (around +0.3 °C), with a nearly identical daily Tave (approximately +0.1 °C). GLBD-FED identifies records that could or almost could represent the highest or lowest temperature in the 24-hour period as daily Tmax or Tmin, while GSOD selects the highest or lowest records within the 24 hours. This variance in definitions, combined with different preferences for meteorological and airport report sources, contributes to these observed biases."

The intricate composition of VOCs, especially the presence of H2O, frequently undermines the catalysts in the treatment systems. In this study, we have explored metastable catalysts that are regulated by different facets, which can activate H2O into active oxygen species required for the reaction. Surprisingly, the sample with the {101} facet exposed demonstrates superior performance compared to the sample with the high-energy {001} facet with H2O. In fact, the metastable structures constructed from diverse atomic arrangements are the key to breaking through this conventional understanding. Although the emergence of 18OCO18 indicates that all samples can achieve the H2O process, the Pt/TiO2-MS {101} sample, with its longer M–O bonds and more Pt–Ometa–Ti, exhibits lower H2O dissociation energy and stronger lattice oxygen mobility.

Nevertheless, the source apportionment of deposited Pb within glacierized regions of the Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP)─where glacier shrinkage is most severe across the entire TP─remain poorly quantified. To address this gap, this study integrates newly obtained Pb isotopic data from cryoconite samples with published data sets to elucidate the spatial distribution of Pb isotopic compositions and quantitatively reveal the origins of anthropogenic Pb deposited in the extensively SETP glaciers. The results show that Pb isotopic ratios range from 1.166 to 1.204 for 206Pb/207Pb and from 2.446 to 2.525 for 208Pb/207Pb, with large variability. Moreover, distinct spatial heterogeneity in the isotopic compositions is observed, with a decreasing trend along the longitudinal gradient. Source apportionment demonstrate that Indian coal combustion represents the primary source of Pb in SETP glaciers, accounting for 75.5%, with the strongest influence occurring at glaciers situated at valleys. At the plateau scale, Pb derived from Indian coal combustion exerts the greatest impact on this region, with its contribution decreasing from 75.5% to 21.3% along the south-north transect."

Despite their bioaccumulative potential, their occurrence and possible biological impacts on marine megafauna remain understudied. We investigated LCM occurrence in Indo-Pacific humpback dolphins (Sousa chinensis) and finless porpoises (Neophocaena phocaenoides) collected from the South China Sea (2007–2021) and assessed their toxicity through in vitro assays using established dolphin cell lines. By employing robust source-tracing methodologies, we provide the first evidence that LCMs from household electronics and coastal e-waste accumulate in cetacean tissues, including blubber, muscle, and, critically, brain tissues, demonstrating blood–brain barrier penetration, a previously undocumented phenomenon of LCMs in mammalian wildlife. The temporal trend of LCM burden in porpoise blubber is correlated with shifts in global liquid crystal display production. Transcriptomic profiling revealed LCM-induced DNA damage, cell cycle arrest, and impaired cell division in cetacean cells. These findings suggest that LCMs may pose potential risks to the nervous system and other organs of marine mammals, warranting further investigation into their toxicological effects and possible implications for human health. By bridging critical gaps among everyday electronics, LCM contamination, and marine conservation, this study highlights the need for urgent regulatory actions and improved e-waste governance to mitigate ecological and public health risks."

The Fenton process was identified in this study to enable Fe loading onto MPs in real textile wastewater, which may influence the geochemical cycling of arsenic (As) when entering the environment. Our results show that Fenton treatment can load Fe species onto various MPs with Fe content of 3318.8–4290.9 μg/g. The surface Fe species, primarily existing as amorphous Fe(OH)3 and FeOOH, are embedded within the surface layer of ∼8 μm and exhibit high stability. The MP-Fe composites exhibited strong adsorption affinity for both As(III) and As(V), with saturated adsorption capacities of 557.2–631.8 μg/g and 304.7–572.8 μg/g, respectively, representing 5.3–26.5-fold enhancement compared to pristine MPs. Synchrotron radiation-based X-ray fluorescence (SRXRF) revealed spatial consistency between Fe and As on the MP-Fe surface (R2 = 0.4938–0.8152), confirming that Fe species are critical for As adsorption. For As(III), the adsorption process is accompanied by oxidation, with the oxidation ratio reaching up to 84.1%.

Thermodenuder–Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (TD-AMS) thermograms revealed higher volatility for CH and CHO fragments (T50 ∼ 390–395 K) and greater thermal stability for nitrogen-containing CHON ions (T50 ∼ 410–415 K). Volatility basis set (VBS) distributions showed that CHON species dominated the composition of 1-day aged SOA (INDOH1) but were largely depleted in 5-day aged SOA (INDOH5), indicating extensive oxidative aging associated with ring-opening reactions and the loss of nitrogen-containing functional groups, as reflected in the degradation of aromatic species (AImod > 0.67) and reduced π-conjugation. Additionally, INDOH1 exhibited stronger light absorption than INDOH5, demonstrating significant photobleaching. The evaporation due to heating affected the complex refractive index (RI); the imaginary part (k) increased from 0.014 to 0.09 in INDOH1, while it remained below 0.06 in INDOH5. The absorption enhancement with heating is attributed to the preferential evaporation of weakly absorbing, nonaromatic compounds, enriching the particle phase in thermally stable, π-conjugated CHON species. These results establish a direct link between the volatility, chemical evolution, and optical properties of indole SOA."

Due in part to the experimental challenge of in situ characterization, these physicochemical properties remain incompletely understood. Here, an aerosol fluorescent labeling methodology in conjunction with a fluorescence aerosol flow tube (F-AFT) was used for direct, in situ physicochemical characterization of α-pinene and toluene SOA. The wavelength of maximum emission λmax of the fluorescent probe Prodan was shown to depend on the hygroscopicity, degree of oxidation, and relative humidity (RH)-dependent phase transitions of the SOA. At varying RH, λmax was linearly correlated with % water content with an R2 value of 0.95. For fixed RH and varying SOA oxidation degree, λmax was linearly correlated with the oxygen-to-carbon ratio (O:C) with an R2 value of 0.95. Finally, the λmax values measured from mixed organic/inorganic particles indicated that ammonium sulfate seeded toluene SOA exhibited liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) at 80% RH and below while remaining homogeneous at 90% RH. Overall, this study demonstrates the power and versatility of this approach for direct, online analysis of a range of physicochemical properties in SOA."

However, the environmental relevance of additional FTEO homologues and analogues remains rarely investigated. Through a combination of suspect screening and homologue-based nontargeted analysis, we identified a total of 60 FTEO homologues and 30 perfluoroalkyl ether ethoxylate (PFAEE) homologues in commercial antifog products. They included homologue groups of 4:2 FTEOs (n = 16), 6:2 FTEOs (n = 17), 8:2 FTEOs (n = 12), 10:2 FTEOs (n = 8), 12:2 FTEOs (n = 7), perfluorobutyl ether ethoxylates (n = 15), and perfluorohexyl ether ethoxylates (n = 15). Among them, 4:2 FTEOs, 6:2 FTEOs, and perfluorobutyl ether ethoxylates were also frequently detected in house dust (n = 120) collected from South China, with semiquantified concentrations measured to be 30.4, 36.0, and 55.3 ng/g. Among each homologue group, the composition profiles of individual homologues with different numbers of repeated ethoxy units resembled between antifog products and house dust. A toxicological priority index (ToxPi) approach revealed the highest risk of 6:2 FTEOs among all of the identified FTEOs and PFAEEs, although the risks from other groups should not be overlooked. Collectively, our work reveals the complexity of diverse FTEO homologues and reports the presence of PFAEEs for the first time in indoor environments, raising the need for further investigating their sources, environmental distribution, and potential human exposure."

Here, we combined a field survey of 43 paired soil-cast samples across three agricultural land-use scenarios with complementary laboratory soil column experiments to elucidate earthworm-driven MP dynamics. The field survey revealed ubiquitous in situ MP occurrence and upward fluxes from bulk soils to casts, with transport efficiency modulated by soil clay and organic carbon contents. Laboratory simulations using epigeic and anecic species validated that different ecotypes actively ingest MPs from source soils and deposit them in surface casts. Crucially, both field and laboratory data demonstrated a significant reduction in particle size in casts compared to soil (6.48% and 19.8%, respectively), supporting the potential earthworm effects on MP mechanical attrition. Polymer compositions in casts mirrored those in soils, exhibiting a nonselective and passive ingestion pathway. Beyond physical transport, the formation of field biogenic polymer aggregates facilitated chemical aging of MPs, as evidenced by elevated oxidation indices. This process was likely accelerated by the enrichment of plastic-degrading microbial taxa (e.g., Flavobacterium) within casts, which exhibited up to a 35.6-fold increase in relative abundance. Collectively, these findings highlight the dual role of soil-engineering invertebrates in driving the vertical redistribution and physicochemical degradation of MPs in agricultural systems."

These changes are mainly driven by human‐caused increases in atmospheric levels of CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ and other well‐mixed greenhouse gases. Key features of this fingerprint are warming of the troposphere, the lowest layer of the atmosphere, and cooling of the stratosphere, the layer above the troposphere. Cooling in the lower stratosphere (from roughly 15–20 km above Earth's surface) also arises from human‐caused depletion of stratospheric ozone. While lower stratospheric cooling diminished in the 21st century, largely due to the emerging “healing” of stratospheric ozone levels after the Montreal Protocol, strong cooling of the mid‐ to upper stratosphere continued unabated. Satellite observations of this distinctive fingerprint are in accord with current state‐of‐the‐art climate model estimates of human‐caused temperature changes. The claim to the contrary made in the recent US Department of Energy review of climate science is factually incorrect."

The diurnal pulse (DP), a daily‐scale expansion of TC upper‐level cold clouds, effectively captures the spatiotemporal evolution of TC convection and is tightly linked to TC intensity changes, particularly rapid intensification (RI). By incorporating the DP as a temporal evolution signal, AI models achieved significantly improved prediction skill for TC intensification rates and RI probabilities, outperforming those using only conventional instantaneous convective indicators. Permutation tests further confirm that the DP predictors contribute more pronouncedly to forecast skill than instantaneous convective proxies. These findings highlight the untapped potential of incorporating physics‐informed, continuous temporal evolution variables into AI models to improve TC intensity forecasting, especially for challenging RI events."

Prairie and humid forest regions exhibit comparatively muted change. Attribution analysis shows that atmospheric dryness is the dominant control, while antecedent temperature, precipitation, and soil moisture indirectly shape wildfire risk through vegetation and fuel continuity at different lag times.

We examine two reanalyses to assess the extent to which column‐integrated radiative cooling balances convective heating (“bulk RCE”) in the tropics and at higher latitudes. Our analysis shows that bulk RCE is a reasonable approximation of the tropics over ocean, but not land. Surprisingly, bulk RCE is often a reasonable approximation in mid‐latitudes, especially over land. These findings are explained by a simple argument. Over land, the ground heat flux is small, and bulk RCE arises when the top‐of‐atmosphere net radiative flux is small, which occurs in mid‐latitudes. Over ocean, the same mechanism applies but the ocean heat flux can be substantial and causes deviations relative to land. We conclude that bulk RCE is a surprisingly useful approximation of mid‐latitude land climate, which permits the development of simple theory for land climate, more broadly."

We apply metrics capturing average irradiance, persistence, and spatial synchrony of cloudy conditions. Southern Australia experiences persistent low irradiance events in the winter but show limited seasonality in cloud cover.

Meanwhile, rapid Arctic Sea ice loss due to Arctic amplification has emerged as a crucial driver of extreme weather and climate events. However, its specific contribution to Eurasian synchronous heatwaves remains poorly understood. Using climate networks, atmospheric dynamic diagnostics, and numerical experiments, we revealed an interdecadal increase in the interannual relationship between Barents Sea ice and Europe‐East Asian synchronous heatwaves after 2000. During 2000–2022, the persistent sea ice loss in the northern Barents Sea from late spring to summer, combined with strong land‐atmosphere feedback over northwestern Europe, triggers and sustains a northwestern European anticyclone. This anticyclone disturbance, positioned north of the Eurasian subtropical jet, excites a northwest‐southeastward propagating Rossby wave train in summer. Thus, another anticyclone is induced in the north of Tibetan Plateau. Together, these two anticyclones provide favorable atmospheric conditions for the occurrence of Europe‐East Asian synchronous heatwaves. During 1979–1999, however, sea ice anomalies were primarily confined to the southern Barents Sea. The associated feedback processes and atmospheric circulation anomalies are too weak to excite and sustain a northwestern European anticyclone, thereby limiting the occurrence of such synchronous heatwaves in summer. These findings highlight the growing influence of Arctic Sea ice loss on midlatitude summer extremes and offer new insights into the mechanisms behind Europe‐East Asian synchronous heatwaves in a warming climate."

This precipitation event is directly driven by a tropospheric cyclone and a downstream anticyclone, which jointly transport warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico into the eastern U.S. Through a series of WRF experiments, we indicate that a nudged run (NOBS), in which the stratospheric circulation is nudged toward the observed evolution represented by the ERA5 reanalysis data set, successfully captures the evolution of the tropospheric cyclone and anticyclone, whereas a parallel run (NCLM) nudged toward the ERA5 winter climatology fails to capture them. The NOBS run accurately simulates the sub‐vortex over North America, which facilitates the southward invasion of cold air. Moreover, in the NOBS experiment, the well‐captured stratospheric sub‐vortex enhances downward coupling through the phase‐locking mechanism, directly promoting the development of the tropospheric cyclone and indirectly influencing the downstream anticyclone. Our results indicate that the stratospheric anomalies contribute to approximately 37% of the total precipitation during the event. This finding underscores the importance of the sub‐vortex's geometry in the lowermost stratosphere for driving this precipitation event and highlights the need to focus on polar vortex geometry to fully understand regional stratosphere‐troposphere coupling."

We simulate flooding from over 2,800 synthetic TCs impacting five HUC6 watersheds in eastern North and South Carolina under historical and future (SSP5‐8.5) conditions using climatologically consistent data derived from physics‐based numerical models. Projected future TCs in our data set exhibit slower translation speeds and produce higher rainfall rates, driving substantial increases in flood extent and depth despite a slight decrease in average wind speeds and storm surge. The 1% annual flood hazard grows by 36%, with the contribution of compound flooding nearly doubling from 12% to 25%. When sea level rise is included, coastal and compound flooding expand further inland and upriver. Importantly, we show that inundation is underestimated when runoff and coastal flood hazards are modeled in isolation. Additionally, we find that the joint‐probability of the peak or average boundary conditions for a storm does not equal the probability of the overland flood extent at the HUC6 scale.

 Electrolyte solvents for electrochemical devices have been dominated by oxygen (O)-based and nitrogen (N)-based ligands over the past decades1–5, for which the dipole–ion (Li+, Na+ and so on) interaction usually lays the foundations of ion dissociation and transport but frustrates the charge transfer process at the electrolyte–electrode interface6–9. Here, by synthesizing alkanes with monofluorinated structures, we show that fluorine (F)-based ligands with designed steric hindrance and Lewis basicity enable salt dissolution of more than 2 mol l−1. Among them, 1,3-difluoro-propane (DFP)-based Li-ion electrolyte is endowed with all merits for energy-dense and low-temperature batteries, including low viscosity (0.95 cp), high oxidation stability (>4.9 V) and ionic conductivity of 0.29 mS cm−1 at −70 °C. By incorporating F atoms in the first solvation shell, the weak F–Li+ coordination facilitates the Li plating/stripping process with Coulombic efficiency (CE) up to 99.7% and exchange current density one magnitude larger than O–Li+ coordination at −50 °C. The electrolytes further enable the operation of lithium-metal pouch cells under an electrolyte amount of less than 0.5 g Ah−1, achieving energy densities greater than 700 Wh kg−1 at room temperature and about 400 Wh kg−1 at −50 °C. The hydrofluorocarbon (HFC) electrolytes in this work provide a feasible approach to building electrochemical systems beyond traditional coordination chemistry.

 The sensitivity of non-local optical measurements at low light intensities, such as those involved in long-baseline telescope arrays1,2, is limited by fundamental quantum noise and photon losses3. Distributed quantum entanglement has been proposed as a route towards overcoming these limitations and accessing new regimes of non-local optical sensing4–6. Here we demonstrate the use of entangled quantum memories in a quantum network of silicon–vacancy centres in diamond nanocavities7–9 to experimentally perform such non-local phase measurements. Specifically, we combine the generation of event-ready remote quantum entanglement, photon mode erasure that hides the ‘which-path’ information of temporally and spatially separated incoming optical modes and non-local, non-destructive photon heralding enabled by remote entanglement to perform a proof-of-concept entanglement-assisted differential phase measurement of weak incident light between two spatially separate stations. Demonstrating successful operation of the remote phase sensing protocol with a fibre link baseline up to 1.55 km, our results provide an opportunity for a new class of quantum-enhanced optical imaging methods with potential applications ranging from long-baseline interferometry and astronomy to microscopy10,11.

 The history of the lunar magnetic field is a longstanding controversy. Many palaeomagnetic studies provide evidence for either a persistent, weak magnetic field or the lack of an intrinsic magnetic field between 1.020 and 3.580 billion years ago. However, for the period between 3.580 and 3.854 billion years ago, palaeomagnetic studies have recovered strong intrinsic fields (>40 µT) distributed among weak or null intensity measurements. Crustal magnetic anomalies from this period have also been interpreted as evidence for the presence of both strong and weak magnetic fields. Here we explore potential links between published palaeointensity, rock magnetic and geochemical data for lunar basalts. We find there is a statistically significant relationship only between recovered palaeointensity and the titanium content of lunar basalts. By modelling the heat flux across the core–mantle boundary, we suggest that there is a causal link between lunar dynamo generation and the eruption of high-titanium basalts. Such a link may result from the intermittent melting of ilmenite-bearing cumulates at the core–mantle boundary. The coincidence of these rare events probably reflects sampling bias near high-titanium basaltic terranes.

 The Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO) is the dominant mode of tropical stratospheric variability that modulates global circulation and climate. Although a long-term weakening of QBO amplitude has been observed under global warming, the relative roles of different tropical oceans remain unclear. We perform sensitivity experiments forced by sea surface temperature perturbations over the tropical Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian Oceans, as well as their combined warming, to separate individual and joint effects. Pacific warming produces the strongest weakening and slowest descent of the QBO, whereas Atlantic warming slightly strengthens the amplitude and extends the vertical structure. Indian Ocean warming slightly weakens the amplitude and accelerates the descent. When all three oceans warm simultaneously, the QBO exhibits a weaker amplitude and faster descent, consistent in sign with the combined single-basin responses but with a reduced magnitude owing to diminished zonal and inter-basin SST gradients. Momentum budget analyses further show that basin-dependent competition between equatorial wave forcing and tropical upwelling underlies these contrasting responses."

 Radiative effects of aerosol-cloud interactions constitute the most uncertain climate forcing of the Earth system. To understand how these interactions may change with climate, we conduct 3-day-long large-eddy simulations of a stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition along an airmass-following trajectory over the Northeast Pacific Ocean. By perturbing boundary-layer aerosol concentrations, aerosol-cloud interactions are simulated in present-day and warmed climate with increased CO2. Aerosol-induced cloud changes, including the Twomey effect and adjustments of cloud fraction and liquid water path, are inhibited in a doubled-CO2 climate. Decomposing the aerosol-induced cloud radiative effect change (ΔCRE) reveals that aerosol-induced cloud fraction changes dominate ΔCRE. Doubling CO2 attenuates the aerosol-induced ΔCRE (i.e., cooling) by >30% in our simulations. Our results also show that low cloud feedbacks are sensitive to the background aerosol concentration, highlighting the interplay between climate forcings and feedbacks. These results may aid in predicting the cooling potential of marine cloud brightening in a changing climate."

 This study examines how different global warming levels associated with near-future carbon neutrality timings influence future tropical cyclone activity over the western North Pacific, using a pseudo-global warming framework. Convection-permitting simulations of multiple landfalling tropical cyclones were performed with the Weather Research and Forecasting model under two Shared Socioeconomic Pathways: SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, corresponding to net-zero emissions in the 2050 s and 2070 s, respectively. Delayed attainment of net-zero emissions leads to more substantial intensification, with the area affected by strong winds expanding by 7% and 9%, and regions of heavy precipitation by 15% and 22%, under SSP1-1.9 and SSP1-2.6, respectively. These differential responses are driven primarily by thermodynamic changes (atmospheric moisture increase) and also contributed by dynamic changes (enhanced vertical motion). The results underscore that the timing of carbon neutrality is a critical determinant of the severity of landfalling tropical cyclone impacts.

 Reforestation is considered an important nature-based climate solution to help achieve net-zero CO2 emissions. However, strategies using reforestation-based CO2 removal to offset fossil fuel emissions may not lead to the same climate outcome as avoiding the fossil fuel emissions. Here, we use an Earth System model of intermediate complexity to compare the climate outcome of different pathways: a reference pathway, and net-zero pathways where additional fossil fuel CO2 emissions relative to the reference pathway are balanced by reforestation-based CO2 removals (“Reforestation Net-zero pathways”). Results show that model simulations of Reforestation Net-zero pathways yield a higher atmospheric CO2 and warmer climate outcome than the reference simulation. The higher atmospheric CO2 results from carbon cycle feedbacks. The additional global warming from higher atmospheric CO2 is further amplified by biogeophysical effects of reforestation. These findings highlight the need for improved methods to account for the carbon cycle and climate effects of reforestation.

 Moult is a critical period in the life cycle of emperor penguin. Like other stages of their life history they depend upon Antarctic sea-ice as a platform to moult. Our knowledge of where the birds moult is limited to a small number of tracking studies and incidental observations, showing most adult emperor penguins moult in small groups on sea ice between January and March. Sea ice extent and duration has reduced dramatically over the last decade, and understanding how these declining ice conditions are impacting emperor penguins is crucial to model future population trajectories. We show that groups of moulting emperor penguins can be seen in medium and very-high-resolution satellite imagery. The study concentrates on a specific the area of West Antarctica, identifying the distribution and number of moulting groups over a seven-year period (2019-2025). Between 2022 to 2024, reduced fast ice extent resulted in a concentrated distribution of moulting groups and early break-up of the moulting platform before the end of the season.

 Arctic sea ice is fundamental to the global climate engine, modulating heat exchange between the ocean and the atmosphere and impacting large-scale oceanic and atmospheric movements. While the monitoring of sea ice concentration (SIC) from satellites has long depended on coarse-resolution passive microwave (PMW) sensors, Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) missions, such as Copernicus’s Sentinel-1, have emerged as complementary and fine-resolution sources of sea ice information.This study introduces the DMI-ASIP (Danish Meteorological Institute - Automated Sea Ice Products) data record; the first decade-long (2014–2024) and pan-Arctic SIC record derived from Sentinel-1 SAR imagery and provided at a high spatial resolution of 0.5 km. Compared to two well-established PMW-based SIC data records, DMI-ASIP consistently shows higher SIC and sea ice area, particularly in the marginal ice zone and during the melt season. Evaluation against an independent 2020–2022 SIC reference data record derived from optical Landsat-8 imagery indicates strong overall performance for DMI-ASIP, achieving a lower RMSE (8.7%) compared to the two PMW-based records (12.1% and 13.6%). Furthermore, DMI-ASIP exhibits less seasonal variability in its performance than the PMW-based records. While DMI-ASIP is quantitatively closer to the reference data record, the evaluation revealed a consistent tendency for DMI-ASIP to overestimate sea ice concentrations (+2.5% mean bias across the 2020–2022 evaluation period).

 Changes in the spectral reflectance of drying soil are slow and rather subtle for much of the drying time, becoming more rapid and dramatic only when readily available pore water has been depleted. Tracking changes in reflectance at frequent intervals as soil dries, and considering the observations as a time series, can provide insight into the relationship between spectral changes and the underlying soil moisture status. This paper describes time series of laboratory measurements of the spectral reflectance of four distinct soils collected at 15-min intervals as the soils progress from oversaturated to air-dry. Continuous changes in reflectance as water evaporates over time are described, and a spectral Fresnel component to the reflectance of oversaturated soil is documented. A rationale for a metric to detect the end of constant evaporation is presented, along with an approach for identifying and distinguishing among bare soils in satellite or aircraft imagery. The observations also provide insight into the challenges of designing spectral metrics intended to gather useful information regarding moisture content and soil characterization."

 Retrieving high-resolution soil moisture (SM) using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is often difficult due to noise caused by surface heterogeneities. Threshold-based masking techniques such as dynamic masking (DM) are commonly applied to mitigate these effects, but they can inadvertently remove valid SM signals or retain pixels that contribute to noise. This study introduces a novel masking approach based on temporal stability analysis (TSA) that identifies and retains pixels that reliably capture SM dynamics. TSA is performed between 10 m-scale SAR backscatter and 1 km synthetic backscatter from the Water Cloud Model (WCM) using Land Surface Model (LSM)-simulated SM and vegetation descriptors as input. The method is evaluated using both in situ observations and LSM simulations across three distinct SM monitoring networks—SMC (South Korea), TxSON (United States), and REMEDHUS (Spain)—and compared with DM. Across all sites, TSA-based masking improved correlations (by up to 0.15) and reduced ubRMSE (by up to 0.014 m3/m3) against both LSM-derived SM and in situ SM, relative to no masking and DM. It also more effectively excluded urban and water pixels while retaining those where backscatter signals are influenced by vegetation but properly compensated through the WCM. In further evaluations with cosmic-ray neutron probe observations, TSA improved the correlation to 0.61 at 480 m resolution. These findings highlight the effectiveness of TSA in refining pixel selection and improving SM retrieval across diverse landscapes and spatial scales."

 The Meteosat Third Generation Lightning Imager (MTG-LI), launched aboard the MTG-Imager-1 satellite, is the first geostationary optical lightning sensor to cover Europe and Africa while also covering parts of South America. It enables continuous monitoring of total lightning (both intra-cloud (IC) and cloud-to-ground (CG)) with high temporal and spatial resolution. This study presents the first validation of LI observations over South America and adjacent regions during October 2024, using data from the ground-based Earth Networks Total Lightning Network (ENTLN). Three objectives are addressed: (i) evaluation of LI’s detection capabilities across varying spatiotemporal thresholds; (ii) assessment of the temporal accuracy of LI; and (iii) investigation of the empirical relationship between ENTLN peak current (A) and LI optical radiance (R). Our results show that in areas with dense ground network coverage, detection efficiency exceeds 0.8 and FAR is below 0.3 using moderate thresholds (±2 s, 1° x 1°). Relatively high FAR values, particularly at night, are in-part due to LI detecting lightning that ENTLN misses in areas where its performance is reduced. In addition, a regression model of the A–R relationship is proposed enabling the peak current to be estimated based solely on satellite data, which is advantageous in areas with insufficient ground-based observations. The results show that this relationship is more suitable in logarithmic transformation, with positive discharges exhibiting twice the regression slope than negative discharges."

 Vehicle counting and localization using high-resolution satellite imagery have recently demonstrated substantial value in urban management and public services. However, satellite images routinely suffer from degradation issues, including blurring, insufficient resolution, noise, uneven illumination, and occlusion, due to sensor limitations, weather conditions, compression artifacts, and other environmental factors. These quality issues severely degrade the stability and accuracy of traditional vehicle counting and localization methods. To address this challenge, we propose Degradation-aware Vehicle Counting and Localization (DeVCL), a novel end-to-end point regression framework explicitly designed for degraded satellite imagery, which adaptively recognizes image degradation conditions and directly predicts vehicle positions. Specifically, DeVCL uses a self-supervised degradation representation jointly with image quality assessment to guide a degradation-aware feature modulation module, enhancing feature representations for low-quality inputs. We also introduce a feature-level adversarial mechanism without paired supervision to strengthen feature robustness. In addition, a density-sensitive feature refinement module is proposed to address matching ambiguities caused by densely packed and arranged vehicles, thus improving localization performance. We evaluated DeVCL using two synthetic degraded datasets built on FAIR1M_V and ITCVD, along with a newly collected dataset named SatPark that features high vehicle density and includes multiple naturally occurring degradations. Experimental results indicate that DeVCL consistently outperforms existing methods, particularly in SatPark, demonstrating strong generalization and practical adaptability."

 Accurate estimation of chlorophyll content helps understand the physiological health of saplings. Traditional field measurement methods limit large-scale applications, while remote sensing monitoring methods, though improving efficiency, still face challenges in data analysis and processing. A key challenge is extracting the canopy of individual trees and estimating chlorophyll content amid interference from weed vegetation. To overcome this challenge, this study develops a novel coupled deep learning approach. First, an Attention and Pyramid U-Net (APUNet) was proposed to improve the segmentation accuracy of Ginkgo seedlings crown boundaries in multispectral drone images. Second, the hyper-parameter combination of the You Only Look Once (YOLO) model was optimized to improve sapling detection accuracy under complex conditions with high weed coverage. Next, a sliding window method was developed to reduce duplicate detection rates for detecting all saplings in the entire image, and the intersection of APUNet and detection results was used for segmentation of individual saplings. Finally, a PROSAIL-Deep Neural Network (DNN) model for chlorophyll estimation was developed, and the impact of using APUNet YOLO to remove weed pixels on chlorophyll estimation was investigated, along with how over-coverage and under-coverage during the segmentation process affect the accuracy of chlorophyll estimation. The results show that, compared to U-Net, APUNet improved segmentation performance, with the IoU increasing from 0.697 to 0.736. After hyper-parameter optimization through grid search, the YOLOv8l model achieved an mAP50 of 0.968 and when this model was applied to full-image detection using a sliding window approach, its duplicate detection rate (ddr) decreased by 11.2% compared with the general method. In chlorophyll inversion, the chlorophyll estimation accuracy reached its highest after using APUNet-YOLO to reduce the interference from weed pixels, with an R2 of 0.752 and an RMSE of 7.143 μg/cm2. Meanwhile, the sensitivity analysis of the impact of segmentation errors on chlorophyll estimation accuracy shows that, compared to under-coverage segmentation, over-inclusion segmentation leads to a greater decline in chlorophyll estimation accuracy. This novel coupled model can effectively monitor the chlorophyll content of Ginkgo saplings in settings with complex backgrounds, providing a practical possibility for the realization of precision forestry."

 Accurate and efficient object detection in remote sensing imagery is fundamental to applications such as urban monitoring, infrastructure assessment, and disaster management. However, two persistent challenges remain: (1) small objects occupy only a few pixels in ultra-high-resolution images, making them difficult to detect reliably, and (2) the rapid growth of large-scale satellite data demands computationally efficient methods suitable for practical deployment. Existing lightweight convolutional networks provide real-time efficiency but often fail to capture sufficient discriminative information for small targets, while Transformer-based detectors improve representation power at the cost of high computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose MAC-DETR, a CNN-Mambaout-Transformer hybrid detection framework designed for remote sensing imagery. MAC-DETR integrates three complementary modules: (1) Mambaout-RepLK, a Mambaout-style gated convolution block that reduces computational overhead while preserving expressive feature extraction, achieving + 2.5% mAP improvement in fine-grained categories on NWPU VHR-10 while reducing parameters by 23%; (2) CROSS-UP, an adaptive upsampling block that enhances multi-scale fusion and improves the detection of small objects—yielding up to + 2.6% mAP gain on multi-scale categories in NWPU VHR-10—without introducing extra complexity; and (3) ASSAIFI, a sparse attention module that strengthens feature interaction to further refine small-object representations. Experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that MAC-DETR achieves 74.1% mAP on DOTA-v1.5, 95.4% on NWPU VHR-10, 94.4% on HRSC2016, and 95.4% on the infrared SIRSTv2 dataset, consistently outperforming both CNN– and Transformer-based baselines. Ablation studies show that the design reduces parameters by 23% and computation by 10–15%, offering a practical balance between accuracy and efficiency. These results highlight MAC-DETR’s effectiveness for large-scale, multi-modal Earth observation applications. The source code will be available at: https://github.com/Keykeykeykeykeykey/MAC-DETR."

 For tree-level inversion of leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) from UAV imagery, the adjacency scattering effect of individual trees can affect the reflectance of the specific tree crown, thereby increasing the uncertainty and difficulty of LCC inversion. In this study, a novel visual factor (VF) correction framework for such adjacency scattering effect is proposed, which can efficiently quantify the adjacency effects by geometric probabilities instead of computationally intensive 3D radiative transfer modeling (3D-RTM). This framework is realized by extracting the light intersection probability between the target tree crown and the adjacency scenes (Crown, Ground, and Sky) via ray tracing on LiDAR-derived 3D scenes. We constructed a VF-based adjacency effect correction equation to optimize the extracted vegetation indices (VIs) of tree crowns which were utilized for tree-level LCC inversion. The results indicate that most ratio-based vegetation indices that include near-infrared bands, such as NDVI, RVI, MCARI, CIrededge, and GNDVI, increased the accuracy of LCC after calibration (the mean R2 of univariate prediction was improved to 0.46), while DVI and EVI were insensitive to the adjacency effect and TVI showed a decrease in accuracy. Notably, VIs after adjacency effect correction demonstrated a remarkable improvement under the multivariate regression algorithm, with the R2 increasing by 0.4 compared to that before correction, achieving an accuracy of R2 = 0.67. The method overcame the uncertainty of tree-level signals in UAV imagery by eliminating the influence of the adjacency scattering and provided an efficient solution for the accurate inversion of parameters at the individual-tree scale, which is of great application value for the assessment of precise forestry management."

 Nonuniform particle sizes are adopted in the studies on organophosphate esters (OPEs) in urban surface dust, resulting in difficult comparisons in terms of OPE concentration and composition as well as uncertainties of exposure risk of OPEs. In this study, urban surface dust was fractionated into <63, 63–150, 150–250, and 250–1000 μm fractions for the size composition characteristics of urban surface dust, and 13 OPEs in the four fractions and bulk dust samples were analyzed for the size existence features and exposure risk uncertainties of OPEs. The results showed that urban surface dust was composed mainly of <63 μm (50.0%) and 63–150 μm (34.2%) parts. The total concentration of 13 OPEs in the bulk dust ranged from 130 to 5968 ng/g, with a mean of 1378 ± 1427 ng/g. The means of OPEs exhibited decreasing trends or first increasing and then decreasing patterns with the increasing particle size of dust, with the greatest of most OPEs in <63 or 63–150 μm. Although alkyl and chlorinated OPEs were predominant in the four fractions and bulk dust, individual OPEs were dominated by tri(2-chloroisopropyl) phosphate (TCiPP) and tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBOEP) in the four fractions as well as by tris(2-choloroethyl) phosphate, TCiPP, tri(1,3-dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCPP), and TBOEP in the bulk dust. The size fractions of <63 μm (57.5%) and 63–150 μm (34.0%) were the main mass contributor for OPEs in urban surface dust. The health risk of human exposed to most OPEs (e.g., tri-n-butyl phosphate, TBOEP, tri(2-ethylhexyl) phosphate, TCiPP, TDCPP, and tricresyl phosphate) might be underestimated if their concentrations adopt from the bulk dust rather than mainly existing size dust (<150 μm). The current research results suggest that the urban surface dust of <150 μm could be proposed as the uniform size standard in the study on OPEs in urban surface dust."

 Methyl glycolate (MG) is emitted into the atmosphere as a result of its use as an industrial precursor. This study presents the gas-phase reactivity of MG with Cl atoms and HO• radicals for the first time. The rate coefficient for both reactions, kCl = (4.3 ± 0.9) × 10−12 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, and kHO = (4.8 ± 1.4) × 10−13 cm3 molecule−1 s−1, were determined simultaneously by FTIR spectroscopy and/or SPME-GC-FID. Based on these findings, the atmospheric lifetime of MG with HO• radicals was estimated to be 12 days, indicating that its emissions could be transported and have a regional impact. Furthermore, the photooxidation products of MG were identified and quantified by FTIR, both in the presence (CH3OC(O)OONO2, HOC(O)H and CO) and absence of NO2 (CH3OC(O)C(O)H, HOC(O)H, CO2 and CO). Additionally, the formation of HOCH2C(O)OH was identified by GC-FID. Analysis of the sinks of alkoxy radicals formed in the degradation of MG shows significant differences depending on the presence of NOx: in clean atmospheres, these radicals undergo unimolecular decomposition or H abstraction by O2 leading mainly to the formation of CH3OC(O)C(O)H, whereas under polluted conditions their reactions with NO2 become significant, resulting in the formation of CH3OC(O)OONO2 and HC(O)OH. The former can affect health and the biota or be transported to remote locations, where its thermal decomposition can inject CH3OC(O)OO• and NO2• radicals, thereby contributing to the pollution of otherwise pristine environments. On the other hand, HC(O)OH could affect cloud and raindrop acidity, favoring cloud droplet nucleation."

 Lead-210 (210Pb), a decay product of 222Rn in the 238U decay series, is associated with aerosol particles in the atmosphere and is therefore widely used as a tracer of atmospheric processes and aerosol dynamics. This study focused on airborne 210Pb levels to evaluate the radiological influence of nearby uranium processing and waste storage facilities in North Kazakhstan uranium province. Collection of aerosol particles was conducted in Stepnogorsk city during 2020–2022 with the exception of the winter months. Activity of 210Pb and major ion concentrations in seven size-fractionated aerosol particles were determined by high-purity germanium (HPGe) detector and ion chromatography, respectively. The observed 210Pb activity concentrations in aerosol samples varied between 0.46 ± 0.01 mBq/m3 and 2.60 ± 0.03 mBq/m3, with an arithmetic mean of 0.86 mBq/m3. The radiation dosimetry of daily inhalation of 210Pb through exposure to outdoor air was estimated to be from 0.9 to 2.5 μSv/y. Although this level is low compared to global mean exposures, the long term presence of inhaled 210Pb in the body constitutes a persistent radiation risk. The negative correlation (r = −0.60) was observed between total activity and average temperature indicating an increase in concentration with decreasing temperature. The dominant fraction of atmospheric 210Pb predominantly was found in fine aerosol particles smaller than 2.1 μm, and accounted for 95.3 ± 12.0% of the total. The linear correlation of 210Pb with sulfate, nitrate, and chloride suggests that human activities, including coal combustion, are possible contributors to atmospheric 210Pb in this study area. This highlights the importance of considering local anthropogenic emissions when interpreting the atmospheric 210Pb levels."

 The diurnal cycle of precipitation exhibits considerable regional variability and is generally the result of multiple factors including land-sea temperature differences, topographical features, and atmospheric dynamics. However, the characterization of this phenomenon requires high resolution precipitation data often not available in many parts of the world. In this study, we examine diurnal cycles of rainfall over Madagascar using 23 years (2001−2023) of data from Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement Mission (GPM IMERG) Version 07 Final Run (hereafter IMERG), PERSIANN Dynamic Infrared–Rain Rate (PDIR-Now), and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5). Results from harmonic analysis reveal a strong diurnal cycle for precipitation amount and frequency across the entire study area for all seasons derived from the three datasets. The time of maximum for amount and frequency of precipitation are similar across the three datasets, however, ERA5 generally estimates the time of maximum to occur 2–4 h earlier. The diurnal circulation is driven by the persistent easterly winds, e.g. the Southeast Trade Winds. However, the time of maximum rainfall occurs in the early afternoon along the coastlines given sea breeze circulations. The interior of Madagascar reveals an evening maximum while areas off the coast generally have maximum precipitation amount and frequency just after midnight. These patterns are strongest in summer and spring and weakest during the winter season. Our results suggest that high-resolution satellite-derived precipitation data are quite useful for studying precipitation processes in complex terrain where rain gauge data are generally unavailable."

 Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) models have enabled effective simulation of extreme precipitation (EP), yet most models remain black-boxes with unclear contributions from individual meteorological variables. Here, we develop an Explainable Extreme Precipitation Simulation framework (XEP-Sim) to identify and quantify the key drivers of EP in the Asian monsoon region. Six meteorological variables are found to be essential for accurately reproducing EP, with integrated water vapor (IWV) playing a dominant role. EP intensity increases significantly under extreme conditions of these variables, reaching up to 2.8 times higher when all six are extreme compared to none. In addition, interactions between extreme IWV and other variables further amplify EP intensity through dynamic pathways. These findings suggest the dominant role of IWV and its interactions with other key variables, offering physically interpretable insights that can improve EP prediction and inform variable selection in data-driven climate models."

 In addition to near-surface photochemical production, Surface ozone (O3) concentrations are strongly influenced by vertical exchange processes in the troposphere. To quantify these impacts, a transformer-based deep learning model was developed and integrated with an interpretable technique (DeepLIFT). The model was trained using observations and meteorological reanalysis data over the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei (BTH) region between 2019 and 2023. The model demonstrated robust generalization ability and high predictive accuracy (R2 = 0.90). The annual contribution of vertical exchanges in the lower (VEX_L) and upper (VEX_U) troposphere accounts for 14% and 5% of surface O3 concentrations, respectively. Seasonally, VEX_L had the strongest impact in summer, contributing about 18% to the surface O3, while VEX_U showed relatively strong impact in spring and autumn, accounting for 5–7%. Diurnal variation in VEX_L was particularly pronounced in summer, with nightly contributions exceeding daytime values by up to 27.4 μg/m3. High contribution events of VEX_L (>30%) and VEX_U (>15 μg/m3) occurred most frequently in summer, with frequencies 1.5–3 times higher than in other seasons.

 Small island ecosystems are threatened by climate change in several ways. This includes the Galápagos archipelago in the Tropical Eastern Pacific, where limited freshwater makes the islands dependent on atmospheric supply through precipitation. However, precipitation distribution remains highly uncertain due to the lack of operational observation systems, and it is unclear how climate change will affect availability. Given its location, climate impacts are closely tied to changes in El Niño Southern Oscillation extremes during El Niño and La Niña years.Using a new measurement network incorporating a vertical rain radar profiler, we investigated seasonal rainfall changes (hot and cool) by analyzing El Niño/La Niña-like years, serving as surrogate for a locally warmer and locally cooler world. Our analysis demonstrates that in a locally warmer world, precipitation is increasing in both seasons. Rainfall characteristics and satellite-retrievals convective cloud frequency indicate more convective activity, intensifying heavy rainfall, especially during the hot season. In the cool season, drizzle is replaced by light rain throughout the vertical profile.In a locally cooler world, the hot season's typical midday rainfall maximum is replaced by oscillating, short-wavelength patterns and lower totals. Interestingly, the cool season in a La Niña-dominated world exhibits slightly higher rainfall than a neutral year, likely due to better condensation conditions of the advected moist air at lower air temperatures. Overall, results suggest improved total rainfall supply in a locally warmer world, but torrential rain could endanger the islands in the hot season. Furthermore, cool seasons shift from drizzle to light rain, though totals remain low overall."

In this study, we reconstructed centennial-scale variability of the SCSTF (1894–2022) using coral oxygen isotope (δ18O) and satellite observations. Besides prominent interannual and decadal variabilities, there exists a marked long-term decreasing trend at −0.14 ± 0.02 Sv (1 Sv = 106m3s−1) per decade for the total SCSTF volume transport. Consequently, the SCSTF transport decreased by 35 ± 5% over the past 129 years in comparison with the mean value of 5.15 Sv.

Ocean models often neglect the heat exchange needed to melt ice shelves and icebergs. Simulations presented here indicate that this omits the largest ocean heat sink on the Antarctic continental shelf, representing 60% of heat supplied across the shelf break.

ROS events remain a highly challenging hydrometeorological problem in several aspects of land surface model development, pushing the limits of land-atmosphere, snowpack, and runoff modeling. In particular, the representation of turbulent fluxes during these events is critical as energy into the snowpack controls the rate of melt and may impact the magnitude of resulting flooding. In this study, we investigate the representation of these turbulent fluxes in the Weather Research & Forecasting (WRF) model coupled to the Noah-MP land model during a ROS event. For this case study, we use an extreme ROS event which occurred on 12–13 March 2019 across Nebraska, Iowa, and Missouri, resulting in historic flooding and damages. Our WRF simulation of this event was compared with observations from AmeriFlux, snow products, and ERA5 reanalysis fields. While the simulation was able to produce the synoptic dynamics leading up to and during the event, there were notable discrepancies between the observed and modeled turbulent fluxes, suggesting that during ROS events, latent heat flux into the snowpack is underrepresented. Furthermore, analysis of the kilometer-scale WRF simulation run across the CONtiguous United States for 40 years at 4 km resolution (CONUS404) reveals the same underrepresented latent heat fluxes. Simple snowmelt and runoff models, forced with the observed fluxes as well as an experiment with reduced latent heat fluxes, shows that including the latent heat flux melts the snowpack quicker than without it, which has implications for the modeling of flooding in the region."

Using remote sensing data, we present for the first time a comprehensive assessment of vegetation expansion across the ecologically fragile Qinghai–Tibet Plateau. During 2002–2023, vegetation expanded across nearly 1/5 of the barren land, with a change rate (–3.89 to −4.95 × 104 km2/10a) comparable in magnitude to the regional glacier retreat and permafrost thaw. The upper limit shifted upslope (∼35 m), while the lower limit shifted downslope (∼150 m). This bidirectional expansion mode is associated with the alleviation of water limitation at lower elevations (due to wetting) and energy limitation at higher elevations (due to warming). Nevertheless, projections suggest this rapid downslope expansion may decelerate. The identified bidirectional pattern challenges the prevailing assumption of a uniform upslope shift in alpine vegetation under climate change."

Here we use a frequently cited SPAtially Referenced Regression On Watershed attributes (SPARROW) model to systematically assess the influence of climate extreme frequencies, defined by type intensity, duration, seasonality and co-occurrence of precipitation and temperature events, on the delivery of total nitrogen to river channels in the contiguous United States. Through multiple recalibrations of the model, we test the explanatory power of a wide range individual and combined mean and extreme climate predictors of total nitrogen flux at 425 US Geological Survey monitoring sites over a two-decade period. We use the Akaike information criterion for final optimized model selection. We find that hot/dry autumns, wet summers, and cool years enhance delivery, while dry summers and hot/wet autumns reduce delivery of total nitrogen. Using the final recalibrated model with temperature and precipitation inputs from three global circulation models, INM-CM4-8, GFDL-CM4, and CanESM5, under Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 245 and 585, we compare the simulated impacts of changes in mean climate alone with changes in a combination of mean and extreme climate occurrence frequencies on total nitrogen flux from current levels to flux levels averaged over 2045–2054. We find that simulations accounting for the effects of extreme climate conditions differ significantly from those which consider only mean temperature (MT) and precipitation changes. Several regions, including some with significant agricultural activity, show a reversal in direction of simulated future total nitrogen flux, from reductions in flux due to a dominant effect of increased MT to an increase in flux due to an overriding effect of more frequent extreme events. These findings suggest that changing extreme climate regimes can substantially alter watershed nitrogen processing and underscore the need to account for them in the future."

When adequately thick and stable, river ice serves as a key transportation corridor for residents of remote Arctic and sub-Arctic communities. Climate change is altering the timing, extent, and duration of river ice cover, impacting both environmental processes and human activities. This study examines regional variability and temporal change in river ice phenology across Alaska using satellite observations and climate-driven modeling. We extracted reach-scale surface water extent from the Landsat archive to characterize river ice cover at sub-monthly time scales, capturing spatial heterogeneity and seasonal transitions during freeze-up and break-up. We then developed statistical models driven by ERA5-Land climate reanalysis to reconstruct annual metrics identifying the beginning, end, and duration of ice-covered conditions from water years 1979–2023. Model results show that typical river ice duration varied strongly along climatic gradients, ranging from 2.4 months in a southern coastal region to 7.3 months in northern Alaska (2000–2023). Decadal comparisons show that river ice duration during 2014–2023 was substantially shorter than in the 1980s across much of the state, with reductions exceeding three weeks within western and southwestern Alaska. These recent declines reflect the combined influence of delayed freeze-up and, to a lesser extent, earlier break-up onset. Long-term trend analyses (1979–2023) reveal persistent declines in ice duration, primarily driven by later freeze-up, with rates of change from 3–5 d decade−1 where trends are significant. Together, these findings demonstrate substantial, regionally structured changes in Alaska’s river ice regimes and underscore growing challenges in transportation, public safety, and access in river-dependent communities."

Source analysis indicated that ships contributed notably to organic aerosol and alkylated PAHs, and dominated ultrafine particles. These results support continued monitoring as the Mediterranean becomes a sulfur emission control area in 2025. 
 Maritime transport exerts a substantial influence on local air quality, particularly in port cities. Ship emissions are recognized as major contributors to air pollution, with comparable magnitude to those of road transport. This study, conducted in 2021 in Toulon, a port city on the French Mediterranean coast, assessed ship emissions one year after the implementation of IMO2020 sulfur regulations. Emission factors (EFs) were determined for key pollutants such as SO2, NOx, CO, NO, CH4 and particulate matter (PM), including black carbon (BC), organics (Org), sulfate (SO42-), nitrate (NO3-), ammonium (NH4+), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as well as the particle number concentration (PN). The IMO2020 regulation led to a marked reduction in sulfur-related emissions, whereas pollutants such as BC, Org, and PAHs remained at pre-regulation levels. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) analysis of PM1 organic aerosol (OA) measured by a High-Resolution Time-of-Flight Aerosol Mass Spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) was used to investigate shipping contribution to local air quality. PMF successfully distinguished between road and marine transport emissions, revealing a shipping contribution to the total OA of 11.2 %. Eight factors were resolved: three shipping-related OA, a Hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), a Cooking-like OA (COA), an Oxidized Hydrocarbon-like OA (OxHOA), a Less Oxidized OA (LOOA), and a More Oxidized OA (MOOA). Shipping and HOA factors were the dominant contributors to ultrafine particles, accounting together for 51.9 % of the alkylated PAHs (APAHs). These findings highlight the persistent influence of shipping emissions in port areas and demonstrate the effectiveness of advanced source apportionment methods to improve emission monitoring strategies, particularly as the Mediterranean region prepares for the implementation of Emission Control Area (ECA) regulations in 2025."

When sea-breeze fronts moved inland, they mixed marine and continental air, changing aerosol concentrations by up to a factor of two as far as 50 km inland. The sea breeze also reduced the number of particles that can form cloud droplets, highlighting the connection between coastal meteorology and aerosol-cloud interactions. 
 The Sea Breeze Circulation (SBC) influences atmospheric processes at multiple scales in coastal regions. Understanding how SBCs impact the aerosol number budget and aerosol–cloud interaction processes is essential. This study investigates sea breeze–aerosol interactions (SAIs) during 46 summertime SBC events using data from the TRacking Aerosol Convection Interactions Experiment (TRACER) field campaign across urban (main) and rural (supplemental) coastal sites in southern Texas. Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) simulations complement observations to explore spatio-temporal meteorological controls on boundary layer aerosols. During the summertime, Sea Breeze Fronts (SBF) penetrating inland transported cool, moist air over the land, introducing air masses with distinct properties compared to the preexisting continental air. These SAIs cause variability in number concentrations of up to a factor of two, with events typically lasting ∼ 5 h before returning to background conditions. SAI impact on aerosols varies with site proximity to water and the preceding sea breeze (SB) history, primarily affecting the marine-influenced accumulation mode. The main site, influenced by both Galveston Bay and the Gulf of Mexico, reflects a stronger marine influence. In contrast, a supplemental site, at a similar shoreline distance but exposed only to the Gulf of Mexico and typically upstream of the urban core, samples SB air that has traversed land and partially regained continental characteristics. Simulations show that the regional SAIs extend ∼ 50 km inland and reach up to the boundary layer height. SAIs further decrease cloud condensation nuclei relevant aerosol number concentrations in ∼ 20 % of events during SBF passage."

We conducted field measurements in Hangzhou, China, to examine how the mass ratio (MR, coating-to-BC) affects light absorption enhancement (Eabs). Our results show that widely used optical models overestimate Eabs, especially under clean conditions. A new MR-dependent parameterization improves model accuracy and reduces this uncertainty. 
 Black carbon (BC) is a strong climate forcer, but considerable uncertainty remains in estimating its radiative impact, largely due to persistent gaps between observed and modeled light absorption enhancement (Eabs). In this study, we employed a Centrifugal Particle Mass Analyzer and Single Particle Soot Photometer tandem system to characterize mass ratio (MR, coating-to-BC) of BC-containing particles in Hangzhou, China. Observations across a field campaign revealed low, medium, and high Eabs values under varying atmospheric conditions. The uniform core-shell Mie model overestimated Eabs, particularly during clean periods (low Eabs). To address this, we developed an observationally constrained parameterization for transition-state particles based on MR-dependent optical transitions behaviors. This approach effectively reconciles modeled and measured Eabs across varying pollution conditions. It also emphasizes the importance of incorporating MR heterogeneity and transition-state optical behavior to improve BC light absorption estimates and reduce uncertainties in assessing radiative effects."

Distinct acetylene plumes at Linyuan (R² > 0.99) provided an internal consistency check. Results reveal spatial–seasonal source variability and highlight the roles of petroleum, mixed, and aged air sources in ozone formation management. 
 Ozone pollution remains a persistent challenge in Taiwan's Kaoping region due to dense industrial and urban emissions. Using high-resolution, hourly observations from three Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations (PAMS) combined with Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF), this study resolved eight distinct sources of non-methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs), key precursors of ozone formation. The time-resolved PMF output captured source-specific temporal patterns – as shown by the acetylene factor at Linyuan (R2 = 0.99 with observations) – providing an intrinsic check on model performance and facilitating spatial interpretation of sources. Petroleum-related emissions dominate NMHC mass at all sites but are more prominent at Xiaogang, while aged air masses substantially enhance ozone pollution at downwind locations such as Linyuan and Chaozhou, underscoring the role of regional transport and atmospheric aging. Although mixed sources from vehicular and solvent emissions contributed less mass, they dominated ozone formation potential (OFP) due to higher chemical reactivity. Notably, their influence persisted even under moderate ozone conditions, indicative of a VOC-limited regime. Overall, these results emphasize that effective ozone mitigation in southern Taiwan requires coordinated control of petroleum, mobile, and solvent emissions, and demonstrate the value of multi-site, year-round, high-time-resolution NMHC measurements for constraining ozone precursors."

 Methane emissions from the oil and gas (O&G) industry play a major role in the global methane budget. The MethaneSAT space-based mission, which operated between March 2024 and June 2025, was designed to provide high-quality data on O&G methane emissions, from regional fluxes to high-emitting point sources. This was enabled by MethaneSAT's measurements in the 1598–1683 nm window with a high spectral resolution (0.25 nm), medium spatial sampling (100×400 m2 at nadir), and wide-area coverage (about 200 km at nadir). In this work, we showcase the potential of MethaneSAT to survey high-emitting point sources across O&G basins. We first assess MethaneSAT's performance for the detection, quantification and attribution of methane plumes through the analysis of key observation-related parameters, including wind speed, surface albedo and spatial sampling. We estimate a minimum detection limit of about 500 kg h−1 for a bright surface and low wind conditions, and an average detection limit around 1300 kg h−1 corresponding to an ensemble of sites with different observation conditions. We analyzed selected MethaneSAT datasets from the main O&G methane hotspots in the world. We observe particularly strong and persistent sources in the  Turkmenistan's South Caspian basin and in the Midland sub-basin of the US Permian Basin, and reveal major super-emissions in Maturin (Venezuela) and Zagros Foldbelt and Widyan (Iran), and the Appalachian basin. We also present other examples of strong methane sources at high latitudes (West Siberia), in offshore platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, and from the waste sector. Our results illustrate the potential of MethaneSAT data to map methane emissions from hotspot regions and super-emitters around the planet."

We developed a high-resolution inventory of air pollutants and greenhouse gases for a heavily polluted Chinese province. This valuable resource reveals seasonal and spatial emission patterns across sources, cities, and hotspots, highlighting key differences among megacity clusters, industrial hubs, and agricultural regions. 
 A high-resolution inventory provides scientific basis for numerical simulations and control strategies. Under the background of synergistic carbon reduction and pollution control, constructing a carbon-pollutant co-emission inventory is of great significance for regional air quality improvement. Taken Henan Province in the Central Plains region as an example, the most polluted regions in China, an update emission inventory was developed. The study presents results showing that in 2022, the total emissions of SO2, NOx, CO, PM10, PM2.5, VOCs, NH3, BC, OC, CO2, CH4, and N2O in Central China, particularly Henan Province, were 408.7, 1336.2, 4647.3, 901.1, 440.0, 759.3, 672.7, 47.4, 90.3, 540462.0, 12462.0 and 42.9 kt respectively. The emissions were predominantly attributed to industrial combustion, electricity generation, motor vehicles, and agricultural activities. Significant spatial heterogeneity was observed. Northern heavy industrial cities exhibited high carbon and pollution intensities with carbon emission 1.75–3.7 times higher than the provincial average. In contrast, central transportation hubs were primarily characterized by elevated emissions of NOx and VOCs. Southern agricultural areas showed low carbon but high NH3 emissions. Temporally, emissions of SO2, CO, PM10 and PM2.5 peaked during winter, whereas NH3, CH4 and N2O increased during the summer agricultural season. High-emission grids were predominantly concentrated in urban agglomerations of the north-central region, especially around Zhengzhou, Jiaozuo, and Anyang. Co-hotspot analysis identified the central-northern industrial zone, especially around Zhengzhou, as the key region for coordinated control, with winter offering the most significant synergistic potential. This inventory provides a critical scientific basis for targeted, region-specific mitigation strategies."

Our measurements show good accordance with previous COS observations. Moreover, laboratory tests of ozone (O3) scrubbers proved squalene to remove O3 very efficiently without biasing the measurements of other trace gases. 
 Carbonyl sulfide (COS) is a low abundance atmospheric trace gas that has a tropospheric lifetime of 2–2.5 years, allowing it to reach the stratosphere, where it undergoes photolysis and reactions with ⋅OH and O⋅ radicals, generating precursors of stratospheric aerosols. Vertical profiling of COS has rarely been realised, especially for stratospheric observations. In this study, we introduce a new technique for continuous and discrete vertical profiling of COS based on the analysis of air samples collected by AirCore, the LIghtweight Stratospheric Air (LISA) sampler, and its scaled-up version BigLISA, in three campaigns in Trainou (2019), Kiruna (2021) and Sodankylä (2023) using a Quantum Cascade Laser Spectrometer (QCLS). To eliminate potential COS measurement biases, we have investigated the efficiency of different scrubbers based on cotton and squalene for removing ozone (O3) and assessed their potential impacts on COS measurement. Furthermore, we examined the influence of different inlet configurations and O3 scrubbers on the retrieved COS profiles, and found no significant impact within the uncertainties. We found that the differences with the averaged profiles obtained from the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment – Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) and the measured AirCore profiles and LISA samples were less than 10 % (±50 ppt) at both mid and polar latitudes. Differences between our observations and COS observations from the SPectromètre InfraRouge d'Absorption à Lasers Embarqués (SPIRALE) ranged from 10 % to 15 %, with both methods showing similar COS trends over altitude. Moreover, we found squalene-based scrubbers to be suitable for quantitative O3 removal. Both AirCore and the LISA samplers are lightweight and suitable for routine balloon-borne COS profiling, providing useful observations for stratospheric research and validation of COS retrievals from remote sensing techniques."

All isotopes exhibit strong seasonal cycles controlled by temperature, monsoon rainfall, and moisture source humidity. d-excess reflects source-region evaporation, while Δ′¹⁷O shows reduced seasonal sensitivity and highlights atmospheric mixing and transport processes, providing new constraints on East Asian hydroclimate dynamics. 
 Precipitation stable isotopes are critical tracers for understanding climate variability and the hydrological cycle, as they enable the tracing of moisture sources, air mass mixing, and evaporation vs. condensation mechanisms. In mid-latitude regions such as South Korea, which are influenced by tropical and extratropical circulation, long-term isotope records remain scarce. Here, we analyze stable isotopes in precipitation collected bi-weekly in Seoul, South Korea, from 2016 to 2020. The oxygen isotope composition (δ18O) ranged widely from 1.15 ‰ to −18.21 ‰, hydrogen isotope composition (δ2H) varied from 3.3 ‰ to −132.0 ‰, the deuterium excess (d-excess) ranged from 23.7 ‰–2.1 ‰ and the 17O-excess (Δ′17O) ranged from 69 to −28 per meg. All three primary isotopes exhibited a coherent sinusoidal seasonal cycle, with the most depleted values in winter, gradual enrichment through spring, and sharp depletion during the summer monsoon, reflecting the combined influence of temperature and the amount effect. The d-excess was highest during cold, dry months and lowest in humid, rainy months, reflecting shifts in near-surface relative humidity at the moisture source region and associated kinetic fractionation. Meanwhile, Δ′17O exhibited a similar season trend with a smaller amplitude, indicating a reduced sensitivity to seasonal variations in relative humidity compared to d-excess and suggesting additional modulation by large-scale transport and water vapor mixing. The local meteoric water line closely matches the global line but winter samples show a higher intercept and a slightly steeper δ17O–δ18O slope, suggesting enhanced kinetic fractionation under continental air masses. A consistently negative δ18O–Δ′17O relationship was observed except in winter when it weakened. This integrated analysis of δ18O, d-excess, and Δ′17O provides a comprehensive picture of source humidity, transport dynamics, and seasonal precipitation processed in a mid-latitude East Asia, and offers a valuable reference for refining isotope-enabled climate models over East Asia.

We created the first long-term record of these glaciers and their lakes from 1990 to 2022 by analyzing satellite images. Our results show that many glaciers are shrinking while their lakes are growing. These changes matter because they affect water supply, flood risks, and mountain landscapes. This dataset offers new knowledge to support research and planning for climate change impacts. 
 Lake-terminating glaciers (LTGs) typically exhibit higher rates of retreat and thinning compared to land-terminating glaciers. However, a comprehensive inventory for LTGs and their associated proglacial lakes across High Mountain Asia (HMA) is currently lacking, limiting further understanding of their spatial heterogeneity in glacier change. This study employs a semi-automated identification method, coupled with rigorous visual inspection, to construct a comprehensive inventory of LTGs and proglacial lakes in HMA for 1990 and 2022. Our data indicate that, by 2022, HMA hosted 1740 LTGs (5082.08 ± 13.15 km2), among which 667 glaciers (3454.59 ± 12.43 km2) remained in contact with proglacial lakes since 1990, 1073 (1627.49 ± 4.30 km2) are newly developed and 468 (960.13 ± 3.18 km2) had disconnected from proglacial lakes during the investigation period. Accordingly, 645 proglacial lakes (207.18 ± 0.82 km2) remained in contact with ice, 1123 new lakes (54.85 ± 0.35 km2) formed, and 485 lakes (45.31 ± 0.34 km2) detached from ice (including 25 disappeared). During the past 32 years, the total area of proglacial lakes increased by 138.19 ± 1.18 km2 (81.7 %), alongside a glacier area loss of 324.43 ± 19.23 km2 (5.1 %). The southern regions of HMA, particularly the Hindu Kush, Himalayas, Nyainqentanglha, and Gangdise Mountains, exhibited the highest concentration and most rapid changes of the glacier-lake system.

Data gaps caused by clouds and other non-optimal conditions limit comprehensive analyses like trend monitoring. This study evaluated DINCAE and DINEOF gap-filling methods for reconstructing chlorophyll a datasets, including total chlorophyll a and five major phytoplankton groups. Both methods showed robust reconstruction capabilities, aiding pattern detection and long-term ocean colour analysis. 
 Phytoplankton are vital to marine biogeochemical cycles and form the base of the marine food web. Comprehensive datasets offering a spatiotemporal perspective on phytoplankton composition are essential for assessing the impacts of climate change on marine ecosystems. Phytoplankton functional types (PFTs) classify phytoplankton based on their biogeochemical functions, enabling assessments of nutrient cycling, primary productivity, and ecosystem structure. However, satellite-derived ocean colour products like PFTs chlorophyll a (Chl a) concentrations are challenged by limited temporal and spatial coverage due to the exclusion of data collected under non-optimal observing conditions, such as strong sun glint, clouds, thick aerosols, straylight, and large viewing angles or due to the specific sensor configuration and sensor malfunction. This highlights the importance of gap-filling techniques for producing consistent datasets, which are currently missing for operational data sets. This study evaluates two robust gap-filling methods for satellite observations: Data Interpolating Empirical Orthogonal Functions (DINEOF) and Data Interpolating Convolutional Auto Encoder (DINCAE). These methods were applied to Sentinel 3A/B OLCI-derived Chl a concentration products in several regions of the Atlantic Ocean over three years of data, including total Chl a (TChl a) and Chl a concentration of five major PFTs, namely diatoms, dinoflagellates, haptophytes, green algae, and prokaryotic phytoplankton. The reconstructed datasets were assessed using test dataset evaluation and validated with in situ measurements collected during the transatlantic RV Polarstern expedition PS113 in 2018. The test dataset evaluation indicates that DINCAE performs slightly better than DINEOF in representing transient-scale variability, particularly within highly dynamic regions. DINCAE achieves an average root-mean-square-logarithmic-error (RMSLE) in cross-validation that is 66 % lower for TChl a and 16 % lower for PFTs compared to DINEOF. However, external validation using in situ measurements indicates better performance for DINEOF than DINCAE, with improved regression metrics for PFTs, including a 12.5 % better slope, 13.6 % better intercept, and 68 % higher coefficient of determination (R2). The gap-filled datasets exhibit slightly reduced but still robust accuracy compared to the original satellite data while preserving statistical trends, improving spatial structure restoration, and increasing matchup data for validation. It is concluded that DINCAE and DINEOF each have unique strengths for gap-filling ocean colour products. DINCAE performs well in complex water bodies, effectively reproducing patterns from the original satellite product. In contrast, DINEOF shows higher overall reliability, supported by independent validation, and is better suited for larger areas due to its lower computational demands."

Fridlind;Israel Silber;Nicole Riemer;Daniel A. Knopf,Prognostic simulations of mixed-phase clouds with model AC-1D v1.0: the impact of aerosol types and freezing parameterizations on ice crystal budgets,"The role of Arctic clouds in the regional climate remains uncertain due to insufficient understanding of the amount of liquid droplets and ice crystals present in these clouds. An aerosol-cloud model is employed to examine the role of different aerosol types and freezing parameterizations on the number of ice crystals. The choice of freezing parameterization significantly changes the number of ice crystals impacting the interpretation of the evolution and warming effect of Arctic clouds. 
 Mixed-phase clouds at high latitudes contribute to the uncertainty in predicting cloud feedbacks and climate sensitivity, mainly due to the complexity of microphysical processes that influence the partitioning between the supercooled liquid and ice phases, and hence, cloud radiative effects on regional scales. Particularly in Arctic mixed-phase clouds, the activation of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) from various aerosol populations remains a leading source of uncertainty.  We developed an aerosol-cloud one-dimensional (AC-1D) model, which provides a novel framework to prognostically treat INP and ice crystal budgets while explicitly accounting for polydisperse and multicomponent aerosol that activate INPs following different freezing parameterizations. The AC-1D model is informed by large-eddy simulations to probe the impact of INP representation on predicted ice crystal number concentrations (Ni) and ice crystal budgets in mixed-phase Arctic stratus. We apply three immersion freezing (IMF) parameterizations, two time-independent (singular) and one time-dependent (classical nucleation theory), to predict the evolution of the INP reservoir and resulting ice crystal budget from polydisperse mineral dust, organic (humic-like substances), and sea spray aerosol particle size distributions. Our analysis focuses on how variations in aerosol number concentration and cloud system parameters such as cloud cooling rate, cloud-top entrainment rate, and ice crystal fall speed influence the INP reservoir and ice crystal budgets. Furthermore, this study investigates the competitive ice nucleation dynamics in mixed aerosol environments and provides a process-level quantification of the INP budget terms, which directly controls ice crystal budgets. For all studied case scenarios, the aerosol types and associated particle size distributions significantly impact INP and Ni, and the choice between a time-dependent and a singular freezing description yields orders-of-magnitude differences in the predicted INP and Ni over the 10 h simulation time, reflecting typical cloud lifetimes. Our results show that the influence of cloud cooling, INP entrainment, and sedimentation varies significantly depending on the chosen freezing parameterization. These findings underscore the critical need for robust IMF parameterizations and precise cloud system observations to enhance the accuracy of models in predicting mixed-phase cloud structure and evolution."

However, their performance in complex flue gases containing NOx, aromatic volatile organic compounds (VOCs, e.g., toluene), and chlorinated VOCs (e.g., chlorobenzene) remains limited. This study evaluates the crystalline phase-dependence of TiO2-supported V2O5 catalysts (anatase: V/TiO2-A; rutile: V/TiO2-R) for synergistic multipollutant control. We identify a crystal-dependent reversal in synergistic catalytic performance: V/TiO2-A exhibits superior activity for NOx-toluene coremoval, while V/TiO2-R achieves optimal NOx-chlorobenzene elimination. Mechanistic studies reveal that oxygen vacancies in V/TiO2-A enhance toluene activation, whereas high V5+/V4+ ratios and Brønsted acidity in V/TiO2-R promote chlorobenzene activation and HCl formation. This insight enabled the design of a tandem catalyst system (V/TiO2-R upstream + V/TiO2-A downstream) within a single SCR reactor, achieving >90% simultaneous conversion of NOx, chlorobenzene, and toluene at 375 °C─outperforming individual catalysts, physical mixtures, and commercial benchmarks with high HCl selectivity. The configuration exploits phase-specific strengths─rutile for chlorinated VOC oxidation at high temperatures, followed by anatase for aromatic VOC degradation─avoiding separate control units and easing retrofit cost and space constraints."

While photolysis dominates the degradation of neonicotinoids in atmospheric liquid water, existing studies focus primarily on bulk-solution reactions, overlooking the ubiquitous atmospheric microdroplets. Here, we employed in situ single-droplet ultraviolet absorption spectroscopy, revealing that the photolysis rate of neonicotinoids in microdroplets was 25–76 times faster than in bulk solution. A comprehensive characterization of photoproduced reactive intermediates demonstrated that direct photolysis proceeded through denitrification pathways. Mechanistic investigation showed that interfacial enrichment combined with an ultrahigh electric field promotes photolysis, as evidenced by in situ FTIR, surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy, and DFT calculations. Free energy barriers for excited-state generation decreased linearly with increasing electric field strength at a rate of 104–105 kJ mol–1 au–1. Moreover, we established quantitative structure–activity relationship models to predict photolysis rate constants of neonicotinoids. These findings bridge the critical knowledge gap between traditional bulk solution and microdroplet-mediated atmospheric reactions, providing a scientific foundation for accurately evaluating the environmental fate and transboundary ecological threats of neonicotinoids."

Brandt,Temperature Modulates PFAS Accumulation and Effects on Metabolic Performance in Sheepshead Minnows,"Climate warming and chemical pollution shape aquatic ecosystems, yet the physiological mechanisms underlying their combined effects remain unclear. We investigated how projected increases in mean summer surface water temperature alter per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) toxicokinetics and their effects on the physiological performance of sheepshead minnows (Cyprinodon variegatus). Adult fish were chronically exposed to an environmentally relevant PFAS mixture (perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) + perfluorooctanoate (PFOA)) under current and projected mean-temperature scenarios. Tissue PFAS concentrations, whole-organism metabolic rates, swimming performance, reproductive output, and somatic indices were assessed. Temperature modified PFAS tissue concentrations in a compound- and tissue-specific manner, notably promoting PFOA redistribution to eggs. Metabolic responses were temperature-dependent: at 26 °C, higher tissue PFAS concentrations were associated with elevated standard and maximum metabolic rates (SMR and MMR), maintaining aerobic scope (AS). At 28.5 °C, SMR remained stable while MMR and AS declined with rising PFAS, indicating less oxygen for energetically demanding activities. Despite unchanged performance outcomes for swimming and reproduction,  increase in hepatosomatic index with increasing tissue PFAS concentrations and altered PFAS distribution suggests detoxification costs. These findings indicate that increases in mean water temperature are likely to exacerbate contaminant stress, with consequences for coastal fish population resilience and offspring development. PFAS risk assessment should consider costressors under projected warming."

This study introduces an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework using a curated A549 cytotoxicity data set (19,841 compounds) that integrates customized Molecular Access System (MACCS) fingerprints, six base models, and a stacking ensemble meta-model, all optimized with a biobjective strategy to assess the toxicity of organic compounds in PM2.5. The stacking ensemble model demonstrated satisfactory performance (test AUC > 0.8), exhibiting good generalization, adaptability, and robustness. Nontargeted analysis generated and experimentally validated a prediction set from the Hong Kong PM2.5 samples (51 of 387 compounds confirmed from 13 classes), demonstrating broad applicability on an independent Nanjing PM2.5 set (572 compounds). Key substructures driving toxicity, identified through a SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and cell experimental validation, revealed that PM2.5 compounds with aromatic rings and nitrogen-based functional groups (e.g., aromatic α,β-unsaturated ketones, aromatic amines, aromatic nitro compounds, and tertiary amines) likely contribute to high toxicity. The derived “structure–toxicity” rules narrow the search space from thousands of compounds to those containing critical substructures, enabling efficient prioritization of toxic components and providing a foundation for improving model specificity and predictive accuracy in future studies."

Also, over the past two decades, the progressive implementation of the International Maritime Organization (IMO) fuel sulfur content (FSC) regulations has driven major shifts in both fuel characteristics and compliance technologies. The widespread adoption of desulfurized marine fuels has markedly decreased average V/Ni ratios in coastal environments (to ∼1), whereas the continued use of heavy fuel oil (HFO) with exhaust gas cleaning systems (scrubbers) appears to maintain pre-IMO values. Compiling two decades of V/Ni data from ship emission studies, this work assesses temporal and technological trends to evaluate the robustness of this ratio as a diagnostic marker. The results show a global decrease in V/Ni ratios driven by fuel desulfurization with residual variability reflecting fuel type, sampling context, and industrial influence. Overall, the V/Ni ratio is a relevant tracer of shipping emissions in coastal areas and a potential indicator of scrubber operation in an evolving regulatory landscape."

Here, we investigated emissions from a pan, an air fryer, and an oven under controlled residential conditions with constant chicken quantity and varying oil quantity and marination. The pan generated the highest PM2.5 concentrations and mass-based emission rates, whereas the air fryer emitted moderate levels and the oven had minimal emissions. Variations in PM2.5 mass concentration are tightly associated with the size distribution of emitted particles, with diameter (dp) peaking at 120–140 nm, 55–62 nm, and 20–30 nm from the pan, air fryer, and oven, respectively. Oil quantity and marination substantially affected mass-based emissions, whereas number concentrations were not substantially influenced. Organic compounds dominated the aerosols, and spectral marker ratios (f55/f57, f67/f69) clearly differentiated them from ambient aerosols. Based on the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) model with particle hygroscopic growth, the air fryer produced the highest particle number dose, while pan frying generated the largest mass and surface area dose, with over 50% depositing in the alveolar region. These findings demonstrate that cooking method is a critical determinant of indoor particle exposure and that different cooking methods present distinct exposure profiles depending on the metric considered."

However, the scientific evidence remains limited, particularly in studies on clinically diagnosed precocious puberty (PP), and the specific pollutant drivers underlying this condition are poorly characterized. Identifying the key hazardous substances contributing to PP thus represents a critical research priority. This study conducted a population-based case–control study to profile the internal exposure to organic pollutants. Using a combination of liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) and solid-phase extraction, we performed suspect screening and nontargeted analysis with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) (liquid chromatography-/GC-Orbitrap HRMS). Nontargeted analysis revealed a broad spectrum of EDCs, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, phthalate esters (PAEs), organophosphate esters (OPEs), phenols, amides, and acrylates. Differential analysis between cases and controls further highlighted several pollutant classes, such as organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), phenols, and chlorinated paraffins. These pollutants were significantly elevated in the PP group. These findings provide new internal exposure data and methodological support for environmental health research. They also offer a scientific foundation for targeted source–control strategies to reduce children’s exposure to harmful pollutants, supporting the broader public health objectives of “Healthy China 2030”."

This study used field observation data to reveal the key factors affecting the albedo of two typical underlying surfaces (bare land, alpine grassland) under snow free conditions. Results show that the solar elevation angle, soil ice content, soil liquid content, and near canopy surface air relative humidity are the primary determinants of albedo for these typical surfaces. Based on these findings, the albedo schemes suitable for the bare land and alpine grassland on the TP have been constructed by considering more comprehensive affecting factors. Evaluation of single‐point simulations at four stations indicates that adopting the new albedo schemes can clearly improve the albedo simulations of Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5) with the root mean square error reduced by ∼10% to ∼60% relative to adopting the original albedo schemes, further leading to the surface net radiation simulations improved and thereafter the warm biases of soil temperature simulations reduced by ∼0.2°C to ∼1°C. Regional simulation verification further confirms that adopting the new albedo schemes in CLM5 can obviously improve the surface net radiation simulations by increasing the albedo simulation accuracy on the TP, thereby mainly reducing the overestimation of surface sensible heat flux and land surface temperature by the original albedo schemes, further resulting in the performance of CLM5 to simulate the TP surface heat conditions enhanced."

Whereas prior research on TC climatologies has relied on proxies like Potential Intensity and synthetic storm models, the cyclones simulated by newer TC‐resolving GCMs can now be analyzed directly. This is particularly useful for studying projected global storm distributions under radically altered future climates, including high‐emissions warming scenarios, and those shaped by climate interventions. In this paper, we utilize a high‐resolution model configuration to conduct experiments examining the effects of Stratospheric Aerosol Injection (SAI) on tropical cyclones. These experiments are constructed based on prior work on SAI, using the Geoengineering Large Ensemble Project (GLENS) ensemble. Our analysis focuses on three uncoupled 10‐year simulations conducted using 30‐km grid spacing and forced with modeled sea surface temperatures from earlier work. The first is a recent‐past calibration run. The second simulates the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) 5–8.5, for the years 2090–2099, with no SAI. The third simulation also uses SSP 5–8.5 for the years 2090–2099, but with SAI keeping global temperature rise at no more than 1.5 K. We use a novel TC tracking scheme to analyze resulting changes in storm tracks and properties. Our results show that while SAI may return global storm counts back to late 20th‐century levels, there are still large basin‐by‐basin changes in storm number and intensity. These are likely driven by increases in mean ENSO indices that occur with warming, but seemingly also with intervention."

Here, we investigate the impacts of the TP surface sensible heating on the surrounding Asian cloud fraction and surface radiation budget using numerical climate experiments that vary sensible heat exchange. The TP surface sensible heating, as an elevated heating source, can induce a low‐level cyclone surrounding the TP and ascent over the central‐eastern TP, pumping air into the middle troposphere. Consequently, spring cloud fractions significantly increase over the east TP and East China (EC) owing to the TP surface heating, enhancing cloud radiative effects and longwave radiation but reducing shortwave and net radiation at the surface, whereas the opposite changes occur over the west TP. The summer TP impacts exhibit more substantial changes in both magnitude and spatial coverage relative to spring states. Due to the coupling between the upper and lower circulations forced by the TP surface heating, increased cloud fractions extend over the whole TP in summer, with enhanced ascent and cloud radiative cooling dominated by the shortwave component. Meanwhile, cloud fractions decrease over Central and North Asia, accompanied by abnormal descent, weakened cloud radiative cooling, and minimal change in net surface radiation due to a weak offset between longwave and shortwave radiations. Our results indicate that the TP surface sensible heating significantly influences the distribution and magnitude of the surrounding Asian cloud fraction and surface radiation budget via circulation responses."

Wildfire emissions increase the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere and thus affect cloud properties (e.g., cloud brightness). For this study, we conducted open laboratory burning experiments with less studied biomass types from South African savannah and European boreal forest, to quantify the particle hygroscopicity, an important factor affecting CCN concentrations. We also investigated the effect of burning conditions (characterized by the modified combustion efficiency (MCE)) and aging on the hygroscopicity of the particles. Considering all the experiments, the primary hygroscopicity parameter κ $\kappa $ is constant (0.079 ± $\pm $ 0.007 (mean ± $\pm $ STD) for supersaturation of 0.43%) with respect to MCE for particles from smoldering combustion and increases to a maximum of 0.19 with increasing contribution of flaming. With aging, the hygroscopicity increases (boreal forest biomass) or remains unchanged (savannah biomass) in smoldering experiments, while it decreases in experiments with more flaming‐dominated burning, decreasing the overall variability in κ $\kappa $. Using complementary chemical analysis methods, we provide insights into the markedly different CCN results under different burning conditions. Our results indicate that even in organic carbon‐dominated aerosol representative of wildfires, a small fraction of inorganic material can significantly influence the aerosol hygroscopicity, highlighting the impact of combustion efficiency on biomass burning aerosol CCN activity."

However, the roles of aerosol aqueous conditions in regulating nitrate formation and loss are still poorly constrained. Here, 744 hourly PM2.5 samples collected during the winter of 2023–2024 in a typical northern Chinese city were analyzed to investigate the drivers of severe nitrate pollution. The mean PM2.5 concentration reached 106.0 ± 84.4 μg m−3, with a maximum of 377.8 μg m−3. The NO3−/Total Ions (TI) ratio increased steadily to 43% in 2023, reflecting rising NO2 and effective SO2 emission reductions that shifted winter aerosol composition from sulfate‐to nitrate‐dominated. Four pollution episodes (PE1‐PE4) were identified relative to a clean background period. Both PM2.5 and NO3−/TI ratios were strongly enhanced during all episodes. NO3− exhibited a strong dependence on aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) when ALWC <200 μg m−3, but this relationship weakened at higher ALWC, indicating a transition in dominant formation and loss pathways. Nitrate consistently dominated NH4+ neutralization. PE1 showed the highest aerosol pH but the lowest ALWC and nitrogen oxidation ratio, suggesting that more acidic conditions favor NO2 oxidation. At ALWC >200 μg m−3, gas‐particle partitioning of nitrate approached quasi‐equilibrium, while enhanced deposition indicated accelerated loss. Meanwhile, elevated ALWC increased the particle size through hygroscopic growth, reducing the PM1/PM2.5 ratio. These results demonstrate a threshold‐dependent control of ALWC on nitrate production and removal, with ALWC = 200 μg m−3 representing a critical turning point for wintertime nitrate pollution."

We have developed an hourly temporal, 10‐m spatial resolution biogenic CO2 flux estimation framework based on the Vegetation Photosynthesis and Respiration Model (VPRM) and its variants (UrbanVPRM and VPRM‐modified). Unlike lower‐resolution models, our approach captures finer‐scale variability, particularly in fragmented urban green spaces like street trees and lawns. Results show that vegetation in Munich offsets 2.0%–2.8% of annual anthropogenic CO2 emissions in the study domain, with tree‐covered areas as primary sinks and grasslands as net sources. During summer, daytime CO2 uptake can match or exceed anthropogenic emissions. Evaluations employing city park field measurements and eddy covariance towers confirm strong performance of our models, while highlighting VPRM‐modified's advantage in grasslands and croplands, and UrbanVPRM's improvements in urban areas via impervious surface correction.

Notably, China’s total land carbon emissions (13 ± 0.5 PgC) accounted for 22% of global land carbon emissions during 1700–1900, with Northeast and Southwest China experiencing the largest historical land carbon losses from intensive deforestation. Nevertheless, the 17.0 ± 1.7 PgC emissions during 851–1980 were fully offset by rapid carbon sinks over 1980–2022, driven by CO2 fertilization and large-scale afforestation. These findings provide insights into China’s historical land carbon dynamics, their underlying drivers, and global implications. This study quantifies China’s millennial land carbon dynamics (851–2022). Historical emissions from deforestation were fully offset by 1980–2022 sinks, driven by CO2 fertilization and afforestation, highlighting regional impacts on global carbon balance."

 The Gulf Stream is part of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). The AMOC is a tipping element and may collapse under changing forcing. However, the role of the Gulf Stream in such a tipping event is unknown. Here, we investigate the link between the AMOC and Gulf Stream using a high-resolution (0. 1°) stand-alone ocean simulation, in which the AMOC collapses under a slowly-increasing freshwater forcing. AMOC weakening gradually shifts the Gulf Stream near Cape Hatteras northward, followed by an abrupt northward displacement of 219 km within 2 years. This rapid shift occurs a few decades before the simulated AMOC collapse. Satellite altimetry shows a significant (1993–2024, p < 0.05) northward Gulf Stream trend near Cape Hatteras, which is also confirmed in subsurface temperature observations (1965–2024, p < 0.01). These findings provide indirect evidence for present-day AMOC weakening and demonstrate that abrupt Gulf Stream shifts can serve as early warning indicator for AMOC tipping.

 Understanding the impacts of permafrost thawing on the carbon cycle requires a closer look at the proportion of dissolved and particulate organic carbon released upon thaw, and the magnitude of its conversion into greenhouse gases, which remain critically underexplored. In Central Yakutia (Siberia), we show evidence of contrasting influence of permafrost degradation on dissolved and particulate organic matter in both old and recent thermokarst lakes. Particulate organic carbon is largely modern and originates from lake primary production. In contrast, up to 75% of dissolved organic carbon originates from permafrost thaw in recent lakes and early-Holocene lakes modified by recent thermokarst, leading to the highest concentrations ever measured in such lakes. Despite massive transfers to lakes of permafrost-derived dissolved organic carbon showing high lability characteristics, this carbon fuels only a fraction of carbon dioxide emissions, and accumulates. Methane and the remaining carbon dioxide emissions originate from recently primarily produced carbon, also highly labile.

 Glacial melting in West Antarctica has intensified with the increased intrusion of warm ocean water beneath ice shelves, but the processes controlling the export of meltwater-associated micronutrient iron (Fe) to Southern Ocean surface waters remain unclear. Here, we report Fe concentrations and dissolved Fe (dFe) isotope ratios in the inflowing deepwater layer that drives melting of the Dotson Ice Shelf and in the meltwater-enriched outflow to determine meltwater-derived dFe. Isotopic mass balance points to an anoxic Fe-reducing region of the upstream subglacial hydrologic system as the dominant source of meltwater dFe, rather than ice shelf melt itself. Remarkably, total meltwater contributes only ~10% of outflowing dFe, with the majority contributed by inflowing deep water (62%), augmented by inputs from shelf sediments (28%). Outflowing suspended particulate Fe exceeds inflow by 46%, at 100 times the dFe concentration, with 25% in reactive phases. Predictive models of future ecosystem effects should consider that the primary role of ice shelf melting is to provide buoyancy that transports Fe from deep sources to the Fe-limited surface ocean, stimulating phytoplankton growth.

 The COVID-19 pandemic inadvertently offered a condition to evaluate how abrupt human-activity reductions affect freshwater ecosystems, particularly water turbidity. Using satellite-derived data from 774 lakes worldwide (2017–2022), here we show turbidity declined significantly in highly turbid zones of lakes following COVID-19 containment, with minor effects elsewhere. Globally, average peak turbidity decreased 7.0% in 2020 relative to 2019; 5.9% was directly attributable to containment measures, independent of climate. Without these measures, peak turbidity would have been ~5% higher (0.45 Nephelometric Turbidity Units) during 2020–2022. Lakes in regions with stricter containment and higher anthropogenic footprint exhibited larger declines and faster rebounds post-restriction. Among individual lakes, 75.2% experienced average peak turbidity reductions. For 168 lakes, containment-driven improvements averaged –18.6%, strongly correlated with reduced night-time light as a proxy for anthropogenic inputs.

 Under a sustained warming climate, reservoir‐area landslides exhibit increasingly complex, non-linear interactions. The cascade “climate or seasonal variability-soil rheology-vegetation response/feedback-impulse-wave risk” constitutes an emerging safety threat in alpine gorge reservoirs; yet how such cascades propagate—and how their key links manifest—remains insufficiently resolved. Here, adopting a geomorphological–ecological, multi-feedback perspective, we develop a research paradigm that couples heterogeneous geological modeling with surface-ecosystem diagnostics and analyses of spatiotemporal lag effects, and apply it to an empirical study of the Likan Landslides in the Lijia Gorge Reservoir on the upper Yellow River. We show that the landslide undergoes a northward-deflecting motion as a quasi-rigid block, and we identify and quantitatively characterize three heterogeneous zones with distinct activity signatures: (1) Horizontally dominated displacement zone (0.7 km2; mean thickness 10.6 m; maximum displacement rate 73 mm yr⁻1) showing thick-slope shear-creep behavior; (2) Downslope displacement-dominated zone (0.3 km2; 7.9 m; 33 mm yr⁻1) characterized by thin-slope creep and brittle unloading; (3) Severe dual-motion zone (2.2 × 10⁻2 km2; 7.03 m; 33–73 mm yr⁻1) manifesting block tensile-fracture movement. We further detect a 3–6-month lag between precipitation forcing and landslide response, coupled with a vegetation recovery suppression effect, confirming the system as a hydrologically lag-driven, progressive heterogeneous landslide. Its long-term creep–spatial differentiation–environmental feedback composite mechanism induces cumulative damage to the ground surface and poses the potential to trigger secondary wave surges. The study establishes a multi-field coupling framework of remote sensing that links process analysis with risk-warning decision-making, provides an empirical case for understanding landslide responses under climate change, and offers a transferable paradigm for cascading landslide risk assessment in reservoir regions."

 Aviation emissions of ultrafine particles and nitrogen oxides have adverse effects on climate, air quality, and public health. Modern engines tend to emit less pollutants and carbon dioxide by improving combustion technology and reducing fuel consumption. However, the performance of these optimized engines under real-world operating conditions remains poorly understood. In this study, we conducted field measurements of particle number (PN), NO, and CO2 concentrations during the aircraft taxi-out, landing, and take-off phases by utilizing a roadside platform situated near the taxiway. We successfully identified 1,040 PN plumes and 582 NO plumes for calculating real-world aircraft engine emission factors. The median engine-specific PN emission factors range from 1.5 × 1016 to 7.3 × 1016 particles/kg-fuel, which was 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than non-volatile PN emission factors reported by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO), indicating substantial emissions of volatile and semi-volatile particles from aviation sources under real-world operational conditions. The median engine-specific NO emission factors varied from 1.9 to 29.0 g/kg. Notably, a significantly higher NO emission factor was observed for new-generation engines compared to their predecessors. Additionally, an inverse variation trend between NO and PN emission factors was identified across different operating phases and engine types. Linear regression yielded slopes of −2 × 1015 and −8 × 1015, accompanied by coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.63 and 0.92, respectively. These findings underscore a trade-off between improved fuel efficiency and increased pollutant emissions. Furthermore, thrust settings, aircraft maximum take-off weight (MTOW) as well as aircraft service duration were also found to exert considerable influence on PN and NO emissions."

 This paper presents a novel and computationally efficient framework for the inverse identification of atmospheric pollution sources, with a focus on real-time applicability in complex environments. The proposed method combines stochastic modelling of pollutant dispersion with Higher-Order Singular Value Decomposition (HoSVD) and machine learning-based surrogate modelling. A case study centred on the Singapore region demonstrates the method’s ability to accurately reconstruct pollution fields from sparse sensor data over a 900-hour simulation window. The approach leverages a multi-objective optimization strategy, using Gaussian Process Regression (notably, the regression task is carried out in a parametric space of relatively low dimensionality) to approximate parametric modes and the Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm for source localization. Results show that the localization error remains within a fraction of the spatial grid resolution, and the entire computational pipeline—from simulation to optimization—can be executed in under 30 min on standard desktop hardware. This efficiency enables frequent or continuous deployment in operational monitoring systems. The framework’s modularity allows for extension to higher-dimensional parametric spaces, making it suitable for a wide range of environmental monitoring applications."

 Amines in fine particles influence atmospheric chemistry by promoting the formation of new particles and contributing to the growth of secondary aerosol mass through acid-base reactions and aminium salt formation. To investigate their abundance, seasonal dynamics, and sources of particulate amines in different environments in Pakistan, concurrent particulate matter (PM2.5) sampling campaigns were conducted at an urban site in Lahore and a rural site in Bhakkar, during the summer (southwest monsoon) and winter of 2022. We report an unexpected observation: the total mean concentrations of thirteen quantified amines are significantly higher in the rural area (60.52 ng m−3 in summer; 79.57 ng m−3 in winter) than in the urban area (1.88 ng m−3 in summer; 11.63 ng m−3 in winter), revealing a reversed urban-rural gradient. Both sites exhibited consistent wintertime enhancements. Dimethylamine was the most abundant species (17–48% of total amines), followed by diethylamine (7–23%) and ethylamine (1–17%). The concentrations of amines showed strong positive correlations with sulfur dioxide, PM2.5, and organic carbon, and were elevated during periods of low temperatures and weak winds, suggesting thermodynamic partitioning of haze in winter. The positive matrix factorization (PMF) receptor model identified distinct sources, with rural amines mainly contributed by proteinaceous waste emissions and agrochemical emissions (40.7% and 34.1% respectively). In contrast, urban amines were primarily contributed by waste and biomass burning, fugitive dust, and chemical manufacturing (60.2%, 19.1%, and 14.0% respectively). This study reveals a significant predominance of particulate amines in rural Pakistan, challenging the conventional view of urban-industrial dominance and highlighting the critical influence of localized agricultural and domestic sources on atmospheric chemistry."

 As a typical coastal city in northern China, Tianjin often suffered severe co-pollution of PM2.5 and ozone (O3), with maximum daily 8h average ozone concentration (MDA8 O3) ≥ 160 μg m−3 and the daily mean PM2.5 concentration (PM2.5_24h) ≥ 35 μg m−3 during the warm season (April-September). However, the meteorological characteristics and formation mechanism of co-pollution in Tianjin remain unclear. In this study, the temporal variations of co-polluted days in Tianjin were analyzed based on the observation data from 2017 to 2024. Two typical episodes were selected to investigate the meteorological influence and driving factors of co-pollution by using Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. The number of co-polluted days fell during 2018-2021 and rose to 35 days in 2024, which accounted for 45.5% of the total polluted days during the warm season in Tianjin. The MDA8 O3 on co-polluted days was higher than that on O3-single polluted days, highlighting the role of intensified atmospheric oxidation. Co-pollution is prone to occur on the days with high temperature and relative humidity, weak wind or sea-land circulation and temperature inversion. Two formation mechanisms of co-pollution in Tianjin were investigated. The O3-initiated co-pollution on June 27, 2020 was characterized by a rise in O3 firstly and a subsequent increase in PM2.5. Process analysis and source apportionment simulations revealed that aerosol chemistry was the main source of secondary inorganic aerosols, and local production was the largest regional source to MDA8 O3 in Tianjin, with an average contribution of 21.76%, suggesting that local chemical production under strong atmospheric oxidation is the primary driver of O3-initiated co-pollution. In contrast, the PM2.5-initiated co-pollution on April 8, 2022 began with elevated PM2.5, which was attributed to regional transport and accumulation caused by unfavorable meteorological conditions (sea-land breeze and temperature inversion). Subsequently, O3 increased as precursors transported from Shandong (25.57%) and other adjacent regions (23.56%). This study emphasized the importance of reducing atmospheric oxidation and regional collaboration for co-pollution prevention and control in northern coastal areas."

 This study investigates how sea-breeze fronts (SBFs) and gust fronts (GFs) influence the initiation, intensification, and evolution of convective cells, focusing on a series of “back-building” supercells that occurred in Shanghai on 5 July 2017. Multiple observational and modeling datasets were investigated, including weather radar, sounding data, wind profilers, and the cloud-resolving model CM1. Results indicate that the development of the SBF significantly modified the boundary-layer wind structure and enhanced low-level vertical wind shear. When superimposed with the strong outflow boundary of the supercell, this leads to a substantial increase in storm-relative helicity, affecting convective cell intensity, lifespan, and propagation—key factors in supercell formation and development. The study also identifies a potential mechanism for backward propagation: intensification of the SBF and GF created an unstable Kelvin-Helmholtz layer atop the cold pool, which is inferred to have excited gravity waves. These waves likely contributed to enhanced updrafts and thickening of the cold pool. Additionally, interaction between the cold pool and the ambient southwesterly jet produced a new low-level jet, further strengthening the updraft. These findings advance the understanding of the back-building supercell dynamics in eastern coastal China and provide valuable insights for nowcasting and early warning."

 The diurnal temperature range (DTR), defined as the difference between daily maximum and minimum temperatures, is a key indicator of diurnal climate variability and a sensitive measure of model performance. Since 1901, the observed global DTR has declined significantly, a trend previously underestimated by climate models. Here, we show that the latest model ensemble of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) simulates this decline more accurately than CMIP5. This improvement is primarily due to a stronger overall response to external forcings, particularly from greenhouse gases (GHG) and natural forcing (NAT), which leads to a multi-model mean trend much closer to observations. Furthermore, optimal fingerprinting analysis reveals a fundamental shift in attribution structure: while CMIP5 attributes the change almost solely to GHG, CMIP6 supports a more physically coherent, multi-forcing framework in which GHG remains dominant but statistically detectable contributions from NAT and anthropogenic aerosols (AER) emerge, collectively yielding a more realistic forcing synergy. CMIP6 also better captures the distinct regional DTR patterns driven by anthropogenic aerosols. A central reason for this enhanced forcing response is the higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) in CMIP6 models. Models with ECS values closer to observationally constrained estimates simulate a more substantial and consistent DTR decline. This link is likely due to improved cloud physics, which simultaneously elevates ECS and refines the surface solar radiation variations driving DTR. Therefore, CMIP6's superior performance stems from a more realistic physical basis rather than error compensation. These findings deepen the understanding of DTR changes and provide key insights for future climate model development."

 Clouds play a critical role in regulating the Earth's radiation budget and water cycle, and their microphysical properties (e.g., optical thickness, effective radius, and phase) are of great importance for understanding climate change and precipitation formation. In this study, a cloud detection and water cloud droplet size retrieval approach is proposed based on observations from the Polarization Multi-Angle Imager (PMAI) onboard China's new-generation polar-orbiting meteorological satellite FY-3G. Polarization characteristics from the shortwave infrared bands at 1030 nm, 1370 nm, and 1640 nm are utilized. Cloud masking and phase classification are performed through the combined use of multi-band reflectance and polarization ratios, whereas the effective radius of water clouds is retrieved from a lookup table (LUT) generated with the UNL-VRTM vector radiative transfer model. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach exhibits strong robustness under different surface conditions (ocean, forest–grassland, and desert). Compared with MODIS (MYD06) products, the overall cloud detection accuracy exceeds 70%, with recall rates higher than 80%. The recall rate for water cloud identification is generally above 85%, and the retrieved effective radius shows a Pearson correlation coefficient of approximately 0.6 with MODIS, validating the reliability and potential of the method.

 Methane (CH4) is the second most important anthropogenic greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Its vertical distribution is crucial in identifying emission sources and evaluating climate impacts. This study aims to retrieve atmospheric CH4 vertical profiles from the observations of the second-generation Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder (HIRAS-II) onboard the Fengyun-3F (FY-3F) satellite. Based on information entropy, the most sensitive spectral channels were selected, and a damped Newton algorithm was employed to retrieve the vertical distribution of CH₄ volume mixing ratios. The retrievals were validated against ground-based high-resolution spectroscopic observations from the Network for the Detection of Atmospheric Composition Change (NDACC). The comparison shows that the correlation coefficient of the column-averaged CH₄ concentrations within the 300–500 hPa layer exceeds 0.75, with relative deviations of less than ±3%. Taking the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) region as a representative area, the spatiotemporal variations in CH4 concentrations during 2024 were analyzed. The results demonstrate a distinct seasonal cycle and a spatial distribution pattern characteristic of anthropogenic emission sources. This study demonstrates that HIRAS-II can retrieve atmospheric CH4 vertical information, providing critical technical support for greenhouse gas monitoring via satellite remote sensing in China."

 Under the climatological background of increasing trend of sub-daily and hourly precipitation extremes over North China Plain (NCP) since 2000, sub-daily and hourly precipitation extremes have substantially increased in association with extraordinary persistent heavy rainfall events (PHREs) with record-breaking flash heavy rainfalls (FHRs). They attack the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei urban agglomeration and thus bring casualties, ecological environment damages, economic losses, and public sentiments due to the less accurate predictions for FHRs during PHREs. Based on long-term observational and reanalysis datasets, quantitative characteristics for precipitation, synoptic circulations, and thermodynamic environments are revealed for FHRs during PHREs under meridional and zonal synoptic patterns (MT and ZT). Precipitations exhibit significant differences over complex underlying surfaces. Compared to PHREs, fiercer FHRs over the plain subdomain are associated with stronger high-level atmospheric circulations, amplified low-level water vapor transports, and increased ascending motions compared to their climatological averages. During FHRs under MT, there is an extra water vapor channel. Spatial distributions of the six indices, i.e., CAPE, K index, SI, Δθe, RH, T-Td, in FHRs during 40 PHREs in the past 25 years are investigated in comparisons to their corresponding annual and event averages. It is found out that CAPE and KI present larger values over the plain subdomain. CAPE, SI, and Δθe all exhibit terrain-following features under both patterns with stronger magnitudes under MT, while the other three exhibit latitudinal contrasts with similar medians and more concentrated thresholds. Favorable thermodynamic indices and their thresholds with medians for FHRs are concluded in this study to provide quantitative scientific evidence for improving potential prediction skills for FHRs during PHREs at different geographic locations over NCP under two dominant synoptic patterns, and with varied intensities. What's more, the corresponding characteristics are quantitatively analyzed for three extremely severe PHREs in late July 2021, 2023, and 2025 as a comparison and application to the most recent events."

Emma Knowland,From column to surface: connecting the performance in simulating aerosol optical properties and PM2.5 concentrations in the NASA GEOSCCM,"We investigated a climate model's ability to simulate atmospheric aerosols focusing on the relationship between mass and optical properties, by comparing predictions with observations. Our analysis revealed that model errors in aerosol scattering primarily stem from inaccurate particle mass concentrations and relative humidity, rather than flawed optical property assumptions in the model. These findings point out improvements for enhancing the accuracy for aerosols representation in our model. 
 Aerosols are a key climate forcer and harmful to human health at the surface. Accurately modeling aerosol optical properties, mass loading and their relationship is important for constraining aerosol-climate forcing and characterizing particulate matter pollution exposure. We investigate the drivers of uncertainties in the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System Chemistry Climate Model (GEOSCCM) in simulating aerosols by focusing on the link between aerosol optical properties and mass. We compare a GEOSCCM hindcast with long-term coincident observations including satellite AOD measurements, speciated PM2.5 datasets from observations-model data fusion, and ground-based measurements of aerosol mass and optical properties. We analyze regional trends and seasonal variations of AOD and PM2.5, and surface aerosol properties, including relative humidity's role in hygroscopic enhancement. This work also presents the first extensive assessment of GEOSCCM's aerosol component with observational data. Our findings show that biases in PM2.5 components and relative humidity significantly impact simulated aerosol scattering at the surface, while scattering efficiency assumptions align with observations. This indicates that errors in simulated scattering relate more to simulated aerosol speciated mass and relative humidity than optical properties and size distribution assumptions in GEOSCCM. Our work highlights the importance of relative humidity biases on aerosol scattering enhancement for climate models where meteorology is not prescribed. Findings suggest improvements in GEOSCCM aerosols mass and optical properties could be achieved through updating emission inventories, especially over biomass burning regions, reducing nitrate biases, and improving relative humidity simulation."

This study derived a mixing state index from hygroscopicity and systematically investigated the covariation between the mixing state and CCN activity in inland and coastal air. We propose a practical approach for estimating critical diameter from mixing state index, applicable when the aerosol particles are not highly aged. 
 Simplified assumptions of aerosol mixing states in modeling often introduce substantial uncertainties in estimating cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations (NCCN) and their climatic impacts. This study systematically investigates the contrasting relationships between mixing states and CCN activity by combining field measurements of hygroscopicity with the algorithm of entropy at two inland and coastal sites. We show distinct seasonal variations of mixing state. In winter, externally-mixed particles dominated both sites, with comparable mixing state indices (χ) of 0.38 ± 0.12 and 0.39 ± 0.09 respectively for coastal and inland air. However, measurements in summer showed pronounced differences: aerosols in the coastal atmosphere exhibited a higher degree of internal mixing (χ=0.69 ± 0.19), whereas inland χ values only increased moderately to 0.47 ± 0.12. Aerosol mixing state is largely influenced by primary emissions and secondary formation process. Externally-mixed particles originate chiefly from anthropogenic emissions in inland or sea salt in coastal. With the aging process, particles become more internally-mixed as the enhanced fraction of more-hygroscopic mode. Both environments show the negative correlations between the critical diameter (Dcri) and χ but with distinct decrement rates for coastal vs. inland aerosols. Specially, Dcri exhibits heightened sensitivity to fluctuations in χ when χ<0.5. This offers a practical approach to estimate Dcri from χ when the particles are not highly aged. Further analysis reveals that NCCN exhibits heightened sensitivity to fluctuations in χ at low values. These results underscore that mixing states exert different control over NCCN in diverse environments and provide critical constraints for parameterizing fine aerosols CCN activity in models."

Shupe;Corinna Hoose;Matthias Tesche,Occurrence of seeding multi-layer clouds in the Arctic from ground-based observations,"We quantify the occurrence of single- and multi-layer clouds in the Arctic based on combining soundings with cloud-radar observations. We also assess the rate of ice-crystal seeding in multi-layer cloud systems as this is an important initiator of glaciation in super-cooled liquid cloud layers. We find an abundance of multi-layer clouds in the Arctic with seeding in about half to two thirds of cases in which the gap between upper and lower layers ranges between 100 and 1000 m. 
 Studies of Arctic clouds often focus on low-level single-layer clouds (SLCs). Here, we use combined observations of soundings and cloud radar during the MOSAiC, ACSE, and AO2018 research cruises as well as from long-term observations at Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard and Utqiagvik, Alaska to investigate the occurrence of SLCs and multi-layer clouds (MLCs) in the Arctic and to assess the rate of ice-crystal seeding in cold MLCs. MOSAiC observations show cloudy conditions in between 70 % and 90 % of sounding-radar cases. SLCs show occurrence rates of 30 % to 40 % with the highest value of 45 % during October. Cold MLCs are most abundant from November to June (40 % to 55 % of cases). Seeding occurs in about half to two thirds of the identified cold MLCs during MOSAiC for which the sub-saturated layer extends between 100 and 1000 m. The seeding rate increases by as much as 20 percentage points as the assumed size of the falling ice crystals is increased from 100 to 400 µm. The observations reveal a stable rate of cloud-free conditions of around 20 % over the covered latitude range. Cloud occurrence during MOSAiC and at Ny-Ålesund in July, when the geographical distance between observations was minimal, shows reasonable agreement. Comparisons of MOSAiC and other research cruises to the central Arctic also indicate consistent occurrence rates of different cloud types despite the likely effect of year-to-year variability. The comparison of data from ship campaigns and land sites suggests that the latter are not necessarily a good indicator of cloud occurrence in the high Arctic."

We found that non-dust emissions from ships and land-based activities contribute the majority of soluble iron capable of enhancing marine primary productivity, with particularly pronounced contributions in coastal regions and during the summer season. These findings provide improved insight into the influence of human activities on oceanic nutrient supply. 
 Non-dust emissions have been increasingly recognized as important contributors to atmospheric iron (Fe), influencing marine productivity through enhanced bioavailable Fe inputs. However, accurately quantifying the contributions and spatiotemporal variability of non-dust sources remains challenging due to relatively low time-resolution of traditional filter-based analytical methods. In this study, the contributions of non-dust emissions to atmospheric total and soluble Fe in the Northwest Pacific were quantified based on online measurements from three ship-based observation campaigns in 2021–2022. A Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) model was applied for source apportionment. Results showed non-dust emissions were notable contributors to atmospheric total Fe, representing 24 %–41 % of total Fe in PM10 and 30 %–56 % in PM2.5 samples across different cruise legs. Importantly, their contributions to soluble Fe were significantly higher, reaching 88 %–97 % in PM10 and 85 %–98 % in PM2.5 samples. Among non-dust sources, land anthropogenic emissions contributed substantially to both total and soluble Fe, whereas ship emission contributed a small portion to total Fe but was a major source of soluble Fe, particularly in summer, when its contribution reached 79 % of soluble Fe in PM10 samples in coastal regions. Additionally, Fe from non-dust sources exhibited stronger spatial variability than dust source. The concentrations of land anthropogenic Fe differed by 3–5 times between coastal and open-ocean areas during the same cruises, while ship-derived Fe varied by an order of magnitude or more. This study offers critical observational evidence to advance understanding of how diverse emission sources shape atmospheric composition in Asian continental outflow regions."

Using a weather prediction model, we simulate clouds in the Arctic during a month. The model is evaluated against observations collected during the ship campaign MOSAiC (Multidisciplinary Drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate). We find that multilayer clouds frequently occur in the region, in fact, they dominate the cloud occurrence. The study highlights the importance of representing these clouds in simulations over the Arctic. 
 Multilayer clouds (MLCs) are common in the Arctic. With a limited-area setup and 2.5 km horizontal grid spacing, 32 ICON simulations from 22 August to 23 September 2020 were analysed to examine the MLC abundance and characteristics across the Arctic. The model was evaluated against observations from the MOSAiC campaign. An immersion freezing parameterisation was developed to capture the local ice-nucleating particle concentration, increasing the cloud ice number concentration by up to 16 % at temperatures above −12 °C. Overall, the model captured most cloudy events with a dry (moist) bias at lower (higher) altitudes. Simulated water paths were underestimated, roughly 3-fold for liquid water and 100-fold for frozen hydrometeors.A 35 %–65 % MLC occurrence, smoothly distributed across the Arctic region, was simulated. Modelled MOSAiC occurrence frequencies span 42 %–76 %, compared to an observed 32 %–59 %. While large differences in the total MLC occurrence are found, two-layered systems occur with a systematic frequency of about 22 %. The sub-saturated layer between cloud layers is typically < 1 km, indicating a high likelihood of the seeder-feeder mechanism (up to 52 %), consistent with observations."

The results show that lactic acid sulfate enhances particle cluster stability and promotes new particle formation, particularly in forested and agricultural regions. These findings highlight the important role of organic compounds like lactic acid sulfate in particle formation, offering insights for mitigating haze and health risks. 
 Organosulfates (OSs) are key components of atmospheric aerosols and serve as tracers for secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation. Among these, lactic acid sulfate (LAS) has been increasingly detected in the atmosphere. However, its molecular formation pathways and its role in new particle formation (NPF) remain poorly understood. In this work, we investigate the gas-phase formation mechanism of LAS via the reaction between lactic acid (LA) and SO3, and assess its impact on sulfuric acid-ammonia (SA-A) driven NPF using quantum chemical calculations and Atmospheric Cluster Dynamics Code (ACDC) kinetic modeling. Our results show that SA and H2O significantly catalyze the LA-SO3 reaction, enhancing the effective rate coefficient by 7–10 orders of magnitude within the temperature range of 280–320 K. Further molecular-level analysis using the ACDC reveals that LAS not only significantly enhances the clustering stability of SA and A up to 108-fold, but also plays a significant and direct role in SA-A nucleation under conditions typical of forested and agricultural regions. Notably, LAS-SA-A clusters contribute to 97 % of the overall cluster formation pathways in regions with high LAS concentrations like Centreville, Alabama. Additionally, our findings show that the nucleation potential of LAS-SA-A clusters is stronger than that of LA-SA-A clusters, aligning with field observations, even though LAS concentrations are typically three orders of magnitude lower than LA. These findings imply that OSs formed through SO3 consumption may significantly contribute to the enhanced NPF rates observed in continental regions."

Kurup;Caroline Poulsen;Steven T. Siems;Daniel J. V. Robbins,Validation and comparison of cloud properties retrieved from passive satellites over the Southern Ocean,"Southern Ocean (SO) clouds are crucial in defining the Earth's radiation budget. They are primarily observed by satellites, due to a lack of surface observations. This study validated cloud top height and cloud mask and compared the microphysics products from 3 satellite cloud datasets over the SO. The study revealed significant differences in cloud property retrievals between the sensors. Multilayer clouds play a major role in the differences when validated with active satellite measurements. 
 The clouds over the Southern Ocean (SO) play a vital role in defining the Earth's energy budget. The cloud properties over the SO are known to be different from their Northern Hemisphere counterparts. As a result, monitoring cloud properties over the SO, including macro- and microphysical properties, is of particular interest.We compared the Level 3 products from AVHRR CMSAF, MODIS, and CALIOP for cloud top height, cloud fraction, and cloud liquid fraction. The study found that MODIS underestimated cloud top heights, while AVHRR CMSAF overestimates them when compared to Level 3 CALIOP. The overall cloud cover for MODIS was less than that of CALIOP while AVHRR CMSAF showed higher cloud cover over mid-latitudes and lower cloud cover over land in the Level 3 product. The comparison of cloud fraction for liquid clouds against CALIOP indicates that AVHRR CMSAF tends to overestimate, whereas MODIS tends to underestimate the liquid cloud fraction. The magnitude of the difference varies with the latitude and season.Following the Level 3 analysis, we investigated three passive remote sensing satellite datasets, MODIS Collection 6.1, AVHRR CMSAF CLARA-A3, and AVHRR PATMOS-x, over the SO. We validated the Level 2 cloud mask, the cloud top height, and the cloud phase for 2015 retrieved from the passive sensors with active CloudSat-CALIOP sensors. We compared the effective radius and cloud optical depth amongst the three passive sensor datasets.This research found that there are substantial uncertainties in the cloud top height, the cloud optical depth, and the cloud thermodynamic phase, over the SO. The extent of which varies depending on the cloud property and retrieval algorithm used. The cloud mask comparison revealed varying levels of agreement between passive and active sensor observations, with a Kuiper Skill Score (KSS) of 0.71 (AVHRR CMSAF), 0.70 (MODIS), and 0.43 (AVHRR PATMOS-x). In the comparison of cloud top height, a mean absolute bias of 0.65 km (AVHRR CMSAF), 1.03 km (MODIS), and 1.27 km (AVHRR PATMOS-x) was observed for single-layer cloud scenes cases. This mean absolute bias increased to 1.87 km (AVHRR CMSAF), 3.25 km (MODIS), and 3.30 km (AVHRR PATMOS-x) for the multilayered cloud scenes. In the comparison of cloud effective radius, it was observed that the disagreement between the passive sensors was more significant in the presence of multilayer clouds. The effective radius disagreement was higher for ice clouds. Variations in ice habit assumptions, lookup table configurations, and phase classification schemes could contribute to these differences. We found that the presence of sea ice strongly influences the retrieval of cloud optical depth at high latitudes, with most passive optical depths higher over sea ice than over ocean. The new finding that contradicts previous studies may result from the difficulty of retrieving cloud optical depth over ice using the retrieval algorithms."

Through comparison and cross-validation with other data sources, this dataset has been proven to have significant advantages in accuracy and applicability. 
 Ecosystem services are the various benefits provided by ecosystems to humans, establishing a crucial link between the natural environment and human well-being. High-resolution ecosystem service datasets can provide more detailed and accurate information, enabling the identification of site-specific differences at local scales. In this study, we produced a high spatial resolution dataset of ecosystem services in China for the years 2000, 2010, and 2020, simulated using ecological process models. Model parameters were calibrated based on literature summaries, ground monitoring data, and reconstructed remote sensing data. The dataset, with a spatial resolution of 30 m, includes net primary productivity, soil conservation, sandstorm prevention, and water yield. The validation results show high consistency between this ecosystem services dataset and both in situ observations and existing datasets.

Our Structural Evolution Indicator distinguishes real change from temporary planting, revealing that agricultural expansion is driven by Global South countries while the Global North remains stable. This work provides a vital baseline for monitoring food security and environmental sustainability. 
 Accurate quantification of the structural evolution of global agricultural systems is critical for assessing food security and monitoring planetary boundaries. However, current agricultural monitoring is hindered by a baseline that reflects the continuous, annual nature of agricultural management and distinguishes active cultivation cycles from permanent structural changes. Existing products typically rely on fragmented snapshots, multi-year aggregation, or generalized and inconsistent definitions (introducing systematic bias and noise into trend analysis). To bridge this gap, we generated the first Global 30-m Annual Cropland Extent Dynamics (GACED30) dataset (2000–2024). Our continuous mapping framework integrates the gap-free SDC30 to capture the intra-annual phenological transitions distinctive of active cultivation, employs a spectral-semantic sample alignment strategy to resolve the inconsistencies across different cropland sample sets, and applies a rule-based processing to mitigate the spectral ambiguity between active fallow and natural bareland. Furthermore, we derived grid-based Structural Evolution Indicators via continuous statistical trend analysis, utilizing the full 25-year time-series density to rigorously quantify expansion and abandonment trajectories. Comprehensive assessment demonstrates the reliability of GACED30, which achieves a high overall accuracy of 96.5 % and significantly outperforms existing global products (e.g., GLAD Cropland, ESA World Cover and GLC_FCS30D) in capturing temporal stability. Crucially, GACED30 exhibits strong agreement with FAO national statistics, achieving a high correlation in cropland area (R2:0.95) and an 81.1 % consistency in production trends. Based on this consistent baseline, we analyzed the structural evolution of global agriculture, estimating the 2024 cropland area at 1488.5 Mha with a net change rate of 1.2 Mha/year. Our trend analysis reveals a distinct global divergence: structural expansion is heavily concentrated in the Global South (e.g., Africa and South America), driven by commodity frontiers, whereas the Global North is characterized by widespread stability or policy-driven contraction. GACED30 thus provides a reliable evidence base for monitoring the changing footprint of global agriculture. The dataset is publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18199675 (Chen et al., 2025)."

Addressing the long runtimes and input/output limitations of previous approaches, our agent model accurately reproduces simulations of fine particulate matter and ozone, enabling rapid air quality assessment. 
 Efficient and informative air quality modeling in future emission scenarios is vital for effective formulation of emission reduction policies. Traditional chemical transport models (CTMs) struggle with the computational demands required for timely predictions. While advanced emulator techniques greatly accelerate CTM simulating process, they fall short in providing comprehensive estimates of future air quality due to their limited model structure. Additionally, these emulators often have difficulty simultaneously accounting for varying emission variables and the effects of regional transport, which limits their applicability and undermines prediction accuracy. In this study, an informative future air quality prediction model “TGEOS v1.0” based on the Transformer framework is developed as an efficient agent model of GEOS-Chem v14.2.2. TGEOS is able to efficiently estimate key statistical indicators of PM2.5 and O3 concentrations under future emission scenarios and capture potential extreme pollution events, with approximately 2.51 s to execute one-year estimation. The model incorporates sectoral emissions of up to 26 distinct species as well as the impacts of regional emissions and meteorology on pollutant concentrations, enhancing its versatility and predictive accuracy. The spatial and probability distributions predicted by TGEOS are in good agreement with GEOS-Chem, with the correlation coefficients for PM2.5 and O3 exceed 0.98 in high-pollution months. Compared with other machine learning models, TGEOS based on Transformer framework showcases superior performance, underscoring the potential of the Transformer framework in air quality modeling."

We developed a point-object-detection-based deep learning method for fast, automated detection and quantification of these sources. The model was trained on a large synthetic dataset and tested for generalization using two independent datasets, including simulations and satellite observations. 
 Point sources account for a large portion of anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Timely detection, localization, and quantification of these emissions are critical for supporting carbon neutrality efforts. Spaceborne monitoring satellites can provide essential concentration data for identifying point sources. However, existing methods often require human intervention and typically detect plume masks instead of source locations, limiting their utility for regulatory applications. In this study, we present GHGPSE-Net, a deep learning method for greenhouse gas point source extraction. GHGPSE-Net simultaneously performs detection, localization, and quantification of emissions, eliminating the need for traditional segmentation steps. To train and evaluate the model, we construct synthetic datasets using an atmospheric transport model and validate its accuracy against radiosonde profiles and satellite observations. GHGPSE-Net demonstrates desirable performance in the simulation data across detection (F1-score of 0.96), subpixel-level localization and quantification (Pearson's correlation of 0.99, root mean square error of 89.9 tCO2 h−1), tested on ideal instrument of 0.5 km × 0.5 km resolution with retrieval noise of 1.5 parts per million (ppm). The results also demonstrate considerable generalization of the proposed model when tested using two independent datasets. On the identified sources from OCO-3 spaceborne observations, GHGPSE-Net achieves a detection precision of 0.89, localization accuracy of 3.02 km, and a Pearson's R of 0.59 for quantification. The proposed method and datasets provide a valuable foundation for future research towards rapid and automated GHG point source extraction, offering critical data to support swift responses to abnormal emission events."

However, most previous studies rely on the assumption of a constant impact of PM2.5 over time, despite emerging evidence on the time-variant nature of PM2.5-associated health effects. This study aims to assess the temporal changes in the association between PM2.5 and its components and the risk of ischemic stroke. We employed the case-crossover design and included 1,625,763 participants from the Chinese Stroke Center Alliance (CSCA) program. Conditional logistic models were used to estimate the acute effect of PM2.5 and its components on the ischemic stroke onset. Temporal changes in PM2.5 and its components were evaluated across two periods (2015–2017 and 2018–2022) and annually. A 10 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 at lag 0 day demonstrated a stronger association with ischemic stroke during Period 1 (percent change in risk: 0.54% [0.42 to 0.65%]) compared to Period 2 (0.29% [0.19 to 0.38%]), indicating a significant decline of −0.25% (−0.40 to −0.10%). This decreasing trend was consistent across five PM2.5 components, particularly for black carbon (BC), which exhibited the largest reduction (−4.47% [−7.47, −1.38%]). Nonlinear exposure-response curves for PM2.5 and its components also exhibited a steeper trend in Period 1. By integrating individual ischemic stroke onset data from over 2,600 hospitals across China, our study demonstrates a declining trend in the health effects of PM2.5 and its chemical components on ischemic stroke onset. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for temporal variations in PM2.5-related health effects when estimating disease burden, designing and evaluating air pollution control policies, and informing public health decision-making."

Controlling nitrogen oxide emissions from coal-biomass cocombustion is an urgent challenge. This study develops a novel standalone Chemical Reactor Network (CRN) model to mechanistically elucidate the distinct nitrogen transformation pathways in cocombustion environments. This work reveals an enhanced bidirectional NO–N2O interconversion in the dilute phase, mediated through both direct NCO/NH radical routes and indirect pathways involving NO2 intermediates. The key distinction arises from biomass-volatile induced pathway switching: biomass-derived HCN significantly elevates NCO radical pools, establishing parallel NO-to-N2O conversion channels that create the characteristic emission profile of simultaneous NO reduction and N2O accumulation. Temperature exerts precise regulation, with NO–N2O conversion showing unidirectional characteristics in specific ranges, where higher temperatures promote NO formation via enhanced CH3 radical chemistry. Furthermore, the proposed biomass-coal balancing theory reveals that moderate blending ratios favor HCN → N2O conversion, reducing NO emissions, while excessive biomass shifts equilibrium toward HCN → NO pathways. This threshold behavior provides a theoretical foundation for targeted NOx control in multifuel combustion systems."

Although atmospheric INP derive from terrestrial, freshwater, and marine environments, their specific sources and microbial producers remain largely unresolved, especially in the rapidly warming Arctic. Here, we examine terrestrial runoff as a driver of INP enrichment during summer in Young Sound fjord, Northeast Greenland. INP concentrations active at −10 °C were significantly elevated in the sea-surface microlayer (SML) and at river outlets relative to underlying seawater, correlating negatively with salinity and distance from freshwater input, highlighting terrestrial runoff as a dominant source of warm-temperature INP. We identify a novel runoff-driven mechanism of SML formation in Arctic coastal waters, whereby terrestrial particles and compounds are transported downstream and selectively accumulate at the air–water interface likely due to their surface-active properties combined with limited seawater mixing driven by salinity gradients. Biological INP were also observed in the atmosphere (1.3–25.3 INP–10 m–3), with sequencing data suggesting terrestrial origins. Our findings demonstrate that terrestrial ecosystems strongly enrich the coastal SML with biological INP, constraining the pool of potential atmospheric INP sources and underscore Arctic coastal interfaces as key regions for cloud-relevant processes under ongoing climate change."

However, the critical role of ambient water in mediating such multiphase reactions on leaf surfaces has often been overlooked. Here, using isotopic tracing techniques, we demonstrate that reactive oxygen species generated in the leaf surface condensate can mediate the oxidation of urea adsorbed on leaves, leading to the formation of nitrite (NO2–). This phenomenon is widespread across various leafy vegetables. At 5 °C and an 80% relative humidity (RH), condensate-mediated oxidation of residual urea on leaf surfaces resulted in NO2– accumulation exceeding the food limit standard. Hydroxyl radicals (•OH), amino radicals (•NH2), and nitric oxide radicals (•NO) were produced during water vapor condensation, collectively driving the conversion from urea to NO2–. Density functional theory calculations verified that radical-mediated transformation occurs spontaneously. Further studies indicate that controlling urea residues on vegetable leaves below 60 ppm and maintaining RH in cold storage below 60% can effectively suppress NO2– formation. Our results demonstrate that water vapor condensation on leaf surfaces can influence the oxidation of organic compounds adsorbed by leaves, providing new insights into the environmental transformation of organic pollutants on plant surfaces."

In this study, the liquid chromatography–photodiode array–high-resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC–PDA–HRMS) method was applied to resolve the molecular fingerprints of BrC emitted from biomass burning and coal combustion. The mass absorption efficiency (MAE) of biomass-derived BrC was consistently higher  than that of coal-derived BrC over the range of 300–500 nm, reflecting  distinct source-dependent chromophoric compositions. A total of 29 chromophores (3.3–4.2 g kg–1) identified in biomass burning explained 35.4–50.3% of the total BrC light absorption, while 20 chromophores (0.4 g kg–1) from coal combustion accounted for 37.0%. Biomass-derived BrC was dominated by lignin pyrolysis products, stilbenes, coumarins, and flavonoids, while coal-derived BrC contained more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and N/O-containing aromatics. Nitrophenols, such as methoxy nitrocatechol and 4-nitro-3-vinylsyringol, were detected in flaming emissions but absent in smoldering, serving as distinct molecular tracers for combustion conditions of biomass burning.

Despite extensive research on individual pollutants, a comprehensive risk assessment of lubricating oil aerosol mixtures remains limited. This study integrated in vitro cytotoxicity experiments with respiratory deposition modeling to assess health risks of aviation lubricating oil aerosols. Human lung epithelial cells (A549) were exposed to lubricating oil and major components to establish dose–response relationships and elucidate toxicity mechanisms through cell viability, reactive oxygen species (ROS) detection, inflammatory responses, and apoptosis. The multiple-particle-dosimetry (MPPD) model was employed to simulate aerosol deposition patterns across different respiratory regions under three different exposure scenarios. In vitro experiments revealed distinct cytotoxicity profiles among lubricating oil components, with tricresyl phosphate (TCP) showing the strongest toxicity (lowest observed effective concentration, LOEC = 20 μM), followed by N-phenyl-1-naphthylamine (PAN) (80 μM) and tributyl phosphate (TBP) (100 μM), while base stock demonstrated excellent biostability. Actual aviation lubricating oil exhibited a cytotoxicity threshold at 300 μM. MPPD simulations revealed time-dependent deposition patterns: short-term exposure favored tracheobronchial retention, while long-term exposure resulted in preferential alveolar accumulation. Risk assessment using hazard quotients (HQs) showed all exposure scenarios yielded values well below 1.0. Without adjustment of uncertainty factors, the highest HQ was 8.7 × 10–4; even with the uncertainty factors of 300, the highest HQadj reached only 2.6 × 10–1 under 25-year high-end exposure conditions, indicative of acceptable health risks. This combined study provides quantitative evidence that aircraft cabin environments complying with the WHO 24 h and annual air quality guideline values present manageable health risks."

To investigate the solar activity dependence of the dayside lunar surface potential in the terrestrial magnetotail, we compared long‐term observations of lunar surface photoelectrons with numerical calculations of photo‐emitted electron energy spectra. The comparison demonstrates that the observed solar activity dependence of lunar photoelectrons is well reproduced by the model. The current balance surface potential based on this model predicts more positive potentials for higher solar activities, possibly exceeding +100V ${+}100\ \mathrm{V}$ in the magnetotail lobes during solar flares. These results highlight the importance of evaluating the lunar electrostatic environment under various conditions, including extreme solar events."

We introduce FURECast, a deep learning model that not only leverages three‐dimensional structure of polarimetric radar variables (ZH, ZDR, KDP) but also embeds their intrinsic self‐consistency relation as a physical constraint. The model employs an encoder‐translator‐decoder architecture, integrating multi‐level inputs via late fusion and evolving features through cascaded multiscale blocks. Moreover, a novel physical loss term is introduced to enforce microphysical consistency during training. Evaluated on S‐band (GD‐SPOL) and C‐band (NJU‐CPOL) radar data sets, FURECast achieves a 14.1% improvement in 90‐min critical success index (35 dBZ threshold) over the 2D reflectivity‐only baseline, while reducing physical inconsistency by two orders of magnitude.

Results show that Chinese lakes exert substantial cooling on summer daytime maximum temperatures, with a mean extent of 27.5 km, a magnitude of 1.03°C, and an efficiency of 0.46°C/10 km. LCC efficiency shows spatially asymmetric trends, intensifying on the Tibetan Plateau but weakening in the eastern plains. Random forests analysis reveals that albedo is the dominant driver of temporal variability, while depth and surrounding topography are the primary spatial controls. These findings underscore the critical role of lakes in mitigating regional heat extremes and highlight the necessity of incorporating lake‐climate feedback into climate adaptation."

Results indicate that for 1‐hr interval (typical sampling interval of mooring observations), both the coherent and incoherent characteristics of semidiurnal ITs exhibit convergence with increasing duration.

These platforms measured key atmospheric and oceanic parameters, including wind speed, temperature, and humidity, to quantify air‐sea fluxes and characterize the atmospheric boundary layer and upper ocean. This study is the first to leverage these observations to evaluate the background ensemble at the air‐sea interface from a self‐cycled Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System data assimilation (DA) system. Verification against observations demonstrated that the background deterministic forecast captures key spatial and temporal variability of surface air temperature (SAT), humidity, wind speed, and sea surface temperature (SST), although systematic biases in humidity and SST were identified due to a combination of model and initialization errors. Evaluation of the 6‐hr background ensemble showed skillful spread for SAT, humidity, and wind speed relative to the forecast error variance. In contrast, the SST ensemble spread was markedly underestimated and inversely related to forecast error variance, emphasizing the need for sampling the oceanic state uncertainty. For longer background forecasts, temporal cross‐correlation of SST with SAT and surface wind speed revealed physically coherent time‐lagged relationships, with atmospheric changes preceding SST responses by approximately 24–36 hr. Similar correlations were preserved in ensemble perturbations, reflecting the ability of the background ensemble in maintaining the dynamic consistency across the coupled interface. These findings provide insights into improving the coupled background ensemble covariances, paving the way for the development of strongly coupled ocean‐atmosphere DA for hurricane forecasting."

Midlatitude tropopause‐overshooting convection is especially important to climate because it can enhance stratospheric water vapor, which has its greatest radiative forcing sensitivity in the extratropical lower stratosphere. Thus, it is essential to understand what factors influence the strength and prevalence of overshooting storms and associated STE. The U.S. Dynamics and Chemistry of the Summer Stratosphere (DCOTSS) field campaign during 2021 and 2022 was the first large‐scale airborne primarily focused on sampling stratospheric impacts from overshooting convection. Our research utilizes the extensive DCOTSS data set in combination with radar, satellite, and environmental observations to investigate relationships between observed stratosphere composition change and storm and environmental characteristics. Our results demonstrate greater magnitudes of STE for above‐anvil cirrus plume (AACP)‐producing storms and mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). In addition, the most extreme enhancements in water vapor and other tropospheric gases occur where the tropopause height is low and the depth of overshooting is high, especially for AACP‐producing storms. We also investigate the impact of storm and environmental characteristics on pathways for hydration (air mass transport and mixing vs. ice sublimation), finding that they also modulate the frequencies of each process at different altitudes. Namely, mixing is found to be most prevalent in AACP‐producing storms and MCSs, which can help explain transport differences between water vapor and other gases."

While their horizontal size distribution (HSD) generally follows a power‐law, it consistently displays a distinct scale break. Such an HSD pattern of cumulus clouds has been extensively reported, but the underlying mechanism is so far unclear. This study explores it by analyzing cumulus cloud samples generated by the large eddy simulations. By taking into account the evolution processes of individual clouds as well as their precursor bubbles, that is, a compact entity of updrafts originating from the surface layer, we identified a critical linkage between cloud lifecycle and the emergence of scale break. For the two categories of cumulus clouds (active and forced) that are divided into two life stages (growing and decaying), the scale break was found to appear only in decaying active ones. The HSD of decaying forced clouds and that of growing ones exactly satisfy a power‐law, consistent with their precursor bubbles. The initial HSD of young bubbles undergoes modification through the temporal size evolution of clouds near their maximum horizontal cross‐sectional area layer (maximum area layer), thus shaping the HSD of cumulus clouds. During the decaying stage, active clouds experiences non‐monotonic variation of the averaged vertical velocity, slowing their size down as they traverse the level of neutral buoyancy. The medium‐size snapshot cloud samples increasing in this way causes a scale break in the statistics, suggesting that the scale break is essentially an emergent property of cumulus cloud dynamics."

A Spatiotemporal Analysis of China's 89 Shrinking Cities (2001–2019),"Numerous studies have examined how urban expansion exacerbates Surface Urban Heat Island intensity (SUHII), yet limited attention has been paid to whether and how urban shrinkage mitigates SUHII. This study employed multiple models to analyze the spatiotemporal evolution of surface urban heat island (SUHI) and its driving factors in 89 shrinking cities in China from 2001 to 2019 across interannual, seasonal, and diurnal scales. The results show that (a) From 2001 to 2019, the average SUHII of shrinking cities in China experienced a slight overall decrease, falling by 0.150 K during the daytime and 0.128 K at nighttime. However, at the individual city level, the dominant change types were non‐significant decrease and non‐significant increase. (b) During the daytime and nighttime, 66.292% and 57.303% of shrinking cities, respectively, exhibited declining SUHII trends, with pronounced differences across climate zones. Shrinking cities located in the North Subtropical climate zone showed the most significant magnitude of SUHII reduction. (c) The driving mechanisms of SUHII in shrinking cities revealed pronounced diurnal asymmetry and climate zone dependence. Daytime SUHII was primarily driven by meteorological factors such as relative humidity, sunshine duration, and surface pressure, whereas nighttime SUHII reflected the combined effects of both meteorological and anthropogenic factors. Moreover, the cooling effect associated with population loss partially offset the enhancement of SUHII caused by urban expansion. This study provides new empirical evidence for understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics and driving mechanisms of SUHI in shrinking cities."

 The giant impact hypothesis, generally considered as the origin of the Moon, predicts a dry Moon lacking volatile elements, but in situ observations provide evidence that volatile elements such as carbon, nitrogen and oxygen are stored on the lunar surface and are being supplied to its exosphere. Such volatile sources and dynamics remain poorly understood. Here we investigate the chemical composition and time variations in the lunar exosphere using an ion mass analyser onboard the Kaguya satellite. We reported sporadic changes in the C+/O+ ratio occurring immediately after meteoroid showers. We also observed daily variations in the C+/O+ and N+/O+ ion ratios, suggesting two possible sources: a nitrogen-rich reservoir with a higher N/C ratio than the solar value or N-free CO/CO2 gases. Our findings indicate that the mechanism for the production of C+, N+ and O+ ions during the daytime is solar wind sputtering—ejection through collision with solar wind particles—of the nitrogen-rich reservoir, whereas micrometeoroid impacts and photoionization are not dominant processes. We propose that the nitrogen-rich regolith reported in Apollo samples and indigenous volcanic gases constitute the source of volatile ions in a thin lunar atmosphere.

 To unlock the potential of high-resolution nighttime light (NTL) data, robust compositing methods are required. We present an automatic and scalable method for high-resolution NTL data compositing, demonstrated using SDGSAT-1 data. It operates at the pixel level by ranking structural image features across a temporal stack and selecting the observation acquired under the most favourable conditions. Unlike workflows that rely on external cloud masks and physical atmospheric correction models, it uses only internal image characteristics and stationarity metrics to mitigate contamination from clouds, haze, moonlight reflection, and sensor artefacts. The resulting composites show strong agreement with established, annual VIIRS products used as independent external benchmarks (correlation up to 0.95, R2 consistently >0.80), while retaining a spatially crisper signal than VIIRS at a common aggregated scale (e.g. 800 m). The method also improves SDGSAT-1 usability by suppressing acquisition-dependent artefacts, including scene anomalies and inter-band RGB misregistration, and by improving spatial alignment: mean positional error is reduced from >340 m in the input data to 19.2 m in the composite. Internal geometric consistency improves markedly, with mean inter-band RGB misregistration decreasing from 47.6 m to 3.6 m. The workflow also introduces a taxonomy combining NTL brightness, temporal stationarity, and built-up area presence. For the Po Plain (Italy), the stationary NTL domain covers ∼10% of the area yet contains ∼60% of total light emissions; within it, 73.6% originate from built-up areas and 26.4% from non-built-up infrastructure (e.g. lit roads). Overall, the method supports integration of SDGSAT-1 data into global monitoring frameworks."

 Gas flaring (GF), a significant source of greenhouse gases, poses a challenge to satellite monitoring due to the trade-off between the low spatial resolution of nighttime observations and the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of daytime data. This limitation results in notable omissions in global flare inventories, particularly for small-scale, intermittent, or clustered offshore flares. To address this, we introduce a Day-Night Synergistic Gas Flaring Detection (DNSGFD) framework, leveraging the synchronous, multi-sensor capabilities of the Sustainable Development Science Satellite 1 (SDGSAT-1). The framework's core strategy, “nighttime discovery and daytime confirmation,” is uniquely enabled by our proposed Glimmer-enhanced Flare Disturbance Index (GFDI), which fuses thermal, glimmer, and chromatic information from a single nighttime pass to pinpoint high-confidence candidates. Applied to the Southeast Asian Seas, our framework identified 317 offshore gas flaring platforms (GFPs) with an overall accuracy of 96.6%. Cross-validation against benchmark datasets underscores its superior performance: DNSGFD successfully identified 96.9% of the platforms listed in the DAFI v2 inventory, detected 169 GFPs unresolved by the VIIRS Nightfire product, and cataloged 193 previously unrecorded sites. By systematically integrating the high SNR of nighttime sensing with the fine spatial detail of daytime imaging, our methodology establishes a more complete, accurate, and physically robust foundation for global flare inventories."

 New satellites are needed to quantify the upwards of 170 trillion microplastic particles floating on the ocean surface that concentrate in the convergence zones of the ocean gyres. Past research on cleaned microplastic pieces harvested from the ocean gyres indicates a highly consistent endmember across the spectrum with distinct absorption features at 931, 1215, 1417, 1732 and 2313 nm. Here, surface-floating microplastic pieces with natural biofilm were collected at 21 stations across 4700 km of the North Pacific gyre convergence zone, also referred to as the “Great Pacific Garbage Patch,” to assess the impact of biofilm on spectral properties. Reflectance of damp, biofilmed microplastic pieces were measured in bulk from 350 to 2500 nm shortly after collection with ambient sunlight on the ship deck and the biofilm was separated and stored for DNA sequencing. Biofilm was found on all collected samples and the red algal genus Tsunamia alone accounted for ∼53% of the eukaryotic microbiome of the harvested biofilm. Biofilm absorbed light broadly across blue wavelengths (400–500 nm) and in a narrowband at 674 nm consistent with chlorophyll-a and other photosynthetic pigments in red algae. Hence, biofilm could impact ocean color chlorophyll-a and fluorescence line height retrievals if particle concentrations were high enough. No significant differences were found in band-depths estimated at 1215 and 1732 nm and only minor differences at 931 nm between biofilmed and biofilm-removed samples. This new endmember of damp, biofilmed microplastic most closely resembles the spectral properties of microplastic pieces as they naturally occur in the ocean gyres. New sensors for marine debris detection may consider narrow bands between 670 and 680 nm to discriminate red algal biofilmed microplastic from phytoplankton, in addition to the NIR and SWIR bands characteristic of floating marine microplastics."

 We introduce a fully automated and scalable method for mapping surface water extents from single-acquisition Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imagery. This approach integrates adaptive thresholding of radiometric terrain-corrected SAR backscatter data, fuzzy-logic classification, region growing, dark land estimation, and a bimodality test to minimize false positives in low-backscattering areas and false negatives in high-backscattering areas. By combining these steps, the algorithm achieves classification accuracies exceeding 85% in detecting surface water extents across diverse environmental conditions.Accuracy was first assessed at meter scale using 52 PlanetScope scenes acquired worldwide in September–October 2019; the algorithm achieved 93% overall accuracy, 86% user's accuracy, and 94% producer's accuracy. Global robustness was then evaluated by processing every Sentinel-1 acquisition from 1 to 12 November 2023 and cross-comparing the resulting maps with 6561 temporally matched observational products for end-users from remote sensing analysis (OPERA) dynamic surface water extent from Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (DSWx-HLS) products. This large-scale test yielded 90% user's and 94% producer's accuracies, confirming reliable performance at continental extent.Additional case studies demonstrate the algorithm's ability to handle surface water extent in sand-dominated deserts, to track seasonal amplitude in Folsom Lake (California), drought-induced loss in Cerro Prieto Reservoir (Mexico), and rapid filling of the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam. These results show that the method scales across local to global domains and maintains high accuracy, providing a practical tool for near-real-time monitoring of floods, droughts, and water-resource management. Because the approach is sensor-agnostic, it can be ported to forthcoming L- and S-band missions such as NASA-ISRO synthetic aperture radar (NISAR), broadening its applicability to future hydrologic observations."

 Rapid climate warming is increasing thaw hazards in permafrost regions, threatening infrastructure and ecosystems, but accurate assessment of the susceptibility to thaw hazards in data-scarce high-altitude zones such as the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau remains challenging. Reported here is the development of an inventory of 534 thaw-hazard sites in Qinghai Province using an integrated framework of multi-source data (satellite remote sensing, unmanned aerial vehicle imagery, field surveys). Four machine learning models—random forest, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, and the novel tabular prior-data fitted network (TabPFN)—are compared for thaw-hazard susceptibility mapping under small-sample constraints, evaluating accuracy, interpretability, and uncertainty. TabPFN significantly outperforms the conventional models, achieving an accuracy of 0.938, an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.979, and the lowest coefficient of variation, indicating robust predictions with limited data. Unlike conventional models favoring precipitation and permafrost type, Shapley additive explanations analysis shows that TabPFN prioritizes vegetation and temperature change rate. The four susceptibility maps consistently align predicted high-risk zones with observed thaw hazards, particularly in areas near the Qinghai–Tibet Railway. Uncertainty mapping highlights sparse-data areas for targeted field validation. This study demonstrates TabPFN's value as a robust, interpretable tool for thaw-hazard modeling in data-scarce permafrost regions, aiding risk mitigation and land-use planning."

 Accurately segmenting planar primitives from airborne LiDAR point clouds is crucial for urban planning applications and three-dimensional (3D) building reconstruction. However, existing approaches often exhibit limited extensibility and diminished robustness when segmenting buildings with diverse architectural styles. To address this issue, this paper proposes an enhanced constrained k-Plane Clustering (kPC) method that segments building point clouds into distinct planar primitives. The kPC algorithm formulates the segmentation task as a mixed-integer non-convex optimization problem incorporating three geometric constraints: point-to-plane distance minimization, cluster-center proximity enforcement, and directional regularization. This problem is solved via an alternating minimization strategy, which iteratively updates cluster assignments and plane parameters using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) until convergence is reached. The proposed constrained kPC method provides two key advantages. First, it effectively mitigates the infinite extensibility of fitted planes. This issue is common in conventional kPC methods, and its mitigation directly addresses a major source of suboptimal segmentation performance. Second, the framework demonstrates robustness to variations in the optimization objective’s coefficients while maintaining consistent performance. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world multi-style building datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Furthermore, the performance of the proposed method is robust to variations in its parameters, maintaining effectiveness across a wide range of values."

 Soil moisture (SM) is a key variable governing land–atmosphere interactions and terrestrial hydrological processes. Recent satellite missions provide global SM observations, among which ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 offers full polarimetric L-band SAR measurements at spatial resolutions as fine as 6 m. Retrieving SM from SAR data requires disentangling scattering contributions from vegetation and surface roughness (e.g., root mean square height; Hrms). Conventional approaches typically rely on collocated in-situ measurements of SM and Hrms for calibration, but such data are often sparse. In addition, the simultaneous estimation of multiple scattering parameters from limited SAR observables can lead to ill-posed inversion and unstable retrievals. To address these challenges, we propose ESCAPE (Ensemble-based Self-Calibrated Autoencoder with Physics-informed Estimation), a self-calibrating framework that integrates polarimetric ALOS-2/PALSAR-2 observations within a 10-member physics-informed neural network (PINN) ensemble. ESCAPE embeds physically based scattering models into an autoencoder architecture and estimates SM and Hrms without using in-situ SM measurements as direct training targets. The ensemble strategy mitigates uncertainty arising from ill-posed physical constraints and gradient-based optimization. Spatial evaluation over Spain and Austria demonstrates robust performance, with a correlation coefficient R = 0.701, an unbiased root mean squared difference (ubRMSD) of 0.089 m3 m−3, and a bias of 0.006 m3 m−3. Temporal evaluation at an independent site in Japan yields R = 0.568, ubRMSD of 0.06 m3 m−3, and a bias of − 0.13 m3 m−3. Ensemble analysis further reveals that aggregating multiple PINN realizations improves robustness by reducing the influence of poorly converged members. Compared with conventional approaches trained directly on in-situ data, ESCAPE exhibits improved generalization across heterogeneous environments. These results highlight the potential of ESCAPE as a self-calibrated, satellite-only framework for high-resolution estimation of geophysical parameters, demonstrating the value of combining physical principles with ensemble-based deep learning for SAR remote sensing applications."

 This study employs machine learning methods to predict O3, SO2, and PM2.5 concentrations at four typical sites in the Yunnan Plateau region (Diqing, Dali, Pu'er, and Banna) and examines the underlying driving mechanisms. By utilizing four models—RF, BP, CNN, and LSTM—and combining meteorological factors, emission data, and terrain characteristics, the prediction results indicate that all models exhibit high accuracy with narrow performance gaps. Although RF demonstrates slightly superior overall stability, the structurally simpler BP model performs comparably to deep learning models in specific scenarios, indicating that complex architectures are not always strictly superior. O3 prediction performance is optimal (R2 > 0.88) due to its strong photochemical reaction regularity; SO2 follows (R2 = 0.79–0.97), influenced by the stability of emission sources; PM2.5 has the poorest fit (R2 = 0.56–0.86), attributed to its multi-source nonlinear characteristics and the complexity of transboundary transport.

 In recent years, surface ozone (O3) pollution has become increasingly severe in East China, especially in Shanghai, highlighting the need for accurate models to forecast O3 concentrations and to investigate its formation mechanism. This study develops an O3 forecasting model using a stacking ensemble machine learning (Stacking EML) method based on meteorological and air pollutant data from 2021 to 2024. Subsequently, Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is employed to quantify the influences of meteorological and chemical factors on O3 formation during a typical O3 pollution episode in Shanghai. The integration of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) significantly enhances the model performance, with the R2 value increasing from 0.74 to 0.81. SHAP analysis reveals that chemical factors dominate O3 formation on polluted days (60%), higher than meteorological factors (40%). Total VOCs (TVOCs) are the primary chemical driver (42%), and oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) constitute 27.1%, with reactive aldehydes being the dominant species. O3 formation sensitivity curves from 2021 to 2024 further indicate that Shanghai is in a VOC-limited regime, with a tendency toward a weakly VOC-limited condition. The combination of Stacking EML and SHAP analysis proves to be a powerful tool for predicting and interpreting O3 formation, thereby providing a scientific basis for formulating coordinated NOx and VOCs emission reduction strategies."

 Quantifying seasonal variations in ozone (O3) fluxes in forest ecosystems and identifying their causes are essential for characterizing the global sink and source strength of O3 and conserving atmospheric and forest environments. We measured O3 fluxes in a Japanese red pine (Pinus densiflora) forest located at the foothills of Mt. Fuji from 2016 to 2020 using the micrometeorological gradient method. Flux quality was validated by comparing CO2 fluxes derived from the gradient and eddy-covariance methods, which showed good agreement. To our knowledge, this study represents the first multiyear observations of O3 fluxes and stomatal O3 uptake ratios in an Asian forest. The measured five-year daytime O3 fluxes (10:00–15:00) in summer and winter were −9.6 ± 3.2 and −3.3 ± 1.8 nmol m−2 s−1, respectively. The O3 flux in winter was approximately 30% of that in summer. The daytime O3 concentration and flux (deposition) values peaked in spring and summer. The ratios of the stomatal O3 uptake to the total forest O3 deposition in summer and winter were 0.64 ± 0.28 and 0.32 ± 0.30, respectively. This ratio was among the highest reported in previous studies. A likely explanation is the relatively low ambient O3 concentration at the observation site. The cumulative value of leaf area-based stomatal O3 fluxes exceeding 1.6 and 1 nmol m−2 s−1 during summer was 0.7 and 1.9 mmol m−2, respectively. The Japanese red pine forests absorb a certain amount of O3, which has the potential to impact the ecosystem.

We characterized spatial and temporal variability of EPs using multiple indices including annual maximum 1-day precipitation (RX1), 99th percentile threshold (P99th), mean exceedance above the 99th percentile (ME99th), and frequency of extreme rainy days (RP99th), following the definitions set by the Expert Team on Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), with particular focus on the Massif Central and Cévennes regions as critical hydrological hotspots. Quality control showed that 95% of stations had no significant outliers, and 86% demonstrated homogenous precipitation data. A statistically significant increasing trend in RX1 was observed (0.5 mm decade-1, P < 0.05), while P99th exhibited no significant trend. RP99th revealed a significant decreasing trend (-1.6 days decade-1, P < 0.05), whereas ME99th showed a significant increase (∼0.26 mm decade-1, P < 0.1). Seasonally, RX1, P99th and ME99th peaked in autumn, while RP99th increased from May through December. Spatially, stations located in the Cévennes and Massif Central recorded the highest values of RX1, P99th, and ME99th, with a noticeable intensification in their trends. The years 1982 and 2003 showed peak anomalies in RX1 and ME99th. Investigation of large-scale atmospheric drivers revealed that six climate indices (El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Arctic Oscillation (AO), North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), East Atlantic Oscillation (EAO), Scandinavian pattern (SCA), East Atlantic–Western Russia (EAWR)) with semiannual and annual cycles of precipitation collectively explain up to 33% of precipitation variability, though their influence was weaker for extreme indices. Nonetheless, correlations between global climate indices and precipitation were statistically significant (P < 0.05), exceeding 0.4 at several stations. Notably, the AO and SCA had distinct negative (r = -0.26) and positive (r = 0.29) effects, respectively. Thirteen widespread extreme precipitation events (P99th) were identified, each affecting at least 15% of stations. Among them, only the event in December 2003 was classified as severely abnormal based on Gumbel return period analysis; others were within the historical range of variability. Synoptic analysis indicated that these events were often driven by low-pressure systems over the North Atlantic, with cyclonic circulation and enhanced westerlies channeling moisture via atmospheric rivers into the region."

 East Asian summer rainfall (EASR) exhibits substantial spatial and temporal diversity. One of its prominent and impactful forms is monsoon–tropical cyclone landfall (MS-LTC) rainfall, which occurs when the East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) coincides with landfalling tropical cyclones (TCs) and typically leads to extreme rainfall and flooding over China. However, the physical mechanisms governing MS-LTC rainfall and its seasonal predictability remain poorly understood. Observations from 1983 to 2023 show that the leading mode of MS-LTC rainfall is dominated by interannual variability, featuring two anomaly centers located over the Western North Pacific (WNP) and North China, and associated with a meridional dipole circulation over East Asia (EA), comprising a low-latitude cyclone and a mid-latitude anticyclone. Two independent and physically meaningful precursors have been identified: Arctic sea ice concentration (SIC) anomalies over the Greenland and Barents Seas, and cold sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTAs) in the far eastern equatorial Pacific (Niño1 + 2 region). The Arctic SIC anomalies can persist from the preceding winter through summer, primarily maintained by the sea ice–albedo feedback and the ocean memory effect over the Greenland and Barents Seas, respectively. Both observations and numerical experiments demonstrate that these anomalies excite a downstream Rossby wave train, facilitating the development of the meridional dipole pattern over EA. Concurrently, La Niña–like SST cooling induces a baroclinic response over EA that exhibits a circulation structure opposite to the Pacific–East Asia (PEA) teleconnection, thereby sustaining the dipole pattern. A physics-based empirical prediction (P-E) model that combines MAM SIC and JFM Niño1 + 2 indices achieves the highest skill in predicting MS-LTC PC1 during the hindcast period. This P-E model provides a physically grounded and operationally feasible tool for the seasonal prediction of MS-LTC rainfall."

 The Northeast China Cold Vortex (NCCV) significantly affects regional weather, but its three-dimensional (3D) seasonal structural differences have not been systematically quantified. Using ERA5 reanalysis data (2000−2020), we quantify these contrasts through statistics and dynamical compositing. The results show that: (1) The summer NCCV has a smaller horizontal scale (365 km), approximately 26.4% smaller than the winter mean (496 km). In contrast, its vertical scale is larger (8 km), about 60% greater than in winter (5 km). (2) Thermodynamically, intense summer diabatic heating (primarily latent heat release) generates potential vorticity (PV) anomalies near the vortex core, while the peripheral PV anomalies rapidly dissipate. This enhances convergence and vertical PV transport and leads to a “compact and deep” structure. In contrast, weaker diabatic heating and vertical PV transport in winter result in a “broad and shallow” structure. (3) Dynamically, the vortex core exhibits stronger inertial stability in summer, favoring upward transport of PV. In winter, a broader region of inertial stability inhibits convergence and limits vertical development of the vortex system. This combined thermodynamic-dynamic perspective improves the understanding and prediction of NCCV-related extreme weather."

 During 2020–2022, typhoon activity over the Northwest Pacific was associated with basin-wide tropical climate anomalies linked to the triple La Niña, with genesis regions shifting northwestward and intensities being generally weaker. This study, based on best-track typhoon data and the ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis 5th Generation) data, investigates the main characteristics of summer typhoon activity in China during 2020–2022 and their underlying physical processes. The key findings are as follows: During the La Niña period, the Pacific SSTA (Sea Surface Temperature Anomaly)exhibited an east-cold, west-warm pattern, leading to an expanded Western Pacific Subtropical High (WPSH) with its ridge shifting northward and its western boundary extending westward, guiding typhoon paths northwestward. The ascending branch of the Walker circulation shifted westward and intensified, elevating the latitude of typhoon genesis. Meanwhile, the cooling in the tropical North Atlantic and the positive phase of the Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) enhanced water vapor convergence through Kelvin and Rossby waves, contributing to anomalies in the WPSH. The combined effects of the WPSH, Walker circulation, and other climate modes during the triple La Niña altered the environmental fields for typhoons (with increased relative humidity and vertical velocity). As a result, typhoon genesis locations shifted northwestward, and the centroid of typhoon tracks moved closer to the Chinese coast."

 Previous studies have revealed distinct regional variations of the Hadley cell and zonal asymmetric features in Antarctic Oscillation (AAO), the dominant atmospheric mode of the extratropical Southern Hemisphere. However, the interannual connection between them and the impacts of AAO on the local Hadley circulation edges in both hemispheres still remain unclear. Based on ERA5 reanalysis during 1979–2020, this study demonstrates that the AAO exhibits a zonal asymmetric spatial structure that aligns with the distribution of tropical velocity potential anomalies, and divides the Hadley circulation into Indo-Pacific, East Pacific, and Atlantic-Africa sectors, with the Indo-Pacific sector displaying the strongest edge variability. AAO is out-phase with the variations of the southern hemispheric Hadley circulation edge (SHE) of the Indo-Pacific sector in March–April-May, September–October-November (SON), and December–January-February (DJF), and out-phase with the variations of East Pacific sector's SHE in June–July-August. AAO is in-phase with the variations of the northern hemispheric Hadley circulation edge (NHE) of the Atlantic-Africa sector in DJF. Above processes are reproduced by the linear baroclinic model. AAO primarily influences the SHE via the transient eddies, while its impact on the NHE is jointly modulated by both transient and stationary eddies. Finally, we reveal the AAO's influence on precipitation anomalies via the Hadley circulation: AAO is in-phase with precipitation over Australia in SON, but in DJF a positive AAO forces a dipole pattern of decreased precipitation in southern Europe and Mediterranean and increased precipitation in northern Europe. This study deepens the pivotal role of AAO in regional Hadley circulation dynamics."

 This study analyzes 53 storms that occurred in the summer of 2015, using data from the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Lightning Location System (GLLS) and an S-band Doppler radar observation. Among these storms, 34 produced large-peak-current cloud-to-ground (LCG) lightning, 10 produced only small-peak-current CG (SCG) lightning, and 9 produced no detectable CG lightning. The results show that the combination of 40 dBZ echo top height (Top40) and 40 dBZ echo area at 5 km altitude (Area40_5) effectively distinguishes LCG-dominant storms from non-LCG storms.The analysis reveals that updraft intensity fundamentally controls LCG production. Storms exhibiting maximum Top40 ≥ 12 km show evidently higher peak LCG frequencies and greater total LCG counts compared to storms with weaker updrafts. Notably, even storms with maximum Top40 < 12 km can achieve substantial LCG production when these moderately intense updrafts exhibit prolonged duration.A robust correlation emerges between the maximum Top40 values recorded during the 30-min period preceding LCG initiation and subsequent LCG counts in the initial active phase. Throughout storm lifetimes, Top40 variations mirror LCG frequency trends, with Top40 and Area40_5 values during LCG-active periods consistently exceeding those during SCG-only periods. Primary LCG activity predominantly occurs during Area40_5's growth phase prior to peak development, followed by rapid weakening or diminishment after the peak.These findings confirm that LCGs result from active updrafts, which may provide both favorable conditions for vigorous electrification and formation of high-density charge structures. Consequently, frequent LCG activity serves as an indicator of active updraft periods in storms.It should be noted that the thunderstorm cases analyzed in this study were all from a single summer season. Although the fundamental trends and relationships identified are expected to be robust, some specific quantitative values may vary interannually. Furthermore, the analysis primarily focused on localized, small-scale thunderstorms, which represent the most common type during the local summer. Consequently, the conclusions drawn here may not be fully applicable to larger-scale convective systems and should be interpreted with caution in such contexts."

However, current regional-scale methods lack the spatial precision needed to improve understanding of the drivers of these fluxes to inform strategies aimed at maximizing landscape carbon storage. Here, we develop an alternative and highly constrained procedure for estimating wildfire emissions at both local (10 meters) and regional (1000 kilometers) scales in boreal Fennoscandia. This approach reassessed existing knowledge of heat development within the context of modern geospatial datasets, revealing expanded applications of satellite-derived fire radiative power in classifying distinct smoldering dynamics. The findings additionally emphasized the importance of capturing fine-scale variation in climate-sensitive fuel loading when determining regional fire season impact. Comparisons revealed substantial limitations in existing boreal carbon accounting methods while providing insights into the sensitivity of fire regime characteristics to climate, management, and landscape structure."

Here, we report observations of such a frequency-dispersed whistler detected in the ionosphere of Mars by NASA’s MAVEN spacecraft. We demonstrate the plausibility of wave propagation from the atmosphere to the spacecraft, and we show that the observed dispersion corresponds to theoretical expectations using realistic crustal magnetic field and ionospheric models. Increased attenuation at higher frequencies explains why only the low-frequency part of the whistler is observed. Our observations provide direct evidence of electromagnetic waves from an impulsive source on Mars, suggesting that electric discharges may indeed occur in the Martian atmosphere."

When a small perturbation is induced, the eigenvalue detuning from an EPD follows aKth-root sublinear expansion, which provides a means of enhancing the sensitivity (frequency shift) of resonant-based sensors. On the downside, resonant-based sensors are susceptible to cavity imperfections, local mechanical disturbances (temperature variations, vibrations), and other experimental uncertainties. Here, we overcome this problem by experimentally implementing passive periodic microwave metamaterials with nonresonant EPDs (NR-EPDs) occurring in their Bloch spectrum. We demonstrate a sublinear variation of the reflectance near NR-EPDs to a specific class of (global) perturbations and propose its usage for ultrasensitive sensing that is immune to undesired (local) perturbations. The sensitivity is shielded from technical or fundamental noise that typically degrades the signal-to-noise performance of resonant EPDs."
