10.5194/acp-25-13123-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注的是上对流层/下平流层（UTLS）区域中小尺度湍流对示踪剂分布的影响，以及湍流混合如何改变该区域的化学成分。研究使用了多尺度化学模型MECO(n)和一个新的诊断方法来确定垂直混合的方向。虽然UTLS的化学成分对气候有重要影响，但该研究的重点在于模拟和理解湍流混合过程本身，而不是直接利用遥感技术进行大气环境监测或分析大气成分。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['UTLS', 'Turbulence', 'Tracer distribution', 'Multi-scale chemistry model', 'MECO(n)', 'Vertical mixing']",Chun Hang Chau;Peter Hoor;Holger Tost,Simulated mixing in the UTLS by small-scale turbulence using multi-scale chemistry-climate model MECO(n),"This study examines how the turbulence in the upper troposphere/lower stratosphere (UTLS) could modify the tracer distribution under different situations. Using a multi-scale chemistry model with a novel diagnostic, we found that both the pre-existing tracer gradient and the dynamical and thermodynamical forcing play a role in modifying the tracer distribution. These results allow further research on the UTLS turbulent mixing and its implications for the climate system. 
 The chemical composition of the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) plays an important role for the climate by affecting the radiation budget. Small-scale diabatic mixing like turbulence has a significant impact on the distribution of tracers which further affect the energy budget via their radiative impact. Current models usually have a higher vertical resolution near the surface and a coarser grid spacing in the free atmosphere, which is insufficient to resolve the occurrence of small-scale turbulence in the UTLS. In this work, we utilise enhanced vertical resolution (200 m in the UTLS) simulations focusing on mixing events in the Scandinavian region using the state-of-the-art multi-scale atmospheric chemistry model system MECO(n). These model simulations are able to represent different distinct turbulent mixing events in the UTLS and depict a significant impact of mixing on the tracer distribution in the UTLS. A novel diagnostic (delta tracer–tracer correlation) is introduced to determine the direction of the vertical mixing. The strength of the UTLS turbulent mixing depends on the particular situation, i.e., the vertical tracer gradient, and dynamical and thermodynamical forcing, i.e., vertical wind shear, deformation and  static stability. This work provides evidence that high-resolution simulations are able to represent significant turbulent mixing in the UTLS region, allowing for further research on the UTLS turbulent mixing and its implications for the climate system."
10.5194/acp-25-13221-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注中国南昌市PM2.5中主要极性有机化合物的组成、来源和动态变化。它侧重于通过化学分析和统计模型来识别和量化不同来源（包括人为源和生物源）对有机气溶胶的贡献，并探讨冬季污染期间的有机气溶胶形成机制和影响因素。虽然该研究与大气环境有关，但它主要使用地面观测和化学分析方法，而不是遥感技术，如卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['organic aerosols', 'PM2.5', 'source apportionment', 'chemical composition', 'pollution episodes']",Wei Guo;Zicong Li;Renguo Zhu;Zhongkui Zhou;Hongwei Xiao;Huayun Xiao,"Contributions of primary anthropogenic sources and rapid secondary transformations to organic aerosol pollution in Nanchang, Central China","Through a comprehensive year-long analysis of major polar organic compounds in PM2.5, we elucidate the complex composition and sources of organic aerosols (OAs) within the urban environment of Nanchang, China. Given the significant health and environmental impacts of PM2.5, our research provides critical insights into the contributions of primary emissions and secondary formation processes to urban OA, and confirm the sources and the influencing factors of OA during pollution episodes. 
 Due to the complex composition of organic aerosols (OAs), identifying their sources and understanding their dynamics remain challenging, particularly in urban environments of China where natural and anthropogenic influences to OAs intersect. This study aimed to clarify the relative contributions of primary emissions and secondary formation to urban OAs and confirm the sources and influencing factors of OA pollution. We analyzed major polar organic compounds in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) collected over one year in Nanchang, Central China. Specific biomarkers and diagnostic ratios were applied to characterize OA sources and distribution patterns, while chemical mass balance (CMB) models and tracer-based approaches were used to estimate source contributions. Statistical analyses were conducted to investigate OA characteristics and drivers during winter pollution episodes. Notably, fatty acids, fatty alcohols, and saccharides predominated over lignin, resin products, sterols, glycerol, hydroxy acids, and aromatic acids, with molecular profiles indicating both anthropogenic and biogenic origins. Source apportionment results showed that primary organic carbon (POC) and primary OAs (POAs) contributed 58 % of total organic carbon and 23 % of PM2.5 mass, respectively, compared with 8 % and 4 % from secondary organic carbon (SOC) and secondary OAs (SOAs). Anthropogenic sources dominated, accounting for approximately 90 % of POC and POAs as well as 60 % of SOC and SOAs. Seasonal patterns revealed stronger biogenic influences in spring–summer, whereas anthropogenic emissions dominated in autumn–winter. Short-term winter episodes were characterized by rapid secondary formation, facilitated by elevated primary emissions and favorable oxidation conditions, including enhanced light intensity and nitrogen oxides."

We built a Lagrangian modeling framework using a single-column model (AOSCM) to simulate the air mass transformation. Comparing to observations, reanalysis, and forecast data, we found that the Lagrangian AOSCM can successfully reproduce the main features of the transformation. The Lagrangian AOSCM can be used for future model development to improve Arctic weather and climate prediction. 
 In Arctic warm-air intrusions, air masses undergo a series of radiative, turbulent, cloud, and precipitation processes, the sum of which constitutes the air mass transformation. During the Arctic air mass transformation, heat and moisture are transferred from the air mass to the Arctic environment, melting the sea ice and potentially reinforcing feedback mechanisms responsible for the amplified Arctic warming. We tackle this complex, poorly understood phenomenon from a Lagrangian perspective using the warm-air intrusion event on 12–14 March captured by the 2022 HALO-(𝒜𝒞)3 campaign. Our trajectory analysis of the event suggests that the intruding air mass can be treated as a cohesive air column, therefore justifying the use of a single-column model. In this study, we test this hypothesis using the Atmosphere–Ocean Single-Column Model (AOSCM). The rates of heat and moisture depletion vary along the advection path due to the changing surface properties and large-scale vertical motion. Cloud radiative cooling and turbulent mixing in the stably stratified boundary layer are constant sinks of heat throughout the air mass transformation. Boundary layer cooling intensifies over the marginal ice zone and forces the development of a low-level cloud underneath the advected one. As the air mass flows past the marginal ice zone, large-scale updrafts dominate the temperature and moisture changes through adiabatic cooling and condensation. The ability of the Lagrangian AOSCM framework to simulate elements of the air mass transformation seen in aircraft observations, reanalysis, and operational forecast data makes it an attractive tool for future model analysis and diagnostics development. Our findings can benefit the understanding of the timescales and driving mechanisms of Arctic air mass transformation and help determine the contribution of warm-air intrusions in Arctic amplification."
10.5194/acp-25-13077-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文探讨了卷云对温带地区对流层顶结构的影响。通过飞机测量和高分辨率ICON模拟，研究发现卷云中的辐射冷却和潜热释放等绝热过程显著影响了对流层顶的热力学结构。研究结果表明，卷云中的绝热云过程对于温带过渡层（ExTL）的热力学结构以及潜在的跨对流层交换非常重要。该研究使用了卫星和无线电探空仪数据进行验证，并分析了大气成分（如水汽和N2O）与卷云形成的关系。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，特别是卫星观测和大气成分分析方面。,"['cirrus clouds', 'extratropical tropopause', 'diabatic processes', 'radiative cooling', 'latent heating', 'potential temperature', 'potential vorticity', 'satellite data', 'radiosonde data', 'atmospheric composition (water vapor, N2O)', 'ExTL (Extratropical Transition Layer)']",Nicolas Emig;Annette K. Miltenberger;Peter M. Hoor;Andreas Petzold,Impact of cirrus on extratropical tropopause structure,"This study presents in situ observations of cirrus occurrence from aircraft measurements in the extratropical transition layer (ExTL) using simultaneous measurements from two platforms. Lagrangian diagnostics based on high-resolution ICON simulations show long residence times of the cirrus in stratospheric air, allowing us to separate different diabatic processes during transit. The findings suggest that radiative diabatic cloud processes significantly impact the tropopause thermodynamic structure. 
 Diabatic processes are essential in shaping the thermodynamic and chemical structure of the extratropical transition layer (ExTL). Cirrus may play a vital role due to associated latent heating and its influence on radiative and turbulent properties. Here we present for the first time a combination of in situ observations of the ExTL thermodynamic structure inside and outside cirrus using a dual-platform approach during the AIRTOSS-ICE campaign and a Lagrangian analysis based on high-resolution simulations. Earlier analysis by Müller et al. (2015) suggests cirrus formation in stratospherically influenced air based on measured N2O mixing ratios. The dual-platform approach reveals substantial disturbances in the vertical profile of potential temperature with a weakened stratification inside the cirrus and sharpening above.Lagrangian analysis based on high-resolution ICON simulations suggests that cirrus-related radiative cooling and latent heating are essential for the formation of the observed perturbed potential temperature profile. Radiative cooling and to a lesser degree turbulent heat and momentum transport result in substantial potential vorticity (PV) production in the upper part of the cirrus and a steepening of the vertical potential vorticity gradient. The simulation reproduces key aspects of the observations and the larger-scale evolution as evident from satellite and radiosonde data. Our analysis further indicates that the cirrus particles formed in an already moist ExTL air mass over southern Germany about 12 h before being sampled over the North Sea.Our findings underline the importance of diabatic cloud processes for the thermodynamic structure of the ExTL and potential cross-tropopause exchange."

Haugvaldstad;Dirk Olivié;Trude Storelvmo;Michael Schulz,Dust radiative forcing in CMIP6 Earth System models: insights from the AerChemMIP piClim-2xdust experiment,"Our study examines what would happen if desert dust in the atmosphere doubled, motivated by dust sedimentation records showing a large increase in dust levels since industrialization began. Using climate model simulations, we assess how more dust affects Earth's energy balance and rainfall. We found that models disagree on whether more dust overall cools or warms the planet. Additionally, more dust tends to reduce rainfall because it absorbs radiation and encourages the formation of ice clouds. 
 Mineral dust significantly affects the downwelling and upwelling shortwave (SW) and longwave (LW) radiative fluxes, and changes in dust can therefore alter the Earth's energy balance. This study analyses the dust effective radiative forcing (DuERF) in nine CMIP6 Earth System Models (ESMs) using the piClim-2xdust experiment from AerChemMIP. The piClim-2xdust experiment uses a global dust emission tuning factor to double the emission flux. The DuERF is decomposed into contributions from dust-radiation (direct DuERF) and dust-cloud (cloud DuERF) interactions. The net direct DuERF ranges from −0.56 to 0.05 W m−2. Models with lower (higher) dust absorption and a smaller (larger) fraction of coarse dust show the most negative (positive) direct DuERF. The cloud DuERF is positive in most models, ranging from −0.02 to 0.2 W m−2, however, they differ in their LW and SW flux contributions. Specifically, NorESM2-LM shows a positive LW cloud DuERF attributable to the effect of dust on cirrus clouds. The dust forcing efficiency varies tenfold among models, indicating that uncertainty in DuERF is likely underestimated in AerChemMIP. There is a consistent fast precipitation response associated with dust decreasing atmospheric radiative cooling (ARC). Models with strongly absorbing dust show reduced precipitation, explainable by decreased clear-sky ARC (up to 3.2 mm yr−1). In NorESM2-LM, this decrease is associated with a cloudy sky ARC due to an increase in cirrus clouds (up to 5.6 mm yr−1). Taken together, these findings suggest that the fast precipitation response induced by dust alone may be significant and comparable to that caused by anthropogenic black carbon."

Since emission inventories are typically provided at the annual level, emissions are downscaled to a refined temporal resolution using temporal profiles. This study quantifies the impact of using new anthropogenic temporal profiles on the performance of an European air quality multi-model ensemble. Overall, the findings indicate an improvement of the modelling results. 
 An accurate characterization of the temporal distribution in primary emissions is essential for air quality modeling. This study evaluates the impact of replacing the default temporal profiles in the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) European air quality multi-model ensemble with an updated dataset (CAMS-REG-TEMPO). The sensitivity of 11 regional models and the ensemble to these changes is assessed by comparing modeled and observed monthly, weekly, and diurnal cycles of nitrogen dioxide (NO2), ozone (O3), coarse particulate matter (PM10), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) across Europe. NO2 shows the greatest improvement, with weekly cycle correlations increasing up to +0.17 due to better road transport emissions representation. PM10 correlations improve in winter (up to +0.13 weekly and +0.07 diurnal) due to refined residential wood combustion emissions. PM2.5 correlations remain largely unchanged, except for diurnal cycles, which improve in winter (+0.18) but slightly degrade in spring and summer (−0.02). O3 is the least affected, as correlations were already high with default profiles (0.9–0.95). For some species and timescales (e.g., NO2 diurnal cycles), results vary across models, highlighting the complex interactions between emission timing and atmospheric processes. CAMS-REG-TEMPO has little effect on annual RMSE and bias, aside from slight improvements in high PM10 concentrations. Overall, the findings support implementing CAMS-REG-TEMPO in the operational CAMS multi-model ensemble."

Pausata,Comparing multi-model ensemble simulations with observations and decadal projections of upper atmospheric variations following the Hunga eruption,"The 2022 Hunga eruption caused unprecedented stratospheric water injection, triggering unique atmospheric impacts. This study combines observations and model simulations, projecting a stratospheric water vapor anomaly lasting 4–7 years, with significant temperature variations and ozone depletion in the upper atmosphere lasting 7–10 years. These findings offer critical insights into the role of stratospheric water vapor in shaping climate and atmospheric chemistry. 
 The Hunga Tonga–Hunga Ha'apai Model–Observation Comparison (HTHH–MOC) project aims to comprehensively investigate the evolution of volcanic water vapor and sulfur emissions and their subsequent atmospheric impacts and underlying response mechanisms using state-of-the-art global climate models. This study evaluates multi-model ensemble simulations participating in the HTHH–MOC free-run experiment with climate projections for 10 years (2022–2032). Model results are evaluated against satellite observations to assess their ability to reproduce the observed evolution of stratospheric water vapor, aerosols, temperature, and ozone from 2022 to 2024. The participating models accurately capture the observed distribution patterns and associated upper atmospheric responses, providing confidence for their future projections. Model simulations suggest that the Hunga eruption-induced stratospheric water vapor anomaly lasts 4–7 years, with a water vapor e-folding time of 31–43 months. This prolonged water vapor perturbation leads to significant stratospheric and mesospheric cooling, resulting in significant ozone loss in the upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere for 7–10 years. Comparisons between simulations with both SO2 and H2O emissions and those with H2O-only emissions indicate that the pronounced dipole response with upper-stratospheric cooling and lower-stratospheric warming is driven by the combined effects of SO2 and H2O injections. These results highlight the prolonged atmospheric impacts of the Hunga eruption and the potential critical role of stratospheric water vapor in modulating long-term atmospheric chemistry and dynamics."

Platt;Xinrong Ren;Martin Steinbacher;Irène Xueref-Remy,The role of the tropical carbon balance in determining the large atmospheric CO2 growth rate in 2023,"The year 2023 saw unexpectedly large global atmospheric CO2 growth. Satellite data reveal a role for increased tropical emissions. Larger emissions over eastern Brazil can be explained by warmer temperatures, which has led to exceptional drought, while hydrological changes play more of a role in emission increases elsewhere in the tropics. Broadly, we find that this situation continues into 2024. 
 The global annual mean atmospheric CO2 growth rate in 2023 was one of the highest since records began in 1958, comparable to values recorded during previous major El Niño events. We do not fully understand this anomalous growth rate, although a recent study highlighted the role of boreal North American forest fires. We use a Bayesian inverse method to interpret global-scale atmospheric CO2 data from NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory (OCO-2). The resulting a posteriori CO2 flux estimates reveal that from 2022 to 2023, the biggest changes in CO2 fluxes of net biosphere exchange (NBE) – for which positive values denote a flux to the atmosphere – were over the land tropics. We find that the largest NBE increase is over eastern Brazil, with small increases over southern Africa and Southeast Asia. We also find significant increases over southeastern Australia, Alaska, and western Russia. A large NBE increase over boreal North America, due to fires, is driven by our a priori inventory, informed by independent data. The largest NBE reductions are over western Europe, the USA, and central Canada. Our NBE estimates are consistent with gross primary production estimates inferred from satellite observations of solar-induced fluorescence and from satellite observations of vegetation greenness. We find that warmer temperatures in 2023 explain most of the NBE change over eastern Brazil, with hydrological changes more important elsewhere across the tropics. Our results suggest that the ongoing environmental degradation of the Amazon is now playing a substantial role in increasing the global atmospheric CO2 growth rate."

Summer polar upwelling bottom-up drives opposite water vapor variability between the two hemispheres. Subsequently, mesospheric ozone is negatively modulated by water vapor through ozone chemistry, which further influences temperatures above 90 km via radiative and chemical heating. 
 The upper mesosphere, a transition region between Earth's atmosphere and space, is characterized by complex interactions among water vapor (H2O), atomic hydrogen (H), ozone (O3), atomic oxygen (O), and temperatures. Using MLS, SABER, and SOFIE satellite data, we explore the upwelling-driven interannual variability of temperatures near 90 km (T90) and atmospheric constituents during solstice months, revealing a bottom-up control mechanism of “upwelling–H2O(H)–O3(O)–T90” in the two hemispheres. First, summer polar upwelling transports H2O upward, which is then transported toward the winter hemisphere by meridional winds. Subsequently, the hydration increases H via photolysis and depletes O3 in the winter hemisphere through H-driven catalytic loss. The O varies in pace with O3 due to chemical equilibrium, and the radiative and chemical heating by O/O3 reactions reduces the T90 in the winter hemisphere (T90W). Second, upwelling-induced cooling promotes polar mesospheric cloud (PMC) formation, with ice particle growth blocking H2O transport and dehydrating heights above PMCs. This dehydration reduces H abundance, thereby decreasing H-driven O3 loss. Meanwhile, the colder temperatures directly increase O3 through ozone kinetics. The enhanced O3, together with the coupled O, collectively increase the summer polar temperatures above 90 km (T90S). This anti-phase interannual variability between hemispheres, mediated by PMC microphysics and H2O-O3 chemistry, establishes summer polar upwelling as a fundamental driver of mesospheric climate and highlights the importance of dynamical-chemical coupling in the upper mesosphere."

Unlike the traditional view, this process may explain how liquid and ice can coexist in cold clouds. Based on theory and aircraft data, our findings provide new insight into the microphysics of mixed-phase clouds, which could improve understanding of how Arctic clouds affect climate. 
 The Wegener–Bergeron–Findeisen (WBF) process describes the growth of ice crystals at the expense of supercooled liquid droplets in mixed-phase clouds, driven by phase transitions at temperatures below 0 °C. In this study, we introduce a potential mechanism involving the transfer of water vapor from ice to cloud droplets formed on Giant Cloud Condensation Nuclei (GCCN). This process occurs under specific atmospheric conditions influenced by temperature and CCN size, particularly for CCN with diameters exceeding 1 µm. We term this mechanism the Giant Cloud Condensation Nuclei-Enhanced Ice Sublimation Process (GCCN-ISP). We first conduct a theoretical analysis to develop a physical model for determining these specific atmospheric conditions, followed by validation through observations. Model simulations informed by observational data from aircraft indicate that when CCNs are sufficiently large and cold, the water vapor partial pressure over droplets formed on these CCNs can be lower than that over ice. Consequently, water vapor can transfer from ice to supercooled droplets, causing the droplets to grow. Eventually, the water vapor pressures of both reach equilibrium, resulting in their coexistence."

Our analysis of global climate simulations shows this approach might reduce extreme droughts overall. However, benefits are uneven: poorer nations face far higher drought risks compared to wealthier regions. These findings ​suggest that stratospheric aerosol geoengineering strategies may induce the risk of unintentionally worsening regional hydroclimatic disparities. 
 As global temperature rises, the severity and frequency of droughts are projected to increase. Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) has been proposed as a potential solution to reduce surface temperatures, but its effectiveness in alleviating drought extremes remains unclear. Here, we assess the global impacts of SAI on drought extremes based on experiments from the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (GeoMIP6) and the Geoengineering Large Ensemble Project (GLENS). By 2100, the frequency of extreme droughts is projected to increase by 7.33 % under the high-emission Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 5 (SSP5-8.5) scenario relative to present day. SAI reduces this increase by 1.99 % in GeoMIP6, and by 1.80 % in GLENS compared with Representative Concentration Pathways 8.5 (RCP8.5). Attribution analyses show that SAI-induced cooling alone reduces extreme drought frequency by 3.42 % in GeoMIP6 and 4.28 % in GLENS relative to their respective high-emission scenarios, outweighing the 2.12 % increase driven by SAI-induced precipitation reductions under the same conditions. However, these rainfall deficits lead to substantial inequities in drought exposures. Compared to developed nations, countries with less development experience smaller reductions, or even increases, in economic and population exposure to extreme drought under SAI relative to SSP5-8.5 or RCP8.5. These findings suggest that the current SAI strategies in GeoMIP6 and GLENS may induce the risk of unintentionally worsening regional hydroclimatic disparities."

These reactions have implications for oceans, lakes, and clouds, providing crucial insights for modeling natural processes. 
 Organic compounds concentrated at air–water interfaces, such as the sea-surface microlayer (SML), or aerosol and cloud droplets, are key contributors to complex photochemical reactions. Nonanoic acid (NA) is surface active, and 4-benzoylbenzoic acid (4-BBA) is a photosensitizer. This study combines investigations at the air–water interface by sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectroscopy and in the liquid and gas phases by mass spectrometry (MS) to study the photochemical interactions of both substances at the air–water interface. We identify a novel interfacial aromatic signal via SFG, revealing surface-localized photoproducts previously undetected (C9H10O5). The study demonstrates that 4-BBA not only acts as photosensitizer but also undergoes photodegradation. Our experiments show the critical influence of the UV portion of the solar spectrum on photoproduct formation, as significant amounts of benzene (C6H6) and benzaldehyde (C7H6O) were detected as degradation products of 4-BBA in the gas phase particularly for the lowest wavelengths (280–310 nm). In the liquid phase, we identified the following photoreaction products: C8H12O4, C8H12O5, C9H10O5, C9H14O3, C9H16O3, C9H16O4, and C10H14O4. Among these, C8H12O4, C9H10O5, and C9H16O3 were most enhanced (by a factor of ∼ 11) in the presence of 4-BBA, with C9H10O5 strongly dependent on the presence of oxygen. The formation of C9H10O5 increased at shorter wavelengths due to photodegradation of 4-BBA, while C8H12O4 and C9H16O3 were dominant at longer wavelengths, consistent with photooxidation of NA. While pH and salinity were not varied systematically in this study, we found that decreasing the pH from 8 to 5.4 affected the water restructuring at the interface and increased the rate of photoproduct formation. Increasing salinity from zero to ∼ 38 ppt enhanced the photoreaction rates by a factor of 2. These findings highlight the importance of environmental factors in modeling interfacial photochemistry and demonstrate how SFG reveals surface–bulk coupling relevant to product formation in diverse aquatic systems."

In this paper, a two-step bias correction scheme is established based on radiation observations of HIRAS-II (Hyperspectral Infrared Atmospheric Sounder-II) carried on FY-3E. 
 Meteorological satellite data have been extensively utilized in global numerical weather prediction systems and have a positive impact to improve forecast accuracy. In order to correctly assimilate satellite radiance observations in data assimilation systems, the systematic observation biases must be corrected to conform to a Gaussian normal distribution with a mean of 0. By selecting appropriate air-mass predictors through correlation assessment, a two-step bias correction scheme (namely the scan-angle bias correction and the air-mass bias correction) is established in this paper based on radiance observations of FY-3E/ HIRAS-II from 1 to 31 January 2023. The results indicate that FY-3E/HIRAS-II O−B (observation-simulation) bias exhibits scanning angle bias dependence from nadir to limb field of view. Statistics have found that this scanning angle bias does not depend on latitude band. After scan-angle bias correction using statistical scan-angle correction coefficients, the dependence of the O−B biases on the scan angle can be eliminated. The second step is to perform air-mass correction. Our correction scheme is compared with the air-mass bias correction scheme in NCEP-GSI. Although the scan angle influence is also considered in NECP-GSI scheme, it does not account for the water vapor effect in the atmosphere. Consequently, the correction effect is not good for channels with lower peak height of weighting function, resulting in a slightly residual positive bias after correction. The combination of air-mass predictors (model surface skin temperature, model total column water vapor, thickness of 1000–300 hPa, and thickness of 200–50 hPa) selected through importance assessment in this study effectively eliminates the air-mass biases. The systematic biases between observed brightness temperature and background simulated brightness temperature from background atmospheric field for all HIRAS-II channels significantly decrease after bias correction, and the bias distribution essentially follows a Gaussian normal distribution with a mean of 0. The FY-3E/HIRAS-II data assimilation experiments show that the selected air-mass predictors (EXP-2 scheme) is the most effective among the four experiments. The mean O−B and O−A in all channels are the smallest after bias correction. Compared with the independent ERA5 objective analysis fields, the EXP-2 scheme has a significant improvement for the temperature analysis at upper air and near surface. The water vapor profiles of the EXP-2 scheme are the closest to ERA5 at almost all height levels."

Compared to standard sensors, these new sensors showed better accuracy, especially in rapidly changing temperatures. Over 100 drone flights confirmed the sensors' ability to measure temperature fast enough to compare to standard meteorological instruments. This new method provides valuable data for understanding turbulent heat fluxes in the atmospheric boundary layer. 
 This study demonstrates the feasibility of measuring temperature variance and heat flux with self-calibrated fine-wire platinum resistance thermometers (FWPRT) on multicopter drones. The sensors are especially designed for light weight, fast response-times and to be carried on miniature drones for turbulence measurements. A significant improvement was found in vertical profiling of temperature gradients compared to slower solid-state sensors, demonstrating reduced hysteresis between ascent and descent phases and accurate representation of strong gradients. More than 100 single flights with the sensors attached to drones of the SWUF-3D fleet were carried out in vicinity to a meteorological mast array at the WiValdi wind energy research park in Northern Germany. The comparison to sonic anemometers shows that temperature variance can be accurately measured within the background flow variability. The same applies for heat flux, which was measured for the first time with multicopter UAS and the eddy covariance method without external sensors. Heat flux is a crucial parameter to understand the energy balance of the atmospheric boundary layer and turbulent mixing. An uncertainty below 50 W m−2 was determined with the constraint that only low to moderate wind speed conditions (3–8 m s−1) could be used to allow vertical wind speed measurements with the current algorithm. The results indicate that the temperature sensors are suited for heat flux measurements, but further improvements are necessary with regard to vertical wind speed estimates to decrease the overall uncertainty."

Analyses at various scales showed a moderate overall correlation – stronger in suburban areas and weaker in urban zones. Correlations peaked in winter and autumn, likely due to stable weather. The findings suggest that satellite data can complement ground monitoring but require adjustments for regional and climatic variations. 
 Effective monitoring of air pollution is essential for the development of environmental and public health policies. Comprehensive air quality management requires precise tools and strategies to assess the spatial and temporal distribution of pollutants. This study investigates the correlation between nitrogen dioxide (NO2) concentrations detected by the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5p) satellite and those measured at ground stations by Catalonia's official air quality monitoring network during 2022 and 2023. The methodology integrates satellite and surface data aligned in space and time. The relationship between both measurements is analyzed under different frameworks: (i) global, considering the entire territory; (ii) by geographic zone (urban, suburban, and rural, as well as inside and outside the Barcelona Metropolitan Area (BMA)); (iii) according to the type of stations (traffic, background, industrial); and (iv) at a seasonal level, covering different quarters of the year. Statistical tools are then used to identify patterns and differences based on zones, typology, and seasonality characteristics. The results show a moderate positive correlation at the global level, with r=0.66. By zones, the analysis reveals that suburban (r=0.66) and non-BMA zones (r=0.67) present stronger correlations compared to urban zones (r=0.55), traffic typology (r=0.61), or stations located in the BMA zone (r=0.42). Seasonally, the correlation peaks in winter (r=0.70) and autumn (r=0.66), periods with more stable atmospheric conditions for NO2 concentrations, while it is lowest in spring (r=0.61) and summer (r=0.57). These findings highlight the utility of the S5p satellite as a complement to ground-based networks in NO2 monitoring, while revealing the limitations of applying a direct relationship between both types of data at the regional level and across different geographic zones."

 In  data analysis of atmospheric remote sensing, the combination of complementary measurements of the same atmospheric state from different sensors operating with different geometries and/or in different spectral ranges is a powerful technique to advance the knowledge of tropospheric and stratospheric processes. Complete data fusion (CDF) is an a posteriori method used so far to combine only one-dimensional (1D) atmospheric products (vertical profiles) related to the same or nearby geolocations  from simultaneous and independent remote sensing observations. In this study, we demonstrate the applicability of the CDF algorithm to two-dimensional (2D) products and show its first application to simulated ozone datasets from the future Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer New Generation (IASI-NG) mission and the Changing-Atmosphere Infrared Tomography (CAIRT) ESA’s Earth Explorer 11 candidate mission, in nadir- and limb-viewing observational geometry, respectively.

 The Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE) mission, a joint effort between the European Space Agency (ESA) and the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), aims to advance our understanding of aerosols, clouds, precipitation, and radiation using a comprehensive payload of active and passive sensors. A key component of the payload is the 94 GHz cloud profiling radar (CPR), which provides the first-ever Doppler velocity measurements collected from space. Accurate knowledge of the CPR antenna pointing is essential for ensuring high-quality CPR Doppler velocity measurements. This study focuses on the geolocation assessment and antenna mispointing corrections during EarthCARE's commissioning phase and beyond, using Earth's surface Doppler velocity measurements collected over the first 9 months of the mission. While the instrument footprint is proven to be properly geolocated within about 100 m, surface Doppler velocity observations reveal mispointing trends influenced by solar illumination cycles and thermoelastic distortions on the antenna. Correcting these effects significantly reduces biases, ensuring better Doppler velocity measurements, essential for understanding cloud microphysics and dynamics. The results, validated through the analysis of Doppler velocities in ice clouds, underline the critical role of pointing corrections for the success of the EarthCARE mission."

Our method used diverse sky images taken from various locations across the globe to train our machine learning model. We achieved a very high accuracy in detecting cloud cover, even in polluted areas. Our model surpasses traditional methods by running efficiently with minimal computational needs. 
 Cloud fraction (CF) is an integral aspect of weather and radiation forecasting, but real time monitoring of CF is still inaccurate, expensive and exclusive to commercial sky imagers. Traditional cloud segmentation methods, which often rely on empirically determined threshold values, struggle under complex atmospheric and cloud conditions. This study investigates the use of a Random Forest (RF) classifier for pixel-wise cloud segmentation using a dataset of semantically annotated images from five geographically diverse locations. The RF model was trained on diverse sky conditions and atmospheric loads, ensuring robust performance across varied environments. The accuracy score was always above 85 % for all the locations along with similarly high F1 score and Receiver Operating Characteristic – Area Under the Curve (ROC-AUC) score establishing the efficiency of the model. Validation experiments conducted at three Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) sites and two Indian locations, including Gadanki and Merak, demonstrated that the RF classifier outperformed conventional Total Sky Imager (TSI) methods, particularly in high-pollution areas. The model effectively captured long-term weather and cloud patterns, exhibiting strong location-agnostic performance. However, challenges in distinguishing sun glares and cirrus clouds due to annotation limitations were noted. Despite these minor issues, the RF classifier shows significant promise for accurate and adaptable cloud cover estimation, making it a valuable tool in climate studies."

After integrating simulations into data from 2 different satellite missions, we extract the probability of detection. We compare our results with real plumes, which shows the consistency of the models. Detection and monitoring efforts can be optimized by filtering data based on these results, reducing unnecessary searches and increasing the action taken on these emissions. 
 The offshore oil and gas industry is an important contributor to global anthropogenic methane emissions. Satellite-based, high-resolution imaging spectrometers are showing a great potential for the detection of methane emissions over land. However, the use of the same methods over offshore oil and gas extraction basins is challenged by the low reflectance of water in the near- and shortwave infrared spectral windows used for methane retrievals. This limitation can be partly alleviated by data acquisitions under the so-called sun glint configuration, which enhances the at-sensor radiance. In this work, we assess the performance of two space-based imaging spectrometers, EnMAP and EMIT, for the detection of offshore methane plumes applying the matched filter method. We use simulated plumes to generate parametric probability of detection (POD) models for a range of emission flux rates (Q), at-sensor radiances and wind speeds. The POD models were confronted with real plume detections for the two instruments. Our analysis shows that the spatial resolution of the instrument and the at-sensor radiance (which drives the retrieval precision) are the two factors with the greatest impact on plume POD. We also evaluate the dependence of the at-sensor radiance on the illumination-observation geometry and the surface roughness. Our POD models properly represent the different trade-offs between spatial resolution and retrieval precision in EnMAP and EMIT. As an example, for most combinations of Q and wind speed values at POD = 50 %, EMIT demonstrates better detection performance at Q>7 t h−1, whereas EnMAP performs better at Q<7 t h−1. This study demonstrates the ability of these two satellite instruments to detect high-emitting offshore point sources under a range of different conditions. By filtering data based on these conditions, methane emission detection and monitoring efforts can be optimized, reducing unnecessary searches and ultimately increasing the action taken on these emissions."

The HCCNC could be used for low-temperature experiments where gas-phase partitioning into or out of the aerosol phase for semi-volatile compounds is relevant for CCN activity. 
 Aerosol particles play a critical role as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) in the atmosphere. The capacity of aerosol particles to activate into cloud droplets is measured experimentally using CCN counters (CCNCs). Recent findings suggest that the co-condensation effect of semi-volatiles can enhance aerosol particle growth and cloud droplet activation. Conventional CCNCs, such as the streamwise CCNC, heat particles as they transit the CCNC column and may inadvertently not capture the co-condensation effect, leading to an underestimate in CCN concentrations. Additionally, streamwise CCNCs struggle to achieve supersaturations below 0.13 %, limiting their applicability for studying hydrophilic particles like (NH4)2SO4 larger than 111 nm. To address these limitations, we developed the Horizontal Cloud Condensation Nuclei Counter (HCCNC), which can generate supersaturation (SS) down to 0.05 % for temperatures down to 4 °C. This study presents the development of the HCCNC, providing a detailed technical description of its 3D geometry, computational fluid dynamics simulations and the key components that demonstrate its performance, showing accurate performance at low temperatures and SS, which the widely used, commercially available Droplet Measurement Technologies Inc.

Sampling and humidity generation followed the principle of the previously used continuous-flow thermal-gradient diffusion chambers. Particles were detected using a commercially available optical particle counter (OPC; MetOne Instruments, Inc., Model 804). The instrument's performance is validated by conducting laboratory tests using ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4) particles in the size range between 50 and 200 nm and for temperatures between 30 and 8 °C.

This study designed a consistency verification method for weather radar networks based on the FY-3G precipitation radar (SGRCM) and a ground-based weather radar network consistency verification method (AWRCM). From January to October 2024, observational experiments were conducted in the South China region involving 19 S-band weather radars and 13 X-band phased-array weather radars. The aim was to analyze the influencing factors of the consistency verification methods and the observational biases of reflectivity factors for radars with different bands and systems. For the S-band weather radars, the difference in the bias between the two methods ranged from −1.5 to 1.4 dB, and the difference in the standard deviation ranged from −1.2 to 1.2 dB. For the X-band phased-array weather radars, the difference in the bias between the two methods ranged from −6.67 to 0.84 dB, and the difference in the standard deviation ranged from −0.38 to 1.51 dB. The evaluation results of the two methods show good consistency for weather radars with different bands. We selected one radar with a larger bias for recalibration and rectification, and the changes in bias before and after rectification thus provide a good indication of the improvement in network consistency among the radars."

 Mineral dust is abundant in the atmosphere. To assess its climate impact, it is essential to obtain information on the three-dimensional distribution of cloud condensation nucleation (CCN) and ice-nucleating particle (INP) concentrations related to mineral dust. The POlarization LIdar PHOtometer Networking (POLIPHON) method uses aerosol-type-dependent conversion factors to transform lidar-derived aerosol optical parameters into CCN- and INP-relevant microphysical parameters. We present a global dataset of conversion factors at 532 nm obtained using Aerosol RObotic NETwork (AERONET) observations at 137 sites for INP and 123 sites for CCN calculations. Dust presence is identified using a column-integrated dust ratio threshold of 80 %, derived from the AERONET columnar particle linear depolarization ratio at 1020 nm. INP-relevant conversion factors (c250,d, cs,d, and cs,100,d) exhibit distinct regional patterns, generally lower near deserts and increasing downstream from dust sources. CCN-relevant conversion factors (c100,d and χd) display significant site-to-site variation. A comparison of dust-related particle concentration profiles derived using both POLIPHON and the independent Optical Modelling of the CALIPSO Aerosol Microphysics (OMCAM) retrieval shows that profiles generally agree within an order of magnitude. This result is consistent with the respective retrieval uncertainties and corroborates the usefulness of lidar observations for inferring dust-related CCN and INP concentration profiles."

To address these issues, we generated the first global high resolution (1 km) daily H product from 2000 to 2020 using long short-term memory (LSTM) deep learning models, incorporating data from the Global LAnd Surface Satellite (GLASS) product suite. Furthermore, considering that the difference between land surface temperature and air temperature (Ts-a) is a key driver of H, we introduce the first global accurate satellite-based Ts-a product. This product refines the uncertainty compared with obtaining Ts-a directly from existing products by subtracting air temperature from land surface temperature. Our model, distinct from previous models that estimate H per pixel through physically-based models requiring parameters that are not readily accessible, can conveniently derive global values and efficiently capture nonlinear interactions. Additionally, it accounts for the temporal variation of H. Validation against independent in-situ measurements yielded a root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and coefficient of determination (R2) of 25.54 W m−2, 18.649 W m−2, and 0.54 for H, and 1.46 K, 1.073 K, and 0.52 for Ts-a, respectively. The estimated H and Ts-a values are more accurate than current products such as MERRA2, ERA5-Land, ERA5, and FLUXCOM under most conditions. Additionally, the new H product offers more detailed spatial information in diverse landscapes. The estimated global average land surface H from 2000 to 2020 is 35.29±0.71 W m−2. These high-resolution H and Ts-a products are invaluable for climatic researches and numerous other applications.

Using fossil pollen records and statistical models, we mapped changes across space and time. The dataset shows how forests, grasslands, and alpine ecosystems shifted over millennia, offering insights into past climate–vegetation interactions and improving future climate and land-use research. 
 Spatiotemporally contiguous paleo-vegetation reconstructions are essential for studying climate-vegetation interactions, providing critical data for paleoclimate modeling, and refining past land cover in Earth System Models (ESMs) and scenarios of anthropogenic land-cover changes (ALCCs). Here, we present the first spatiotemporally contiguous paleo-vegetation cover dataset for the Tibetan Plateau, spanning from the last deglaciation (16 ka) to the preindustrial era. This dataset was achieved using two sets of random forest (RF) models: one focused on temporal reconstructions (RF-temporal) and the other on spatial reconstructions (RF-spatial). RF-temporal reconstructs temporal trends from 61 fossil pollen records across the Tibetan Plateau, while RF-spatial interpolates site-based cover, producing a dataset with a spatial resolution of 0.5°×0.5° and a temporal resolution of 400 years. The dataset provides estimates of vegetation cover, along with a 95 % confidence interval, for seven vegetation types (total vegetation, woody vegetation, herbaceous vegetation, coniferous forest, broadleaved forest, alpine steppe, and alpine meadow). To illustrate, we present the temporal trends and spatial distribution of vegetation cover for these vegetation types, comparing them with the vegetation cover used in ESMs. We further discuss the dataset's reliability, limitations, and applications, along with the discrepancies between our reconstructed results and those used in ESMs, highlighting possible reasons for these differences.

This work supports better decisions in food security, disease control, and environmental protection around the world. 
 Understanding global livestock dynamics is essential for global food security, public health, socio-economic and sustainable development. This study developed an automated global livestock mapping framework that integrated Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and the Random Forest regression model. By implementing the mapping scheme on Google Earth Engine (GEE), we develop the first annual gridded livestock of the world (AGLW), covering the period from 1961 to 2021 at a spatial resolution of 5 km.

The AGLW maps reveal the spatio-temporal dynamics of global livestocks over the past six decades, highlighting both global expansion and localized fluctuations, such as the notable increase in pig stock in China and the decline in horse stock in Poland. By offering a reliable and continuous dataset, AGLW overcomes the limitations of existing livestock mapping products in terms of spatio-temporal continuity and resolution. This dataset serves as a crucial resource for enhancing our understanding of global livestock dynamics, informing policy decisions, guiding sustainable agricultural practices, and promoting resilience in both ecological and human systems.

The comprehensive modern pollen dataset covers the full range of climatic gradients across the TP and all vegetation types. The modern pollen dataset has good predictive power in estimating net primary production and annual precipitation. 
 A dataset of pollen extracted from the surface-sediments of lakes with broad spatial coverage is essential for pollen-based reconstructions of past vegetation and climate. We collected 90 new lake surface-sediment pollen samples from the Tibetan Plateau (TP), covering major vegetation types, including alpine forest, alpine meadow, alpine steppe, and alpine desert. By integrating these new data with previously published lacustrine pollen datasets, we established a comprehensive modern pollen dataset comprising 476 samples across the TP, covering the full range of climatic gradients across the TP, with Net Primary Production (NPP) from 0.16 to 6617.36 kg C m−2, mean annual precipitation (Pann) from 97 to 788 mm, mean annual temperature (Tann) −9.09 to 6.93 °C, mean temperature of the coldest month (Mtco) −23.48 to −2.65 °C, and mean temperature of the warmest month (Mtwa) 1.77 to 19.26 °C. Numerical analyses based on the comprehensive modern pollen dataset (n=476) revealed that Pann is the primary climatic determinant for pollen distribution, while NPP is a valuable variable reflecting vegetation conditions. To detect the quantitative relationship between pollen and NPP / Pann, both Weighted-Averaging Partial Least Squares (WA-PLS) and Random Forest algrithom (RF) were employed. The performance of both models suggests that this modern pollen dataset has good predictive power in estimating past NPP and Pann, but RF has a slight advantage with this dataset. This comprehensive modern pollen dataset provides a reliable basis for reconstructing past vegetation and climate changes on the central TP. However, caution is required when applying it to pollen spectra from marginal regions of the TP or to records covering the Last Glacial period, where analogue quality is relatively poor.

Existing datasets often miss night-time burning and how smoke rises in the atmosphere. We created an open dataset for 2023 that records fire emissions every hour in three dimensions at high resolution. By combining satellite data and machine learning, it improves understanding of when and where smoke is released and supports better forecasts and policy decisions. 
 Biomass burning (BB) is a major source of atmospheric pollutants in Southeast and East Asia (SEA), yet most existing emission inventories lack accurate diurnal cycles and vertical injection profiles, limiting the accuracy of air quality and climate simulations. This study develops the Southeast and East Asia Fire (SEAF) inventory, an hourly 3 km three-dimensional (3D) emission dataset for 2023, by fusing fire radiative power (FRP) from Himawari-8/9 AHI and VIIRS through cloud correction, cross-calibration, and a region–vegetation-specific Gaussian diurnal reconstruction with dynamic gap filling. Vertical profiles are further constrained using a random forest (RF) – Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) framework trained with Multi-angle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) smoke plume heights (SPH) and ERA5 meteorology. The SEAF inventory exhibited strong consistency with TROPOMI CO, showing a correlation of R = 0.97 in monthly columns and differing by only 7.81 % during a representative event on 9 March 2023. Annual PM2.5 emissions in SEAF are approximately 2362 Gg y-1, which is 67 % lower than the Fire INventory from NCAR (FINN) but aligns well with the Fire Energetics and Emissions Research (FEER) and the Quick Fire Emissions Dataset (QFED) estimates. The RF–SHAP framework successfully predicted SPH, with over 90 % of estimates within ± 500 m. This approach corrects the near-surface overweighting of conventional schemes by reducing emissions below 0.3 km and enhancing injection between 2.7–5.5 km during the spring burning peak, yielding vertical profiles that closely align with satellite observations. SHAP analysis identified temperature- and radiation-related factors, particularly the vertical integral of temperature (Vit) and terrain elevation, as the primary drivers of SPH, with additional contributions from FRP, planetary boundary layer height, and seasonal–meteorological interactions. These advances in both diurnal timing and vertical injection are anticipated to provide an observation-driven, hourly 3D BB emission dataset for SEA that can improve the reliability of air quality, climate, and policy assessment models."

The accuracy in the modelled UV indices has been assessed for different combinations of model inputs. A good overall agreement between UVIOS2 and the world reference spectroradiometer QASUME was found (average ratio of ~ 1 between the modelled and measured UV index), although the variability in the ratio can be large under cloudy conditions. 
 The third campaign for the calibration and intercomparison of solar UV radiometers (UVC III) took place at Davos, Switzerland in June–August 2022. More than 70 radiometers participated in the campaign and measured side-by-side with the portable reference spectroradiometer QASUME. The UVIOS2 system is a flexible UVI modelling tool that can be exploited for different applications depending on the inputs. Thus, different combinations of satellite, reanalysis, and/or ground-based inputs were used to test the UVIOS2 performance when it is used as a tool for UVI nowcasting or for climatological studies. While UVIOS2 provided quite accurate estimates of the average (for the period of the campaign) UVI levels, larger deviations were found for individual estimates. The average agreement between the UVI from the UVIOS2 and QASUME was better than 1 % for all the different sets of inputs that were used for the study. The range of the variability was of the order of 40 % for instantaneous measurements (15 min), mainly due to the model's inability to capture the instantaneous effects of cloudiness, especially under broken cloud conditions. Under clear-sky conditions the model was found to perform much better, with the differences between the model estimates and the QASUME measurements being smaller than 12 % for 95 % of the studied cases. Even at the pristine environment of Davos, single scattering albedo (SSA) was found to contribute significantly to the modelling uncertainties under cloudless conditions. For Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) of the order of 0.2–0.4 at 550 nm, the role of the SSA was found to be comparable to the role of AOD in the modelling of the UVI."

However, their dynamics are not captured in large-scale climate models. We designed a simplified, computationally efficient model – FjordRPM – that accurately captures key fjord processes. It has direct applications for improving projections of ice melt, ocean circulation, and sea level rise. 
 Interactions between ice masses and the ocean are key couplings in the global climate system. In many cases, these interactions occur through glacial fjords, which are long, deep, and narrow troughs connecting the open ocean to marine-terminating glaciers. By controlling the fluxes of ocean heat towards the ice sheet and ice sheet freshwater towards the ocean, glacial fjords play an important role in modulating ice sheet mass loss and the impacts of freshwater on ocean circulation. Yet, these dynamics occur at small scales that are challenging to resolve in earth system models and hence are often ignored, represented in an ad-hoc manner, or studied using expensive high-resolution models that are limited in scope. Here, we propose a means of capturing glacial fjord dynamics at negligible computational expense in the form of a “reduced-physics” model (FjordRPM) that resembles a “1.5-dimensional” or box model. We describe the design and physical parameterisations in the model and demonstrate its ability to capture important modes of glacial fjord circulation by comparing it against a general circulation model in idealised and realistic simulations. We suggest that the model is a useful tool for understanding fjord dynamics and a promising approach for representing glacial fjord processes within large-scale models or climate and sea level projection efforts."

 A comprehensive understanding and accurate modelling of the terrestrial carbon cycle are of paramount importance to improve projections of the global carbon cycle and more accurately gauge its impact on global climate systems. Land surface models, which have become an important component of weather and climate applications, simulate key aspects of the terrestrial carbon cycle, such as photosynthesis and respiration.

By circumventing the challenges associated with developing and maintaining tangent linear and adjoint models, the EnVarDA method offers a very promising alternative. Using synthetic observations generated through a twin experiment, we demonstrate the ability of EnVarDA to assimilate atmospheric CO2 concentrations for model parameter calibration. We then compare the results to a VarDA method that uses finite differences to estimate tangent linear and adjoint models, which reveals that EnVarDA is superior in terms of computational efficiency, fit to the observations, and parameter recovery."

 Atmospheric radiative transfer (RT) models are useful tools to increase our understanding of the physical interactions and processes occurring in the atmosphere and surface. In the category of free and open-source models, the library for radiative transfer (libRadtran) is a widely used and versatile package. However, running high-resolution calculations with libRadtran is often tedious since libRadtran does not include all the required information to run line-by-line executions (i.e., resolving individual spectral lines of gases) in a flexible way under specific atmospheric conditions, meaning that external software is required. This poses a problem for a user since generating necessary files for libRadtran requires familiarity with the topic of molecular spectroscopy in addition to knowing how to use the external software, which may not be tailored for producing libRadtran-compatible files. In this paper, we present HAPI2LIBIS, a compact software tool intended to be used in close connection with libRadtran to enable easy high-resolution calculations. HAPI2LIBIS streamlines the generation of high-resolution molecular absorption data for libRadtran by utilizing the latest version of the High-Resolution Transmission Molecular Absorption (HITRAN) database and the HITRAN Application Programming Interface (HAPI) with user-specified spectral ranges and atmospheric profiles.

This model seamlessly integrates simulations from the North American Atlantic coastal ocean to tidal tributaries and wetlands. By bridging the gap between large-scale regional ocean models and fine-scale shallow water systems and intertidal zones, this work helps fill observational gaps and provides valuable insights into studies like saltwater intrusion. 
 Saltwater intrusion is an increasing concern for coastal ecosystems. While groundwater models have made progress in simulating aquifer salinization, their boundary conditions – potentially informed by ocean model simulations in shallow water systems and intertidal zones – remain constrained. Here we presented a 3D unstructured-grid model that covers the Gulf of Maine and the Mid-Atlantic Bight, and most areas of the South-Atlantic Bight along the North American Atlantic Coast (“NAAC”) for 2 decades, with a focus on the salinity simulations. This model resolves detailed geometric features of tidal tributaries down to 100 m while maintaining a resolution of 6.5 km in the coastal ocean. The two-decadal simulations from 2001 to 2020 were evaluated using a comprehensive observational dataset of elevation, temperature, and salinity. The mean absolute error in the M2 amplitude across the NOAA tidal gauges within the domain is 0.11 m. The root-mean-square deviation for salinity and temperature measurements are 0.27 PSU and 0.12 °C, respectively. The model reasonably captured the currents and circulations. For the first time, we extended a regional continental scale ocean model to the tidal wetlands to include compound flooding process. The two-decade of simulations of hydrodynamic and hydrological connectivity along the Atlantic Coast have significantly addressed numerous observational gaps in many systems. Specifically, saltwater intrusion patterns in major estuaries of the Mid-Atlantic, such as Chesapeake Bay, Delaware Bay, and other tributaries within the same hydrologic unit, exhibit significant correlations. The seamless cross-scale capability of this model facilitates future applications to land-sea interactions, such as carbon fluxes."

We show that calculating the mean absolute error of bins best fits the observational datasets under multiple conditions and without using temperature corrections. Additionally, we show that calibration at a smaller scale than all Antarctic ice shelves is not needed. Finally, we assess the impact with future projections until 2300. 
 Uncertainties in future sea level rise are mainly due to uncertainties in Antarctic ice sheet projections. Indeed, modelling the future of the Antarctic ice sheet presents many challenges. One of them is being able to model the physical interactions between the ocean and the ice shelves. As a result of technical challenges related to computational resources, implementation, and different modelling timescales, these interactions are often parameterised rather than explicitly resolved in ice sheet models. These parameterisations vary in complexity and calibration method, eventually leading to differences in resulting sea level rise contribution of several metres. Here we present the implementation of the Potsdam Ice-shelf Cavity mOdel (PICO) basal ice shelf melt module in the GRISLI v2.0 ice sheet model. We compare six different statistical methods to calibrate PICO and assess how robust these methods are if applied at different resolutions and areas of the Antarctic ice sheet. We show that computing the mean absolute error of the bins is the best method as it allows us to match the entire distribution of melt rates retrieved from satellite data at different resolutions as well as for different Antarctic ice shelves. It also results in a smaller parameter space than the other tested methods. This method makes use of melt rate bins and minimises the differences between the values of the bins of the model and the ones of the observational target. It gives equal weight to the full distribution of melt values: low, medium, and high values.

To understand the role of these environments during hyperthermals, we herein investigate the Permian–Triassic environmental crisis, which led to the most severe mass extinction event in the Phanerozoic. Our analysis of siliciclastic deposits from the Boreal Ocean from Lusitaniadalen, Svalbard, reveals a distinct increase of the lipid biomarkers C33‐n‐alkylcyclohexane (C33‐n‐ACH) and phytanyl toluene following the extinction event. This increase does not appear to reflect facies changes. Rather, it coincides with the extinction horizon, and persists into the lowermost Triassic (Griesbachian). Our findings suggest that neither C33‐n‐ACH nor phytanyl toluene are linked to short periods of photic zone euxinia recorded at Lusitaniadalen, but rather are derived from a specific group of phytoplankton. This indicates that higher‐latitude ecosystems may have supported regional blooms of unknown primary producers after the Permian–Triassic mass extinction, thus explaining the selective survival of some marine organisms. We also identify (albeit in lower abundance) C33‐n‐ACH and its pseudohomologs in northern Italy, which is the first report of n‐ACHs in the tropical Tethys region across the Permian–Triassic transition outside of South China, highlighting the wide paleogeographic distribution of this biomarker. Phytanyl toluene, however, is found exclusively in deposits recording higher‐latitude ecosystems, and is likely linked to organisms occupying a similar ecological niche as the source organism of C33‐n‐ACH in these settings."

However little is known about scales of a few kilometers (the submesoscales). The new satellite mission Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) provides a global coverage of these scales by measuring sea surface height. Through the radar backscatter coefficient, it also provides surface wind speed at the same resolution. Here, we examine situations in the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio Extension regions where SWOT as well as scatterometer winds and sea surface temperature (SST) at kilometer scale were available. A good correspondence between winds from SWOT and scatterometer is found at the mesoscales. More importantly, the signature of SST anomalies is found in SWOT winds down to 10 km scales, confirming the effect of the ocean on the atmosphere at those scales. SWOT therefore opens new opportunities for the study of submesoscale air‐sea interactions from space."

While often land masses are INP sources, we found especially low INP concentrations for the two stations furthest south, Neumayer and Princess Elisabeth. At Neumayer no clear annual cycle could be identified. No strong signal from biological particles, as known to occur for example, in the summertime Arctic, was observed.

However, its operational timescales remain unclear due to challenges in quantifying past weathering intensity, especially in marine sediments—the final sink of continental weathering fluxes. Using Holocene Mediterranean sediments as a test case, we examine climate‐driven weathering responses recorded in deep‐sea archives. Geochemical analyses of 18 well‐dated eastern Mediterranean cores reveal distinct provenance‐controlled weathering signals. After accounting for provenance and grain‐size effects using fixed‐effects models, we identify a consistent pattern between climate changes and weathering responses, with a time lag of ∼3,000–5,000 years. The observed lag varies by depositional setting, requiring up to 2,000 years for marine sediment transit from nearshore to abyssal environments. Catchment erosion and transport introduce another ∼3,000‐year delay, reflecting hydroclimate instability influences on weathering dynamics. Consequently, deep‐sea archives effectively preserve climate‐driven weathering changes only on timescales exceeding sediment residence time (generally >103 years)."

Here we use tropospheric HCHO retrievals from the Pandonia Global Network (PGN), combined with NASA's GEOS Composition Forecast (GEOS‐CF) model to understand the diurnal variation of summertime HCHO across the contiguous US. While PGN HCHO tropospheric column (HCHOtrop) shows a weak diurnal cycle in most regions, a distinct midday peak is found at the urban sites of Southern US (mainly in Houston), likely driven by highly reactive VOC emissions. For the vertical profile of HCHO mixing ratio within the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL), PGN shows a significant decrease from 0.5 to 2 km while GEOS‐CF exhibits an excessively well‐mixed vertical shape. This discrepancy in HCHO profile leads to an overestimated HCHOtrop in GEOS‐CF in Northeast Coastal US and Southeast US.

The MEP‐retrieved VWC exhibited strong correlation with in situ measurements of LFM (r > 0.6) in the Western U.S. The integration of high‐resolution vegetation coverage data enhances the detection of sub‐grid vegetation heterogeneity.

Geological records, like speleothems and lake sediments, show precession drives orbital‐scale temperature and precipitation variations in this region but lack seasonal detail. By reconstructing a full precession cycle using Alfred Wegener Institute Earth System Model, here, we examine how precession impacts the timing and duration of the East Asian summer and rainy season. The results reveal that in a precession cycle with high eccentricity, summer duration varies by up to 57 days, with onset and termination shifting by up to 48 and 52 days, respectively. The rainy season duration varies by up to 21 days, with onset and termination shifting by up to 31 and 35 days. These changes stem from precession‐modulated perihelion timing, affecting surface temperature and the meridional shift in subtropical high system.

Most existing simulations of electron precipitation rely on test particle models that neglect particle feedback on waves. However, both theoretical and observational studies indicate that the feedback from energetic electrons significantly influences chorus wave excitation and evolution. In this study, we quantify electron precipitation driven by chorus waves using self‐consistent simulations at L = 6 with typical magnetospheric plasma parameters. Electrons in the ∼10–200 keV range are precipitated, exhibiting energy‐dispersive characteristics. The precipitation intensity reaches ∼108–109 ${10}^{8}\!\mathit{\mbox{--}}\!{10}^{9}$ keV/s/sr/cm2/MeV $\mathrm{k}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}/\mathrm{s}/\mathrm{s}\mathrm{r}/{\mathrm{c}\mathrm{m}}^{2}/\mathrm{M}\mathrm{e}\mathrm{V}$, consistent with the typical values in observations.

Here we describe how estimates of Earth's temporal gravity field and observed height time series can be used to quantify errors in GIA models. We tested several GIA models in Fennoscandia, Laurentia and Greenland and found spatial coherence in the pattern of errors, with root mean square velocity errors of ∼ ${\sim} $1 mm/yr, ∼ ${\sim} $2 mm/yr and ∼ ${\sim} $5 mm/yr, respectively.

 α,β-Unsaturated carbonyl functionality- those with connected carbon-carbon and carbon-oxygen double bonds- are commonly found in bioactive compounds. Late-stage functionalization of these compounds could involve oxidation of methylene (2°) C—H bonds while leaving the C—C double bonds that are important for biological activity intact1–3. Catalytic systems have been developed for selective oxidation of methylenes in the presence aromatics4 and N-heterocycles5, however olefins remain an unsolved problem. Here we show that replacing the carboxylic acid with a H-bond donor solvent in sterically hindered manganese PDP catalysts changes the active oxidant to one that accelerates electron rich methylene oxidation and significantly slows epoxidation of electron deficient olefins (kC-H[O]/kepox = 38.5). Chemoselective methylene oxidation is demonstrated in forty-five molecules housing α,β-unsaturated carbonyl functionality where all previous methods afforded allylic oxidation or epoxidation. Mechanistic studies support that the new oxidant proceeds via a more charged pathway that disfavors electron deficient bonds, demonstrating that highly reactive metal oxidants can be tuned to achieve chemoselectivity.

 Parity and breastfeeding reduce the risk of breast cancer, particularly triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)1,2, yet the immunological mechanisms underlying this protection remain unclear. Here, we show that parity induces an accumulation of CD8+ T cells, including cells with a tissue-resident memory (TRM)-like phenotype within human normal breast tissue. In murine models, pregnancy followed by lactation and involution drove the accumulation of CD8⁺ T cells in the mammary gland, coinciding with reduced tumour growth and increased intratumoural immune cell infiltration, effects that were abrogated by CD8⁺ T cell depletion. Importantly, this CD8+ T cell dependent tumour control was only observed following a complete cycle of lactation and involution. Consistent with this, primary TNBCs from parous women exhibited greater T cell infiltration and improved clinical outcomes. Together these findings, spanning preclinical models and over 1000 patient samples, provide new insight into how reproductive history shapes breast immunity, positioning CD8⁺ T cells as key mediators of parity-associated protection and informing novel strategies for both prevention and treatment of breast cancer."

 The sensitivity of terrestrial Arctic climate during the Late Miocene remains poorly understood, despite this interval marking the transition towards a cooler, more variable global climate and the prelude to Northern Hemisphere glaciation. Here we present a Late Miocene terrestrial proxy record, developed through the analysis of speleothems, from eastern North Greenland (Kalaallit Nunaat). Growth periods indicate multiple episodes of permafrost absence between ~10 and 5 Ma, suggesting mean annual air temperatures ~14 °C higher than present coinciding with atmospheric CO2 concentrations above ~310 ppm and local sea surface temperature anomalies >2 °C higher than present. Such moderate thresholds for permafrost absence highlight the climate sensitivity of North Greenland. Spikes in siliciclastic-derived trace elements ~6.3 and ~5.6 Ma are interpreted as terrestrial indicators for Late Miocene ephemeral glaciers in North Greenland. Climate variability recorded during speleothem growth periods was predominantly forced by obliquity, although, in the earliest Late Miocene, obliquity-scale anti-phasing with Antarctica may have occurred. Regional sea-ice extent was at its greatest following ~5.6 Ma during phases of transient glacial–interglacial cycles. Our findings highlight the sensitivity of the Arctic climate system and permafrost to modest CO2 levels and provide insights into regional responses to orbital forcing.

 Altermagnets, a unique class of magnetic materials that combines features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, have garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and magnonics. While the electronic properties of altermagnets have been well studied, characterizing their magnon excitations is essential for fully understanding their behavior and enabling practical device applications. In this work, we introduce a measurement protocol combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering with circular polarization and azimuthal scanning to probe the chiral nature of the altermagnetic split magnon modes in CrSb. This approach circumvents the challenges posed by domain averaging in macroscopic samples, allowing for precise measurements of the polarization and energy of the magnons in individual antiferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced circular dichroism in the magnon peaks, with an azimuthal dependence that is consistent with the theoretical predictions and the g-wave symmetry. By establishing a reliable and accessible method for probing altermagnetic magnons, this work opens new avenues for fundamental studies of these collective excitations and for developing next-generation magnonic device applications.

 Eosinophils are innate immune cells with central roles in allergy, parasitic diseases and multiple inflammatory conditions. Moreover, their role in host-pathogen interactions has been well characterized. However, the role of eosinophils during fungal infection is poorly defined. In this study, we delineate the importance of eosinophils during C. albicans systemic infections. C. albicans is promptly phagocytosed by human eosinophils, but growing hyphae escape this mechanism by releasing the fungal toxin candidalysin, which causes eosinophil membrane damage and cell death. Concomitantly, eosinophil mediators, notably major basic protein 1 (MBP-1), released during cytolysis, inhibits C. albicans growth and viability. Moreover, systemic candidiasis in genetic (Δdbl/GATA) or anti–IL-5–mediated depletion of eosinophils results in increased fungal burden and decreased survival. We here identified CD48 as a major receptor of eosinophils and possibly of other immune cells involved in the recognition of C. albicans via agglutinin-like sequence 6 (Als6). CD48 is important for protection in a model of systemic candidiasis as shown in CD48−/− mice and it binds clinical isolates of C. albicans. In conclusion, we have defined a protective role for eosinophils in vitro and in mouse C. albicans infections through CD48/Als6 host-pathogen interaction axis. In this work, authors show that via CD48–Als6 interaction, eosinophils can kill Candida albicans in vitro and protect against systemic candidiasis in vivo, reducing the fungal growth and improving survival of mice."

 We employ a time series of ERS-1/2, ALOS-1/2 PALSAR, Sentinel-1, COSMO-SkyMed, and RCM differential synthetic-aperture radar interferometry data from 1996 to 2023 to document the short and long-term migrations of the grounding line (GL) of Berry Glacier, West Antarctica, a tributary of Getz Ice Shelf that controls 10% of its ice discharge. In 2019–2021, we detected a short-term GL migration of 18.0 ± 0.9 km, which is exceptionally long and implies that the glacier bed is up to 1300 m deeper than previously known. On short time scales, the GL migrates between three states controlled by bed topography. The observed flexing of the glacier suggests that seawater is trapped in the newly formed ice shelf cavity in an irregular fashion during the tidal cycle. From 1996 to 2021, the most inland position of the GL retreated by 18.1 ± 0.4 km, or 0.7 km/year, the ice thickness decreased by 11 ± 1 m/year, the ice sped up by 64 ± 5%, and the glacier lost a total mass of 131 ± 23 Gt. We attribute the rapid retreat to an enhanced ocean heat flux from warm Circumpolar Deep Water (CDW) reaching the grounding line through favorable bathymetry channels, combined with km-sized seawater intrusions beneath the glacier that cause rapid melting of basal ice.

Here, authors develop a tailored ionic-molecular sieve membrane that selectively intercepts hydrated ions, enabling stable high-capacity long cycling with low projected costs. 
 Aqueous Zn-I flow batteries are attractive for grid storage owing to their inherent safety, high energy density, and cost-effectiveness. However, Zn anode deposition/dissolution reactions cause severe water migration owing to ionic imbalance, especially under harsh conditions with high state-of-charge and high areal/volumetric capacities, further exacerbating intrinsic challenges for practical Zn-I systems. Herein, we develop a tailored ionic-molecular sieve membrane to regulate the transport behaviors of water/hydrated ion clusters, enabling the electrolyte balance by precise size sieving effects. Systematic investigations of different subnanometer pore sizes reveal that the optimal range (0.55–0.65 nm) can selectively intercept large hydrated ion clusters and reduce polyiodide shuttling. In this way, Zn-I flow batteries with this membrane exhibit a stable cycling over 2000 h (500 cycles) under harsh conditions (50% state-of-charge), achieving 66.4 mAh cm−2/53.2 Ah L−1posolyte/27.66 Wh L−1system. This systems also deliver a low self-discharging rate, retaining a high Coulombic efficiency of 98.5% after 3 days static flow. Furthermore, techno-economic cost analysis reveals a competitive levelized cost of long-term energy storage for systems incorporating this membrane (551.98 USD MWh−1 at an energy-to-power ratio of 18 h).

 Integrated photonic devices made of silicon nitride, which can be integrated with silicon-on-insulator and III-V platforms, are expected to drive the expansion of silicon photonics technology. However, the relatively low refractive index contrast of silicon nitride is often considered a limitation for creating compact and efficient devices. Here, we present three freeform silicon nitride devices—a coarse wavelength-division multiplexer, a five-mode mode division multiplexer, and a polarization beam splitter—while systematically benchmarking both the design capability and the fabrication repeatability and robustness of inverse-designed components. We demonstrate up to a 1200× reduction in footprint while maintaining relatively large minimum feature sizes of up to 160 nm, showing that inverse-designed silicon nitride devices can be as compact as their silicon counterparts. These results enable high-density integration in silicon nitride photonics and pave the way for multidimensional data transmission and quantum applications, as the inverse design technique can be applied to different silicon nitride thicknesses and is potentially extendable to other low- and mid-index contrast platforms.

Tolić,Kinetochore-centrosome feedback linking CENP-E and Aurora kinases controls chromosome congression,"This study reveals that centrosomal Aurora A regulates the CENP-E–Aurora B feedback at kinetochores to control initiation of chromosome movement, linking the signaling of two key mitotic structures. 
 Chromosome congression is crucial for accurate cell division, with key roles played by kinetochore components, the molecular motor CENP-E/kinesin-7, and Aurora B kinase. However, Aurora B kinase can both inhibit and promote congression, suggesting the presence of a larger signaling network. Our study demonstrates that centrosomes inhibit congression initiation when CENP-E is inactive by regulating the activity of kinetochore components. Depletion of centrioles via Plk4 kinase inhibition allows chromosomes near acentriolar poles to initiate congression independently of CENP-E. At centriolar poles, high Aurora A kinase enhances Aurora B activity, increasing phosphorylation of microtubule-binding proteins at kinetochores and preventing stable microtubule attachments in the absence of CENP-E. Conversely, inhibition of Aurora A or expression of a dephosphorylatable mutant of the kinetochore microtubule-binding protein Hec1 enables congression initiation without CENP-E. We propose a negative feedback mechanism involving Aurora kinases and CENP-E that regulates the timing of chromosome movement by modulating kinetochore–microtubule attachments and fibrous corona expansion, with the Aurora A activity gradient providing critical spatial cues for the network’s function. This study reveals that centrosomal Aurora A regulates the CENP-E–Aurora B feedback at kinetochores to control initiation of chromosome movement, linking the signaling of two key mitotic structures."

Here, the authors use porous membranes with strong water permeability and bidirectional ion transfer to enable stable and scalable acidic CO2 electrolysis. 
 Zero-gap membrane electrode assembly (MEA) CO2 electrolysers offer high energy efficiency and promise for industrial application. However, the transport of carbonates within an anion exchange membrane (AEM) electrolyser leads to CO2 loss, thereby limiting carbon utilization efficiency. Emerging acidic anolyte electrolysers using cation exchange membrane (CEM) can address this challenge but face critical stability issues, including accelerated hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and persistent salt precipitation. Here, we propose a porous membrane (PM) as an alternative to the CEM in acidic anolyte electrolysers. The system demonstrates continuous operation at 100 mA cm−2 for 200 h without salt precipitation, while maintaining nearly 100% CO selectivity. Furthermore, large-scale device (100 cm2) also shows stable performance. Mechanism analysis suggests that enhanced water permeation and bidirectional ion transfer are critical for achieving stable performance in acidic anolyte electrolysers. These findings offer a feasible approach for high-performance, stable and scalable acidic MEA CO2 electrolysers.

 Super-resolution microscopy has revolutionized the imaging of complex physical and biological systems by surpassing the Abbe diffraction limit. Recent advancements, particularly in single-molecule localization microscopy, have pushed localization below nanometer precision, by applying prior knowledge of correlated fluorescence emission from single emitters. However, achieving a refinement from 1 nm to 1 Ångström demands a hundred-fold increase in collected photon signal. This quadratic resource scaling imposes a fundamental barrier in single-molecule localization microscopy, where the intense photon collection is challenged by photo-bleaching, prolonged integration times, and inherent practical constraints. Here, we break this limit by harnessing the periodic nature of the atomic lattice structure. Applying this discrete grid imaging technique (DIGIT) in a quantum emitter system, we observe an exponential collapse of localization uncertainty once surpassing the host crystal’s atomic lattice constant. We further applied DIGIT to a large-scale quantum emitter array, enabling parallel positioning of each emitter through wide-field imaging. Collectively, these advancements establish DIGIT as a competitive tool for achieving unprecedented, precise measurements, ultimately paving the way to direct optical resolution of crystal and atomic features within quantum and biological systems.

 The Congo River Basin (CRB), hosting the second-largest tropical forest on Earth, is of global significance for the water and carbon cycles. Its population and ecosystems are also strongly dependent on freshwater availability, which is increasingly threatened by current climate change and deforestation. Persistent drought conditions in CRB have been reported, but their drivers and impacts on the basin’s hydrology remain unknown. Here, we analyze 42 years (1981–2022) of atmospheric and hydrological variability to show that the drying trend in Central Congo is linked to reduced atmospheric moisture convergence and precipitation, primarily during the rainiest period. This trend correlates with a weakening of the Walker circulation and an increase in Sea Surface Temperature in the Central Eastern Tropical Atlantic Ocean which influences moisture convergence over the Central Congo with a ~3-month lag. Our findings emphasize the need for integrative atmospheric and hydrological approaches to address CRB’s freshwater and forest vulnerability to climate change."

 Wildfires are a key component of Earth system dynamics with respect to carbon cycling. Thus, reconstructing past wildfire dynamics is crucial for understanding potential future climate change as related to (paleo)environmental feedbacks. Here, we explore wildfire during the Early Triassic (Smithian and Spathian, ca. 250 million years ago) – a time interval characterized by scarce fire evidence, perturbation of the carbon cycle, climatic oscillations, vegetation succession and biotic radiation-extinction pulses – using polyaromatic hydrocarbons, which are an organic (geo)chemical fire indicator in sediments. Hydrocarbon abundances in shales from Spitsbergen show a prominent increase after the Smithian-Spathian boundary. Diagnostic ratios of hydrocarbons suggest that these compounds were derived from relatively unaltered biomass as opposed to soil erosion and petrogenic carbon inputs or coal combustion vis-à-vis a coincidental Siberian Trap volcanism. Our data indicates that as temperatures decline during the late Smithian, coeval hydrological conditions become less intense and changing vegetation successions become more amenable to wildfire activity. We hypothesize that changing regional wildfire regimes influenced biogeochemical cycles, potentially affecting long-term carbon sequestration. The observed coupled behavior in water-vegetation-wildfire systems amid key perturbations in Earth’s history provides new insights into imminent future climate change consequences.

 Here we present a detailed analysis of how existing buildings in U.S. cities can contribute to storing carbon. Carbon can be retained in two ways: as biogenic carbon in wood-based materials, and through carbonation of concrete, a natural process in which carbon dioxide reacts with cement-based compounds. We examined buildings constructed before 2000 across 12 large metropolitan areas, using building stock data, satellite imagery, and Google Street View images interpreted with computer vision. These sources were combined into 1715 building categories to estimate material use and carbon storage. The analysis shows that existing buildings could store around 134,863 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Chicago and Las Vegas contain the largest stores of biogenic carbon (156.06 and 72.88 million tons), while New York shows the highest contribution from concrete carbonation (15.36 million tons). These findings highlight the importance of developing effective building preservation, reuse, and demolition policies in support of long-term climate goals.

 BackgroundA growing body of study have demonstrated a significant correlation between exposure to ambient fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure and the occurrence of preterm birth (PTB). Nevertheless, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain elusive.MethodsTo explore the relationship and underlying mechanism behind PM2.5-induced PTB, a real-time system simulating environmental air conditions was utilized, alongside culturing uterine smooth muscle cells (HUSMCs). Collagen contractility assays were conducted to evaluate the contractility of HUSMCs, while quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and Western blot (WB) analyses were used to determine microRNA (miRNA) and protein expression. Additionally, a dual-luciferase assay validated the targeting relationship between miR-200a and progesterone receptor (PGR).ResultsWe found that intrauterine exposure to PM2.5 resulted in a reduction of pregnancy duration in C57BL/6 mice (mean pregnancy duration was 18.25 ± 0.95 days in PM group vs. 19.33 ± 0.52 days in control group). The contractility of HUSMCs was elevated after PM2.5 treatment. qPCR and WB analyses of both uterine tissue and HUSMCs suggested that PM2.5 activated miR-200a while inhibiting the expression of the PGR in vivo and in vitro. Dual luciferase assay validated the targeting relationship between miR-200a and PGR. Further investigations indicated that downregulation of PGR may enhance the contractility of HUSMCs by modulating oxytocin signaling, specifically altering the protein expressions of Oxtr, TRPC3, and PLCL2. Subsequently, the miR-200a inhibitor significantly alleviated the effect of PM2.5 in downregulating expression of PGR, changing oxytocin signaling, and increasing contractility of HUSMCs.ConclusionOur results demonstrate that miR-200a-targeted PGR regulates oxytocin signaling, likely serving as a crucial factor contributing to PM2.5 exposure-induced inappropriate myometrial contractions and the onset of PTB."
