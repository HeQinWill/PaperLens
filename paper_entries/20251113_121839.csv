10.5194/acp-25-15453-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注撒哈拉沙漠沙尘暴对地中海地区大气环境的影响，通过21年的观测数据，分析了沙尘传输事件的频率、持续时间和季节性变化。虽然没有直接提及遥感技术，但其研究内容与大气环境监测密切相关。沙尘气溶胶的光学特性、粒径分布以及传输路径的分析，对于验证和改进大气传输模型，提高空气质量预测的准确性具有重要意义。此外，研究结果对于评估沙尘对地球能量平衡、云形成过程以及人类健康的影响也至关重要。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有较强的关联性。,"['Saharan dust', 'aerosol optical size distribution', 'particulate matter concentration', 'backward trajectories', 'dust transport events', 'Earth’s energy budget', 'cloud formation', 'air quality']",Franziska Vogel;Davide Putero;Paolo Bonasoni;Paolo Cristofanelli;Marco Zanatta;Angela Marinoni,Saharan dust transport event characterization in the Mediterranean atmosphere using 21 years of in-situ observations,"Dust is in terms of mass the most abundant aerosol in the atmosphere. It can have a significant influence on e.g. the scattering and absorption of light, cloud formation, and solar energy production. We present 21 years of optical particle size distribution measurements at a mountain station in Italy, from which we assess Saharan dust transport events. A peak in the number of events was observed in summer and autumn, while a trend in the number of events over the 21 years was not detected. 
 The Mediterranean Basin is regularly affected by atmospheric dust transport from the Saharan desert. These recurring events have strong implications for the Earth’s energy budget, cloud formation processes, human health, and solar energy production. Monte Cimone, with 2165 m a.s.l., is an ideal platform to investigate dust outbreaks in Mediterranean Europe. In this study, we present 21 years (2003–2023) of dust transport event identification, derived from continuous measurements of the aerosol optical size distribution coupled with backward trajectories. Throughout all the years investigated, the fraction of dust transport days remained constant at values between 15 % and 20 % without any detectable trend. This absent trend was also observed in the particulate matter concentration. The annual cycle of dust transport days was characterized by two peaks from May to August and in October and November with values up to 20 %. A similar annual cycle was reflected in the particulate matter concentration with the highest concentrations in summer and the lowest in winter. Grouping consecutive dust transport days into dust transport events revealed that in the winter months a typical event had a duration of one or two days, whereas in the summer months dust transport events lasted longer (three or more days). The 21 years of measurements presented in this study will set a baseline to assess future dust transport scenarios. Furthermore, they can be used to validate dust forecast models to increase the accuracy of predicting atmospheric dust transport towards the Mediterranean Basin."

Results provided the critical insights into understanding of regional O3 pollution genesis with the exceptional natural sources contribution derived from the stratosphere. 
 Stratospheric ozone (O3) intrusion acts as a major natural source of tropospheric O3 affecting atmospheric environment. Targeting a stratospheric intrusion (SI) hotspot, the Tibetan Plateau (TP) with the immediately adjoining O3 pollution region of Sichuan Basin (SCB) in Southwest China, this study assesses the contribution of SI to the near-surface O3 over SCB and reveals the multi-scale coupling mechanisms of atmospheric circulations with the seasonally discrepant terrain effects of the TP. Based on the simulations on four selected SI events in 2017, it is estimated that SI over the TP can penetrate deeply into the near-surface atmosphere in SCB, with event-specific maxima of up to 38.7 % in O3 increments, providing an extra contribution of 11.1 %–16.0 % to regional O3 pollution. The evolution of South Asian High in the upper troposphere with the peripheral subsidence in the warm seasons and the subtropical westerly jet over the TP in the cold seasons facilitates tropopause folding, driving stratospheric O3 into the free troposphere. We further identified the dominant processes for SI-derived O3 entering the near-surface layer over the basin with (1) a direct intrusion pathway of downward transport over the central and eastern SCB regions in the warm seasons, and (2) an indirect pathway of downslope transport along the TP-SCB slope into the western SCB region in the cold season, revealing the distinct seasonal effects of TP thermal and mechanical forcing on stratospheric O3 transport into the SCB region. These findings highlight the critical role of the TP in modulating stratosphere-to-troposphere O3 transport and its implications for  regional air quality changes."
10.5194/acp-25-15403-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要探讨了青藏高原高海拔地区车辆挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）的排放特征。研究发现，与低海拔地区尾气排放占主导地位不同，在高海拔地区，由于低气压导致燃料油蒸发加剧，蒸发排放成为VOCs的主要来源。这表明在高海拔地区需要采取特定的排放控制措施。虽然该研究没有直接涉及遥感技术，但其对大气成分的分析以及对空气质量的潜在影响，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测）密切相关。通过地面观测数据，该研究可以为遥感数据的验证和模型校正提供参考，从而提高遥感技术在高原地区空气质量监测中的应用价值。,"['volatile organic compounds', 'VOC emissions', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition', 'evaporative emissions', 'tailpipe emissions', 'high-altitude environment']",Weichao Huang;Sihang Wang;Peng Cheng;Bingna Chen;Bin Yuan;Pengfei Yu;Haichao Wang;Nan Ma;Mei Li;Keding Lu,Measurement report: Unexpected high volatile  organic compounds emission from vehicles  on the Tibetan Plateau,"We studied vehicle emissions from ten 3000-meter tunnels on the Tibetan Plateau. Emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increase with elevation due to the evaporation of fuel oil from low pressure, unlike at lower elevations where tailpipe is predominant. This suggests that specific emission control measures are needed. This research aims to understand emissions at high altitudes and to guide cleaner transport. 
 Vehicular emissions significantly impact atmospheric composition, yet their behavior in high-altitude environments remains poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of vehicular emissions conducted across ten tunnels on the Tibetan Plateau, encompassing nearly 3000 m of altitudinal variation. Our findings reveal that total emission factors of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) increase with altitude, driven primarily by a pronounced rise in evaporative emissions. Source apportionment indicates that evaporative emissions contribute 67 % of the total VOCs, markedly outweighing the 24 % from tailpipe exhaust, a pattern that diverges from those observed at lower altitudes, where tailpipe emissions dominate. We identify low atmospheric pressure as the key factor enhancing evaporative VOC release at high altitudes. This study offers critical new insights into the mechanisms of vehicular emissions in plateau regions, underscoring the necessity of accounting for specific environmental conditions and fuel evaporation when formulating emission control strategies for high-altitude settings."
10.5194/acp-25-15415-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注城市树木的生物挥发性有机化合物（BVOC）排放及其对空气质量的影响，特别是臭氧和颗粒物的形成。研究通过在蒙特利尔和赫尔辛基两个城市对常见阔叶树种进行采样，比较了公园和街道树木的BVOC排放潜力。研究结果表明，树木间的BVOC排放差异较大，且街道树木的排放量在不同城市有所不同。该研究强调了物种选择和管理策略在减少BVOC排放和改善空气质量方面的重要性。虽然该研究与空气质量有关，但它主要侧重于生物排放源，而非大气环境遥感技术。,"['BVOC emissions', 'air quality', 'ozone formation', 'particulate matter', 'urban trees']",Kaisa Rissanen;Juho Aalto;Jaana Bäck;Heidi Hellén;Toni Tykkä;Alain Paquette,Variability in BVOC emissions and air quality impacts among urban trees in Montreal and Helsinki,"Urban trees emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOC) that affect air quality through the formation of ozone and particulate matter. Trees in Montreal and Helsinki did not emit more BVOCs than expected based on measurements from forest trees, but the emissions varied between individual trees and growth environments. Avoiding high-BVOC emitting tree species and management strategies that protect trees from BVOC-inducing stress factors would help minimise their negative air quality impacts. 
 Many cities attempt to mitigate poor air quality by increasing tree canopy cover. Trees can indeed capture pollutants and reduce their dispersion, but they can also negatively impact urban air quality. For example, trees emit biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) that participate in both ozone (O3) and secondary organic aerosol (SOA) formation, yet these emissions have been little studied in urban contexts.We sampled BVOCs from the leaves of mature urban trees using lightweight enclosures and adsorbent tubes in two cities: Montreal, Canada and Helsinki, Finland. In both cities, we targeted five common broadleaved species in parks and streets, comparing their standardised BVOC emission potentials to nonurban BVOC emission potential estimates from emission databases. We also calculated the potential O3 and SOA formation by the study species at the leaf scale and upscaled to the neighbourhood.We found that the measured BVOC emission potentials generally deviated little from the emission database estimates, supporting the use of database estimates for urban trees. However, tree-to-tree variation in the BVOC emission potentials was large, with slight differences between park and street trees. Compared to park trees, street tree emissions were higher in Montreal (specifically isoprene and sesquiterpenoids) and lower in Helsinki (specifically green leaf volatiles). Finally, we found that O3 formation from our study species' BVOC emissions was dominated by isoprene, while SOA formation was also affected by lower monoterpenoid and sesquiterpenoid emissions. These findings highlight the importance of species selection and management strategies that protect trees from BVOC-inducing stresses."

Moyer,The airborne chicago water isotope spectrometer: an integrated cavity output spectrometer for measurements of the HDO ∕ H2O isotopic ratio in the Asian Summer Monsoon,"The water molecule comes in several different varieties, which are nearly indistinguishable in daily life. However, slight differences between the water molecule types can be exploited to achieve better scientific understanding of parts of Earth's atmosphere. In this work we describe the design, construction, and operation of an instrument meant to measure these molecules aboard research aircraft up to altitudes of 20 km. 
 We describe a new version of the Chicago Water Isotope Spectrometer (ChiWIS), designed for airborne measurements of vapor-phase water isotopologues in the dry upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) aboard research aircraft. This version of the instrument is a tunable diode laser (TDL), off-axis integrated cavity output spectrometer (OA-ICOS). The instrument was designed to measure the HDO / H2O ratio in the 2017 Asian Summer Monsoon flight aboard the M-55 Geophysica during the StratoClim campaign, and so far has also flown aboard the WB-57F in the 2021 and 2022 ACCLIP campaigns. The spectrometer scans absorption lines of both H2O and HDO near 2.647 µm wavelength in a single current sweep, and has an effective path length of 7.5 km under optimal conditions. The instrument utilizes a novel non-axially-symmetric optical component which increases the signal-to-noise ratio by a factor of 3. Ultra-polished, 4 in. (101.6 mm) diameter cavity mirrors suppress scattering losses, maximize mirror reflectivity, and yield optical fringing significantly below typical electrical noise levels. In laboratory conditions, the instrument has demonstrated a 5 s measurement precision of 3.6 ppbv and 82 pptv in H2O and HDO, respectively."

Daellenbach;André S. H. Prévôt;Roberta Vecchi,Intercomparison of online and offline XRF spectrometers for determining the PM10 elemental composition of ambient aerosol,"This study presents the deployment of the Xact® 625i Ambient Metals Monitor in Milan (Po Valley, Italy) and its performance in measuring particulate matter elemental composition at a high temporal resolution. Our findings demonstrate strong agreement between online and offline X-ray fluorescence analyses, underscoring the potential of advanced monitoring technologies for air quality research. 
 Measuring the elemental composition of atmospheric particulate matter (PM) can provide useful information on the adverse effects of PM and facilitate the identification of emission sources. Carrying out these measurements at a high temporal resolution (1 h or less) allows describing the fast processes to which aerosol particles are subjected in the atmosphere, leading to a better characterization of the emissions. Energy dispersive X-ray fluorescence (ED-XRF) spectrometry is one of the most widespread techniques used to determine the elemental composition of PM. In recent years, new systems known as online XRF spectrometers have been developed to provide real-time measurements of the PM elemental concentration at a high temporal resolution. Among these advanced instruments, the Xact® 625i Ambient Metals Monitor by Cooper Environmental (USA) performs in situ automated measurements with a user-selected temporal resolution ranging from 15 to 240 min. In this study, an Xact® 625i monitor equipped with a PM10 inlet was deployed for nearly 6 months (July–December 2023) in Milan (Po Valley, Italy) at a monitoring station of the Lombardy Regional Agency for Environmental Protection (ARPA Lombardia). The instrument was configured to quantify 36 elements, ranging from Al to Bi, with 1 h temporal resolution in the PM10 fraction. The objective of the study was to verify the correct functioning of the instrument and to evaluate the quality and robustness of the data produced. Xact® 625i data were aggregated to 24 h daily means and then compared to 24 h PM10 filter data retrieved by ARPA Lombardia in the same station and analyzed offline for the elemental concentration with a benchtop ED-XRF spectrometer. The intercomparison focused on 16 elements (Al, Si, S, Cl, K, Ca, Ti, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Br, Sr, and Pb) whose concentrations were consistently above their minimum detection limits (MDLs) for both online and offline techniques. The results of the intercomparison were satisfying, showing that the Xact® 625i elemental concentrations were highly correlated to the offline ED-XRF analyses (R2 ranging from 0.67 to 0.99 and slopes ranging from 0.79 to 1.3, with only a few elements showing slopes up to 1.70)."
10.5194/amt-18-6449-2025,False,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,该研究主要关注大气有机气溶胶（OA）的挥发性测量，特别是使用FIGAERO-CIMS技术。它通过使用聚乙二醇（PEG）作为校准物质，旨在扩展挥发性测量的范围，从而更好地了解大气气溶胶的成分。虽然该研究与大气成分有关，但它更侧重于实验室测量和校准方法，而不是直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测或卫星观测。因此，与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['atmospheric organic aerosols', 'volatility measurements', 'FIGAERO-CIMS', 'polyethylene glycols', 'saturation vapor pressure', 'calibration']",Arttu Ylisirniö;Noora Hyttinen;Zijun Li;Mitchell Alton;Aki Nissinen;Iida Pullinen;Pasi Miettinen;Taina Yli-Juuti;Siegfried Schobesberger,The saturation vapor pressures of higher-order polyethylene glycols and achieving a wide calibration range for volatility measurements by FIGAERO-CIMS,"This study increases the knowledge of the low-volatility organic compounds observed in ambient aerosol particles by providing new volatility information about compounds used for calibrating volatility measurement instruments. Previously, such information was not available, and calibration of the instrument had to be extrapolated to cover the whole measurement range. Results of this study will provide the scientific community with better tools for investigating the complexity of ambient aerosols. 
 The Filter Inlet for Gases and AEROsols coupled with a Chemical Ionization Mass spectrometer (FIGAERO-CIMS) is a widely used method for determining the chemical composition of the molecular constituents of atmospheric organic aerosols (OA). This temperature-programmed desorption technique thermally desorbs OA in a linearly ramped desorption temperature, and the temperature at a detected molecule's peak desorption rate, Tmax, is proportional to the molecule's volatility. Thereby, FIGAERO-CIMS also enables a direct measurement of the volatilities (saturation vapor pressures) of the OA constituents. A series of polyethylene glycols (PEGs) has been used to quantitatively connect FIGAERO measurement results (in particular, Tmax) to volatilities (i.e., calibrate). However, available literature values of saturation pressure (Psat) or saturation mass concentration (C*) for these compounds only extend to PEG 9, which exhibits Tmax values around ∼ 90 °C, whereas Tmax values of OA constituents measured from lab-generated or ambient aerosols routinely reach up to 160 °C (Li et al., 2021; Masoud et al., 2022). To extend the region over which we can conveniently calibrate FIGAERO-CIMS, and hypothetically also other thermal desorption-based techniques for investigating OA composition and volatilities, we performed FIGAERO-CIMS calibration experiments using aerosol particles consisting of PEGs 5-15, which yielded Tmax values of up to ∼ 150 °C. We then set out to estimate the hitherto unknown Psat (C*) values of PEGs 10-15 by utilizing a suite of different Psat estimation methods: both measurement-independent methods (quantum chemistry-based calculations, molecular structure-based group contribution methods, and parametrizations based on molecular sum formulas) and fits of an explicit desorption model to our FIGAERO measurement results with C* and vaporization enthalpies as free parameters. We assess the respective suitability of each method and argue that we obtain the best estimates for PEG volatilities based on the fits to our measurements. We obtained log 10(C* (µg m−3)) values ranging from 0.51 ± 0.07 (PEG 6) to −9.2 ± 1.6 (PEG 14), agreeing with previous literature results on PEGs < 10. Within uncertainties, our results broadly continue the near log-linear relationship of C* with PEG mass for larger PEGs and also agree with some of the independent methods. Contrary to common assumptions in previous literature on FIGAERO results, we find that the relationship between log10(C*(µgm-3)) and measured Tmax is not linear. We explore the consequences of this finding on the analysis of previously published FIGAERO-CIMS measurements of sesquiterpene-derived OA. Prospects for improving on our results in future work are discussed. We conclude that calibration experiments using aerosol containing PEGs up to ∼ PEG 15, with best-estimated saturation vapor pressures, provide promising opportunities for constraining the volatilities of aerosol constituents, down throughout the range of extremely low-volatility organic compounds (ELVOC, C* < 3 × 10−4 µg m−3), as detected not only via FIGAERO-CIMS but also other (online) temperature-programmed desorption techniques."

Thomas,Improving turbulent airflow direction measurements for fiber-optic distributed sensing using numerical simulations,"We used computer simulations to improve how fiber-optic cables measure wind direction. These heated cables have small cones attached to sense how air moves around them. We found that hollow cone designs detect airflow more accurately than earlier versions. This helps us better understand air movement near the ground and could improve the physical foundations of weather and climate models. 
 This study investigates the impact of microstructure geometry on the thermal and turbulence responses of electrically heated fiber-optic (FO) cables under varying flow conditions and turbulence intensities for the purposes of sensing flow direction. The underlying measurement principle is the directionally sensitive heat loss from electrically heated FO cables with imprinted microstructures exposed to turbulent airflows resembling a long hot-wire anemometer. Using the COMSOL Multiphysics 6.0 finite-element software, this study explores a wider range of different configurations of filled-coned and hollow-coned microstructures of varying size compared to existing studies. The research identifies optimal combinations which maximize temperature differences (ΔT) across FO cables with cones pointing in opposite directions while balancing key design criteria such as sensitivity to wind speed and minimizing the FO-cables' PVC coverage. We demonstrate that FO cables with hollow-coned microstructures (radius = 24 mm, height = 24 mm, and spacing = 15 mm) outperform their filled-coned counterparts, maintaining ΔT values above 2 K across a broader range of wind speeds and turbulence intensities. Notably, the hollow-cone configuration sustains a temperature difference of up to 0.8 K at a 60° wind attack angle. The findings implicate substantial improvements for an optimized FO cable design in atmospheric boundary layer studies, enabling more accurate measurements of wind direction, distributed turbulent heat fluxes, and vertical wind speed perturbations using fiber-optic distributed sensing (FODS). Future work shall validate the findings under field conditions to assess the robustness and real-world applicability of the optimized design."

Wright;Neil P. Hindley,Stratospheric gravity waves in a post-limb sounder era: can GNSS-RO be used to extend the SABER QBO-driving record?,"Gravity waves (GW) influence atmospheric dynamics. One key effect is on the zonal winds in the tropics stratosphere, which drive the quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO). Satellite observations are used to study gravity waves, but each satellite is constrained by its observational limits. This study investigates how GW–QBO interactions are observed by two satellites, SABER and GNSS-RO, and examines the potential for GNSS-RO to extend the GW climatology that is carried out by SABER for 23 years. 
 The quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) is a slowly repeating cycle of winds which dominates tropical lower-stratospheric dynamics and has been described as the “heartbeat of the stratosphere”.  However, it is challenging to represent in weather and climate models because its periodicity and magnitude are controlled by small-scale gravity waves (GWs) that cannot be resolved on model grids. To quantify this GW driving we require high-resolution measurements, ideally from satellites to ensure full spatial coverage. Since 2002, the SABER instrument on the TIMED satellite has provided such data, facilitating long-term studies of QBO GW driving. However, SABER is expected to be decommissioned later this year, and no replacement is planned. Here, we assess the possibility of using GNSS-RO data to extend the 23-year SABER record. GNSS-RO  cannot be used as a simple replacement for long-term studies because data volumes are too low before 2006 and for most of the late 2010s, and thus, we ideally wish to supplement rather than replace the  SABER record. However, while the two datasets have broadly similar lower stratospheric resolutions when compared to the full Earth observation constellation, GNSS-RO measurements are higher resolution in all three dimensions than SABER and are oriented differently in 3D space. As a result of this, GNSS-RO GW measurements exhibit much larger GW potential energies (GWPE) and shorter vertical wavelengths than those from SABER. To understand these differences, we use a high-resolution run of the GEOS model to produce synthetic GW measurements, then systematically vary the measurement characteristics between those of the two real instruments. This allows us to identify the key drivers of the different GW properties they measure. We demonstrate that the differences between QBO-driving GW properties measured by the two instruments are primarily due to vertical resolution, with horizontal resolution (either along or across line of sight) and orientation angle playing a negligible role. We further demonstrate that, with a simple vertical smoothing of the GNSS-RO data in the vertical before analysis for GWs, the measured GW properties become near-identical, allowing us to use SABER and GNSS-RO data near-equivalently for this use case. Since GNSS-RO data are now a crucial component of the global numerical weather prediction constellation and are hence highly likely to be available in the long term, this allows us to produce a consistent long-term record of QBO GW forcing from 2002 onwards without key gaps which would be otherwise present in the early 2000s and late 2010s."

The observations of shot-wavelength radars can be attributed to lower level precipitation and wind information in WISSDOM, which allowed for the capture of stronger updrafts in the convection areas of the squall line. Overall, these results highlight the advantages of using radars with multiple wavelengths in WISSDOM, especially shot-wavelength radars. 
 The Wind Synthesis System using Doppler Measurements (WISSDOM) is a practical scheme employed to derive high-resolution three-dimensional (3D) winds using any number of radars. This study evaluated the advantages of using multiple radars with different wavelengths in WISSDOM for the analysis of bow-shaped convection in a severe squall line recorded on 2 August 2020. A total of 11 radars were in operation in the areas surrounding Seoul metropolitan, South Korea: four S-band, two C-band, and five X-band radars. The advantages of using these radars were assessed using six different synthesis scenarios: (1) four S-band (scenario S), (2) two C-band (scenario C), (3) five X-band (scenario X), (4) a combination of four S- and two C-band (scenario SC), (5) four S- and five X-band (scenario SX), and (6) four S-, two C-, and five X-band radars (scenario SCX). The results revealed that scenario S offered good coverage in the synthesis domain, but relatively fewer observations were produced near the surface. In contrast, scenarios C and X provided sufficient data at lower levels but less coverage in the areas far from the radars. The scenarios SC and SX captured the return flow at low levels similar to typical squall line structures. Overall, the scenario SCX led to the optimal synthesis when compared with the observations. The mean bias (MB) of the U- and V-winds between the sounding observations and scenario SCX was 0.7 and 0.5 m s−1, respectively, while the root mean square difference (RMSD) of the U- and V-winds were around 1.7 m s−1. In addition, when comparing the retrieved WISSDOM winds with three radar wind profiler observations, the average MB (RMSD) for the U-, V-, and W-winds was 1.4, 2.0, and 1.0 m s−1 (3.1, 3.9, and 1.5 m s−1), respectively. The significant differences between scenarios S and SCX can be attributed to additional low-level observations in SCX, which allowed for the capture of stronger updrafts in the convection areas of the squall line. Overall, these results highlight the advantages of using radars with multiple wavelengths in WISSDOM, especially C- and X-band radars."

These living datasets are updated every year to provide the highest transparency and traceability in the reporting of CO2, the key driver of climate change. 
 Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate is critical to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesise datasets and methodologies to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO2 emissions (EFOS) are based on energy statistics and cement production data. Emissions from land-use change (ELUC) are estimated by bookkeeping models based on land-use and land-use change data. Atmospheric CO2 concentration is measured at surface stations, and the global atmospheric CO2 growth rate (GATM) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The global net uptake of CO2 by the ocean (SOCEAN, called the ocean sink) is estimated with global ocean biogeochemistry models and observation-based fCO2-products. The global net uptake of CO2 by the land (SLAND, called the land sink) is estimated with dynamic global vegetation models. Additional lines of evidence on land and ocean sinks are provided by atmospheric inversions, atmospheric oxygen measurements, ocean interior observation-based estimates, and Earth System Models. The sum of all sources and sinks results in the carbon budget imbalance (BIM), a measure of imperfect data and incomplete understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as ±1σ."

By applying a deep learning model trained on both observational data and model simulations, we improved the representation of interannual variability and more accurately captured ocean responses to climate events like El Niño. This work supports global efforts to understand the ocean’s role in the carbon cycle and its response to climate change. 
 The ocean plays a crucial role in regulating the global carbon cycle and mitigating climate change. Spatial and temporal variations of ocean surface partial pressure of CO2 (spCO2) influence the air–sea CO2 flux through the difference between surface ocean and atmospheric pCO2 (ΔpCO2), which is further modulated by surface wind speed and gas exchange velocity. However, constructing a global spCO2 data product that is able to resolve interannual and decadal variability remains a challenge due to the spatial sparsity and temporal discontinuity of observational data. This study presents an approach based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) model, combining high-quality observational data from the CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) with multiple advanced global ocean biogeochemical models results to reconstruct a global monthly spCO2 dataset (SJTU-AViT) at 1° resolution from 1982 to 2023. The approach employs the self-attention mechanism of the ViT model to enhance the modeling of the spatial and temporal variations of spCO2, as well as incorporates physical-biogeochemical constraints from the derivative of spCO2 with respect to key controlling factors as additional features. The incorporation of advanced ocean biogeochemical models during the training process allows the ViT-based model to capture more accurate spCO2 variability in these data-sparse regions. Evaluations demonstrate that the new data product effectively captures spCO2 variability at both global and regional scales, showing good consistency with SOCAT observations, long-term ocean station data, and global atmospheric CO2 trends. The reconstructed spCO2 demonstrates strong capability in reproducing spCO2 anomalies during El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, particularly in the eastern Pacific Ocean, where it shows a correlation of −0.81 with the Niño 3.4 index and demonstrates high consistency with cruise data. Based on the SJTU-AViT dataset, the estimated global air–sea CO2 flux patterns are consistent with known regional features such as strong uptake in the Southern Ocean and outgassing in the tropical Pacific. This study not only provides a new 42-year data product for advancing understanding of the ocean carbon cycle and global carbon budget assessments, but also introduces a new Transformer-based deep learning framework for Earth-system data reconstruction. The data product is publicly accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15331978 (Zhang et al., 2025) and will be updated regularly."

To address this, we used machine learning models to learn the hidden relationships between easy-to-measure ocean properties (like temperature and salinity) and nutrient levels. Applying this model, we created ~ 470 million nutrient data points across the North Pacific from 1895 to 2024. This data will help to understand nutrient and marine ecosystem variability under climate change. 
 Nutrients play a critical role in oceanic primary productivity and the biological pump. However, compared to hydrographic parameters such as temperature and salinity, nutrient observations are limited due to their labor-intensive and costly measurements. Thus, nutrient observations are several orders of magnitude sparser than hydrographic observations. In this study, we first established a rigorous data quality control procedure to clean the hydrographic and nutrient (including NO₃⁻, NO₂⁻, DIP, and Si(OH)₄) observations collected from World Ocean Database (WOD) and CLIVAR and Carbon Hydrographic Data Office (CCHDO) in the North Pacific. Subsequently, the cleaned and high-quality CCHDO dataset was used to train three machine learning models – Random Forest, Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Gaussian Process Regression – to establish relationships between nutrient concentrations and key variables, including space coordinates (longitude, latitude, and depth), time variables (year and month), and water mass properties (indexed by potential temperature and salinity). Validation shows that the reconstruction closely matches the observations, with RMSEs of <1.41, <0.071, <0.089 and <3.07 mmol kg-1 for NO₃⁻, NO₂⁻, DIP, and Si(OH)₄, respectively. The validated models were then applied to reconstruct nutrient concentrations from the hydrographic observations in WOD, most of which lacked direct nutrient measurements. This resulted in ~473 million reconstructed nutrient data points across 1.92 million stations for each nutrient, spanning from 1895 to 2024, representing a 2,127 to 2,393-fold increase compared to the original nutrient observations in the North Pacific (197,539 to 222,234). This new dataset will be valuable for studying nutrient variability under climate change and anthropogenic influences, and for providing transient boundary conditions in ocean biogeochemical models.

Kern;Andreas Maier;Nikki Vercauteren,Landscape reconstructions for Europe  during the late Last Glacial (60–20 ka BP):  a pollen-based REVEALS approach,"We provide vegetation reconstructions during the Last Glacial period (60,000 to 20,000 years before present) using fossil pollen data and the REVEALS model. Understanding vegetation change in response to abrupt climate change is critical to enhance our understanding plant migration patterns and the demographic development and dispersal of anatomically modern humans into Europe. Our application PALVEG (https://oakern.shinyapps.io/PALVEG/), aims to make such data accessible to non-experts. 
 Vegetation change during the Last Glacial period in Europe plays a crucial role in better understanding the ecosystem dynamics response to abrupt climate change. Yet, most quantitative reconstructions of land-cover primarily focus on the Holocene and aim to disentangle the impact of anthropogenic and climatic stress on the vegetation. Here, we present temporally continuous land-cover reconstructions from Europe for the latter half of the Last Glacial period (60–20 ka BP) using the “Regional Estimates of Vegetation Abundance from Large Sites” (REVEALS) model. The pollen-based REVEALS model uniquely factors in plant-specific parameters, such as relative pollen productivity (RPP) and pollen fall speed to model pollen dispersal and thus provides more accurate representation of past vegetation cover than simple relations of fossil pollen counts. We compiled a total of 61 datasets from Europe and its bordering regions to model land-cover estimates across 60 time steps in 1000 year increments (Kern, 2024b). By grouping the 38 analysed taxa into 5 land-cover types (LCTs), we simplify the interpretation of our results, demonstrated in three selected periods during the Last Glacial: Greenland Interstadial 14 (GI-14), Greenland Stadial 9 (GS-9), and the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM). These periods provide insight into stadial-interstadial vegetation variability as well as extreme glacial conditions, which seem to play a fundamental role in the demographic developments of Palaeolithic hunter-gatherers. Additionally, we compare the REVEALS land-cover estimates to raw pollen data, provide REVEALS standard errors, and discuss the reliability of our results as well as potential avenues to further improve the reliability of REVEALS estimates. To facilitate the use and interpretation of our data for a wide scientific audience, we developed the browser-based application PALVEG (https://oakern.shinyapps.io/PALVEG/, last access: 22 October 2025), which requires no prior programming experience and dynamically generates maps based on user input."

As our climate warms, fjords are hotspots of change and more scientists are collecting data in fjords. These data need to be available, useable, and intuitive across a wide range of users – from scientists to local people. We provide an example of gridded transect data from Sermilik Fjord as a way to achieve this. 
 As global atmosphere and ocean temperatures rise and the Greenland Ice Sheet loses mass, the glacial fjords of Kalaallit Nunaat/Greenland play an increasingly critical role in our climate system. Fjords are pathways for freshwater from ice melt to reach the ocean and for deep, warm, nutrient-rich ocean waters to reach marine–terminating glaciers, supporting abundant local ecosystems that Greenlanders rely upon. Research in Greenland fjords has become more interdisciplinary and more observations are being collected in fjords than in previous decades. However, there are few long-term (> 10 years) datasets available for single fjords. Additionally, observations in fjords are often spatially and temporally disjointed, utilize multiple observing tools, and datasets are rarely provided in formats that are easily used across disciplines or audiences. We address this issue by providing standardized, gridded summer season hydrographic sections for Sermilik Fjord in Southeast Greenland, from 2009–2023. Gridded data facilitate the analysis of coherent spatial patterns across the fjord domain, and are a more accessible and intuitive data product compared to discrete profiles. We combined ship-based conductivity, temperature, and depth (CTD) profiles with helicopter-deployed eXpendable CTD (XCTD) profiles from the ice mélange region to create objectively mapped (or optimally interpolated) along-fjord sections of conservative temperature and absolute salinity. From the gridded data, we derived a summer season climatological mean and root mean square deviation, summarizing typical fjord conditions and highlighting regions of variability. This information can be used by model and laboratory studies, biological and ecosystem studies in the fjord, and provides context for interpreting previous work. Additionally, this method can be applied to datasets from other fjords helping to facilitate fjord intercomparison studies. The gridded data and climatological products are available in netCDF format at https://doi.org/10.18739/A28G8FK6D (Roth et al., 2025a).

 A continuous meteorological and hydrological observational record is described of the Met Office semi-rural field site of Cardington in southern England between 2004 and 2024. The site was designed to carry out boundary layer, fog and air-surface exchange research to improve the representation of process-based physics within the Met Office Unified Model. The site lay in a flat river basin and was laid mainly to cropped grass and was surrounded by arable fields intermixed with small trees and shrubs through most wind sectors. Observations utilised flux masts at various heights, visibility, radiosondes, very near-surface and subsoil in situ sensors in addition to more specialist remote sensing instruments to retrieve atmospheric properties. In addition to boundary layer and surface data, soil properties such as temperature, moisture and water table depth were obtained. All components of the surface energy balance could be determined. Availability of data based on 30 minute time steps over 20 yr, for the combined components of the energy balance not flagged as either bad or missing, amounts to 77 %.

Turetsky,A Comprehensive Database of Thawing Permafrost Locations Across Alaska,"We created a database of 19,540 thawing permafrost sites across Alaska, including both abrupt and non-abrupt thaw features and explored relationships with elevation, slope, and incoming solar radiation. We use the database to show that existing ground ice maps are too coarse to predict abrupt thaw risk. This database can enhance predictions of future thaw, improve greenhouse gas budget calculations, and guide planning and climate adaptation strategies. 
 The Arctic is warming nearly four times faster than the global average, leading to widespread permafrost thaw degradation with profound implications for ecosystems, infrastructure, and global climate feedbacks. While gradual permafrost thaw occurs over decades, abrupt thaw events – such as thermokarst formation or retrogressive thaw slumps – can rapidly alter ecosystems and severely damage infrastructure. Although abrupt thaw is increasingly widespread, comprehensive datasets that map its spatial distribution at regional scales for land managers and local governments are still lacking. To address this gap, we created the Alaska Permafrost Thaw Database, an open-access, collaborative database which compiles 19,540 permafrost thaw and thermokarst locations across Alaska from 44 sources, integrating field observations, remote sensing products, and the published literature. This database spans observations from 1950 through present and incorporates datasets of varying spatial resolution, ranging from field-based point measurements to remotely sensed products (1–125 m), providing statewide coverage across Alaska. The dataset includes abrupt thaw features and sites experiencing gradual top-down thaw that can help to support comparative analysis and predictive modeling. We used this database to explore relationships between thaw type (abrupt vs. non-abrupt) and topographic metrics (i.e., slope, relative elevation, and potential incoming solar radiation), analyze the distribution of various thaw features across Alaska’s major ecoregions, and compare the database to current spatial datasets of ground ice and Yedoma. Our analysis shows abrupt thaw features are more prevalent in lowlands and depressions while gradual top-down and lateral thaw features are more commonly associated with areas receiving higher potential incoming solar radiation such as south facing slopes and open clearings. We also found substantial mismatches between ice-driven thaw processes and existing ground ice and Yedoma maps, likely reflecting the coarse resolution of current mapping products relative to the fine-scale nature of field measurements and highlighting the limitations of current datasets for local-scale prediction. The database provides direct, empirical evidence of actively thawing and stable permafrost locations and can be used to inform and validate ground ice mapping. By comparing the database with physiographic characteristics and remotely sensed measurements, the database can guide future field campaigns in areas with little to no observations. As permafrost thaw transforms Arctic landscapes, high-resolution, accessible spatial data – such as our thaw database – will be critical for informing climate mitigation and adaptation strategies. The Alaska Permafrost Thaw Database is openly available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16996415), which provides a link to the GitHub repository and access to all versions; this paper describes version 2.0.0."

 This study presents the first national-scale spatial inventory of relict charcoal hearths (RCHs) in Poland, based on high-resolution LiDAR data and digital terrain analysis. Using a combination of manual interpretation, GIS-based feature extraction, and K-prototypes clustering, we identified and classified 634,815 RCHs across forested regions of the country. Each feature was georeferenced and categorized by size, morphological characteristics, slope position, and environmental context, including current and potential vegetation and soil types. Spatial analyses revealed significant regional differences in hearth density, with the highest concentrations found in western and south-central Poland, particularly in the Lower Silesian, Stobrawa, and Świętokrzyskie forests. Cluster analysis distinguished three major types of RCHs, differing in their environmental settings and spatial organization: (1) lowland pine-dominated clusters on gentle terrain, (2) isolated features on steep slopes in mixed forests, and (3) high-density hearth groups in elevated areas. Although large portions of the country appear devoid of RCHs, we argue that this reflects limitations in preservation and detection – due to long-term agricultural activity in lowlands and erosion in mountainous areas – rather than an actual absence of charcoal production. The resulting ReCHAR database offers a unique, open-access tool for interdisciplinary research on forest history, human-environment interactions, and early industrial landscapes. Its modular design supports further expansion, including links to historical settlements and industries reliant on charcoal, such as metallurgy, glassmaking, and tar or potash production."

 Internal climate variability encompasses processes ranging from daily weather fluctuations to multidecadal interactions within the climate system. A large component of internal variability on sub-seasonal to multi-decadal time scales is associated with recurring patterns or “climate modes”.

 High spatiotemporal resolution typical meteorological year (TMY) data are essential for building energy modelling and urban climate studies. However, conventional TMY datasets, limited by sparse ground-based station coverage and infrequent updates, fail to meet the demands of detailed urban-scale simulations. To overcome these limitations, this study uses Australia as a case study and develops a new high-resolution dataset, the TMY derived from the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), hereafter referred to as TMY-MER. A novel weather classification approach was introduced, utilizing a mean relative error index derived from the ratio of daily to monthly maximum solar radiation to identify clear-sky conditions. Uncertainty errors were spatially interpolated using the inverse distance weighting (IDW) method. The results reveal several limitations in the previously generated TMY datasets. TMY-MER demonstrates stable accuracy under clear-sky conditions, with annual average errors below 5 %, while under cloudy conditions, influenced by cloud simulation bias, errors can reach up to 50 %. Spatially, annual solar irradiance is overestimated by 30 % in southeastern coastal urban clusters, while errors in inland regions remain below 10 %. Temporally, the peak error during cloudy winter periods reaches 30 %, whereas summer clear-sky errors are under 5 %. Further analysis using the direct-diffuse separation model indicates a systematic overestimation of diffuse horizontal irradiance (DHI) within 6 %, and an approximately 20 % negative bias in direct normal irradiance (DNI). Validation through building cluster simulations shows that the optimized dataset achieves over 90 % consistency with traditional TMY data, with monthly mean errors below 5 %. The multidimensional error assessment framework significantly enhances the reliability of reanalysis data for use in complex climate zones, supporting dynamic energy system planning and urban thermal environment modelling."

The model benchmarking and evaluation results reveal key model strengths and weaknesses in simulating land surface quantities and show implications for future model improvements. 
 We integrate the refactored community Noah-MP version 5.0 model with the NASA Land Information System (LIS) version 7.5.2 to streamline the synchronization, development, and maintenance of Noah-MP within LIS and to enhance their interoperability and applicability. We evaluate and compare 5-year (2018–2022) global and regional benchmark simulations of LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 and LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 for a set of key land surface variables. Both models capture the spatial and seasonal distributions of observed soil moisture, latent heat (LH), snow water equivalent (SWE), snow depth, snow cover, and surface albedo, with similar bias patterns. Both models tend to underestimate soil moisture over wet soil regimes and overestimate over dry soil regimes, with slightly higher (≤ ∼ 0.01 m3 m−3 for global mean) soil moisture in LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 than LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 across most regions. The model bias patterns of LH overall follow those of soil moisture, while LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 has a lower LH across many non-polar regions than LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1, which reduces the global mean LH bias from 0.99 to −0.39 W m−2. The model SWE bias patterns are dominated by the precipitation and temperature forcing uncertainties, with slightly lower SWE values in LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 (global mean bias of −13.2 mm) than LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 (global mean bias of −10.1 mm). The model bias patterns of snow depth generally follow those of SWE. LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 consistently overestimates snow cover globally with a mean bias of 0.11, while LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 effectively reduces the overestimates across the global snowpacks with a mean bias of 0.07 because of updated snow cover parameters. Both models show widespread overestimates of surface albedo over mid-latitude and high-latitude regions but significant underestimates in the Sahara Desert and Antarctica. Overall, LIS/Noah-MPv5.0 outperforms or is similar to LIS/Noah-MPv4.0.1 in the evaluated land surface variables, except for slight degradation in simulated surface soil moisture and SWE. This study reveals possible model deficiencies, motivates future improvements in coupled canopy-snowpack-soil processes and input soil data, and points to the importance of considering observational and forcing data uncertainties in model evaluation."

Pabon-Moreno;Wantong Li;Mirco Migliavacca;Martin Jung;Gregory Duveiller,BOSSE v1.0: the Biodiversity Observing System Simulation Experiment,"Measuring biodiversity is necessary to assess its loss, evolution, and role in ecosystem functions. Satellites image the whole terrestrial surface and could cost-efficiently map plant diversity globally. However, developing the necessary methods lacks consistent and sufficient field measurements. Thus, we propose using a simulation tool that generates virtual ecosystems, with species properties and functions varying in response to meteorology and the respective remote sensing imagery. 
 As global and regional vegetation diversity loss threatens essential ecosystem services under climate change, monitoring biodiversity dynamics and its role in ecosystem services is crucial in predicting future states and providing insights into climate adaptation and mitigation. In this context, remote sensing (RS) offers a unique opportunity to assess long-term and large-scale biodiversity dynamics. However, the development of this capability suffers from the lack of consistent, global, and spatially matched ground diversity measurements that enable testing and validating generalizable methodologies. The Biodiversity Observing System Simulation Experiment (BOSSE) aims to alleviate the lack of this information by means of simulation. BOSSE simulates synthetic landscapes featuring communities of various vegetation species whose traits's seasonality and ecosystem functions (e.g., biospheric fluxes) respond to meteorology and environmental factors. Simultaneously, BOSSE can generate various types of remote sensing imagery linked to the traits and functions via radiative transfer theory. Specifically, it simulates hyperspectral reflectance factors (R), which can be convolved to the bands of specific RS missions, sun-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF), and land surface temperature (LST). The resolution of the RS imagery can be degraded to test the robustness of different approaches to information loss and the capability of new methodologies to overcome this limitation. Therefore, BOSSE enables users to evaluate the capability of different methods to estimate plant functional diversity (PFD) from RS and link it to ecosystem functions. We expect BOSSE to support the benchmarking and improvement of old and novel methods dedicated to estimating plant diversity and exploring the biodiversity–ecosystem function (BEF) relationships, facilitating advances in this growing area of research and supporting the analysis and interpretation of real-world measurements. We also expect BOSSE to be extended and include new features that provide more realistic simulations that help answer more complex questions related to climate change and global warming."

These advancements enable better demonstrate how these chemical processes significantly influence China eastern cities' particulate pollution. 
 Particle number concentration (PNC) is a key parameter for assessing particles' effects on public health and climate. Although the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model has been widely used to investigate the particle mass concentrations in China, its capability of reproducing the PNC is unclear. After applying the default CMAQ model (version 5.3.2) in Beijing and Nanjing, the model underestimates PNC by 70 % to 80 % with the default Binary Homogeneous Nucleation (BHN) parameterization scheme. We then implement Ternary Homogeneous Nucleation (THN), Ion Mediated Nucleation (IMN), and sulfuric acid-dimethylamine (DMA) nucleation parameterization schemes into the CMAQ model. Seven modelling scenarios are conducted to explore the model's performance on PNC. The results indicate that the scenario with combined IMN and DMA scheme (SumID scheme) yields the best agreement with the observations, enhancing PNC during new particle formation (NPF) events by 84 % in Beijing and 36 % in Nanjing. In SumID scheme, IMN contributes to 56.30 % of the number concentrations in Beijing and 27.86 % in Nanjing, while DMA accounts for 28.15 % in Beijing and 29.27 % in Nanjing, respectively. IMN nucleation contributed PNC exhibits a pronounced diurnal variation with higher concentrations during the day and lower levels at night. DMA pathway predominantly influences NPF events during the morning and evening peak. This study enhances the model's capability to accurately simulate NPF events and underscores the significant influence of IMN and DMA nucleation on PNC in eastern cities."

Our study suggests that both the mean and eddy fields are becoming more energetic under anthropogenic forcing but changes in the mean circulation dominate the increase, concurrent with a spin‐up of the large‐scale circulation, concentrated in the top 200 m and along boundaries. The increase in EKE is strongest in the upper 50 m and is linked to enhanced baroclinic instability within the mean boundary currents.

Utilizing 2014–2021 Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) observations and the vertical profile heating (VPH) method, we quantify LH over northern East Asia (30°–60°N, 105°–140°E) and document its seasonal, meridional, and land‐sea contrasts. Relative to spring/autumn, summer precipitation exhibits higher rain tops, elevated positive/negative turning points, and stronger LH with peak release occurring 1–2 km higher for comparable near‐surface rain rates or echo‐top heights viewing the average latent heat profiles. From 30°N to 60°N, the heights of maximum heating, the sign‐change (turning) levels, and the LH top all decrease poleward by ∼1–2 km consistent with lower freezing levels in colder climates. The horizontal pattern of LH mirrors both latitude and land‐sea distribution: heating at ∼5 km is amplified over coastal/peninsular regions compared with inland mountains. Spectral analyses show that increasing precipitation intensity shifts profiles toward convective‐type, column‐deep heating and lowers the turning level. Intercomparisons with GPM Goddard convective‐stratiform heating (CSH) and spectral latent heating (SLH) products confirm the temporal and vertical robustness of these patterns; mid‐tropospheric heating is comparable across data sets, whereas VPH retrieves markedly stronger low‐level cooling than CSH/SLH. Uncertainties arise from DPR's limited snowfall sensitivity (winter underestimation) and potential low‐level cold bias in VPH, where raindrop breakup mimics evaporation. These results provide a midlatitude LH climatology that benchmarks models, clarifies seasonal/meridional controls on LH vertical structure, and informs simulations of monsoon evolution and extratropical cyclone development."

This potential oceanic NO source leads to a small but potentially widespread increase in surface ozone and hydroxyl radicals in the remote marine environment, altering our understanding of the role the remote marine atmosphere plays in the global system.

Numerous aqueous organic aerosols are emitted into the troposphere by biomass burning. The surface of such aqueous organic aerosols is then potentially covered by organic surfactants, modifying its properties and hence also the photosensitized oxidation of gaseous sulfur dioxide (SO2). It is therefore desirable to explore how such reactions are influenced by the presence of surfactants. First, we investigated the effect of surfactants on the uptake rate of SO2 on vanillin, 4‐benzoylbenzoic acid, and humic acid films. The uptake coefficient of SO2 is increased by approximately a factor of 2–3 under acidic conditions (a pH of 2), compared to that on the humic acid alone film, especially. Second, ultra‐high‐performance liquid chromatography coupled with high‐resolution mass spectrometry was employed to analyze organosulfur compounds, demonstrating the effect of the surfactant‐covered surface on the products. It was found that surfactants, by promoting the interfacial abundance of photosensitizers, facilitate the formation of organosulfur compounds, indicating that the concentration effect is a critical factor in photosensitized interfacial chemistry of aerosols between the bulk liquid water and the gas phase, as it induces abundant product formation at the air‐aqueous interface."

As in previous studies, our results show that growing cumuli are surrounded by downdrafts linked to cloud‐scale quasi‐toroidal circulations at all times at middle and upper cloud levels consistent with the thermal chain description of convective clouds. These toroidal circulations are responsible for the most intense cloud‐edge downdrafts in our simulations. In the upper cloud half, roughly 30%–50% of the upward mass flux is typically compensated within a radius of about twice the updraft radius in quasi‐laminar simulations forced by a warm bubble in an initially quiescent flow. In a turbulent cloud forced by surface fluxes, this compensation fraction is around 10%–30% over the same region. In contrast to the buoyancy‐centered view of subsiding shells, Eulerian and Lagrangian vertical momentum budget analyses show that the most intense cloud‐edge downdrafts in the turbulent setup, and after spin‐up of the toroidal circulation in the quasi‐laminar experiments, are predominantly mechanically forced (i.e., driven by dynamic pressure accelerations). This is consistent throughout the entire growth phase of the cumulus clouds and across tests with varying assumptions, including drier and moister environments. Despite dynamic pressure perturbations being the main driver of toroidal downdrafts, the downdraft speed (relative to the corresponding updraft velocity) exceeds the prediction of the non‐buoyant Hill's spherical vortex—a simple model frequently used for cloud‐scale circulations—by more than 30%."

Ten years ago, a landmark study by Brandt et al. (2014, https://doi.org/10.1126/science.1247045) found generally higher top‐down emissions determinations than industry estimates. Here, we revisit this topic by examining 10 years of peer‐reviewed literature that has been published since. A total of 73 results for top‐down/bottom‐up ratios from 57 articles were included. Most of the published literature focuses on methane emissions, with only 11 articles reporting other O&NG emissions. In the newer literature, 49 (86%) of the studies reported that inventory (bottom‐up) emissions underestimated results from determinations based on ambient observations (top‐down). This finding is similar to the Brandt et al. (2014) study, which found that 82% of literature reported higher top‐down emissions than inventory‐based estimates, suggesting little improvement in inventory data accuracy over the past decade despite this discrepancy having been well documented earlier. However, fewer extreme ratio values (top‐down/bottom‐up) >10 were reported after 2014. A meta‐analysis building on carefully selected literature that has been published since 2014 resulted in a mean ratio value of 2.50 ± 0.62, implying that measured emissions were on average 250% of inventory values. For North American countries, the mean ratio values ranged from 2.59 to 3.75, exceeding the global average. The lowest ratio values were observed when United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reports were used as inventory comparisons to top‐down measurements (mean = 1.45); all other inventory types resulted in mean ratios >2."

Climate‐smart agriculture aims to improve yields while minimizing its climate impact, such as from soil greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions driven by microbial activity. From an irrigation perspective, this underscores the need to assess irrigation practices beyond the traditional objectives of maximizing yield and water use efficiency by also considering their climate impact from soil GHG emissions. To address this gap, we frame climate‐smart irrigation as a multi‐objective optimization problem and derive a dual‐index framework for evaluating irrigation practices across productivity, water consumption, and climate impact dimensions. The Marginal Irrigation Water Productivity (MIWP) index quantifies additional yield per unit of irrigation water, while the Marginal Irrigation Climate Impact (MICI) index measures the associated changes in soil GHG emissions. We apply this dual‐index framework to wheat and rice field irrigation studies with varying soil GHG compositions, showing its ability to assess irrigation across different crop systems. Crop model simulations further demonstrate how different irrigation practices are mapped within the MIWP‐MICI space, where Pareto‐optimal solutions highlight trade‐offs between productivity and climate impact goals. Our approach provides a consistent, quantitative basis for comparing irrigation across multiple dimensions of climate‐smart irrigation."

 Despite the adoption of the Paris Agreement ten years ago, fossil CO2 emissions continue to rise, pushing atmospheric CO2 levels to 423 ppm in 2024 and driving human-induced warming to 1.36°C, within years of breaching the 1.5°C limit 1,2. Accurate reporting of anthropogenic and natural CO2 sources and sinks is a prerequisite to tracking the effectiveness of climate policy and detecting carbon sink responses to climate change. Yet notable mismatches between reported emissions and sinks have so far prevented confident interpretation of their trends and drivers 1. Here, we present and integrate recent advances in observations and process understanding to address some long-standing issues in the global carbon budget estimates. We show that the magnitude of the natural land sink is substantially smaller than previously estimated, while net emissions from anthropogenic land-use change are revised upwards 1. The ocean sink is 15% larger than the land sink, consistent with new evidence from oceanic and atmospheric observations 3,4. Climate change reduces the efficiency of the sinks, particularly on land, contributing 8.3 ± 1.4 ppm to the atmospheric CO2 increase since 1960. The combined effects of climate change and deforestation turn Southeast Asian and large parts of South American tropical forests from CO2 sinks to sources. This underscores the need to halt deforestation and limit warming to prevent further loss of carbon stored on land. Improved confidence in assessments of CO2 sources and sinks is fundamental for effective climate policy."

 Chirality is central to life, and controlling the formation of one of a pair of mirror-image molecules (enantiomers) is a central tenet of synthetic chemistry. Although controlling stereogenic carbon1–3, silicon4,5, phosphorus6,7 and sulfur8,9 centres is commonplace, nitrogen centres in amines are not typically stable. Limited achievements in the enantioselective construction of nitrogen chirality have primarily been established in quaternary ammonium salts10–12 and bridged bicyclic amines13–17, which have a restricted pyramidal configuration. The asymmetric synthesis of non-bridged pyramidal nitrogen-chirogenic compounds suffers from a super-stoichiometric chiral source and exhibits poor stereoselectivity18–24. Here we present a catalytic enantioselective strategy for construction of acyclic nitrogen stereocentres via a chiral Brønsted acid-catalysed chlorination reaction. We designed a stereospecific intramolecular reaction to overcome the structural and configurational instabilities of nitrogen-chlorinated hydroxylamines. The resulting 2-alkoxy-1,2-oxazolidines showed good enantiopurities, and density functional theory calculations confirmed successful enantiocontrol of nitrogen chirality during the chlorination process. Furthermore, this strategy has been applied successfully to synthesize the enantioselective N-chloroaziridines with a configurationally stable nitrogen stereogenic centre. Control experiments provide evidence for an SN2 pathway for the intramolecular nucleophilic substitution event. An asymmetric organocatalysis strategy is used to control pyramidal nitrogen chirality and to synthesize the enantioselective N-chloroaziridines with a configurationally stable nitrogen stereogenic centre."

 Axons in the adult central nervous system (CNS) do not regenerate following injury, in contrast to neurons in the peripheral nervous system and neuronal growth during embryonic development. The molecular mechanisms that prevent regeneration of neurons in the CNS remain largely unknown1,2. Here, to address the intracellular response to injury, we developed an in situ cryo-electron tomography and cryo-electron microscopy platform to mimic axonal damage and present the structural mechanism underlying thalamic axon regeneration induced by the drug epothilone B. We observed that stabilized microtubules extend beyond the injury site, generating membrane tension and driving membrane expansion. Cryo-electron microscopy reveals the in situ structure of microtubules at 3.19 Å resolution, which engage epothilone B within the microtubule lattice at the regenerating front. During repair, tubulin clusters are delivered and incorporated into polymerizing microtubules at the regenerating site. These microtubule shoots serve as scaffolds for various types of vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum, facilitating the supply of materials necessary for axon repair until membrane tension normalizes. We demonstrate the unexpected ability of neuronal cells to adjust to strain induced by epothilone B, which creates homeostatic imbalances and activates axons to regeneration mode.

 Since late 2021, a panzootic of highly pathogenic H5N1 has devastated wild birds, agriculture and mammals. Here an analysis of 1,818 haemagglutinin sequences from wild birds, domestic birds and mammals reveals that the North American panzootic was driven by around nine introductions into the Atlantic and Pacific flyways, followed by rapid dissemination through wild, migratory birds. Transmission was primarily driven by Anseriformes, while non-canonical species acted as dead-end hosts. In contrast to the epizootic of 2015 (refs. 1,2), outbreaks in domestic birds were driven by around 46–113 independent introductions from wild birds that persisted for up to 6 months. Backyard birds were infected around 9 days earlier on average than commercial poultry, suggesting potential as early-warning signals for transmission upticks. We pinpoint wild birds as critical drivers of the epizootic, implying that enhanced surveillance in wild birds and strategies that reduce transmission at the wild–agriculture interface will be key for future tracking and outbreak prevention.

 Rare coding variants shape inter-individual differences in human phenotypes1. However, the contribution of rare non-coding variants to those differences remains poorly characterized. Here we analyse whole-genome sequence (WGS) data from 347,630 individuals with European ancestry in the UK Biobank2,3 to quantify the relative contribution of 40 million single-nucleotide and short indel variants (with a minor allele frequency (MAF) larger than 0.01%) to the heritability of 34 complex traits and diseases. On average across phenotypes, we find that WGS captures approximately 88% of the pedigree-based narrow sense heritability: that is, 20% from rare variants (MAF < 1%) and 68% from common variants (MAF ≥ 1%). We show that coding and non-coding genetic variants account for 21% and 79% of the rare-variant WGS-based heritability, respectively. We identified 15 traits with no significant difference between WGS-based and pedigree-based heritability estimates, suggesting their heritability is fully accounted for by WGS data. Finally, we performed genome-wide association analyses of all 34 phenotypes and, overall, identified 11,243 common-variant associations and 886 rare-variant associations. Altogether, our study provides high-precision estimates of rare-variant heritability, explains the heritability of many phenotypes and demonstrates for lipid traits that more than 25% of rare-variant heritability can be mapped to specific loci using fewer than 500,000 fully sequenced genomes.

 Crohn’s disease often presents with fistulae, abnormal tunnels that connect the intestine to the skin or other organs. Despite their profound effect on morbidity, the molecular basis of fistula formation remains unclear, largely owing to the challenge of capturing intact fistula tracts and their inherent heterogeneity1–3. Here we construct a subcellular-resolution spatial atlas of 68 intestinal fistulae spanning diverse anatomical locations. We describe fistula-associated epithelial, immune and stromal cell states, revealing abnormal zonation of growth factors and morphogens linked to establishment of tunnelling anatomy. We identify fistula-associated stromal (FAS) fibroblasts, which are assembled in concentric layers: a proliferative, lumen-adjacent zone beneath neutrophil and macrophage-rich granulation tissue, an active lesion core of FAS cells and a quiescent, pro-fibrotic outer zone. We examine the architecture of the extracellular matrix in the fistula tract and demonstrate that FAS populations associate with distinct collagen structures, exhibiting properties ranging from proliferation, migration and extracellular matrix remodelling to dense collagen deposition and fibrosis. We define niches supporting epithelialization of fistula tunnels and a FAS-like population that is detected at the base of ulcers in non-penetrating Crohn’s disease. Our study demonstrates that common molecular pathways and cellular niches underpin fistulae across intestinal locations, revealing the cellular protagonists of fistula establishment and persistence. This resource will inform the development of model systems and interventions to mitigate aberrant fibroblast activity while preserving their regenerative properties in Crohn’s disease.

 Florigen, encoded by FT genes, is synthesized in leaves and transported to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) to induce flower development1–3. At the SAM, 14-3-3 proteins are proposed to act as receptors for FT protein and to mediate the indirect interaction between FT and the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor FD to form the florigen activation complex (FAC) that activates transcription of flowering genes4–6. Here we demonstrate a different mechanism of FAC assembly, diverse functions for the 14-3-3 proteins within the complex, and an unexpected spatiotemporal distribution of the FAC. We show that FT is not recruited by 14-3-3 alone, but that it interacts with the DNA–FD–14-3-3 complex through two interfaces, one of which binds DNA via the unstructured C terminus of FT. We also find that interaction of 14-3-3 proteins with the C terminus of phosphorylated FD reduces liquid phase condensation of the intrinsically disordered FD protein, allowing it to bind DNA, and that the 14-3-3 proteins strengthen DNA binding of FD by promoting dimerization, which ultimately results in the recruitment of FT. Unexpectedly, we also find that after FT movement to the shoot apex, FT and FD are co-transcribed in young floral primordia, forming a boundary with the suppressed bract and allowing formation of the FAC during the first stages of floral development. Our studies propose a new mechanism by which the florigen FT transcriptional complex is formed, and indicate distinct functions for the complex during SAM and floral primordium development. In flowering plants, DNA–FD–14-3-3 recruits FT to the florigen activation complex both through DNA–FT interactions and by reducing liquid phase condensation of FD protein, which promotes dimerization, leading to FT recruitment."

 It has long been proposed1, and then observed2,3, that faster rates of soil production occur beneath thinner soils. It remains uncertain, however, whether soil thickness is the driving variable regulating production from the top-down2–6, or whether soil thickness is simply responding to changes in bedrock weathering controlled from the bottom-up7,8. Answering this question is difficult because the feedbacks between soil production and soil erosion, the processes that jointly govern soil thickness2,9,10, respond to perturbations on timescales of thousands to millions of years11,12, timescales that are too long for scientists to observe directly. Here we leverage a space-for-time substitution at a transient mountain range along the San Andreas Fault13–15, where the remarkable tectonic setting allows for independent quantification of uplift, soil production and erosion. We show that, following a pulse of tectonic uplift, the conversion of rock to soil accelerates before the overlying soils thin, but at the same time that topographic stresses increase7 and the rock weakens16. This observation challenges the long-standing assumption that soil production rates are controlled predominantly by soil thickness1,2, and instead lends evidence for a bottom-up, rock strength control on soil production.

 Rainfall and flooding frequently disrupt the lives of urban residents worldwide, posing substantial public health risks1,2. Rapid urbanization is exposing larger and more vulnerable populations to flooding3, while climate change intensifies rainfall patterns4,5 and rising sea levels impair drainage systems6–11. Despite the growing recognition and urgency of these hazards, the health impacts of rainfall remain poorly understood, and those of sea-level rise are entirely unquantified. Here we estimate the mortality consequences of rainfall in one of the world’s largest cities—Mumbai, India. We integrate high-resolution data on rainfall, tides and mortality to analyse how unmanaged rainfall, and its interaction with tidal dynamics, contribute to urban health risks. We find that rainfall causes more than 8% of Mumbai’s deaths during the monsoon season, and that more than 80% of this burden is borne by slum residents. Children face the biggest increase in mortality risk from rainfall, and women face a greater risk than men. We also demonstrate that mortality risk from rainfall increases sharply during high tides and use this relationship to evaluate how rising sea levels could amplify rainfall-induced mortality in the absence of adaptation. Our findings reveal that the mortality impacts of rainfall are an order of magnitude larger than is documented by official statistics12,13, highlighting the urgent need for investment in improved drainage, sanitation and waste-management infrastructure.

 Deep neural networks have achieved success across a wide range of applications, including as models of human behaviour and neural representations in vision tasks1,2. However, neural network training and human learning differ in fundamental ways, and neural networks often fail to generalize as robustly as humans do3,4, raising questions regarding the similarity of their underlying representations. We need to determine what is missing for modern learning systems to exhibit more human-aligned behaviour. Here we highlight a key misalignment between vision models and humans: whereas human conceptual knowledge is hierarchically organized from fine- to coarse-scale distinctions (for example, ref. 5), model representations do not accurately capture all these levels of abstraction. To address this misalignment, we first train a teacher model to imitate human judgements, then transfer human-aligned structure from its representations to refine the representations of pretrained state-of-the-art vision foundation models via fine-tuning. These human-aligned models more accurately approximate human behaviour and uncertainty across a wide range of similarity tasks, including a dataset of human judgements spanning multiple levels of semantic abstractions. They also perform better on a diverse set of machine learning tasks, increasing generalization and out-of-distribution robustness. Thus, infusing neural networks with additional human knowledge yields a best-of-both-worlds representation that is both more consistent with human cognitive judgements and more practically useful, paving the way towards more robust, interpretable and human-aligned artificial intelligence systems. Aligning foundation models with human judgments enables them to more accurately approximate human behaviour and uncertainty across various levels of visual abstraction, while additionally improving their generalization performance."

 Two-dimensional moiré materials are formed by artificially stacking atomically thin monolayers. Correlated and topological quantum phases can be engineered by precise choice of stacking geometry1–3. These designer electronic properties depend crucially on interlayer coupling and atomic registry4,5. An open question is how the atomic registry responds on ultrafast timescales to optical excitation and whether the moiré geometry can be dynamically reconfigured to tune emergent phenomena in real time. Here we show that femtosecond photoexcitation drives a coherent twist–untwist motion of the moiré superlattice in 2° and 57° twisted WSe2/MoSe2 heterobilayers, resolved directly by ultrafast electron diffraction. On above-band-gap photoexcitation, the moiré superlattice diffraction features are enhanced within 1 ps and subsequently suppressed several picoseconds after, deviating markedly from typical photoinduced lattice heating. Kinetic diffraction analysis, supported by simulations of the sample dynamics, indicates a peak-to-trough local twist angle modulation of 0.6°, correlated with a sub-THz frequency moiré phonon. This motion is driven by ultrafast charge transfer that transiently increases interlayer attraction. Our results could lead to ultrafast control of moiré periodic lattice distortions and, by extension, the local moiré potential that shapes excitons, polarons and correlation-driven behaviours.

 Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb–Robinson bound for information propagation1,2, often lead to breakthroughs in the understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during the formation of a weakly interacting Bose–Einstein condensate3–18. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas19,20 that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the interatomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, at which the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck’s constant and the particle mass, or, equivalently, by the quantum of velocity circulation associated with a quantum vortex. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium21–34, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other systems. Experiments reveal a speed limit for the spreading of spatial coherence during the formation of a weakly interacting Bose–Einstein condensate."

 Silicon solar cells are essential for sustainable energy but remain limited by efficiency losses, particularly in the fill factor1–3. Here we develop a hybrid interdigitated back-contact solar cell that combines advanced all-surface passivation with laser-treated tunnelling contacts. This approach achieves a power conversion efficiency of 27.81%, approaching 95% of the theoretical limit4. By integrating high- and low-temperature processes, we suppress recombination and enhance contact performance, achieving a fill factor of 87.55%—nearly 98% of the theoretical limit.

 Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a childhood-onset neurodevelopmental disorder with a large genetic component1. It affects around 5% of children and 2.5% of adults2, and is associated with several severe outcomes3–11. Common genetic variants associated with the disorder have been identified12,13, but the role of rare variants in ADHD is mostly unknown. Here, by analysing rare coding variants in exome-sequencing data from 8,895 individuals with ADHD and 53,780 control individuals, we identify three genes (MAP1A, ANO8 and ANK2; P < 3.07 × 10−6; odds ratios 5.55–15.13) that are implicated in ADHD. The protein–protein interaction networks of these three genes were enriched for rare-variant risk genes of other neurodevelopmental disorders, and for genes involved in cytoskeleton organization, synapse function and RNA processing. Top associated rare-variant risk genes showed increased expression across pre- and postnatal brain developmental stages and in several neuronal cell types, including GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric-acid-producing) and dopaminergic neurons. Deleterious variants were associated with lower socioeconomic status and lower levels of education in individuals with ADHD, and a decrease of 2.25 intelligence quotient (IQ) points per rare deleterious variant in a sample of adults with ADHD (n = 962). Individuals with ADHD and intellectual disability showed an increased load of rare variants overall, whereas other psychiatric comorbidities had an increased load only for specific gene sets associated with those comorbidities. This suggests that psychiatric comorbidity in ADHD is driven mainly by rare variants in specific genes, rather than by a general increased load across constrained genes.

 The synthesis of enantiopure materials is vital for pharmaceutical and agrochemical industries owing to the inherently chiral nature of biological systems and the fact that two enantiomers can have markedly different biochemical properties1. In particular, enantioselective preparation of atropisomers is of great interest owing to their privileged status as chiral ligands and pharmacophores2–4. Although chromatographic- or crystallization-based methods are commonly used to separate atropisomers, we urgently need more efficient and economical approaches to access enantioenriched atropisomers5,6. The use of stereoconvergent methods to access molecules with point chirality is well established but we have not tapped the potential of stereoconvergent catalytic methods to arrive at enantioenriched atropisomers. Here we report deracemization activity of a P450 enzyme and explore its ability to deliver a stereoconvergent route towards enantioenriched atropisomers. Using a curated set of P450 variants, we found that a wide variety of symmetric and non-symmetrically substituted 2,2′-binaphthol (BINOL) building blocks can be deracemized to high enantiomeric purity. This deracemization activity is mechanistically distinct from the activity of previously reported P450 enzymes, which operate through enantioselective bond formation to afford enantioenriched atropisomers. By contrast, the deracemization process reported here is proposed to proceed through bond rotation. As engineered variants have complementary selectivity profiles and substrate scope, this biocatalytic platform should be readily tunable for any desired substitution pattern. We anticipate that these results will inspire new stereoconvergent approaches to synthesizing conformationally stable atropisomers. A new method for deracemization of atropisomers is described which leverages a P450 enzyme-mediated process involving bond rotation for enantioenrichment."

 Gene flow between biological species is a common and often adaptive evolutionary phenomenon throughout the tree of life1–4. Given the pervasive nature of genetic exchange, a daunting challenge is how best to infer the correct relationships between species from the complex collection of histories arrayed across genomes5. The local rate of meiotic recombination influences the distribution of signatures of, and barriers to, gene flow during the early stages of speciation6. Still, a broader understanding of this relationship and its application to accurately discerning phylogeny is lacking due to a scarcity of recombination maps. Here we applied deep learning methods to genome alignments from 22 divergent placental mammal species to infer the evolution of the recombination landscape. We identified a large and evolutionarily conserved X-linked recombination desert constituting 30% of the chromosome. Recombination-aware phylogenomic analyses from 94 species revealed that the X-linked recombination desert is an ancient and recurrent barrier to gene flow and retains the species history when introgression dominates genome-wide ancestry. The functional basis for this supergene is manifold, enriched with genes that influence sex chromosome silencing and reproduction traits. Because the locus underpins reproductive isolation across ordinal lineages, it may represent a reliable marker for resolving challenging relationships across the mammalian phylogeny.

 All polymers exhibit gas permeability through the free volume of entangled polymer chains1–3. By contrast, two-dimensional (2D) materials including graphene stack densely and can exhibit molecular impermeability4–6. Solution-synthesized 2D polymers that exhibit the latter by poly-condensation have been a longstanding goal. Herein, we demonstrate self-supporting, spin-coated 2D polyaramid nanofilms that exhibit nitrogen permeability below 3.1 × 10−9 Barrer, nearly four orders of magnitude lower than every class of existing polymer, and similar for other gases tested (helium, argon, oxygen, methane and sulfur hexafluoride). Optical interference during the pressurization of nanofilm-coated microwells allows measurement of mechanosensitive rim opening and sealing, creating gas-filled bulges that are stable exceeding three years. This discovery enables 2D polymer resonators with high resonance frequencies (about 8 MHz) and quality factors up to 537, similar to graphene. A 60-nm coating of air-sensitive perovskites reduces the lattice degradation rate 14-fold with an oxygen permeability of 3.3 × 10−8 Barrer.

 Acetyl-coenzyme A (AcCoA) sits at the nexus of nutrient metabolism and shuttles between the canonical and non-canonical tricarboxylic acid cycle1,2, which is dynamically regulated by nutritional status, such as fasting3. Here we find that mitophagy is triggered after a reduction in cytosolic AcCoA levels through short-term fasting and through inhibition of ATP-citrate lyase (encoded by ACLY), mitochondrial citrate/malate antiporter (encoded by SLC25A1) or acyl-CoA synthetase short chain family member 2 (encoded by ACSS2), and the mitophagy can be counteracted by acetate supplementation. Notably, NOD-like receptor (NLR) family member X1 (NLRX1) mediates this effect. Disrupting NLRX1 abolishes cytosolic AcCoA reduction-induced mitophagy both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanically, the mitochondria outer-membrane-localized NLRX1 directly binds to cytosolic AcCoA within a conserved pocket on its leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. Moreover, AcCoA binds to the LRR domain and enhances its interaction with the nucleotide-binding and oligomerization (NACHT) domain, which helps to maintain NLRX1 in an autoinhibited state and prevents the association between NLRX1 and light chain 3 (LC3). Furthermore, we find that the AcCoA–NLRX1 axis underlies the KRAS-inhibitor-induced mitophagy response and promotes drug resistance, providing a metabolic mechanism of KRAS inhibitor resistance. Thus, cytosolic AcCoA is a signalling metabolite that connects metabolism to mitophagy through its receptor NLRX1. Acetyl-coenzyme A functions as a non-canonical signal to trigger mitophagy, and the acetyl-coenzyme A–NLRX1 axis underlies the KRAS-inhibitor-induced mitophagy response and promotes drug resistance, providing a metabolic mechanism of KRAS inhibitor resistance."

However, more than half of individuals suspected to have a rare disease lack a genetic diagnosis. The Genomics Research to Elucidate the Genetics of Rare Diseases (GREGoR) Consortium was initiated to study thousands of challenging rare disease cases and families and apply, standardize and evaluate emerging genomics technologies and analytics to accelerate their adoption in clinical practice. Furthermore, all data generated, currently representing over 7,500 individuals from over 3,000 families, are rapidly made available to researchers worldwide through the Analysis, Visualization and Informatics Lab-space (AnVIL) to catalyse global efforts to develop approaches for genetic diagnoses in rare diseases. Most of these families have undergone previous clinical genetic testing but remained unsolved, with most being exome-negative.

 Marine picocyanobacteria are abundant photosynthetic organisms of global importance. They coexist in the ocean with cyanophages—viruses that infect cyanobacteria. Cyanophages carry many auxiliary metabolic genes acquired from their hosts that are thought to redirect host metabolism for the phage’s benefit1–5. One such gene is nblA, which is present in multiple cyanophage families2,6–8. Under nutrient deprivation cyanobacterial NblA is responsible for inducing proteolytic degradation of the phycobilisome9–11, the large cyanobacterial photosynthetic light-harvesting complex. This increases the pool of amino acids available for essential tasks11, serving as a survival mechanism12. Ectopic expression of different cyanophage nblA genes results in host pigment protein degradation6,8,13. However, the benefit of the virus-encoded NblA for cyanophages and the broader impact on the host are unclear. Here, using a recently developed genetic manipulation system for marine cyanophages14, we reveal that viral NblA significantly accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other proteins, and reduces host photosynthetic light-harvesting efficiency. Metagenomic analysis revealed that cyanophages carrying nblA are widespread in the oceans and comprise 35% and 65% of oceanic T7-like cyanophages in surface and deep photic zones, respectively. Our results show a large benefit of NblA to the cyanophage, while it exerts a negative effect on the host photosynthetic apparatus and host photosynthesis. These findings suggest that cyanophage NblA has an adverse global impact on light harvesting by oceanic picocyanobacteria. Viral NblA accelerates the cyanophage infection cycle, directs degradation of the host phycobilisome and other proteins, and reduces host photosynthetic light-harvesting efficiency."

 Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are massive expulsions of magnetized plasma from a star and are the largest contributors to space weather in the Solar System1,2. CMEs play an important role in planetary atmospheric erosion, especially for planets that are close to their host star3–5. However, this conclusion remains controversial as there has not been an unambiguous detection of a CME from a star outside our Sun. Previous stellar CME studies have only inferred the presence of a CME through the detection of other types of stellar eruptive event6–9. A signature of a fast CME is a type II radio burst10,11, which is emitted from the shock wave produced as the CME travels through the stellar corona into interplanetary space. Here we report an analogue to a type II burst from the early M dwarf StKM 1-1262. The burst exhibits identical frequency, time and polarization properties to fundamental plasma emission from a solar type II burst.

Here we present in situ imaging proteomics via expansion (iPEX), which integrates isotropic tissue magnification2 with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry imaging. iPEX provides scalable spatial resolution down to the micrometre scale and substantially increases the sensitivity of protein identification by 10–100-fold. Using the retina as a model, iPEX enabled the construction of spatial proteomic maps with high precision, the visualization of single-cell layers and extrasomatic structures and the identification of colocalized proteins. iPEX was readily applied to diverse tissues, including brain, intestine, liver and organoids, detecting 600–1,500 proteins at 1–5-µm effective pixel size. The application of iPEX to depict spatial proteomic maps in brains of mice with 5xFAD Alzheimer’s disease revealed an early-onset mitochondrial aberrancy. Notably, in young mice, the peroxisomal acetyl-CoA acyltransferase ACAA1A—of which the N392S mutant is a monogenic risk factor in Alzheimer’s disease3—was downregulated. ACAA1 depletion blocked the biosynthesis of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, including docosahexaenoic acid, in multiple cellular contexts. These lipidome alterations were restored in cells overexpressing wild-type ACAA1 but not ACAA1(N392S), which suggests that the dysregulation of long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids has an early role in neurodegeneration. Together, these results demonstrate that iPEX facilitates untargeted spatial proteomics at micrometre resolution for diverse applications. Isotropic tissue magnification is integrated with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry imaging to enable untargeted spatial proteomics at micrometre resolution and with high protein identification rates in multiple tissue types."

J. Donoghue;Marta Álvarez-Presas;Jordi Paps,Convergent genome evolution shaped the emergence of terrestrial animals,"Comparisons of 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and outgroups have been used to reconstruct ancestral adaptation to life on land across 11 distinct terrestrialization events, revealing strong evidence for convergent genomic evolution across the animal kingdom and recurring periods of terrestrial colonization. 
 The challenges associated with the transition of life from water to land are profound1, yet they have been met in many distinct animal lineages2–5. These constitute a series of independent evolutionary experiments from which we can decipher the role of contingency versus convergence in the adaptation of animal genomes. Here we compare 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and their outgroups to reconstruct the protein-coding content of the ancestral genomes linked to 11 animal terrestrialization events, and to produce a timescale of terrestrialization. We uncover distinct patterns of gene gain and loss underlying each transition to land, but similar biological functions emerged recurrently pointing to specific adaptations as key to life on land. We show that semi-terrestrial species evolved convergent functional patterns, in contrast with fully terrestrial lineages that followed different paths to land. Our timeline supports three temporal windows of land colonization by animals during the last 487 million years, each associated with specific ecological contexts. Although each lineage exhibits distinct adaptations, there is strong evidence of convergent genome evolution across the animal kingdom suggesting that, in large part, adaptation to life on land is predictable, linking genes to ecosystems. Comparisons of 154 genomes from 21 animal phyla and outgroups have been used to reconstruct ancestral adaptation to life on land across 11 distinct terrestrialization events, revealing strong evidence for convergent genomic evolution across the animal kingdom and recurring periods of terrestrial colonization."

 Necroptosis is a form of lytic cell death that is overactivated during infections and in inflammatory pathologies1. NINJ1 was recently found to be a mediator of plasma membrane rupture (PMR) during pyroptosis, toxin-induced necrosis, apoptosis, and ferroptosis2,3, but the mediator of PMR during necroptotic cell death remained unknown. Here, using a CRISPR–Cas9-based genome-wide knockout approach, we identify SIGLEC12 as a key mediator of necroptosis downstream of MLKL at the PMR step. Cells with knockdown or knockout of SIGLEC12 are defective in necroptosis-induced PMR and demonstrate ballooning morphology. During necroptosis, SIGLEC12 undergoes dephosphorylation, interacts with MLKL, forms cytosolic puncta and assembles into fibrils. Notably, SIGLEC12 is cleaved by TMPRSS4 during necroptosis to produce a 20-kDa fragment highly homologous to NINJ1, and this cleavage event is required and sufficient to induce PMR during necroptosis. A SIGLEC12 variant associated with cancer (Ser458Phe) and a variant found in the general human population (Arg528Trp) attenuate SIGLEC12 cleavage by TMPRSS4. Knockout of Siglec12 in mouse cells does not affect PMR, suggesting a species-specific role. Our identification of SIGLEC12 as a mediator of PMR expands our understanding of how programmed necrosis is executed and offers new approaches for targeting this proinflammatory form of cell death in human diseases. CRISPR–Cas9-based genome-wide screening shows that SIGLEC12 mediates plasma membrane rupture in cells undergoing necroptosis, possibly through a human-specific mechanism, indicating its potential as a therapeutic target."

 Precise construction of molecular chirality is a longstanding scientific challenge in synthetic chemistry. Although methods to enantioselectively assemble consecutive carbon stereocenters are abundant, courses to establish enriched continuous heteroatomic stereocenters have acquired less attention and remain a tremendous challenge. Of those atoms in main group elements, nitrogen and boron are the most intractable ones to control their chirality. The copper-catalyzed asymmetric insertion reaction is one of the most significant transformations to construct C-B bonds in organic synthesis.

 Trypanosoma cruzi possesses hundreds of genes associated with pathogenesis. The extent and organization of this diverse gene repertoire, expression, and role in infection remain unclear. Using accurate long-read sequencing and chromatin conformation capture, we assembled T. cruzi Sylvio X10 strain chromosomes from telomere-to-telomere. The genome provides accurate organization of multigene family genes, confirming their distribution in expanded clusters or scattered throughout the chromosomes. Quantitative proteomics shows stage-specific proteins and numerous trans-sialidases upregulated in trypomastigotes. The expression of virulence gene families varied in trypomastigotes after each round of cell infection, resulting in heterogeneous parasite populations with variable cell invasion capacity. A T. cruzi genome-wide yeast surface display screen against Chagas disease patients’ antibodies reveals genes expressed during human infections. However, limited conservation in their antibody-binding sites suggests their sequence diversity and variation might help parasites avert antibody recognition.

Here, the authors show that YTHDF2 recognizes m6A-modified U6 snRNA to prevent aberrant TLR3 activation to inhibit inflammation and skin cancer development. 
 The role of m6A RNA methylation of self non-coding RNA remains poorly understood. Here we show that m6A-methylated self U6 snRNA is recognized by YTHDF2 to reduce its stability and prevent its binding to Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), leading to decreased inflammatory responses in human and mouse cells and mouse models. At the molecular level, endosomal U6 snRNA binds to the LRR21 domain in TLR3, independent of m6A methylation, to activate inflammatory gene expression, a mechanism that is distinct from that of the best known synthetic TLR3 agonist poly I:C. Both U6 snRNA and YTHDF2 are localized to endosomes via the transmembrane protein SIDT2, where YTHDF2 functions to prevent the U6-TLR3 interaction. We further show that UVB exposure inhibits YTHDF2 by inducing its dephosphorylation and autophagic protein degradation in human keratinocytes and mouse skin. Skin-specific deletion of Ythdf2 in mice enhanced the UVB-induced skin inflammatory response and promoted tumor initiation. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that YTHDF2 plays a crucial role in controlling inflammation by inhibiting m6A U6-mediated TLR3 activation, suggesting that YTHDF2 and m6A U6 are potential therapeutic targets for preventing and treating inflammation and tumorigenesis.

 Plasmids carrying the mobilized colistin-resistance gene mcr-1 are prevalent among multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogens, yet their broad impact on bacterial physiology and virulence remains unclear. Here, we demonstrate that acquisition of an mcr-1 plasmid concurrently increases antimicrobial resistance and pathogenicity in Escherichia coli. On the same plasmid, the XRE-family transcriptional regulator EcaR cooperates with MCR-1 to activate the wec operon, driving biosynthesis of two surface polysaccharides: enterobacterial common antigen (ECA) and a high-molecular-weight O-chain. Expression of these surface polysaccharides increases bile resistance and virulence in a murine model and further elevates colistin resistance. MCR-1 enhances transcription of upstream genes in the wec operon, whereas EcaR directly activates an internal promoter (PwecE) to induce downstream gene expression. Thus, both components are required for surface polysaccharide expression, and deletion of either abolishes the phenotype. Genomic analysis of publicly available mcr plasmids reveals widespread co-occurrence of mcr-1 and ecaR on IncI2 and IncX4 plasmids, indicating their functional complementarity. These findings uncover a mechanism by which resistance plasmids remodel the bacterial surface, linking horizontal gene transfer to coordinated regulation of antimicrobial resistance and virulence. In this work, authors show that colistin-resistance plasmids in Escherichia coli, via MCR-1 and a plasmid-encoded regulator, upregulate surface polysaccharide synthesis, enhancing antibiotic resistance and virulence and defining a mechanistic link between resistance and pathogenicity."

Here the authors design an electrochromic organogel for stable electrochromic windows. 
 Electrochromic (EC) devices based on structurally designable and color-tunable EC molecules can dynamically regulate light-heat transmittance via the charge-transfer mechanism, yet face challenges of limited near-infrared (NIR) absorption, long-term instability, and restricted modulation modes. Here, we show that π-stacking of heteroaromatic tri-pyridine molecules with a 1,3,5-triazine core (H-TriPy) enhances molecular conjugation, significantly augments NIR absorption, and enables dual-band modulation with improved visual comfort. The three pyridine-based redox centers facilitate multi-step electron transfer, enabling multi-modal EC regulation, including bright, cool, and dark modes. Incorporation of a fluorinated ionic liquid into EC organogels inhibits irreversible π-stacking of high-concentration H-TriPy. Consequently, H-TriPy-based EC devices achieve neutral-colored states with near-zero transmittance as low as 3.7% in both visible and NIR ranges and maintain high switching stability of over 89.1% retention after 100,000 cycles. Furthermore, large-area EC devices exhibit uniform tinting and reliable stability, underscoring their potential for energy-efficient green buildings.

Here, authors show how CLMB uses a composite motif to form multimeric complexes with calcineurin that are required for dephosphorylation. 
 Calcineurin, the Ca2+/calmodulin-activated protein phosphatase, recognizes substrates and regulators via short linear motifs, PxIxIT and LxVP, which dock to distinct sites on calcineurin to determine enzyme distribution and catalysis, respectively. Calcimembrin/C16orf74 (CLMB), an intrinsically disordered microprotein whose expression correlates with poor cancer outcomes, targets calcineurin to membranes where it may promote oncogenesis by shaping calcineurin signaling. We show that CLMB associates with membranes via lipidation, i.e., N-myristoylation and reversible S-acylation. Furthermore, CLMB contains an unusual composite ‘LxVPxIxIT’ motif, that binds the PxIxIT-docking site on calcineurin with extraordinarily high affinity when phosphorylated, 33LDVPDIIITPP(p)T44. Calcineurin dephosphorylates CLMB to decrease this affinity, but Thr44 is protected from dephosphorylation when PxIxIT-bound. We propose that CLMB is dephosphorylated in multimeric complexes, where one PxIxIT-bound CLMB recruits calcineurin to membranes, allowing a second CLMB to engage via its LxVP motif to be dephosphorylated. In vivo and in vitro data, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses of CLMB-calcineurin complexes, support this model. Thus, CLMB with its composite motif imposes distinct properties to calcineurin signaling at membranes including sensitivity to CLMB:calcineurin ratios, CLMB phosphorylation and dynamic S-acylation.

This work develops a titanium alloy exhibiting active passivation behavior that ensures its electrochemical and mechanical stability in seawater-like environments. 
 Titanium alloys represent a promising material in marine applications, focusing on high-stakes environments where their corrosion resistance and high specific strength offer significant benefits. However, they can still be vulnerable to localized corrosion, such as pitting corrosion and stress corrosion cracking, in the presence of aggressive chlorides. Here we report a lightweight titanium alloy that addresses these issues through conventional casting and thermal-mechanical processing. The alloy can generate a passive film showing distinct but stable electrochemical responses. It is found that the reaction of the passive film can shift from the slow accumulation in the passive region, to the rapid buildup of passive layers in extreme anodic potentials. Consequently, the alloy exhibits a pitting potential above 10 VSCE without being subjected to localized corrosion. Meanwhile, mechanical reliability is also achieved during stress corrosion tests, owing to the fast repair of the passive film that substantially constrains the crack propagation. Such virtual immunity to seawater corrosion qualifies this titanium alloy as a potential candidate for long-term cost savings and sustainability. Seawater corrosion can impact the lifespan and reliability of metallic materials for marine applications. This work develops a titanium alloy exhibiting active passivation behavior that ensures its electrochemical and mechanical stability in seawater-like environments."

 Artificial light pollution is increasing worldwide with pervasive effects on ecosystem structure and function, yet its influence on ecosystem metabolism remains largely unknown. Here we combine artificial light at night (ALAN) intensity metrics with eddy covariance observations across 86 sites in North America and Europe to show that ALAN indirectly decreases annual net ecosystem exchange by enhancing ecosystem respiration (Re). At half-hourly and daily scales, we detect consistent nonlinear interactions between ALAN and night duration, with Re increasing under higher ALAN and partially decoupling from gross primary production. At the annual scale, gross primary production shows no direct ALAN response and is instead influenced by the growing season length and urban proximity, whereas Re responds more strongly and consistently across timescales. Our findings show that ALAN disrupts the fundamental energetic constraints on ecosystem metabolism, warranting the inclusion of light pollution in global change and carbon–climate feedback assessments.

 In the Arctic, substantial amounts of methane are stored in marine sediments. Yet, the distribution and stability of methane reservoirs is poorly understood, especially offshore Greenland. As Arctic warming accelerates, understanding natural methane seepage is crucial for assessing its role in the carbon cycle and climate impact. Here, we present a unique interdisciplinary geoscientific data set that spans the ice-covered Northeast Greenland shelf and captures entire fluid flow systems from source to sink. Our data documents widespread natural seepage of oil and gas from the seafloor through the water column, locally reaching the sea surface. The released hydrocarbons are sourced from deep petroleum systems and primarily migrate along permeable beds towards the seafloor. Glacial erosion during the Quaternary has effectively removed the sealing units, creating geologic windows that allow widespread natural seepage.

 Decreasing fish catch threatens the food security and livelihoods of coral reef–dependent communities. However, coastal food systems are too often managed through the narrow lens of fish production, while accessibility also matters. Here, using small-scale fishery, socioeconomic, and interview data from five coastal districts of Palawan, Philippines, we show that fish consumption—an important driver of nutrition security, since energy, protein, and micronutrient intakes depend on the amount and type of fish consumed by residents—is not correlated with production, as a large share of the catch is exported, particularly reef fish. Pelagic and soft-bottom–associated species, on the other hand, are less frequently exported, cheaper, and locally preferred, making them a vital food safety net. We suggest that coral reef fisheries and blue food management should take into account species differences and post-harvest processes to ensure more equitable food outcomes for coastal communities.

 The encroachment of human settlements into wildland areas has expanded the Wildland-Urban Interface (WUI), disrupting ecosystems and increasing wildfire risks. A systematic mapping of woody vegetation and building structures across the wildland-urban continuum is critical for fire risk and ecosystem service assessment, fuel management, conservation, and land use planning. The highly heterogeneous and dynamic nature of this landscape requires a fine-scale monitoring approach. Although machine learning and computer vision have advanced land cover classification using very high resolution imagery (VHR), most studies either focus on identifying only a particular object or a limited study area. We here developed a unified semantic segmentation deep learning model (U-Net) to map trees, shrubs, and building footprints at 0.6 m resolution using the open-source VHR multispectral imagery from the National Aerial Imaging Program (NAIP) for the state of California. A semi-automatic labeling process was adapted to generate a large set of labels for model training and testing with available aerial LiDAR surveys. The validation showed robust performance of the trained U-Net model in predicting canopy-scale trees and shrubs as well as buildings, achieving an overall accuracy of 87.1% and F1 scores of 83.1% for trees and 78.9% for shrubs across different years. Further evaluation demonstrated that this approach captured the fine-scale spatial arrangement of woody vegetation and buildings, and the temporal vegetation dynamics from selective logging, regrowth, and tree mortality following wildfire. The model’s scalability was also shown for county and statewide mapping. Given the availability of open-access NAIP imagery every 2–3 years over the continental US, our scalable approach provides a sub-meter monitoring tool and data to improve ecological and building assessment and fire simulation. These capabilities support adaptive land management to mitigate WUI fire risk and ultimately promote fire-safe communities and resilient ecosystems along the WUI-wildland gradient."

 Evaluations of model- and reanalysis-based surface solar radiation (SSR) products often depend on satellite-derived estimates, which can be biased, particularly under broken-cloud conditions or over high-albedo surfaces. In this study, we first evaluated JAXA’s Himawari satellite SSR against ground-based observations. We then combined sparse but accurate ground measurements with high-resolution meteorological data to train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model that captures and spatiotemporally extrapolates the systematic bias between satellite SSR and ground truth data. Our model is physics-informed, interpretable via feature-attribution analyses, and generalizes across snow-covered terrain. Applying this correction over Japan, we achieved close spatial pattern alignment with a distinct ground-based gridded SSR dataset, which further allowed us to examine the spatial transferability of the correction method. Finally, we used the bias-corrected satellite SSR data to assess a novel high-resolution regional reanalysis, and found that the reanalysis data reproduce expected spatial patterns and overall SSR magnitudes well but tend to slightly overestimate the SSR data under cloudy skies. However, especially under clear skies, the reanalysis remains valuable for refining bias-corrected satellite SSR data in certain high-altitude mountainous regions, where our machine learning model struggles to extrapolate. Overall, the proposed method shows promise for application across platforms and regions, enabling more reliable datasets for climate assessment and downscaling."

 Aerosol water-uptake behavior affects aerosol remote sensing and prediction of visibility, cloud processes, and phenomena sensitive to aerosol liquid water such as heterogeneous chemistry. Aerosol hygroscopic properties are not well characterized seasonally over marine regions, including the northwest Atlantic. The NASA Aerosol Cloud meTeorology Interactions oVer the western ATlantic Experiment (ACTIVATE) conducted aircraft measurements over the northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWAO) with two spatially coordinated aircraft to better understand aerosol-cloud interactions in the region. A statistically dense set of observations of aerosol particle hygroscopicity, composition, size, and optical properties were strategically made below, in, and above boundary layer clouds with instruments on board an HU-25 Falcon aircraft from 2021 to 2022. Results show that median submicron aerosol hygroscopicity f(RH), comparing light scattering at <40 % and 82 % relative humidity, is highest in the winter (1.40 with lower to upper quartiles of 1.21–1.63) over the NWAO, and generally higher farther offshore around clouds as compared to closer to the coast where it is more cloud-free. Higher f(RH) coincides with enhanced inorganic mass fraction, which is dominated by accumulation mode sulfate. In Bermuda, median submicron f(RH) (1.20) is lower than typical clean marine environments, coinciding with transported dust particles. Though f(RH) generally decreases with altitude, there is a slight increase at cloud level presumed to be due to cloud processes related to sulfate, nitrate, and oxidized organics. Our study shows the need to further characterize the variety of processes affecting aerosol hygroscopicity in the NWAO and their impacts on clouds."

 High-resolution retrospective simulations of air quality can generate O3 and PM2.5 concentrations to estimate their health effects and establish a baseline to assess the impacts of future climate and emission scenarios. To this end, the Weather Research and Forecasting Model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) is applied to a triple-nested domain over Brazil, with a high spatial resolution of 3-km over the metropolitan areas of São Paulo (MASP) and Rio de Janeiro (MARJ) for the period of 2012–2016. This work is presented in two-part papers. Part I describes an initial application and evaluation of WRF-Chem for August 2012 to study the impacts of improved inputs and wind speed correction parameterization options on the model performance. These simulations aim to improve the model's accuracy in reproducing the observed meteorological variables and air pollutant levels. The model results with updated land use and cover and urban fraction show a lower positive bias in temperature at 2-m. Updated elevation based on high-resolution (30-m) data reduces the positive bias on wind speed at 10-m for MARJ. The modified wind speed correction reduces the systematic bias of wind speed at 10-m for all domains. WRF-Chem using the combined emissions based on global and local inventories performs well with lower bias and better temporal and spatial representations of historical concentrations of major air pollutants than those using global emissions only. These sensitivity simulations identify the best possible model inputs and wind speed correction parameterization option for simulations for the period of 2012–2016, which will be presented in Part II paper."

 Co-evolving emission controls and a warming climate are reshaping urban air quality. However, the relative weight of these two forces on air pollution trends remains insufficiently quantified over multi-decadal horizons. Here a robust machine learning framework is employed to disentangle weather-driven variability from anthropogenic emission changes, using 32 years of hourly air quality measurements collected at multiple monitoring stations in Vienna, Austria (1991–2022). The investigation focuses on ground-level ozone (O3), nitrogen dioxide (NO2), and total oxidants (Ox, defined as O3 + NO2). Predictive random forest models, incorporating an extensive set of predictors, were rigorously validated using growing-window forward-validation to preserve chronological order. Results indicate NO2 reductions across all monitoring sites, with sharper decreases in daily maximum values compared to daily means, which suggests that pollution-control measures have been especially effective at curbing high-exposure events. In contrast, O3 trends display marked spatial variation: increasing within built-up areas mostly due to reduced chemical removal (titration), but declining on the city's natural outskirts. Satellite HCHO/NO2 column ratios corroborate the intra-city coexistence of different photochemical regimes. By separating the meteorology-driven fraction of pollutant variability, empirical evidence is found for a dual climate change impact in Central European urban air quality: ongoing warming increasingly favours O3 accumulation (a climate change penalty), while promoting NO2 dispersion (a climate change benefit). These insights suggest the need for spatially targeted emission strategies accounting for local chemistry and underscore that a stronger integration of climate change into air quality management policy and practice is essential."

 Based on daily precipitation data from the China Meteorological Administration and reanalysis data from the Japan Meteorological Agency during 1979–2023, this study finds that the synoptic-scale disturbances and the quasi-biweekly oscillation (QBWO) have crucial influence on the spring rainy season onset (RSO) over southern China. Pronounced changes in precipitation are identified before and after the RSO dates on both synoptic and quasi-biweekly timescales, associated with distinct atmospheric circulations. On the synoptic timescale, the RSO is typically preceded by the development of a lower-tropospheric cyclone and a mid-tropospheric baroclinic trough to the west of southern China, enhancing moisture transport from the South China Sea. Meanwhile, on the quasi-biweekly timescale, the key circulation features consist of a broad quasi-barotropic cyclone encircling the Tibetan Plateau and a corresponding anticyclone over the Bay of Bengal in the lower and middle troposphere, jointly facilitating moisture advection from the Arabian Sea. These systems amplify geostrophic relative vorticity anomalies over East Asia and sharpen the zonal gradient of relative vorticity, thereby contributing to upward motion through dynamic processes. From a thermodynamic perspective, the intensification of the cyclone to the west of southern China strengthens southerly winds, which promotes warm air advection and further reinforces vertical ascent. The synergy between these dynamic and thermodynamic processes sustain ascending motion, thereby facilitating the RSO in conjunction with enhanced low-level moisture transport. Clarifying the circulation characteristics triggering the RSO will aid in better predicting the start of the local rainy season in both weather forecasts and extended-range outlooks, then guiding spring farming activities."

In June 2024, extreme heavy rainfall struck regions south of the Yangtze River (SYR) in China, marking the highest precipitation anomaly of the corresponding period near Dongting Lake since 1961. This led to the year's first flood of Dongting Lake and a levee breach in Huarong County, causing substantial damage to agricultural fields, infrastructure facilities, and residential areas. Regarding external sea surface temperature (SST) forcing, the elevated SSTs in the tropical North Atlantic and Indian Ocean combined with cold SSTs in the eastern equatorial Pacific contributed to this extreme rainfall, with the Indian Ocean playing a dominant role. In terms of internal atmospheric variability, the boreal summer intraseasonal oscillation (BSISO) subsequently triggered subseasonal precipitation anomalies and further intensified precipitation during late June 2024. A global climate model (BCC_CPSv3) initialized in May produced a northward deviation in the heavy rainfall belt in June 2024. Through dynamical downscaling, the regional climate model (CWRF) improved the spatial distribution of the precipitation prediction. This improvement was primarily attributed to the more realistic representation of warmer SSTs in the Bay of Bengal and the South China Sea, and their relationships with precipitation in the regional model. A U-Net model based on the nonlinear relationship between circulation and precipitation was employed to pinpoint the circulation sources of prediction skill and error in the regional model. The experimental results revealed that the prediction skill of CWRF for precipitation in the SYR region during June 2024 stemmed mainly from its accurate representation of lower-tropospheric meridional wind. However, its simulation of lower-tropospheric humidity remains inadequate and requires further improvement."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108613,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注沿海季风城市大气中多环芳烃（PAHs）的季节性动态和跨界传输。虽然没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它与大气环境监测密切相关，因为它探讨了大气成分（特别是PAHs）的来源、分布和影响因素。研究使用了PMF、PSCF和XGBoost等方法来识别污染源和评估其贡献，这与利用遥感数据进行空气质量分析和源解析的思路相符。此外，论文还涉及PAHs的跨区域传输，这与利用卫星数据追踪污染物扩散的研究方向相关。因此，尽管没有直接使用遥感技术，但该研究对大气环境遥感监测具有一定的参考价值。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'PAHs', 'source apportionment', 'transboundary transport', 'PMF', 'PSCF', 'XGBoost']",Haolong Zhang;Zheng Zhang;Wenhui Lin;Guohui Lin;Cheng Luo;Ting Fang;Nemin Luo;Minggang Cai;Lei Wang;Bin Yan;Yan Lin,Disentangling seasonal dynamics and transboundary transport of PAHs in a coastal monsoon city,"•Seasonal shift observed between gas- and particle-phase PAHs in coastal China. •Coal and gasoline emissions dominated wintertime PAH toxicity. •66 % of PAHs traced to northern China and Southeast Asia via SRA and PSCF. •XGBoost-SHAP revealed ring-dependent PAH responses to environmental driver. 
 Atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) pose serious environmental and health risks due to their toxicity, persistence, and long-range transport potential. Yet, their seasonal dynamics, regional sources, and nonlinear regulatory mechanisms remain unclear in subtropical coastal regions influenced by monsoonal circulation. We monitored 23 parent and 8 derivative PAHs year-round in Xiamen, China, and applied PMF, trajectory analysis, and XGBoost to investigate their sources and nonlinear environmental drivers. The results revealed clear seasonal variation: particulate-phase PAHs peaked in winter (11.37 ng/m3) and declined in summer (0.13 ng/m3), while gaseous compounds showed the opposite trend. The gas-particle partition coefficients (log Kₚ) showed a strong positive correlation with the octanol-air partition coefficients (log Kₒₐ), while displaying a marked negative correlation with ambient temperature, reflecting the dual influence of compound traits and environmental conditions on phase behavior. PMF identified six major source factors, among which coal combustion and gasoline vehicle emissions were the leading contributors to wintertime toxicity, accounting for 56.73 % of the toxic equivalent (∑TEQ). Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) and Source Region Attribution (SRA) showed that the PAH pollution in Xiamen mainly comes from local source (34 %), northern and northeastern China (46 %) and Southeast Asia and south China Sea (20 %). SHAP-based interpretation of the XGBoost model demonstrated that low-ring PAHs were more sensitive to local meteorological conditions, while high-ring PAHs exhibited stronger association with air mass origins and particle-phase accumulation. These findings reveal seasonal PAH patterns in coastal air and underscore the importance of distinguishing local from transboundary sources."
