Lamsal,Monitoring of total and off-road NOx emissions from Canadian oil sands surface mining using the Ozone Monitoring Instrument,"The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) was used to understand the evolution of NOx emissions from the Canadian oil sands. OMI NO2 combined with winds and reported stack emissions found emissions from the heavy-hauler mine fleet have remained flat since 2005, whereas the total oil sands mined have more than doubled. This difference is a result of emissions standards that limit NOx emissions becoming more stringent over this period, confirming the efficacy of the policy enacting these standards. 
 The oil sands in Alberta, Canada, are a significant source of air pollution. Observations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) on the NASA Aura satellite have been used to quantify NOx emissions from the surface mining region of the oil sands. Two related emissions methods were utilized, one for point and one for area sources, where OMI vertical column densities of NO2 were combined with winds from a meteorological reanalysis and a two-dimensional exponentially modified Gaussian (EMG) plume model. This work better connects the two (point and area) emissions methods and discusses the interpretation of fit parameters and the ability of OMI (and other sensors) to resolve emissions between neighbouring sources.The two methods employed, in good agreement with each other, indicated an increase in emissions from about 55 to 80 kt [NO2] yr−1 between 2005–2011 and a flat trend thereafter. Reported emissions were within 15 % of reported emissions, consistent to within uncertainties. In an extension of this methodology, OMI observations were combined with reported point source emissions to derive the more uncertain emissions component from the large off-road mining fleet. These were found to make up about 60 % of total NOx emissions, also consistent with reported emissions. The OMI-derived 0.9 % yr−1 increase in fleet emissions and the 5.5 % yr−1 increase in bitumen mined, generally a good proxy for fleet emissions, can be reconciled by considering the evolution of the mine fleet over this period. OMI is therefore able to track the transition from US EPA Tier 1 standards, through Tier 4 standards, to the present and in doing so demonstrates the efficacy of this policy. Furthermore, this analysis shows that had the fleet remained at Tier 1, this source would currently be emitting an additional 40 kt [NO2] yr−1."

Blázquez;Franziska Glassmeier,Cold pools mediate mesoscale adjustments of trade-cumulus fields to changes in cloud droplet number concentration,"Shallow clouds in the trades are a major source of uncertainty in climate projections. These clouds organize into striking mesoscale patterns that are exactly what climate models lack. This study explores the origin of such patterns and investigates how variations in microscale properties control them. The importance of microscale effects is compared to that of large-scale forcing on the mesoscale organization of trade-cumulus fields. 
 The mesoscale self-organization of trade-cumulus cloud fields is a major cloud–climate uncertainty. Cold pools, i.e., pockets of cold, dense air resulting from rain evaporation, are a key mechanism in shaping these dynamics and are controlled by the large-scale forcing. We study the microphysical sensitivity of cloud-field self-organization through cold pools by varying the cloud droplet number concentration (Nc) from 20 to 1000 cm−3 in large-eddy simulations on large 154 km×154 km domains. We find that cold pools exhibit two distinct regimes of mesoscale self-organization. Under very low Nc conditions, cold pools transition from a stage in which they are small and randomly distributed to forming large, long-lived structures that perpetuate due to the collisions of cold pools at their fronts. Under high-Nc conditions, cold pools display strongly intermittent behavior and interact with clouds through small, short-lived structures. Thus, although Nc influences the number of cold pools and, in turn, mesoscale organization, cloud depth, and cloud albedo, we find its effect on cloud cover to be minimal. Comparing the microphysical sensitivity of cold-pool-mediated mesoscale dynamics to the external, large-scale forcing shows that Nc is as important as horizontal wind and large-scale subsidence for trade-cumulus albedo. Our results highlight that cold pools mediate the adjustments of trade-cumulus cloud fields to changes in Nc. Such mesoscale adjustments need to be considered if we are to better constrain the effective aerosol forcing and cloud feedback in the trade-wind regime."

Malinowski,High-resolution temperature profiling in the Π Chamber: variability of statistical properties of temperature fluctuations,"Our objective was to enhance understanding of thermally driven convection in terms of small-scale variations in the temperature scalar field. We conducted a small-scale study of the temperature field in the Π Chamber using three different temperature differences (10 K, 15 K, and 20 K). Measurements were carried out using a miniaturized UltraFast Thermometer operating at 2 kHz, allowing undisturbed vertical temperature profiling from 8 cm above the floor to 5 cm below the ceiling. 
 This study delves into the small-scale temperature structure inside the turbulent convection Π Chamber under three temperature differences (10, 15, and 20 K) at Rayleigh number Ra∼109 and Prandtl number Pr≈0.7. We performed high-frequency measurements (2 kHz) with the UltraFast Thermometer (UFT) at selected points along the vertical axis. The miniaturized design of the sensor with a resistive platinum-coated tungsten wire, 2.5 µm thick and 3 mm long, mounted on a miniature wire probe, allowed for vertically undisturbed temperature profiling through the chamber's depth spanning from 8 cm above the bottom to 5 cm below the top. The collected data, consisting of 19 and 3 min time series, were used to investigate the variability of the temperature field within the chamber, aiming to better address scientific questions related to its primary objective: understanding small-scale aerosol–cloud interactions. The analyses reveal substantial variability in both variance and skewness of temperature distributions near the top and bottom plates and in the bulk (central) region, which were linked to local thermal plume dynamics. We also identified three spectral regimes termed “inertial range” (slopes of  ∼-7/5), “transition range” (slopes of ∼-3), and “dissipative range”, characterized by slopes of ∼-7. Furthermore, the analysis showed a power law relationship between the periodicity of large-scale circulation (LSC) and the temperature difference. Notably, the experimental results are in good agreement with direct numerical simulation (DNS) conducted under similar thermodynamic conditions, illustrating a comparative analysis of this nature."

High-spatial-resolution and long-term SS records are important for assessing such events. However, tide gauges can provide limited SS information due to sparse and uneven distributions. Based on artificial intelligence technology and tide gauges, a high-spatial-coverage SS dataset was generated for the period from 1940 to 2020, which can provide possible alternative support for deepening our understanding of SSs. 
 Storm surges (SSs) cause massive loss of life and property in coastal areas each year. High-spatial-coverage and long-term SS records are the basis for deepening our understanding of these disasters. Due to the sparse and uneven distribution of tide gauge stations, such global or quasi-global information can only be provided by global numerical models, while their simulation products mainly span the most recent decades. In this paper, for the first time, an all-site modeling framework for a data-driven model was implemented on a quasi-global scale within areas severely affected by SSs caused by tropical cyclones. Using tide gauge records and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data, we generated a high-spatial-resolution (10 km along the coastline) hourly SS dataset, ASM-SS (all-site modeling storm surge), within the span 45° S–45° N, whose record length is over 80 years from 1940 to 2020. Assessments indicate that, for 95th extreme SSs, the precision of the ASM-SS model (the medians of the correlation coefficients, root mean square errors, and mean biases are 0.63, 0.093, and −0.050 m, respectively) is better than that of the state-of-the-art global hydrodynamic model (the medians are 0.55, 0.106, and −0.045 m). For annual maximum SSs, it is more stable than the numerical model, with the overall root mean square error and coefficient of determination optimizing by 22.3 % and 14.8 %, respectively. This dataset could provide possible alternative support for coastal communities through relevant SS analysis applications requiring high spatial resolution and sufficiently long records.

Berends;Victor Azizi;Jorge A. Bernales;Roderik S. W. van de Wal,The Utrecht Finite Volume Ice-Sheet Model (UFEMISM) version 2.0 – Part 1: Description and idealised experiments,"Ice-sheet models are computer programs that can simulate how the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets will evolve in the future. The accuracy of these models depends on their resolution: how small the details are that the model can resolve. We have created a model with a variable resolution that can resolve a lot of detail in areas where lots of changes happen in the ice and less detail in areas where the ice does not move so much. This makes the model both accurate and fast. 
 Projecting the anthropogenic mass loss of the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets requires models that can accurately describe the physics of flowing ice and its interactions with the atmosphere, the ocean, and the solid Earth. As the uncertainty in many of these processes can only be explored by running large numbers of simulations to sample the phase space of possible physical parameters, the computational efficiency and user-friendliness of such a model are just as relevant to its applicability as is its physical accuracy. Here, we present and verify version 2.0 of the Utrecht Finite Volume Ice-Sheet Model (UFEMISM). UFEMISM is a state-of-the-art finite-volume model that applies an adaptive grid in both space and time. Since the first version published 2 years ago, v2.0 has added more accurate approximations to the Stokes flow, more sliding laws, different schemes for calculating the ice thickness rates of change, a more numerically stable time-stepping scheme, more flexible and powerful mesh generation code, and a more generally applicable discretisation scheme. The parallelisation scheme has changed from a shared-memory architecture to distributed memory, enabling the user to utilise more computational resources. The version control system (git) includes automated unit tests and benchmark experiments to aid with model development, as well as automated installation of the required libraries, improving both user comfort and reproducibility of results. The input/output (I/O) now follows the NetCDF-4 standard, including automated remapping between regular grids and irregular meshes, reducing user workload for pre- and post-processing. These additions and improvements make UFEMISM v2.0 a powerful, flexible ice-sheet model that can be used for long palaeoglaciological applications, as well as large ensemble simulations for future projections of ice-sheet retreat, and that is ready to be used for coupling within Earth system models."

This is usually done by running many simulations of the model with different settings, which can be time-consuming and relies heavily on expert knowledge. To make this process faster and more objective, we developed a machine learning emulator to create a large ensemble and apply a method called history matching to find the best settings. 
 In climate model development, “tuning” refers to the important process of adjusting uncertain free parameters of subgrid-scale parameterizations to best match a set of Earth observations, such as the global radiation balance or global cloud cover. This is traditionally a computationally expensive step as it requires a large number of climate model simulations. This step also becomes more challenging with increasing spatial resolution and complexity of climate models. In addition, the manual tuning relies strongly on expert knowledge and is thus not independently reproducible. To reduce subjectivity and computational demands, tuning methods based on machine learning (ML) have become an active research subject. Here, we build on these developments and apply ML-based tuning to the atmospheric component of the Icosahedral Nonhydrostatic Weather and Climate Model (ICON) at 80 km resolution. Our approach follows a workflow similar to other proposed ML-based tuning methods: (1) creating a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE) of limited size with randomly selected parameters, (2) fitting an ML-based emulator to the PPE to generate a large emulated ensemble with the emulator, and (3) shrinking the parameter space to regions compatible with observations using a method inspired by history matching. However, in contrast to previous works, we apply a sequential approach: the selected set of tuning parameters is updated in successive phases depending on the results of a sensitivity analysis with Sobol indices. We tune for global radiative properties, cloud properties, zonal wind velocities, and wind stresses on the ocean surface. With one iteration of this method, we achieve a model configuration yielding a global top-of-atmosphere net radiation budget in the range of [0, 1] W m−2, and global radiation metrics and water vapour path consistent with the reference observations. Furthermore, the resulting ML-based emulator allows us to identify the parameters that most impact the outputs that we target with tuning. The parameters that we identified to be mostly influential for the physics output metrics are the critical relative humidity in the upper troposphere and the conversion coefficient from cloud water to rain, influencing the radiation metrics and global cloud cover, together with the coefficient of sedimentation velocity of cloud ice, having a strong non-linear influence on all the physics metrics. The existence of non-linear effects further motivates the use of ML-based approaches for parameter tuning in climate models."

Acosta;Gladys Utrera;Etienne Tourigny,Reducing time and computing costs in EC-Earth: an automatic load-balancing approach for coupled Earth system models,"We present an automatic tool that optimizes resource distribution in coupled climate models, enhancing speed and reducing computational costs without requiring expert knowledge. Users can set energy/time criteria or limit resource usage. Tested on various European Community Earth System Model (EC-Earth) configurations and high-performance computing (HPC) platforms, it achieved up to 34 % faster simulations with fewer resources. 
 Earth system models (ESMs) are intricate models employed for simulating the Earth's climate, typically constructed from distinct independent components dedicated to simulate specific natural phenomena (such as atmosphere and ocean dynamics, atmospheric chemistry, land and ocean biosphere). In order to capture the interactions between these processes, ESMs utilize coupling libraries, which oversee the synchronization and field exchanges among independent developed codes typically operating in parallel as a multi-program, multiple data (MPMD) application.The performance achieved depends on the coupling approach, as well as on the number of parallel resources and scalability properties of each component. Determining the appropriate number of resources to use for each component in coupled ESMs is crucial for efficient utilization of the high-performance computing (HPC) infrastructures used in climate modeling. However, this task traditionally involves manual testing of multiple process allocations by trial and error, requiring significant time investment from researchers and making the process more error-prone, often resulting in a loss of application performance due to the complexity of the task. This paper introduces the automatic load-balance tool (auto-lb), a methodology and tool for determining the resource allocation to each component within coupled ESMs, aimed at improving the application's performance. Notably, this methodology is automatic and does not require expertise in HPC to improve the performance achieved by coupled ESMs. This is accomplished by minimizing the load imbalance: reducing each constituent's execution cost (core hours), as well as minimizing the core hours wasted resulting from the synchronizations between them, without penalizing the execution speed of the entire model. This optimization is achieved regardless of the scalability properties of each constituent and the complexity of their dependencies during the coupling.To achieve this, we designed a new performance metric called “fittingness” to assess the performance of coupled execution, evaluating the trade-off between parallel efficiency and application throughput. This metric is intended for scenarios where optimality can depend on various criteria and constraints. Aiming for maximum speed might not be desirable if it leads to a decrease in parallel efficiency and thus increases the computational costs of simulation.The methodology was tested across multiple experiments using the widely recognized European ESM, EC-Earth3. The results were compared with real operational configurations, such as those used for the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and European Climate Prediction project (EUCP), and validated on different HPC platforms. All of them suggest that the current approaches lead to performance loss, and that auto-lb can achieve better results in both execution speed and reduction of the core hours needed. When comparing to the EC-Earth standard-resolution CPMIP6 runs, we achieved a configuration 4.7 % faster while also reducing the core hours required by 1.3 %. Likewise, when compared to the EC-Earth high-resolution EUCP runs, the method presented showed an improvement of 34 % in the speed, with a 6.7 % reduction in the core hours consumed."

The contributions of natural toxins and anthropogenic contaminants to the effects of such chemical mixtures remain poorly quantified. Using skin fibroblast cells from the Indo-Pacific finless porpoise and humpback dolphin, we assessed the toxic potential of seawater extracts, focusing on cytotoxicity and intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation. Among the 38 studied chemicals prevalent in seawater, four algal toxins were 1–6 orders of magnitude more potent than 30 anthropogenic chemicals, including antibiotics, ultraviolet filters, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. Pectenotoxin-2 accounted for 92% of the cytotoxicity triggered by the mixture of all studied chemicals, which collectively explained 34% of seawater-induced cytotoxicity in porpoise cells. For ROS induction, although all studied chemicals collectively explained a small fraction (<1%) of the effects elicited by seawater extracts in both cell lines, okadaic acid and gymnodimine accounted for ∼80% of the mixture effects of all chemicals, with additional contributions from PFASs. Extending the approach to other coastal habitats where concentration data are available revealed algal toxins as dominant contributors among the known contaminant mixtures eliciting dermal toxic potential. This study provides novel insights to guide the identification of toxicity contributors across dermal health end points, with a balanced perspective on natural toxins and anthropogenic contaminants in addressing their mixture effects on sentinel species health."

This study quantifies the contrail mitigation potential and fuel supply chain costs of a uniform SAF distribution scenario, assuming all departing flights use a 10% SAF blend by mass. Building on this, we propose three SAF allocation strategies that optimize the same SAF supply to maximize contrail mitigation, while considering real-world supply chain constraints and additional costs. A seasonal strategy – providing SAF to all flights from October to February at higher blend ratios (28%) – achieves the highest benefit-to-cost ratio (1.7–7.2) and lowest abatement cost (€14–61/tCO2e). It raises annual reductions in contrail energy forcing (EFcontrail) from 7–8% (uniform vs no-SAF scenario) to 12–13%, with supply chain costs rising by 0.5% relative to the uniform scenario. Two diurnal strategies – one targeting flights after 16:00 local time and another adding a constraint of selecting flights with >250 km of persistent contrails – have lower benefit-to-cost ratios (0.2–2.4) and higher abatement costs (€42–675/tCO2e).

However, few studies have explicitly examined their interactions in response to eutrophication. Here, we characterized organic matter (OM) and phosphorus (P) pools in these subsystems of Lake Taihu and analyzed their variations with a gradient from mesotrophic to hypertrophic states. We employed a “3-subsystem” conceptual model with statistical algorithms to estimate the interactions. Concentrations of dissolved and particulate OM and P increased with eutrophication, while only the surface OM and P pools in sediments exhibited variability with the trophic state. Protein- and humic-like substances in the dissolved and particulate OM pools became more prominent at higher trophic states. High mobile P and low inert P were observed in the suspended particles and surface sediments of eutrophic regions. As the trophic state increased, interactions between dissolved and particulate subsystems and between particulate and sedimentary subsystems strengthened, whereas few changes occurred in the interaction between dissolved and sedimentary subsystems. This suggests that particle release and sediment resuspension are more significant pathways for internal nutrient loading in eutrophic regions. These findings provide a comprehensive understanding of how eutrophication affects lake subsystems and their interactions, offering potential ecological restoration references for eutrophic shallow lakes."

While treatment technologies that address pharmaceutical contamination in UDF have been proposed, little is known about the exposure and risk to public health that UDF-fertilized crops pose. We assessed pharmaceutical uptake by lettuce exposed to UDF spiked with pharmaceuticals at two levels: the highest reported concentrations from the literature and at a level 10 times this amount to represent a worst-case scenario for UDF application.

Exposure to pharmaceuticals through the consumption of UDF-fertilized crops is not significantly different from exposure through crops irrigated with reclaimed water (RW).

MP distribution in subsoils was enhanced in fine-textured and iron (Fe)-depleted soils. Based on these findings, we conducted additional column migration experiments using different textured vadose zones, either with or without hematite, as a typical Fe oxide.

This study presents a novel hybrid modeling framework that integrates a process-based hydrodynamic-environmental model with a data-driven approach to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of AMR in coastal waters. Macrolide-related antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs_Macro) were selected as representative markers. The model results were validated using data from a monthly sampling campaign conducted across Singapore’s coastal waters, yielding a mean coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.693, a Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) of 0.589, and a root-mean-square deviation (RMSE) of 0.0257 GC/16S rRNA across 12 sampling points. Lincomycin, pH, dissolved oxygen, zinc and temperature were identified as significant influencers of ARGs_Macro. Although Lincomycin is not classified as a macrolide, it ranks as the most important driver of ARGs_Macro due to its shared resistance mechanisms with macrolides, potentially facilitating cross-resistance. The spatiotemporal model results revealed that coastal areas, particularly in the northern part of Singapore, are vulnerable to significant ARG accumulation, with monsoon seasons amplifying the spread of AMR due to hydrodynamic conditions. This study highlights the development of a robust modeling framework that provides valuable insights into the environmental drivers of AMR in coastal waters, offering a foundation for regulatory strategies and future research aimed at mitigating the risks of antimicrobial resistance in aquatic environments."

However, the presence of coexisting ions significantly impedes recovery efficiency. Here, we investigate the interference mechanisms of coexisting ions on ammonia recovery using a gas-membrane-coupled FCDI system. Results reveal that a single FCDI cell with 10 wt % carbon mass loading achieves optimal performance (SECw = 1.10 kWh m–3, SECN = 34 kWh kg–1 N, and FE = 91.67%), yet these metrics decline markedly after 2 h due to ammonium back diffusion. This back diffusion is strongly correlated with coexisting ion concentrations and carbon loading in flow electrodes. Double current step tests demonstrate that ammonia transmembrane transport is governed by concentration polarization at the membrane/electrolyte interface induced by coexisting ions. To address this, a parallel FCDI cell is employed to discharge high-salinity brine while recovering energy from the salt gradient. Long-term operation (100 h) validates the system’s robustness, achieving a concentrated ammonia extract of 954 ppm. This study elucidates critical ion interference mechanisms in FCDI-based ammonia recovery and presents a sustainable strategy for enhancing wastewater resource utilization."

Conventional oxidative degradation methods predominantly yield bioaccumulative short-chain fluorinated derivatives, failing to achieve molecular annihilation. We highlight reductive defluorination as a transformative strategy to directly cleave C–F bonds and mitigate toxicity through two distinct electron-transfer modalities: indirect routes mediated by reactive species (e.g., hydrated electrons/active hydrogen) contrasted with direct mechanisms employing biocatalytic or electrochemical systems for targeted electron injection. Mechanistic taxonomy and quantitative structure–reactivity analyses reveal that defluorination efficiency is governed by the molecular architecture (e.g., chain length and fluorination patterns) and operational parameters (e.g., pH, redox potentials, and solution matrices). While standalone reductive technologies face scalability constraints from energy intensity and secondary contamination risks, synergistic integration of bioremediation-electrochemical-photocatalytic systems demonstrates enhanced defluorination efficiency. By coupling molecular-level degradation mechanisms with modular engineering, we propose future directions for developing reductive defluorination, offering a sustainable pathway to eliminate environmental recalcitrance and comply with evolving global water quality mandates."

In this study, we developed a simple and effective modification method for the preparation of an anticombined scaling–biofouling thin-film composite (TFC) nanofiltration membrane via a synergetic strategy based on defensive (i.e., sequestering carboxyl groups) and offensive (i.e., immobilizing antimicrobial peptides (AMPs)) functions. According to the Extended Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (XDLVO) analysis, the sequestration of carboxyl groups by AMPs diminishes the acid–base polarity interaction between the biofoulants and membranes, playing a critical role in dismantling the bridge of carboxyl–Ca2+–carboxyl and subsequently rendering both scaling ions and carboxyl groups unavailable to fouling. Meanwhile, the immobilization of AMPs on the membranes prevents microbial metabolism and growth by contact-killing mechanisms, endowing the membrane resistance to severe biofouling in the presence of scaling ions. Furthermore, the synergetic effects overcome the permeability–rejection–antifouling trade-off by enhanced water permeance without sacrificing salt rejection. This research provides a novel dimension for developing high-performance TFC membranes for the mitigation of combined scaling–biofouling in the practical application of wastewater treatment and desalination."

With the increasing wildfire events in recent years, the western U.S. regions may experience challenges with higher-than-normal air pollution levels during the fire season (June-October). Therefore, determining the ozone enhancement pattern from wildfire smoke is crucial to understanding the influence of wildfire plume transport on a subregional basis. This study investigates the impact of the 2013 Rim Fire on ozone levels in rural Nevada, employing a combination of ground-based monitors, satellite remote sensing, and atmospheric modeling. The research focuses on understanding how wildfire smoke affects ozone concentrations in the downwind regions. Findings indicate significant ozone enhancements on smoke days compared to nonsmoke days, highlighting the contribution of wildfire emissions to regional air quality deterioration. The study demonstrates that the chemical transport model underestimated ozone levels downwind of wildfire plumes, likely due to uncertainties in smoke emissions estimates and differences in chemical mechanisms across model versions. Satellite observations of nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde underline the link between wildfire emissions and increased ozone production. The comprehensive approach combining ground-based monitoring, remote sensing, and advanced modeling provides deeper insights into the dynamics of wildfire smoke and its effects on air quality, emphasizing the need for integrated strategies to manage the impacts of wildfires on regional air quality."

 Climate change may amplify the frequency and severity of supply-demand mismatches in future power systems with high shares of wind and solar energy1,2. Here, we use a dispatch optimization model to assess potential increases in hourly costs associated with such climate-intensified gaps under fixed, high penetrations of wind and solar generation. We further explore various strategies to enhance system resilience in the face of future climate change. We find that extreme periods—defined as hours in the upper decile of hourly costs (i.e., the most-costly 10% of hours)—are likely to become more costly in the future in most countries, mainly due to the increased need for investments in flexible energy capacity. For example, under the SSP126 scenario, 47 countries that together account for approximately 43.5% of global future electricity generation are projected to experience more than a 5% increase in average hourly costs during extreme periods, with the largest reaching up to 23.7%. Promisingly, the risk of rising costs could be substantially mitigated through tailored, country-specific strategies involving the coordinated implementation of multiple measures to address supply-demand imbalances and enhance system flexibility.

 The interdependence of climate change and agricultural land use remains a critical, yet unquantified, area of concern for future food production. Here we determine climate-driven cropland change based on an empirical model of cropland response to changes in agricultural productivity. By estimating counterfactual total factor productivity in a scenario without climate change, we find that 88 million hectares (90% confidence interval (CI) 5–179 Mha), or 6.3% (90% CI 3.6–12.8%) of the cropland currently used in 110 countries, can be attributed to climate change via reduced agricultural productivity growth over 1992–2020. This area exceeds the observed 3.9% net cropland expansion in the studied countries, indicating that total cropland area would have decreased in the absence of climate effects. The release of about 21.8 GtCO2 (lower/upper bound: 4.4–41.4 GtCO2) could have been prevented without climate-driven cropland change, accounting for about 18.9% (3.8–35.9%) of land-use change emissions in these countries. Climate-driven cropland change also triggered noticeably warmer and drier local climate feedback in some regions, with potential repercussions for food security. The substantial emissions will probably impose further long-term negative impacts on agricultural efficiency.

 Wildfires reduce vegetation cover and soil biocrust, thus expanding bare grounds susceptible to wind erosion. However, global characterization of post-fire dust emissions has remained qualitative and focused only on landscapes disturbed by relatively large wildfires. Here we apply principles of fluid mechanics to satellite measurements to quantify post-fire dust emissions. We find that 61% of global wildfires at various extents are followed by enhanced dust emissions, injecting 5.6 (3.3–9.2) Tg of dust per year during 2003 to 2022. 95% of the post-fire dust emissions are sourced to small wildfires, which occur more frequently and broadly than large wildfires especially across sparsely vegetated regions. Despite the recent decline in global burned area and a resultant decreasing occurrence of post-fire dust events, the total amount of global post-fire dust emissions has increased by 77% during the last two decades. This elevation in total post-fire dust emissions is attributed to intensifying burning and worsening fire-induced land degradation, which trigger a 155% increase in the intensity of post-fire dust emissions. With an ongoing enhancement of extreme wildfires and synchronized droughts under global warming, our results indicate the emerging importance of post-fire dust emissions globally and regionally.

Here, the authors demonstrate enhanced cross sections due to beyond single-photon excitations in He atoms, facilitating applications in precision spectroscopy. 
 Weak transitions between quantum states are of fundamental importance for a broad range of phenomena from analytical biochemistry to precision physics, but generally challenge experimental detection. Due to their small cross sections scaling with the absolute square of their transition matrix elements, spectroscopic measurements often fail in particular in the presence of competing background processes. Here we introduce a general concept to break this scaling law and enhance the transition probability by exploiting a stronger laser-coupled pathway to the same excited state. We demonstrate the concept experimentally by attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in helium atoms. The quasi-forbidden transitions from the ground state 1s2 to the weakly coupled doubly excited 2p3d and sp2,4− states are boosted by an order of magnitude. Enhancing single-photon-suppressed transitions can find widespread applicability, from spectral diagnostics of complex molecules in life and chemical sciences to precision spectroscopy of weak transitions in metastable atomic nuclei in the search for new physics.

 Since the first detection of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) H5N1 (clade 2.3.4.4b) in U.S. dairy cattle in early 2024, the virus has spread rapidly, posing a major public health concern as the number of human cases continues to rise.

With no vaccines currently available, antiviral drugs remain the only treatment option. Here, we investigate the efficacy of the polymerase inhibitor baloxavir marboxil (BXM) against this virus in mice. We find that early treatment post-infection is effective, but delayed treatment significantly reduces BXM efficacy and increases the risk of BXM resistance, underscoring the importance of timely BXM administration for effective treatment.

Here the authors investigate changes in CD8+ T cell metabolism in iron limiting conditions and find that aspartate is increased yet downstream nucleotide synthesis is suppressed and addition of exogenous aspartate partially rescues T cell function. 
 Iron is an irreplaceable co-factor for metabolism. Iron deficiency affects >1 billion people and decreased iron availability impairs immunity. Nevertheless, how iron deprivation impacts immune cell function remains poorly characterised. We interrogate how physiologically low iron availability affects CD8+ T cell metabolism and function, using multi-omic and metabolic labelling approaches. Iron limitation does not substantially alter initial post-activation increases in cell size and CD25 upregulation. However, low iron profoundly stalls proliferation (without influencing cell viability), alters histone methylation status, gene expression, and disrupts mitochondrial membrane potential. Glucose and glutamine metabolism in the TCA cycle is limited and partially reverses to a reductive trajectory. Previous studies identified mitochondria-derived aspartate as crucial for proliferation of transformed cells. Despite aberrant TCA cycling, aspartate is increased in stalled iron deficient CD8+ T cells but is not utilised for nucleotide synthesis, likely due to trapping within depolarised mitochondria. Exogenous aspartate markedly rescues expansion and some functions of severely iron-deficient CD8+ T cells. Overall, iron scarcity creates a mitochondrial-located metabolic bottleneck, which is bypassed by supplying inhibited biochemical processes with aspartate. These findings reveal molecular consequences of iron deficiency for CD8+ T cell function, providing mechanistic insight into the basis for immune impairment during iron deficiency. Iron has been shown to be necessary for the activation and differentiation of CD8+ T cells.

Here, the authors construct a mathematical framework to infer drug resistance dynamics in cancer using lineage tracing and population size data, which is confirmed with experimental evidence and single-cell sequencing. 
 Cancer treatment frequently fails due to the evolution of drug-resistant cell phenotypes driven by genetic or non-genetic changes. The origin, timing, and rate of spread of these adaptations are critical for understanding drug resistance mechanisms but remain challenging to observe directly. We present a mathematical framework to infer drug resistance dynamics from genetic lineage tracing and population size data without direct measurement of resistance phenotypes. Simulation experiments demonstrate that the framework accurately recovers ground-truth evolutionary dynamics. Experimental evolution to 5-Fu chemotherapy in colorectal cancer cell lines SW620 and HCT116 validates the framework. In SW620 cells, a stable pre-existing resistant subpopulation was inferred, whereas in HCT116 cells, resistance emerged through phenotypic switching into a slow-growing resistant state with stochastic progression to full resistance. Functional assays, including scRNA-seq and scDNA-seq, validate these distinct evolutionary routes. This framework facilitates rapid characterisation of resistance mechanisms across diverse experimental settings.

Developing strategic water markets in the Colorado River headwaters can restore habitat while conserving water resources. 
 The Colorado River system is among the world’s most overallocated basins, struggling to supply water to the southwestern United States and Mexico. Consequently, 90% of the basin’s native fish species are endangered, threatened or extinct. Driven by a 24-year megadrought, the United States allocated over US$4 billion for drought mitigation, including water market transactions that pay farms, cities and industries to divert less water across the US Southwest. We developed a model of how strategic water markets can restore imperilled fish habitat, integrating hydrology, ecology, economics and water rights within the river’s headwater state of Colorado. While least-cost water-use reductions improve over one-third of restorable river habitat, strategically spending 8% more nearly triples habitat improvement. Ten transactions attain 26% of that improvement for 1% of the cost. Water markets that do not legally protect conserved water are 29% less cost-effective than markets that do. Overall, strategic investing and legal reforms yield outsized ecological benefits.

 Changes in storm track intensity and position are key indicators of atmospheric responses to global warming. In this study, we identified a robust northward shift and intensification of midlatitude storm track activity during boreal winters in the North Pacific since the early 1980s. This trend is linked to subtropical tropospheric warming, which has enhanced the midlatitude meridional temperature gradient. This gradient–storm track relationship is evident in both long-term trends and interannual variations. By contrast, Arctic warming weakens near-surface temperature gradients and negatively correlates with storm track activity. Additionally, tropical upper-tropospheric warming appears to strengthen the meridional gradient but induces equatorward shifts in the jet stream and storm track, countering the observed poleward trends. Numerical simulations suggest that the sea surface warming observed in the subtropical North Pacific and Indian Ocean contributes to storm track and circulation changes, providing insights into midlatitude atmospheric dynamics in the context of global warming."

 Several pulses of ocean oxygenation events were recognized in the Ediacaran period. However, the intrinsic triggers behind them remain ambiguous. Here we report phosphorus speciation data from the Ediacaran Doushantuo Formation, South China, to elucidate the role of recycled phosphorus in driving ocean oxygenation. High ratios of organic carbon to organic phosphorus in all samples relative to the Redfield ratio generally imply preferential release of phosphorus during the remineralization of organic matter. Notably, ratios of organic carbon to reactive phosphorus exceed the Redfield ratio during purported oxygenation intervals, but fall mostly below or close to the Redfield ratio in the rest of the section. Quantitative calculations suggest that enhanced benthic and water-column recycling created a phosphorus influx into the ocean that was comparable to or outpaced that of weathering input.

 Seismic and geodynamic studies indicate that the boundary between the Earth’s liquid outer core and solid mantle is not spherical, but is likely characterized by topography in the form of inverted mountains and valleys that have typical amplitudes of several kilometers. One of the dynamical consequences of these deformations is that turbulent flow in the core can exert pressure torques on the mantle, thereby resulting in a transfer of angular momentum between the outer core and the mantle. Understanding this transfer of angular momentum is important for explaining variations in the Earth’s rotation rate, or length of day. Whether kilometer-sized topography can explain observed variations in length of day is a longstanding question in geophysics. Here we use a suite of state-of-the-art numerical simulations of hydrodynamic convection in a rotating spherical shell with boundary topography to show that topographic torques exhibit a linear dependence on topographic amplitude and approach a quadratic dependence on flow speeds. This observation is explained with the asymptotic theory of rapidly rotating convection. These results imply that topographic torques are of sufficient magnitude to explain length of day variations.

 Irrigation is a fundamental practice for mitigating crop yield losses from drought and heat extremes. However, the extent to which irrigation moderates crop sensitivity to these stresses and the future quantity of irrigation required to maintain crop yields remain unclear. Here, we use a meta-analysis of maize field experiments across the Ogallala Aquifer to quantify how varying irrigation amounts influence yield sensitivity to heat and drought based on a panel regression model. We find that each 100 mm increase in irrigation reduces heat sensitivity of maize by 7.6%. By the 2050s, offsetting a projected 26% yield decline under a high-emission scenario, primarily driven by intensifying heat stress, would require a 67% increase in irrigation amounts.

 Stratospheric aerosol injection is a proposed method for offsetting greenhouse gas-induced warming by introducing scattering aerosols into the lower stratosphere to reflect sunlight. Here we explore a potentially more efficient alternative: weakening the Earth’s greenhouse effect by deploying absorptive aerosols in the upper stratosphere (~10 hPa). These aerosols warm the carbon dioxide emission level—where outgoing longwave radiation is most sensitive to temperature—thereby enhancing top-of-atmosphere infrared emission without altering atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. Idealized climate model simulations indicate that this approach can reduce global temperatures an order of magnitude more efficiently per unit aerosol mass than conventional scattering-based interventions. Although based on simplified model experiments lacking interactive aerosol processes and operational constraints, our results identify a distinct physical mechanism for climate intervention, arguing for further research into the impacts—especially potential unintended side effects—of injecting absorptive aerosols into the upper stratosphere as an alternative solar radiation management strategy.

 Over the past few decades, a reduction in chlorinated long-lived ozone-depleting substance emissions due to the regulations imposed by the Montreal Protocol has led to a global decrease in stratospheric chlorine.

 Drought affects the health of natural and socio-ecological systems by altering green water evapotranspiration and blue water runoff. However, the global patterns of green and blue water responses to drought remain unclear. Here we quantified drought using root-zone soil moisture reductions and examined the resulting water deficits across different climatic and vegetation conditions. We show that drought generally reduces both evapotranspiration and runoff globally, though with pronounced spatiotemporal variability. In high-latitude humid regions, drought can initially enhance evapotranspiration, whereas runoff responds more rapidly and declines consistently throughout drought periods. Furthermore, drought reduces runoff more than evapotranspiration in humid regions, but the reverse pattern occurs in arid regions. Compared to other vegetation types, forests exhibit smaller drought-induced reductions in evapotranspiration but greater reductions in runoff. These results underscore the importance of considering background climate and vegetation when assessing drought’s hydrological impacts, with important implications for ecohydrological understanding and water resource management.

 International interest is focusing on how to better manage soil organic carbon (SOC) to increase resilience to climate change and reinforce food security. Remote sensing imagery and visible, near-infrared, and short-wave infrared (VNIR-SWIR) spectroscopy combined with advanced modeling algorithms can monitor SOC in an efficient, low-cost, and environmentally friendly manner. However, the limited bands (multi-spectral imagery) as well as the confounding effects such as soil moisture and surface roughness from the satellite may jeopardize the spectral prediction of SOC. We proposed a framework to integrate laboratory spectra with Landsat-8 multispectral data collected in natural real-environments to implement the satellite hyperspectral simulation for SOC prediction and mapping. A soil spectral library (SSL) with 873 samples containing SOC and VNIR-SWIR reflectance was developed in Northeast China. Two pixelwise temporal mosaicking approaches (i.e., averaged bare soil conditions [Median] and dry soil conditions to exclude anomalous values [R90]) were compared for creating bare soil composite images. Fractional-order derivative was explored for spectral preprocessing. Results indicated Median approach outperformed R90 regarding both spectral correlation and the validation performance for SOC. Raw reflectance after hyperspectral image simulation with 201 bands developed by random forest algorithm improved the validation R2 from 0.38 and 0.29 to 0.49 and 0.32 for Median and R90 approaches, respectively, as compared to raw reflectance with six bands. Laboratory spectra yielded higher predicted accuracy for SOC than Median-simulated, followed by R90-simulated hyperspectral images.

 Cloud detection is a requisite step of almost all terrestrial applications using optical remote sensing imagery, as many applications are sensitive to cloud contamination. In this research, a new algorithm has been developed to detect nocturnal cloud (from sunset to sunrise) in Himawari-8/9 AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager) imagery over land, with simultaneous aims of maximising accuracy, simplicity and efficiency. The algorithm consists of two cloud detection methods: (i) proxy emissivity temporal variation, measured by pixel wise standard deviation within an hour; and (ii) monthly clear surface proxy emissivity database which is updated daily. Results from the two components are combined based on their respective confidence. A validation was conducted against 6 years of CALIPSO LiDAR data over the Australian continent, showing an overall accuracy of 96 %. The algorithm requires no ancillary data. It is also computationally efficient and so is suitable for near real-time (i.e., within 2 h) operation and can be readily adopted to similar operational geostationary sensors."

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), as an active remote sensing technology with all-weather and all-time capabilities, plays an essential role in environmental monitoring and disaster management. However, SAR employed the coherent imaging mechanism to synthesize images, inevitably introducing speckles in the obtained images. These speckles reduce the signal-to-noise ratio of an image due to the random variation of image pixel value, which brings challenges for subsequent applications. The breakthrough of image registration provides the data requirements for acquiring multi-source remote sensing data. Based on the above study, this paper presents a Gradient Consistency constraints semi-supervised network for Optical image-Assisted SAR despeckling (GCOANet). The presented method generates cross-domain reference images by utilizing optical pixel correlation to conduct the paired SAR reconstruction, thereby mitigating feature misalignment caused by the modal differences between SAR and optical imagery. The conditional diffusion model is then employed to learn the mapping between the SAR and reference images, eliminating the necessity for paired SAR/optical data. The reference image is first generated using a pre-trained conditional diffusion model during the training and test phase. Subsequently, a multi-scale blind spot despeckling network is designed to suppress speckles by fusing SAR and reference features, while also preventing the loss of blind pixel information. Finally, an all-directional gradient loss is proposed to rapidly differentiate homogeneous and heterogeneous regions and achieve separate speckle suppression. Extensive experiments conducted on both real and simulated data verify the effectiveness of the presented method, which retains complete texture details and smooth homogeneous areas. Furthermore, the related applications further demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method in real-world scenarios."

 Flash floods in the Western Mediterranean pose a growing hazard due to the effects of climate change, rapid urbanization, and land-use changes. This study focuses on flash floods in the Montsià region of southern Catalonia (NE Iberian Peninsula), with particular emphasis on the municipality of Alcanar, because it illustrates the recent intensification of flash flood dynamics in the Western Mediterranean. The research is motivated by three recent severe flood events in Alcanar (2018, 2021, and 2023), each characterized by extraordinary rainfall totals and significant economic losses, unprecedented in the municipality's 30-year observational record. Methodologically, we integrate multiple data sources—including meteorological station observations, weather radar products, lightning detection networks, high-resolution mesoscale model outputs, and a flood database spanning 1980–2023, complemented by economic compensation records from 1996 to 2020. Through this approach we (i) assess the regional frequency of heavy rainfall and flood episodes, (ii) quantify the economic impacts in Alcanar, (iii) characterize the meteorological and thermodynamic conditions on the three most intense recent events (including moisture source tracking via a Lagrangian methodology), and (iv) analyze spatio-temporal trends in extreme rainfall indicators (percentiles, threshold exceedances, kurtosis, and skewness). Our findings suggest that, from a meteorological perspective, current flash flood behavior in the Western Mediterranean likely emerges from the interplay of localized orographic triggers, elevated sea surface temperatures, strong instability associated with low-level moisture, particular positioning of jet streaks, synoptic-scale cut-off lows, and remote moisture sources. The results also point to an increase in rainfall intensity, explained by the presence of high precipitable water content and shallow convection, which enhances precipitation efficiency. These insights highlight the critical need for robust flood early warning systems, strategic watershed management, and improved risk communication to mitigate escalating flash flood risks in the Montsià county and similar areas throughout the Western Mediterranean region."

 The 2022 mega flash drought over the Yangtze River Basin (YRB), which occurred without sufficient early warning, substantially affected water supply and hydropower generation. This raises a concern about exploring the precursors of flash droughts to facilitate prediction at subseasonal time scale. Previous studies have indicated that flash droughts are directly affected by insufficient precipitation and corresponding circulation anomalies. However, how intraseasonal oscillations (ISOs) provide possible precursors and affect the drought onset remains unclear. Based on the analysis of flash droughts over the YRB during 1961–2022, we find that 38.9 % and 16.7 % of them are influenced by 10–20-day and 20–60-day mid-latitude ISOs, respectively. Although 10–20-day ISOs trigger more flash droughts, 20–60-day ISOs are more favorable for accelerating the onset speed of flash droughts. Specifically, the 10–20-day ISOs trigger eastward Rossby waves, promoting the eastward shift of the South Asian High and enhancing subsidence over the YRB, thereby contributing to flash drought onset. The 20–60-day ISOs are associated with the stagnation of a Circumglobal Teleconnection, and facilitating the superposition of the South Asian High and the Western Pacific Subtropical High, accelerating flash droughts onset. Although the impact of different timescales of ISOs on flash droughts varies, their combined effects are a critical factor in triggering mega flash droughts over the YRB. Our study suggests transitions from wet phases to dry phases of ISOs are critical precursors for flash drought early warning."

 This study proposed a performance-enhancement-oriented evaluation system to inspect the performance of three integrated multi-satellite retrievals of global precipitation measurement (IMERG) products (early run (IMERG ER), late run (IMERG LR), and final run (IMERG FR)) during Typhoon In-Fa, the strongest typhoon on record to make landfall in mainland China in 2021. The new system for comparing hourly IMERG V07 and V06 products at one gauge and ranking all gauge stations in the gauge group is called the increment-ranking scoring index (ISI). The main conclusions are as follows: (1) Compared to IMERG V06, IMERG V07 demonstrates better typhoon precipitation detection capability and higher stability. Although the V07 has improved the problem of underestimating hourly rainfall events, the increasing number of precipitation overestimations across all gauges still raises concerns. (2) The gauge groups with high ISI values demonstrate satisfactory performance in satellite-derived precipitation estimates, while those characterized by high ΔKGE (delta Kling-Gupta Efficiency) values perform less satisfactorily. Higher ISI values (more significant enhancements by V07) are more commonly observed in the coastal region than in the inland region. By introducing the ISI for comprehensive performance evaluation of IMERG V07 and V06 during Typhoon In-Fa, a performance-enhancement-oriented evaluation system proposed in this study is intuitive and concise in revealing the advances of IMERG V07 when monitoring and reconstructing typhoon processes."

We show thatmorc-1is overexpressed incsr-1mutants and accumulates over CSR-1 licensed targets, coinciding with aberrant gain of H3K9me3, reduced H3K36me3, and transcriptional repression. Notably, loss ofmorc-1fully rescues these chromatin defects and partially restores gene expression and fertility incsr-1mutants. Conversely, ectopic overexpression of MORC-1 in the wild-type germ line is sufficient to repress CSR-1 licensed targets and severely compromise fertility.

When pain resolves, the excitability of these neurons returns to baseline. Using electrophysiological and computational approaches, we found that an increase in potassium A-current (IA) underlies the decrease in the excitability of medullary dorsal horn PNs in acute pain conditions. In chronic pain conditions, no changes ofIAwere observed, and medullary dorsal horn PNs exhibit increased intrinsic excitability and firing. Our results reveal a differential modulation of the excitability of medullary dorsal horn projection neurons in acute and chronic pain conditions, suggesting a regulatory mechanism that, in acute pain conditions, tunes the output of the dorsal horn and, if lacking, could facilitate pain chronification."

However, large size poses biophysical challenges, especially regarding nutrient transport: These constraints are typically overcome through multicellular innovations. Here, we show that an emergent biophysical mechanism—spontaneous fluid flows arising from metabolically generated density gradients—can alleviate constraints on nutrient transport, enabling exponential growth in nascent multicellular clusters of yeast lacking any multicellular adaptations for nutrient transport or fluid flow. Beyond a threshold size, the metabolic activity of experimentally evolved snowflake yeast clusters drives large-scale fluid flows that transport nutrients throughout the cluster at speeds comparable to those generated by ciliary actuation in extant multicellular organisms. These flows support exponential growth at macroscopic sizes that theory predicts should be diffusion limited. This demonstrates how simple physical mechanisms can act as a “biophysical scaffold” to support the evolution of multicellularity by opening up phenotypic possibilities before genetically encoded innovations."

Unlike light, which can phase delay or advance the central pacemaker, stressors consistently induce delays, effects attenuated by inhibiting aPVT neurons. Stressors robustly activate AVP-expressing neurons within the SCN and are associated with inhibition of VIP-expressing neurons, whereas light strongly activates VIP-expressing neurons with minimal effects on AVP-expressing neurons. Pairing stressors with light reveals distinct time-dependent interactions, enhancing phase delays at early night but abolishing phase advances at late night.

The NHEJ function of senataxin is redundant with the RECQL5 helicase and the HLTF translocase and is epistatic with ATM. Co-inactivation of ATM, RECQL5, and HLTF results in an NHEJ defect similar to that from the combined deficiency of DNA-PKcs and senataxin or losing senataxin, RECQL5, and HLTF. These data suggest that ATM and DNA-PKcs regulate the functions of senataxin and RECQL5/HLTF, respectively, to provide redundant support for NHEJ."

When combined, collagen networks rigidify via synergistic mechanical interactions and stiffen only with higher mechanical loads. However, how cells respond to the nonlinear elasticity of collagen in hybrid networks remains largely unknown. Here, we demonstrate that when collagen rigidifies by the interpenetration of a second polymer, the amount of force that initially stiffens the network (onset of stiffening, σc) increases and is sufficient to stimulate an increase in intracellular tension. We investigated this effect by precisely controlling the nonlinear elasticity of collagen with the synthetic semiflexible polymer, polyisocyanopeptides. We find that small increases in σcinduce a biphasic response in cell-matrix interactions, influencing how cells migrate, proliferate, and generate contractile force. Our results suggest that cells adaptively respond to changes in the nonlinear mechanics of collagen, which may be a mechanistic behavior used during tissue homeostasis or when collagen rigidifies during pathological conditions."

However, whether these traits evolve directly via predation or indirect effects is largely unresolved. We used artificial selection to experimentally test the impact of adult predation on the evolution of life history and morphology in guppies (Poecilia reticulata). We found that, compared to control fish, predation-selected fish produced larger offspring and larger broods early in life. However, other life history parameters, such as interbrood interval and total number of offspring, showed no response. We also found that predation selected for smaller and lighter females and for shorter tails and gonopodia in males, with no effect on body coloration. Our results show that while several traits evolve fast under selection on adult predation, several “classic” predation-dependent traits seem unaffected by predation selection. By comparing our experimental results to those from natural populations, we can disentangle the contribution of direct and indirect effects on trait evolution under predation pressure."

Nematic phases have been discovered in a variety of systems, including liquid crystals, correlated materials, and superconductors. Here, we report on a magnetic nematic phase, where the basis components are composed of magnetic helices. We directly probed the order parameters associated with the magnetic helices using resonant soft x-ray scattering and find two distinct nematic phases with complex spatiotemporal signatures. Using x-ray correlation spectroscopy, we find that near the phase boundary between the two nematic phases, fluctuations coexist on multiple disparate timescales. Our micromagnetic simulations and density functional theory calculations show that the fluctuations occur concomitantly with a reorientation of the magnetic helices, indicating spontaneous symmetry breaking and the emergence of additional degrees of freedom. Our results provide a framework for characterizing exotic phases that can be extended to a broad class of physical systems."

Here, we identify IL-17 as a novel driver of LKB1-dependent polyp growth. GI tumors from mice bearing heterozygous mutations inStk11(which encodes LKB1) display signatures of pathogenic IL-17–producing CD4+T helper 17 (TH17) cells. LKB1 constrains T cell inflammatory potential, asStk11/LKB1 haploinsufficiency promotes T cell differentiation toward pathogenic IL-17–producing T cell lineages (CD4+TH17 and CD8+Tc17) in vitro and following intestinal infection. Mechanistically, aberrant CREB-regulated transcription coactivator 2 (CRTC2)–dependent signaling drives pathogenic TH17 cell programs downstream of LKB1 haploinsufficiency. Targeting this circuit via CRTC2 deletion or IL-17 blockade antagonizes GI polyp growth in mouse models of Peutz-Jeghers syndrome. These findings establish LKB1 as a gatekeeper of inflammatory type 3 (IL-17–dependent) T cell responses and identify a CRTC2–IL-17 signaling axis that can be targeted therapeutically to block the growth of LKB1 mutant GI tumors."

A substantial proportion of patients do not respond to current therapies or experience intolerable side effects. Transcriptomic characterization of murine and human PNF at bulk and single-cell resolution identified transforming growth factor–β (TGFβ) signaling as a key upstream regulator, driving aberrant basement membrane (BM) protein production by neoplastic Schwann cells and Fbs. Conditional TGFβ1 overexpression inNf1-deficient Schwann cells driven byHoxb7-Cre promoted PNF growth and malignant transformation in vivo. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of the type I TGFβ receptor (TGFβRI) reduced PNF tumor burden inNf1mutant mice. Proteomic characterization of the extracellular matrix (ECM) showed reduced BM proteins upon TGFβRI inhibition. These findings implicate TGFβ as a potential therapeutic target in PNF and provide insights into the role of TGFβ signaling in orchestrating ECM dynamics in the PNF microenvironment."

The optical drive of coherent magnetic collective excitations, namely magnons, represents a promising route. The ability to arbitrarily and nonthermally increase the magnon frequencies with laser pulses could enable this progress. However, this effect has not been reported to date. To achieve it, here, we explore the optical resonant excitation of high-momentum magnons, which experimentally are observed to couple to low-momentum magnons, modifying the frequencies and amplitudes thereof. This evidence, not caused by laser heating, is explained with a resonant light-scattering mechanism coupling high- and low-momentum eigenmodes across momentum space. Our results disclose routes to inducing instabilities and phase transitions via mode softening and potentially even light-driven Bose-Einstein condensation of magnons and superconductivity mediated by high-momentum spin-fluctuations."

Our experimental results reveal the pressure-temperature conditions for amorphization, decomposition, and melting of labradorite and anorthite. The boundary between amorphous plagioclase and crystalline high-pressure phases in our phase diagram indicate diaplectic glass can form at 1300 to 1500 kelvin, and the melting line suggests that maskelynite can be generated above 3000 kelvin at high pressures.

Existing methods to fix e-PTFE implants on host tissues mainly use invasive anchorage such as sutures, spiral tacks, or metal skeletons, which has limitations such as being time-consuming and causing leakage and tissue damage.

We integrate a hydrophilic and bioadhesive hydrogel layer on the hydrophobic and bioinert e-PTFE by designing a facile approach of freezing-induced micromechanical interlocking. The integration is robust enough as pulling hydrogel out of the interlocked pores on e-PTFE requires large energy dissipation. This bioadhesive interface enables instant (operating time < 10 seconds) and secure (adhesion energy >200 joules per square meter) adhering fixation of e-PTFE implants to wet tissue.
