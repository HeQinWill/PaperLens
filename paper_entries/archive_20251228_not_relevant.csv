Despite their potential, mCDR represents only a tiny fraction of currently deployed CDR methods. Their implementations require not only a comprehensive understanding of the marine processes involved, but also a robust monitoring for their effectiveness and potential environmental impacts. In this work, we surveyed the mCDR scientific literature to identify measurable indicators for quantitative information across different ecosystems and methods used for monitoring the carbon removed and environmental side-effects, and explore the main common challenges. We followed the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analysis protocol PRISMA: the search queries were established, and the literature search and criteria for inclusion/exclusion were transparently defined. Our results reveal the lack of a direct linkage from the mCDR-induced rates of chemical and biological changes to the amount of carbon removed from the atmosphere and the magnitude of associated environmental side-effects. The heterogeneity of marine biogeochemical and ecological processes in time and space, together with the propagation of biogeochemical signals in an open system, represent the most common challenge reported for the monitoring approaches. Our results show that we are in need of indicators that provide reliable quantification of CO2 removal rates and information on environmental side-effects. Finally, based on our gap analysis, we provide monitoring recommendations, such as the use of common metrics and the baseline establishment. Currently, the lack of standardized indicators and monitoring procedures inhibits the verification, and hence, creates risks for further investment and prevents the entering of mCDRs in existing carbon certificate trading systems, hindering the long term growth of this sector."

However, the phase-dependent relationship between concurrent ENSO-IOD events and equatorial-coastal waveguides remains unclear. Long-term SSH observations reveal two distinct waveguide modes during autumn-winter: an eastern mode propagating from eastern IO to Bay of Bengal (BOB), and a western mode extending from central IO to Arabian Sea (AS). These modes exhibit significant coherence in central IO exclusively during concurrent ENSO-IOD events, with stronger SSH anomalies occurring during positive phase. We identify a complete wave-mediated pathway in which equatorial Kelvin-coastal Kelvin waveguide interacts with equatorial Rossby-coastal Kelvin waveguide in central IO, transmitting SSH signal from eastern IO through BOB to AS coast. These results establish a dynamical framework linking ENSO-IOD phases to waveguide connectivity, improving predictability of climate-driven air–sea variability in northern IO."

Their resultant climate responses may not fully offset each other, leading to some nonlinear changes, particularly in summer precipitation over East Asia (EA). However, how the coexistence of CO2 and AAs causes the nonlinear effect on EA precipitation remain unclear. Through analyses of fully coupled model simulations, this study shows that when both forcings are included, the precipitation over North China in July–August decreases less than the linear combination of the changes induced by individual forcings, indicating a nonlinear increase of precipitation. These nonlinear changes over EA likely originate from the Arctic and North Atlantic region. Specifically, the Arctic sea-ice sensitivity to the CO2-induced warming is higher than that to the AA-induced cooling, leading to a large increase of sea ice concentration over the East Siberian–Beaufort Seas in the nonlinear effect. This can excite an anomalous atmospheric Rossby wave propagating southeastward into the North Atlantic, which increases low cloudiness to cool the surface over the midlatitude North Atlantic. This cooling subsequently generates an anomalous Rossby wave train pattern across Eurasia with two branches propagating toward EA. The concurring circulation changes over EA ultimately result in nonlinear precipitation changes there. This study suggests that the nonlinear climate response in the high latitudes can remotely induce nonlinear changes in the lower latitudes and highlights the need to consider nonlinear effects in analyzing externally forced climate changes over EA."

This study leverages Google Trends search activity (2016–2024) across 30 major US metropolitan areas to quantify digital responses to heat. Using generalized additive models, two key response metrics are identified: a temperature ‘threshold’ that triggers public concern and a ‘slope difference’ that measures the intensity of the subsequent reaction. The analysis first establishes that a city’s median climate primarily determines its baseline threshold, while the variability of climate governs the slope difference, both reflecting long-term adaptation to local conditions. After accounting for these climatic effects, the study finds that socioeconomic factors explain a significant portion of the remaining variance in digital heat responsiveness. Specifically, the climate-adjusted threshold is higher in cities with greater social vulnerability, indicating a dangerous delay in awareness. This interplay creates five distinct urban typologies, revealing that temperate coastal cities exhibit a highly reactive pattern while arid inland cities show a response buffered by modern infrastructure. These findings uncover a critical disconnect wherein the populations most at risk are often the last to digitally engage with the threat. This digital proxy provides a new, near real-time method for monitoring public risk perception, offering a vital resource for developing more equitable public health interventions against the escalating threat of extreme heat."

However, its spatio-temporal patterns and potential impacts on water quantity and quality remain poorly understood compared to those of wildfires. By analyzing the Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity database (1984–2022), we characterized distinct regional, seasonal and interannual dynamics of large prescribed fires relative to wildfires across the conterminous United States. We found the Southeast dominated the national prescribed fire regime, accounting for 78.6% of total prescribed fire occurrences and 70.7% of total burned area. Seasonally, prescribed fires primarily occurred in the spring, contrasting with wildfires that peak in autumn, particularly in the West and Southwest. Prescribed fires in the Southeast increased significantly from the early 2000s, peaking around 2010, then temporarily declined, whereas wildfires in the West exhibited an overall upward trend with substantial interannual variability. Our synthesis of studies from 1969 to 2024 showed that prescribed fire could potentially reduce evapotranspiration, but increase surface runoff through alterations of vegetation structure, rainfall partitioning, soil properties, and flow generation processes. Additionally, prescribed fire may influence water quality by modifying soil nitrogen dynamics, dissolved carbon, erosion, and sediment transport. However, these impacts are typically short-lived and can be effectively mitgated through site-specific strategies, supporting the use of prescribed fires as as a safe and practical management tool. To this end, we developed an adaptive framework that guides prescribed burning by balancing its ecological and hydrological benefits against potenital risks, thereby promoting sustainable forest management, reducing wildfire risk, and protecting water resources."

Conservation of these ecosystems is vital in preventing the return of massive amounts of carbon to the atmosphere. With climate boundaries of ecosystems shifting, choosing to restore wisely has never been more important. We set out to assess how climate boundaries of peatlands in Europe may shift with climate by (1) deriving relationships between peatland distributions and climate variables and (2) using these relationships to project peatland distributions into the future based on two climate change scenarios: one scenario in line with the Paris Agreement (SSP1-2.6) and a scenario predicting 3 °C warming by 2050 (SSP5-8.5). We estimate that 93% of European peat soils do not longer have functioning peatland ecosystems. The climate conditions for the remaining 7% of peatlands may remain best in Northern Scandinavia, the Western islands, and higher elevations within the European mainland. In contrast, climate suitability for peatlands will significantly decrease through most of Southern, Central, and Eastern Europe. Under 3 °C warming, 92% of all currently functional peatlands will face less suitable climate conditions by 2050. Moreover, the proportion of peatlands under unfavorable climatic conditions will almost triple from 6% to 15%. Our findings imply that conservation and restoration of peatlands in future climates will be most effective in areas with peatlands that are likely to remain closer to the center of their climate niche including parts of northern Scandinavia, Ireland, Scotland and at higher elevational ranges."

Enhanced rock weathering (ERW) captures CO2 by forming dissolved bicarbonate. In addition to CDR, both methods may offer soil improvement as a co-benefit. However, their interaction and combined CDR potential remain largely unexplored. Here, we investigate their individual and combined effects on carbon dynamics in a temperate agricultural soil. Using the process-based LiDELSv2 model calibrated against data from the lysimeter experiment, we simulate 1000 year impacts of applying 4.2 wt% wood biochar, 2 wt% basanite rock powder (RP), their co-application, and co-pyrolyzed material (rock-enhanced biochar, RE-biochar) on soil organic carbon (SOC), net primary production (NPP), net CO2 ecosystem exchange (NEE), and calcium (Ca2+) leaching in a northern German sandy soil. Biochar alone led to the highest increase in SOC and achieved a modeled NEE of −200 g C ha−1 yr−1 per ton of biochar throughout 1000 years, acting as a long-term carbon sink. Co-application and RE-biochar increased SOC too, but to a lesser extent. Rock powder alone reduced SOC by 7%. Although RP enhanced Ca2+ leaching, this did not result in net CO2 removal. Ecosystem respiration and NPP remained stable in the long term. Our results suggest that, when accounting for assumed application rates, biochar is the primary driver of long-term soil-based CDR, while ERW provides only minor co-benefits. This highlights the need to tailor interventions to specific soil and climate conditions."

Haskins,The global importance of gas-phase peroxy radical accretion reactions for secondary organic aerosol loading,"This work outlines an investigation into an understudied atmospheric chemical reaction pathway with the potential to form particulate pollution that has important impacts on air quality and climate. It suggests that this chemical pathway is responsible for a large fraction of the atmospheric particulate matter observed in tropical forested regions, but also highlights the need for further ambient and lab investigations to inform an accurate representation of this process in atmospheric models. 
 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is an important class of atmospheric species with influences on air quality and climate. One understudied SOA formation pathway is gas-phase peroxy radical (RO2) accretion reactions, where two peroxy radicals combine to form a dimer species. This work makes use of recent advances in the theoretical understanding of RO2 accretion reactions to assess their contribution to SOA. After evaluation in a chemical box model, a reduced representation of RO2 accretion reactions was added to a global chemical transport model (GEOS -Chem) to assess the contribution to global SOA and the associated radiative impact. The results of this work suggest that RO2 accretion products may comprise 30 %–50 % of particulate matter (PM2.5) in tropical forested environments, and a smaller proportion in more temperate regions like the south-eastern USA (≈5 %). This work suggests that biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are the main precursors to accretion products globally, but that a notable fraction of aerosol-phase accretion products come from aromatic-derived RO2 and small acyl-peroxy radicals. Contrary to previous assumptions that accretion products are organic peroxides, the box modelling investigations suggest that non-peroxide accretion products (ethers and esters) could comprise the majority of accretion products in both the gas and aerosol phase. This work provides justification for more extensive measurements of RO2 accretion reactions in laboratory experiments and RO2 accretion products in the ambient atmosphere in order to better constrain the representation of this chemistry in atmospheric models, including a greater level of mechanistic chemical representation of SOA formation processes."

We conclude that atmospheric chemical processing, in which aerosol liquid water and acidity play vital roles, dictates aerosol aluminium solubility. 
 Deposition of mineral dust aerosol into open oceans impacts marine biogeochemistry, and the deposition flux can be constrained using dissolved aluminum (Al) in surface seawater as a tracer. However, aerosol Al solubility, a critical parameter used in this method, remains highly uncertain. We investigated seasonal variations of Al solubility for supermicron and submicron particles at two locations in Northern China. Aerosol Al solubility was very low at Xi'an (0.11 %–9.1 %), showed no apparent variation with seasons or relative humidity, and was not correlated with sulfate or nitrate; in contrast, it was much higher at Qingdao (0.06 %–23.4 %), exhibited distinct seasonal variability, and increased with relative humidity and the abundance of sulfate and nitrate. All these features observed can be explained by the effects of atmospheric chemical processing. Mineral dust transported to Xi'an, an inland city in Northwest China, was still not obviously aged and thus chemical processing had little effect on Al solubility; after arriving at Qingdao, a coastal city in the Northwest Pacific, mineral dust was substantially aged by chemical processing, leading to significant enhancement in Al solubility. Our work further reveals that aerosol liquid water and acidity play vital roles in the dissolution of aerosol Al by chemical processing. We suggest that chemical aging can lead to spatiotemporal variation of aerosol Al solubility, and this should be considered when using dissolved Al in surface seawater to constrain oceanic dust deposition."

Heatwave results: canopy heat island was 91.3 % stronger day/52.7 % night. Day heat relied on building coverage, night on sky visibility. Tall buildings block sun by day, trap heat at night. Night ventilation cools, day winds spread heat. Urban design must consider day-night cycles to fight extreme heat, guiding risk reduction. 
 Currently, the diurnal asymmetric and nonlinear mechanisms by which urban morphology modulates the canopy urban heat island (CUHI) during heat wave (HW) periods remain underexplored. This study aims to fill this gap by focusing on the area within the Fifth Ring Road of Beijing, integrating three complementary methods: XGBoost (to identify key morphological drivers), ENVI-met (to reveal nonlinear regulatory processes), and wind environment analysis (to supplement dynamic modulation). The results show that: (1) HW periods significantly enhance CUHI intensity (CUHII) compared to non-heat wave (NHW) periods, with a 91.3 % increase in daytime and 52.7 % at night; (2) XGBoost identifies building coverage ratio (BCR) as the core daytime driver of CUHII, while sky view factor (SVF) dominates at night, and both 2D and 3D morphological indicators exert stronger effects during HW periods; (3) ENVI-met simulations reveal nonlinear mechanisms of building height/SVF: daytime thermal environments are co-driven by short-wave radiation shading and ventilation resistance (as SVF decreases), while nighttime environments are dominated by long-wave radiation accumulation by buildings; (4) Wind environment analysis further shows diurnal differences in wind's role: nighttime ventilation corridors mitigate CUHII by 33.91 %–42.09 %, while daytime prevailing winds may exacerbate downstream CUHII via thermal advection. These findings clarify the diurnal asymmetric mechanisms of CUHI and provide scientific support for urban morphological optimization under extreme heat."

Dheed is a global database of dry and hot compound extreme events from 1950 to 2023. It can be combined with other data to study the impacts of those events on terrestrial ecosystems, specific species or human societies. Dheed's analysis confirms that extremely dry and hot days have become more common on all continents in recent decades, especially in Europe and Africa. 
 The intensification of climate extremes is one of the most immediate effects of global climate change. Heatwaves and droughts have uneven impacts on ecosystems that can be exacerbated in case of compound events. To comprehensively study these events, e.g. with local high-resolution remote sensing or in-situ data, a global catalogue of compound dry and hot (CDH) events is essential. Here, we propose a database of large-scale dry and hot extreme events based on ERA5 climate reanalysis data. Drought indicators are constructed based on the daily balance between reference evapotranspiration and precipitation averaged over the previous 30, 90 and 180 d. Extreme events are detected with absolute local thresholds for the 1950–2023 period. CDH extremes are defined as daily maximum temperature at 2 m exceeding a 99 % absolute local threshold based on the empirical probability distribution, combined with any of the three drought indicators falling short of the 1 % threshold. Unique labels are assigned to CDH events lasting at least three days using a connected component analysis.  Their spatiotemporal extent and summary statistics are extracted for all labelled events. The identified CDH events are validated against extreme events reported in the literature. Out of 40 events listed a priori, 38 could be associated with labelled CDH events. All 10 largest and 10 longest labelled CDH events could be linked to droughts and/or heatwaves reported in the scientific or grey literature.

Compared to the 10 m product, the sub-meter map achieved a 14.60% increase in overall accuracy, revealed a 57.73% discrepancy in spatial distribution, and detected 17 times more individual patches. The improved sensitivity to small patches significantly enhances early detection of Spartina alterniflora invasion. This finer mapping further refines soil carbon estimates and informs wetland management. 
 Current large-scale maps of Spartina alterniflora (S. alterniflora) with 10 m resolution hinder accurate delineation of community boundaries, detection of internal features such as creeks, and identification of small patches. These limitations further compromise the accuracy of spatial distribution extraction and subsequent analyzes. To this end, this study produced the first 2020 national-scale Sub-meter (0.9 m) S. alterniflora Map of Mainland China (CM-SSM), using an object- and sub-meter-enhanced pixel-based phenological feature composite method. The method integrates phenological features from Sentinel-2 with spatial and texture details from Google Earth imagery, improving the spectral separability and mitigating mixed-pixel effects. Compared to the 10 m S. alterniflora product of Mainland China (CMSA), CM-SSM improved overall accuracy by 14.60 % and the F1 score by 0.24. Although the total mapped areas of CM-SSM (59 371 ha) and CMSA (58 006 ha) differ by only 1365 ha, their spatial distributions diverge substantially. When benchmarked against CM-SSM, CMSA exhibited commission and omission errors totaling 34 273 ha (57.73 %). Moreover, the number of patches identified by CM-SSM (148 072) was over 17 times greater than that of CMSA, reflecting its superior capability in detecting fragmented distributions. In addition, Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) estimates derived from CM-SSM were 706.69 Gg (23.09 %) higher than those reported by the corresponding national SOC product for the same year, emphasizing the essential contribution of high-resolution mapping to accurate carbon accounting for S. alterniflora. These advances enhance understanding of S. alterniflora invasion dynamics, support carbon accounting, and inform evidence-based coastal wetland management and restoration.

To enable computationally efficient modeling approaches that can account for potentially unknown subsurface properties, we present a surrogate modeling technique. This technique combines physics-based and machine-learning techniques to enable reliable predictions of geodynamical applications, as we illustrate for the case study of the Alpine Region. 
 Geodynamical processes are important to understand and assess the evolution of the Earth system as well as its natural resources. Given the wide range of characteristic spatial and temporal scales of geodynamic processes, their analysis routinely relies on computer-assisted numerical simulations. To provide reliable predictions such simulations need to consider a wide range of potential input parameters, material properties as they vary in space and time, in order to address associated uncertainties. To obtain any quantifiable measure of these uncertainties is challenging both because of the high computational cost of the forward simulation and because data is typically limited to direct observations at the near surface and for the present-day state. To account for both of these challenges, we present how to construct efficient and reliable surrogate models that are applicable to a wide range of geodynamic problems using a physics-based machine learning method. In this study, we apply our approach to the case study of the Alpine region, as a natural example for a complex geodynamic setting where several subduction slabs as imaged by tomographic methods interact below a heterogeneous lithosphere. We specifically develop surrogates for two sets of observables, topography and surface velocity, to provide models that can be used in probabilistic frameworks to validate the underlying model structure and parametrization. We additionally construct models for the deeper crustal and mantle domains of the model, to improve the system understanding. For this last family of models, we highlight different construction methods to develop models to either allow evaluations in the entirety of the 3D model or only at specific depth intervals."

Lee;Sandip Pal,Urban heat forecasting in small cities: evaluation of a high-resolution operational numerical weather prediction model,"We evaluated a high-resolution numerical weather prediction model in a small, semi-arid U.S. city using dense ground-based measurements. While the forecasts demonstrated good skill for temperature and humidity, they consistently overestimated wind and underestimated nighttime cooling, with inaccurate heat advection predictions. The results highlight the need for improved urban representation in forecast models to better support heat warning systems for small cities. 
 With rising global temperatures, urban environments are increasingly vulnerable to heat stress, often exacerbated by the Urban Heat Island (UHI) effect. While most UHI research has focused on large metropolitan areas around the world, relatively smaller-sized cities (with a population 100 000–300 000) remain understudied despite their growing exposure to extreme heat and meteorological significance. In particular, urban heat advection (UHA), the transport of heat by mean winds, remains a key but underexplored mechanism in most modeling frameworks. High-resolution numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are essential tools for simulating urban hydrometeorological conditions, yet most prior evaluations have focused on retrospective reanalysis products rather than forecasts. In this study, we assess the performance of a widely used operational weather forecast model, the High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), as a representative example of current NWP systems. We investigate its ability to predict spatial and temporal patterns of urban heat and UHA within and around Lubbock, Texas, a small-sized city located in a semi-arid environment in the southwestern US. Using data collected between 1 September 2023, and 31 August 2024 from the Urban Heat Island Experiment in Lubbock, Texas (U-HEAT) network and five West Texas Mesonet stations, we compare 18 h forecasts against in situ observations. HRRR forecasts exhibit a consistent nighttime cold bias at both urban and rural sites, a daytime warm bias at rural locations, and a pervasive dry bias across all seasons. The model also systematically overestimates near-surface wind speeds, further limiting its ability to accurately predict UHA. Although HRRR captures the expected slower nocturnal cooling in urban areas, it does not well capture advective heat transport under most wind regimes. Our findings reveal both systematic biases and urban representation limitations in current high-resolution NWP forecasts. Our forecast–observation comparisons underscore the need for improved urban parameterizations and evaluation frameworks focused on forecast skill, with important implications for heat-risk warning systems and forecasting in small and mid-sized cities."

These materials can behave like both solids and fluids, making their modeling difficult. Matter addresses this with a unified framework, using a numerical solver called MPM. Able to capture cohesion, density variations and complex terrains, it's particularly relevant for snow avalanches or landslides. Matter runs efficiently on standard computers, making advanced simulations more accessible. 
 Simulating the mechanics and flow of granular media requires numerical methods that can handle extreme deformations, along with accurate constitutive models capable of capturing phenomena such as elasticity, shear banding, viscous behavior, compressibility, intergranular attractive forces and rate-dependent friction. In pursuit of this, this article introduces Matter, a Material Point Method (MPM) solver equipped with a range of models to describe dry and cohesive granular media. Rooted in a finite strain elastoplastic framework with a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, this solver features Drucker-Prager models, overstress models, critical state mechanics models as well as the μ(I)-rheology. This includes the recently proposed “critical state μ(I)-rheology model” for cohesive and compressible flows. Moreover, Matter provides a simple way of dealing with complex terrains and introduces a novel material-induced frictional boundary condition. Implemented in C++ with few required dependencies and parallelized on shared memory, it represents a lightweight yet computationally efficient option for laptops and desktops."

 Outlet glaciers and ice streams of the ice sheet of Kalaallit Nunaat (Greenland) transport ice from the interior towards the ocean, so understanding their dynamics is crucial in the context of accelerating Arctic warming. Glacier flow dynamics are predominantly monitored by satellites, thus important processes that occur on timescales shorter than the acquisition frequency (typically days) remain undetected. Therefore, the short-term dynamics of fast-flowing glaciers remains poorly understood and insufficiently constrained in numerical models. Here we use high-rate field observations by global navigation satellite system stations and a Terrestrial Radar Interferometer on Greenland’s fastest ice stream, Sermeq Kujalleq in Kangia (Jakobshavn Isbræ), to characterize its response to the drainage of two surface lakes. The ensuing subglacial flood caused a pulse of faster flow that rapidly propagated downstream—over 16 km within 4 hours—towards the terminus, where it triggered a longer than usual calving episode, lasting 2 hours. The undamped and fast propagation of this speed-up pulse, together with the instantaneous response of the surrounding shear margins, indicate strong coupling within the ice-stream system. Our results highlight how inland areas can accommodate large disturbances with minimal long-term impact on ice motion and efficiently propagate them downstream to trigger irreversible changes at glacier termini.

 Undefined epigenetic programs act to probabilistically silence individual autosomal alleles, generating unique individuals, even from genetic clones. This random monoallelic expression can explain variation in traits and diseases that differences in genes and environments cannot. Here, we developed the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans to study monoallelic expression in whole tissues, and defined a developmental genetic regulation pathway. We found maternal H3K9 histone methyltransferase (HMT) SET-25/SUV39/G9a works with HPL-2/HP1 and LIN-61/L3MBTL2 to randomly silence alleles in the intestinal progenitor E-cell of 8-cell embryos to cause monoallelic expression. SET-25 was antagonized by another maternal H3K9 HMT, MET-2/SETDB1, which works with LIN-65/ATF7IP and ARLE-14/ARL14EP to prevent monoallelic expression. The HMT catalytic SET domains of both MET-2 and SET-25 were required for regulating monoallelic expression. Our data support a model wherein SET-25 and MET-2 regulate histones during development to generate patterns of somatic monoallelic expression that are persistent but not heritable.

A peptide gel that traps 4-GBA restores jawbone healing in rats, rabbits and dogs, suggesting a local, immune-sparing therapy. 
 Hyperglycemia impairs stem cell–mediated bone regeneration, yet the responsible immunometabolic block remains undefined. We identify a neutrophil–Pad4–metabolite axis that suppresses osteogenesis. In rat models of chronic and intermittent hyperglycemia, neutrophils activate ERK/JNK–AP‑1, upregulate Pad4, and generate 4‑guanidinobutyric acid (4‑GBA). 4‑GBA binds alkaline phosphatase (ALP) on jawbone mesenchymal stem cells (JBMSCs), inhibits ALP, and reduces mineralization. Padi4 deletion accelerates socket healing under hyperglycemia. To restore osteogenesis, we engineer GBASpongel, a peptide hydrogel that captures 4‑GBA at the defect. Local GBASpongel treatment rescues ALP activity, osteogenic gene expression, and bone formation in hyperglycemic rats, and improves jawbone regeneration in hyperglycemic rabbits and beagle dogs. Binding assays show micromolar affinity between 4‑GBA and ALP. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses corroborate pathway activation and rescue. Neutrophil-derived 4-GBA directly links hyperglycemia to impaired JBMSC function, and locally targeting this metabolite provides a translational approach to restore bone healing in dysglycemia. Here they show that high blood sugar drives neutrophils to release 4-GBA, a Pad4 byproduct that blocks bone-forming stem cells. A peptide gel that traps 4-GBA restores jawbone healing in rats, rabbits and dogs, suggesting a local, immune-sparing therapy."

Here, the authors report a method for kinetically regulated particle fusion controlled by variation in polymer chain length. 
 Particle fusion is key for establishing communication between biological components. For this reason, whole cell fusion plays a crucial role in many processes, including infection, muscle formation and tissue repair. Analogous co-assembly between synthetic nanoparticles represents a similar type of communication mechanism in artificial systems. Other approaches to control such co-assembly rely on incorporating anisotropic recognition units onto particle surfaces to provide a thermodynamic driving force. Here we present a fundamentally different approach, where hetero-fusion between two populations of undecorated polymer nanoparticles is regulated using kinetic control. Fusion extent is tuned simply by adjusting polymer chain length. Fusion is probed using an elemental tagging strategy for cryogenic scanning transmission electron microscopy combined with electron energy loss spectroscopy (cryo-STEM-EELS). Our results demonstrate the emergence of a complex process between populations of synthetic nanoparticles akin to communication. We anticipate such systems-level behaviour that results from hetero-fusion can enable future technologies.

These authors characterize a nematode homolog of such human receptors, presenting the cryo-EM structure of an asymmetric dimer that embodies properties of the human receptors. 
 Glycoprotein hormones (GpHs) produced in the human pituitary act through receptors (GpHRs) in the gonads to support reproduction and in the thyroid for metabolism. GpHs are heterodimeric cystine-knot proteins; their receptors bind cognate hormones at an extracellular domain and signal through a transmembrane domain to heterotrimeric G proteins. GpHs and GpHRs have co-evolved from invertebrate counterparts. Structures of the human receptors as isolated for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) are all monomeric despite compelling evidence for their functioning as dimers. Here we characterize the homologous receptor from Caenorhabditis elegans. Its biochemical properties are notably similar to those of the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor (TSHR) of humans. Structurally, it is an asymmetric dimer (protomers screw-transformed by 142°/4.1 Å), composed such that only one hormone could bind. This is compatible with the 1:2 asymmetry of negatively cooperative TSH:TSHR complexes and for the transactivation evident from functional complementation of binding-deficient and signaling-deficient GpHRs. By modeling, a symmetrized dimer can bind two hormones as in the 2:2 complexes that support TSHR switches in G-protein usage.

Here, the authors show that Piezo1-driven YAP–CCN1/2 signalling is essential for osteocyte maturation and dendrite formation. 
 Mechanical force controls bone development and homeostasis, with mechanosensitive osteocytes playing a key role. Osteocytes form interconnected dendrites to respond to mechanical stimuli and regulate bone formation and resorption. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying osteocyte maturation and dendrite formation remain elusive. Here we show that Piezo1 loss in late osteoblasts and osteocytes reduces bone mass and disrupts osteocyte differentiation with reduced dendrite number, length and network formation. Decreased YAP activity and unexpected Wnt/β-catenin signaling activation cause these deficiencies, largely restored by intermittent YAP activation. We further identify YAP targets CCN1/2 as crucial secreted factors in the Piezo1-YAP mechanotransduction. CCN1/2 overexpression in the liver rescues dendritic and bone defects in the Piezo1 mutant mice by activating Src, promoting actin polymerization, and activating YAP in a positive feedforward loop. Our findings highlight the pivotal roles of Piezo1 and YAP-CCN1/2-Src signaling, offering potential therapeutic targets for improving osteocyte dendritic networks.

The derived ZnMgO shows ultraviolet photoresponse for photodetection. 
 Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are porous crystalline materials whose composition and structure can be tuned for catalysis, sensing, and optoelectronic applications. Incorporating two different metal ions into a single framework can broaden the functionalities of MOFs. However, conventional solvothermal synthesis typically requires high temperature and long reaction times, while electrochemical anodic dissolution is limited by solid anodes that can only supply a single metal source. For active metals such as Mg, the rapid formation of a passivation layer on solid anodes hinders the continuous release of metal ions. Here, we introduce a liquid metal interface-controlled electrochemical strategy using a fluid Mg-Ga alloy anode, overcoming the single-metal limitation of conventional anodic deposition. The self-healing surface of liquid gallium and its high surface tension induce electrocapillarity and Marangoni flow under an applied bias, enabling dynamic and spatially uniform release of Mg²⁺ ions that co-assemble precisely with Zn²⁺ from solution. Under an optimized bias of 0.3 V, the resulting bimetallic ZnMg-MOF-74 exhibits high crystallinity, nanosheet morphology, and uniform metal distribution. The ZnMgO oxide derived from a two-step annealing process shows excellent ultraviolet photodetection performance, with a responsivity of 1.48 A/W and a fast rise time of 0.32 s. This substrate-free and composition-controllable platform highlights a strategy for interface-driven synthesis of multimetallic MOFs and their derivatives for sensing and optoelectronic applications.

 XPD is a key nucleotide excision repair (NER) protein whose function is vital for genome integrity. During NER, XPD serves as a 5′−3′ single-strand DNA translocase that enables lesion scanning and verification in genomic DNA. Yet, its translocation mechanism is incompletely understood. Here we use molecular simulations and chain-of-replicas path optimization methods to model the ATP-driven translocation mechanisms of XPD and its bacterial homolog DinG, revealing all on-path metastable intermediates and corresponding kinetic rates. We identify the XPD(DinG) global domain motions that modulate the strength of DNA association at the opposing ends of the DNA-binding groove. During the ATP hydrolysis cycle, alternating weak and strong interactions at two defined groove constrictions enable DNA reptation and forward displacement of the ATPase. Moreover, we show that DNA- or ATP-binding residues directly involved in translocation are hotspots for genetic disease mutations. Thus, our findings shed light on the etiology of XPD-associated genetic syndromes.

 Cells in highly crowded environments are exposed to fluctuating mechanical forces. While cells can activate the cortical migration machinery to escape from undesirable compressive stress, the consequence to less motile cells and of prolonged extensive confinement is yet to be uncovered. Here, we demonstrate that nuclear deformation generated by axial confinement triggers a specific form of regulated cell death – ferroptosis. We show that axial confinement is sensed by the nucleus and results in Drp1-dependent mitochondrial fragmentation and mitochondrial ROS accumulation. Meanwhile, we detect cPLA2 translocation to mitochondria. These mitochondrial ROS accumulation and arachidonic acid production concertedly lead to lipid peroxidation and evoke ferroptosis. Interestingly, we find in osteoarthritis, a disease intimately associated with mechanical overloading and inflammation, characteristics of confinement-induced ferroptosis including mitochondrial localization of cPLA2 and high ROS. Together, our findings unveil a pivotal role of cell nucleus and mitochondria in linking mechanical confinement with cell death, highlighting the orchestration of Drp1 and cPLA2 in confinement-induced ferroptosis.

 Crustal recycling, a fundamental process promoting planetary differentiation, is conventionally attributed to plate tectonics on Earth. However, the mechanisms driving this process in tectonically stagnant regimes remain ambiguous. The heavy sulfur isotope (δ34S = 2.0–2.4‰) composition of troilites in the newly-discovered 4.2 Ga high-Al basalt from the South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin indicates the incorporation of surficial degassed 34S-enriched crustal materials into the mantle. Numerical simulations of the SPA-forming impact and the induced mantle convection show that uplifted molten crustal materials are exposed to vacuum for about one hour, leading to degassing and enrichment of 34S, then transported to depths greater than 200 km to provide a hybrid mantle source for high-Al basaltic magmatism. Our integrated petrological geochemical numerical study provides the mechanistic validation of impact-driven crustal recycling on the Moon, fundamentally advancing our capacity to decode early crust–mantle evolution in terrestrial bodies within the inner Solar System.

 The origin of depleted, intermediate, and enriched geochemical reservoirs on Mars has long been debated, with competing models invoking mantle heterogeneity versus crustal contributions. Resolving this is central to understanding the martian mantle composition, crust-mantle interactions, and magma evolution. Here we examine the role of closed- and open-system processes on shergottite magma rare earth element (REE) evolution. We present the first complete REE dataset for olivine, the earliest crystallising phase and proxy for primitive melts, and REEs for olivine-hosted melt inclusions and late-stage merrillite, enabling robust tracking of REE evolution throughout shergottite crystallisation. Depleted and intermediate shergottites exhibit closed-system behaviour, indicating derivation from distinct mantle sources. Enriched shergottites record mixed processes, some reflecting enriched mantle sources and others open-system REE evolution, likely through assimilation of enriched material by depleted magmas. Shergottite diversity thus reflects both preserved mantle heterogeneities and dynamic open-system processes, highlighting the importance of an enriched crustal reservoir.

 Silicon, earth’s second most abundant element, cycles via biogeochemical processes in terrestrial and oceanic environments. The marine sediment-water interface is thought to divide biological-dominated (water) from abiotic-dominated (sediment) silica cycling processes. Studies indicate marine extremophile bacteria induce silica precipitation, but the quantitative importance of microorganisms in broader sediment silica cycling remains unexplored. We hypothesize that microorganisms significantly influence sediment silica cycling, challenging the prevailing divide of microbial importance. Within hours, sediment microbes expedited silica sequestration through rapid coupled dissolution/reprecipitation processes in marine deltaic sediment experiments. Using radiotracer silicon-32, we reveal that microbial mediation enhanced silica uptake, surpassing abiotic uptake by 3.6-fold in dilute suspensions (silica < 100 μM) and 3.4-fold in surface sediment porewater simulations. We assert that microorganisms drive significant diagenetic silica cycling rates, facilitating authigenic silica precipitation through previously reported mechanisms from microscopy analysis.

 Climate change is destabilizing Arctic landscapes by accelerating permafrost degradation, leading to more frequent slope failures, especially during summers. Summer is also the high touristic season for nature-based tourism in the Arctic, attracting visitors unfamiliar with permafrost-related risks. In this context, the Yukon, West Greenland, and Svalbard face both intensifying permafrost degradation and growing summer tourism, making them relevant cases for examining the intersections between permafrost and tourism. While studies and adaptation strategies prioritize local communities, they tend to overlook tourists, a growing demographic in permafrost regions. This tourism growth puts additional economic and safety burdens on local communities. It is argued that tourism should be more fully integrated into adaptation strategies to permafrost degradation and to that end, we propose three recommendations: stronger dialogue with tourism actors; target audiences for improved risk communication; integrate risk communication on permafrost degradation in tourism development goals. Overall, we claim that the inclusion of tourism in adaptation strategies will further contribute to Arctic communities’ resilience.

 Marine calcifiers support ecosystem services, including shell fisheries and coral reefs. Constraining the saturation state of the calcification media of these organisms is essential to understand the response of biomineralisation to environmental change. Here we synthesise aragonite over variable pH, saturation state, temperature, and in the presence of simple biomolecules. We show that the lithium/magnesium distribution coefficient, relating aragonite and precipitation fluid compositions, is significantly affected by precipitation rate but not by temperature or pH. Precipitation rate reflects saturation state and temperature, so lithium/magnesium of biogenic aragonite can be used to calculate mineral precipitation rate and, if the precipitation temperature is known, to reconstruct calcification medium saturation state. Applying the distribution coefficients to a published calcifier dataset indicates that calcification media saturation state is ca. 9 to 13 at 18–30 °C and ca. 6 to 10 at 10–18 °C.

 Carbon dioxide release from the Southern Ocean is generally recognized as a primary factor driving atmospheric carbon dioxide rise during the deglaciation; however, the Bølling-Allerød period saw an atmospheric carbon dioxide plateau, despite diminished biological pump and enhanced ventilation in the Southern Ocean favoring carbon dioxide outgassing. Here we, by compiling productivity records based on multiple geochemical and paleontological proxies, suggest that this plateau was achieved by basin-wide elevated biological pump in the oligotrophic North Pacific. This basin-scale carbon sink is a result of oligotrophy and stratification, allowing for prolonged and complete consumption of deep-sourced nutrients and carbon dioxide in the deepened euphotic zone when North Pacific Intermediate Water was sluggish. This carbon sink is amplified by synchronously enhanced stratification-induced nitrogen fixation. Extending the Bølling-Allerød warming-biological pump analogy to current and future warming scenarios, however, is constrained by human-forced biogeochemical-physical processes, yielding large uncertainties in biological pump responses and feedbacks.

Here authors show that the mTORC1 pathway, partly via neuromedin U receptor 1 (NMUR1), plays a pivotal role in ILC2 cell activation, and that inhibition of this signalling alleviates allergic asthma in mice. 
 Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) initiate pathologic type 2 inflammation in allergic asthma in response to diverse tissue-derived stimuli. However, the molecular mechanisms by which ILC2 cells integrate and respond to environmental signals are unclear. Here, we show in a mouse model that in allergic asthma, mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) activation in lung ILC2 cells increases. Genetic ablation of Raptor, an obligatory component of mTORC1 complex, results in reduced IL-5 and IL-13 production in ILC2 cells and protects mice from allergic inflammation. Pharmacological inhibition of mTORC1 by rapamycin suppresses ILC2 activation and ameliorates allergic lung inflammation. Mechanistically, mTORC1 activation upregulates neuromedin U receptor 1 (NMUR1) expression through epigenetic reprogramming, which augments ILC2 activation in response to neuromedin U (NMU). However, our experiments suggest that NMUR1 is not an exclusive mediator of ILC2 activation downstream of mTORC1. In conclusion, our work reveals that in ILC2s, mTORC1 signaling coordinates neuro-immune crosstalk for optimal activation, and highlights mTORC1 as a potential therapeutic target for allergic asthma. Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2) are known to contribute to the pathology of allergic asthma but the molecular mechanism by which they are getting activated are not fully known. Here authors show that the mTORC1 pathway, partly via neuromedin U receptor 1 (NMUR1), plays a pivotal role in ILC2 cell activation, and that inhibition of this signalling alleviates allergic asthma in mice."

Here, the authors report that Pt chains host delocalized electrons and a distinct active site, giving metallic character and faster hydrogen evolution than isolated atoms. 
 As the smallest one-dimensional structure, single-atom chains exhibit many one-dimensional quantized behaviors, such as Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid behavior, high-temperature superconductivity, and fluctuations. In contrast to single-atom catalysts, there is growing interest in exploring whether and how the point-to-point interaction occurs between neighboring metal atoms in 1D chains. Here, we controllably fabricate Pt chains and single atoms in MoS2 films with similar coordination environments and conduct model studies on their catalytic behaviors in hydrogen production. Combining calculations with field effect transistor and micro-electrochemical measurements, we reveal that the chains exhibit significant delocalized electron densities, which underpins their metallic behavior and engenders a fascinating center site with lower Gibbs free energy than that of single atoms. Notably, we demonstrate that the chain density can be well-tuned, achieving a maximum of 2.82 Pt/nm2, which enables a competitive turnover frequency and wafer-scale hydrogen production. This work offers insights into our understanding of the possible synergistic effect between metal atoms in a 1D arrangement for electrocatalysis.

Here, the authors study chromospheric magnetic fields in three M-dwarf stars using spectropolarimetric observations, finding fields reaching hundreds of Gauss with complex height-dependent structures. 
 Magnetic fields in the upper atmospheres of solar-like stars are believed to provide an enormous amount of energy to power the hot coronae and drive large-scale eruptions that could impact the habitability of planetary systems around these stars. However, these magnetic fields have never been routinely measured on stars beyond the solar system. Through decade-long spectropolarimetric observations, we have now achieved the measurements of magnetic fields in the lower and middle chromospheres of three M-dwarfs. Our results indicate that the line-of-sight component of the chromospheric magnetic fields can reach up to hundreds of Gauss, whose sign frequently opposes that of the photospheric field. The measurements highlight the magnetic field complexity and the variation with height close to the surface of these M-dwarfs. They provide critical constraints on the energy budget responsible for heating and eruptions of stellar upper atmospheres, and enable assessments of how stellar magnetic activity may affect exoplanet environments. Magnetic fields in stellar upper atmospheres are key to understanding stellar activity and its planetary effects.

 Sub-seasonal to seasonal (S2S) precipitation forecasting has long been regarded as a “forecasting desert” due to limited skill beyond seven lead days, undermining downstream hydrological forecasts. However, the higher predictability of streamflow compared to precipitation, and its disproportionate improvement relative to precipitation forecast, have often been overlooked. This study integrates a distributed hydrological model with a probabilistic statistical model to enhance S2S flood forecast by assimilating statistical hydroclimate relationships. The ensemble approach is validated at 24 hydrological stations across Pearl River Basin with complex hydrology. Its modest forecasts show mean Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) scores ranging from 0.36 to 0.16 for weeks 2 to 6, and a 15% improvement in Continuous Ranked Probability Score Skill (CRPSS) compared to hydrological model alone. This study underscores the value of integrating physical and statistical models to improve S2S streamflow prediction, offering a practical pathway to enhance forecast skill in flood-prone basins."

 Earlier leaf-out enhances spring moisture exchange between land and atmosphere. However, its impact on precipitation intensity remains unclear, hampering dynamic monitoring on water erosion. Here we combined remote sensing, reanalysis data, and coupled land-atmosphere model to address this knowledge gap. Results observed an increasing trend in spring precipitation accompanied by earlier leaf-out across temperate China. The simulations isolated the phenological impacts and attributed it to the enhancement of nonerosive precipitation. The mid-temperate semi-humid region exhibited the largest increase (3.03 ± 3.66 mm) in response to 14-days leaf-out advancement. Conversely, erosive precipitation declined in sparsely vegetated areas (<50% cover), sharpening the heterogeneity of moisture gradient. Elevated convective available potential energy promoted more frequent precipitation, inhibiting the deep moisture accumulation required for erosive downpours. Simulated erosive precipitation also declined in temperate summer and autumn. Findings highlight vegetation’s role in precipitation redistribution beyond surface interception, requiring conservation planning to consider bidirectional vegetation-climate feedback.

Chorus waves are known to accelerate these electrons via resonant interactions, but these interactions are inherently nonlinear and coherent. How such processes shape large‐scale electron dynamics remains unresolved. Two competing paradigms, nonlinear advection and diffusive transport, have been debated for decades. Here, we address this controversy using large‐scale first‐principles simulations that self‐consistently generate realistic chorus wave fields, coupled with test particle modeling. We find that electron motion is coherent on short timescales—comparable to or less than a bounce period—but becomes stochastic over longer timescales due to decorrelation. The resulting transport coefficients support the use of quasilinear diffusion theory for long‐term evolution. This work bridges microscopic nonlinear physics with macroscopic modeling frameworks, offering a unified explanation of radiation belt dynamics and advancing the foundation for space weather forecasting."

While traditionally attributed to inner magnetospheric electron heating, recent observations and simulations challenge the exclusivity of this mechanism. Here, we resolve the ionospheric origin of SAR arcs using multi‐instrument observations and numerical simulations during the March 2015 geomagnetic storm. Both magnetospheric heat flux and ion‐neutral frictional heating, driven by subauroral plasma flows, independently generate SAR arcs with intensities surpassing background airglow by hundreds of Rayleighs. While thermal electron impact dominates red‐line emissions in both cases, the vertical structures diverge: frictional heating localizes emissions to altitudes of 250–400 km, whereas magnetospheric heating extends emissions above ∼280 km with broader altitudinal coverage. These results redefine SAR arc generation as a product of competing magnetospheric and ionospheric energy pathways, advancing our understanding of cross‐scale interactions in geospace."

To address this isotope discrepancy, we used high‐resolution ion concentrations and carbon isotope data (CH4 and DIC) of porewaters from the Haima seep, South China Sea, to reconstruct the carbon cycle using a reaction‐transport model. Model simulations demonstrate that in situ methanogenesis cannot explain the extreme 13C depletion. Instead, the shift towards 13C‐depleted CH4 and DIC is primarily driven by isotopic equilibration during AOM, modulated by the carbon isotope fractionation factor and reverse AOM reaction flux under stable conditions. This mechanistic framework reconciles the paradoxical 13C‐depletion in CH4 by emphasizing the role of carbon isotope equilibration during AOM, offering an effective method for tracing the cryptic methane cycle in seep environments."

High‐frequency receiver‐function imaging of the shallow lithosphere beneath the Bermuda swell reveals two prominent interfaces interpreted as the fossil oceanic Moho and the bottom of an underplated layer. This underplated layer is ∼20 km thick, ∼2x greater than observations at many other intraplate ocean islands. Based on the topography of the Bermuda swell, this layer could be rock that is ∼50 kg/m3 less dense than the lithospheric mantle it has replaced.

The Niño‐3.4 index has long been used to characterize ENSO. However, new ENSO indices have been proposed in recent years. Here, in the context of Atlantic tropical cyclone activity, we compared Niño‐3.4 to three modern ENSO indices: the relative Niño‐3.4 index, the ENSO Longitudinal Index (ELI), and a Pacific sea surface temperature zonal gradient index. We examined the association of their August–October values with central Pacific convection, tropical cyclone‐related variables in the Atlantic (e.g., vertical wind shear and potential intensity), and Atlantic tropical cyclone activity. We also assessed the skill of seasonal forecasts of the ENSO indices and the skill of index‐based forecasts of Atlantic tropical cyclone activity.

The emulators were calibrated to historical observations and used for future climate projections without systematic evaluation of their robustness. Here, we develop a framework to evaluate the performance of physical climate model emulators against global climate model (GCM) large ensembles. This is demonstrated by constraining a two‐layer energy balance model (EBM) to historical simulations of four GCMs and comparing their 21st century warming projections. The EBM matches projected warming in three of the four GCMs but exhibits substantial ensemble spread.

We developed a synthetic DNA‐labeling/qPCR approach to distinguish mixed colloids (0.05, 0.5, and 5 μm) transport in porous media. Contrary to single‐size systems where larger colloids (5 μm) were more retained, mixed‐size systems showed higher retention of smaller colloids (0.05 μm). Scanning electron microscopy and filtration analyses revealed size‐dependent heteroaggregation, where smaller colloids deposited on larger ones, forming pore‐blocking aggregates. HYDRUS‐1D simulations identified three governing factors: pore size, surface potential, and media heterogeneity.

Through a case study and composite analysis, we found that the QSARs in the Pacific region gradually moved westward toward Korea, resulting in the stagnation of large amounts of CWV and precipitation near Korea. The dynamical mechanisms of the HPEs associated with the QSARs are investigated based on the finite‐amplitude local wave activity (LWA) calculated using the ERA5 reanalysis data. Downstream amplification of the LWA, which is associated with the westward movement of the Pacific QSAR, occurred approximately 1 week before HPEs over South Korea.

This study demonstrates the key role of ice-ocean interactions in controlling ice-sheet retreat. 
 The Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS), the largest ice stream draining the Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS), is losing mass at an accelerating rate due to atmospheric and ocean-driven melting. Holding the equivalent of 1.1–1.4 metres of sea-level rise, its collapse will have a significant impact on global sea levels making it crucial to understand the controls on its dynamic behaviour. The NEGIS retreated from the continental shelf edge by 21.6 ka BP, with this study confirming continued grounding line retreat to ~100 km from the shelf edge by 20.3 ka BP, earlier than previously reported. This early retreat was driven by warm Return Atlantic Water (RAW) and amplified by a retrograde seabed, which together drove initial grounding line retreat. The presence of a series of grounding zone wedges indicates a quasi-stable grounding line, which was fronted by an ice shelf. Grounding-line retreat took place between 20.3 and 15.2 ka BP. However, ice-shelf break up caused by enhanced sub-ice shelf melt rates driven by RAW ingression, coupled with surface thinning instigated by atmospheric warming during Greenland Interstadial I, triggered rapid retreat of the ice stream after 15.2 ka BP. Our findings confirm the dominant role of oceanic forcing in grounding line stability and ice-shelf break up. Warm Atlantic Water was a major driver of both initial NEGIS retreat from 21.6 ka BP and the collapse of its ice shelf ~15.2 ka BP.

 The Target of Rapamycin kinase Complex I (TORC1) is a central hub in the cell growth and metabolic control network of eukaryotes. How its upstream regulators cooperate to tune signaling across environmental conditions remains unclear. Here, we combine phosphoproteomics, TORC1 activity assays, and targeted genetic perturbations to dissect TORC1 regulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae during transitions from a high-quality nitrogen source (glutamine) to a low-quality nitrogen source (proline), and on to complete nitrogen starvation. In proline medium, Ait1 and Gcn2 attenuate TORC1 activity, establishing a partially inhibited “Low Nitrogen Adaptive” state marked by extensive metabolic reprogramming without growth arrest. In contrast, during nitrogen starvation, SEAC, Ait1, and Gcn2 cooperate to drive TORC1 into a fully inhibited state, triggering widespread dephosphorylation of its downstream targets and entry into quiescence. Our results define a multilayered regulatory circuit that governs graded TORC1 control—a design likely conserved across eukaryotes.

 In contrast to conventional high-strength, high-modulus fibers, spider silk uniquely combines high toughness, strength and diverse functionalities, enabling spiders to thrive in natural environments. However, replicating the sophisticated architecture and properties of spider silk through synthetic approaches, particularly via scalable fiber manufacturing processes, remains a formidable challenge. Herein, we report the tailored fabrication of spider silk-like structures in sodium polyacrylate and polyacrylamide (PANa-PAM) composite polymer hydrogel fibers via wet-spinning. The antisolvent-induced phase separation process modulates composite polymer microphase, yielding nascent PANa-PAM fibers abundant in hydrogen-bonded nanoclusters. Subsequent post-drawing for strain programming facilitates uniaxial polymer alignment and controlled crystallization. The optimized fiber comprises aligned microfibrils, polymer-rich rigid nanoclusters surrounded by polymer-loose regions, and β-sheet-like crystallites, closely mimicking the hierarchical architecture of natural spider silk. As a result, the composite fiber achieves a comprehensive set of spider silk-like properties and functionalities, including a toughness of 118.7 MJ m-3, a tensile strength of 172.3 MPa, 50% elastic strain recovery, 96% damping efficiency, 60% supercontraction, and moisture sensitivity.

 Carnitine is essential for the import of long-chain fatty acids into mitochondria, where they are used for energy production. The carnitine transporter OCTN2 (novel organic cation transporter 2, SLC22A5) mediates carnitine uptake across the plasma membrane and as such facilitates fatty acid metabolism in most tissues. OCTN2 dysfunction causes systemic primary carnitine deficiency (SPCD), a potentially lethal disorder. Despite its importance in metabolism, the mechanism of high-affinity, sodium ion-dependent transport by OCTN2 is unclear. Here we report cryo-EM structures of human OCTN2 in three conformations: inward-facing ligand-free, occluded carnitine- and Na+-bound, and inward-facing ipratropium-bound. These structures define key interactions responsible for carnitine transport and identify an allosterically coupled Na+ binding site housed within an aqueous cavity, separate from the carnitine-binding site. Combined with electrophysiology data, we provide a framework for understanding variants associated with SPCD and insight into how OCTN2 functions as the primary human carnitine transporter.

 Glacial-interglacial sea-level fluctuations affect meridional overturning dynamics in the marginal South China Sea, although their influence on intermediate water exchange with the North Pacific remains unclear. Here, we reconstruct the evolution of South China Sea Intermediate Water since about 31,000 years ago using radiocarbon dating, grain size, redox-sensitive trace elements, and ichnological data from core S17 at 751 m depth. The results reveal more intense flows, better ventilation, and higher oxygenation during the glacial interval. These conditions stemmed from the closure of shallow seaways (Taiwan and Karimata, <50 m sills; Balabac, ~100 m sill) during lowered sea level, which impeded outflow and enhanced downwelling of the South China Sea Surface Water. Comparisons with North Pacific Intermediate Water proxies indicate warmer, saltier South China Sea Intermediate Water outflows modified mixed-North Pacific Intermediate Water during Heinrich Event 1 and the Younger Dryas, potentially weakening deep stratification and facilitating carbon dioxide outgassing.

This study combines multi-proxy records from the Northwest Borneo Trough over the past 30 kyr with transient climate simulations, reconstructing tropical western Pacific hydroclimate during Heinrich events and Bølling–Allerød warming. Results show contrasting responses: Heinrich events saw stronger winter monsoons bringing northern moisture for Borneo’s orographic rain, while Bølling–Allerød warming initiated central Pacific El Niño-like conditions tied to Northern Hemisphere ice-sheet retreat beyond a critical threshold and subsequently sustained by insolation minimum, combined with Southern Hemisphere forcing, leading to regional dryness/seasonal aridity.

 Climate change alters how strongly the atmosphere draws water from the land, yet a consistent global assessment of this evaporative demand has been lacking. Here, we analyze 45 years of climate data and global models to quantify trends in the key drivers—air temperature, humidity, radiation, wind speed, and cloud cover—that determine the atmosphere’s drying power. We find that evaporative demand has increased worldwide, indicating a stronger atmospheric thirst, except in South Asia, where it has declined. There, widespread irrigation has increased soil and air moisture, enhanced cloud formation, and reduced sunlight reaching the surface, counteracting the global signal.

 Chang’e-6 mission retrieved the first samples from the lunar farside South Pole–Aitken (SPA) basin. As the Moon’s largest and deepest impact basin, the SPA basin provides a unique window into the lunar interior, particularly its mantle. While spectral data indicate exposed deep-seated materials in this basin, their mantle origin remains contentious, and the basin’s deep structure is still poorly constrained. Here we combine Chang’e-6 impact-melt norites with thermodynamic modelling to reconstruct SPA impact melting and melt sheet differentiation. Our results reveal that the crystallization sequence observed in Chang’e-6 norites for the SPA melt sheet is most consistent with an orthopyroxene-dominated mantle source with 20–30% highland crustal contribution. We find that the massive SPA impact triggered lunar crust–mantle reorganization, forming a three-layer differentiated basin composed of 51% dunite, 5% orthopyroxenite, and 44% norite from the base upwards. The lower dunite and orthopyroxenite layers collectively constitute a nascent mantle superimposed on the primordial magma ocean mantle. Based on our findings and spectral data, we suggest that both mantle materials have been exposed across the SPA basin.

 Natural drylands often exhibit multistability—distinct ecosystem configurations sustained under similar climates by internal feedbacks. Here, we test whether such multistability persists in human-managed drylands and evaluate how water management stabilizes ecosystem states. Focusing on China’s pan-Hexi Corridor—a representative oasis–desert mosaic spanning a long history of water reallocation—we integrate multi-source datasets to quantify an ecosystem-quality index (EQI). Combining natural water resources with composite human-activity intensity, we use potential-landscape and resilience diagnostics to identify multistability and apply regression models to quantify drivers and generate projections. Potential-landscape analysis reveals two natural low-EQI states coexisting, while a high-EQI state emerges where water and human-activity intensity are sufficient. Overall, human activity raises EQI but reduces resilience. Sectorally, forestry and environmental water are positively associated with EQI, whereas aquaculture and domestic uses are negative. Under CMIP6 scenarios, projections indicate regional EQI declines over the next 50 years, with 0.69–0.91% of landscapes at risk of detrimental regime shifts; maintaining current quality would require increasing forestry water by 82–337% or environmental water by 83–341% across scenarios.

It is not known whether this landscape trap constitutes an alternative stable state, or whether a forest can return to its original state when disturbance levels are reduced. Here, we examine a likely landscape trap caused by the frequent burning of a 528 343 ha forest environment in Australia and previously shown to have a positive fire-flammability feedback. We ask whether the now flammable landscape can be returned to its original low-flammability state, or if the transition is irreversible in the warming climate. Using site-specific empirical models of biophysical and climatic influences on fire frequency, we predict fire frequency up to the year 2100 for three shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) in the context of different management approaches. A warming climate primarily increased wildfire area in our study area by increasing the frequency of synoptic changes, likely reflecting increased rates of escape from suppression firing efforts. Declining winter rainfall had the opposite effect, reducing wildfire area consistent with trends in other seasonally dry environments. The overall effect of warming was therefore a small but significant increase in wildfire area that was more severe under higher GHG emission scenarios. In contrast, removing prescribed burning and incentives for suppression firing had an effect size 2–5 times larger than did the increasing emissions scenarios, demonstrating that the landscape trap was reversible even under the worst-case emissions scenario (SSP3-7.0). Correcting fire management policies immediately reduced annual fire area by 87%, of which 77% was prescribed fire, and 43% of the remaining wildfire proportion was a by-product of the two policies. This allowed forests to escape their flammable age range, reversing a landscape trap. Our study is the first to demonstrate that such states are reversible."

In heavily polluted urban areas, where clusters are formed rapidly and in large numbers, cluster–cluster collisions also become relevant. We calculate cluster–cluster collision rates from atomistic molecular dynamics simulations and an interacting hard-sphere model. Not accounting for long-range attractive interactions underestimates collision and particle formation rates significantly. 
 Collisions of neutral molecules and clusters is the most prevalent pathway in atmospheric new particle formation (NPF), with direct implications for air quality and climate. Until recently, these collisions have been modeled mainly using non-interacting hard-sphere (NHS) models, which systematically underestimate collision and particle formation rates due to omission of long-range interactions. Lately, atomistic simulations which account for long-range interactions have been used to study neutral molecule–molecule and molecule–cluster collisions, but studies on cluster–cluster collisions have still been lacking despite the relevant role they can play, e.g., in haze formation in polluted urban areas. We have therefore studied collisions between neutral clusters of N bisulfate and N dimethylammonium ions at T=300 K up to N=32 using atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Direct simulation results have then been compared against both the traditional NHS model and the newly proposed interacting hard-sphere (IHS) variant. We find the collision rates given by the NHS to be enhanced by a factor of 2.18–5.61 in the atomistic MD simulations, with enhancement decreasing with cluster size, and an asymptotic limit ≈2. The IHS model yields a constant enhancement factor of 3.36 over the NHS model for collisions between same-sized clusters, which decreases with increasing cluster size ratio. Our results demonstrate how even collisions between clusters of tens of acid–base pairs at a relatively high temperature cannot be accurately modeled by neglecting long-range interactions. We also show that the MD results cannot be reproduced by simple point-particle models, highlighting the importance of atomistic details of intermolecular interactions."

Köhler;Axel Seifert;Linda Schlemmer,Predicting ice supersaturation for contrail avoidance: ensemble forecasting using ICON with two-moment ice microphysics,"Persistent condensation trails typically occur due to aircraft flying through certain cold and humid regions. In most cases, these contrails have a warming impact on the climate. Predicting these regions in advance allows flight planners to re-route airplanes. We show that an adaptation of the ice microphysics scheme in a certain weather forecast model improves the prediction of these regions. Running an ensemble of simulations with this scheme improves the prediction quality even further. 
 Persistent contrails and contrail-induced cirrus clouds are considered the most significant non-CO2 contributors to aviation's climate impact. These clouds primarily form in ice-supersaturated regions (ISSRs), defined by relative humidity over ice (RHice) exceeding 100 %. Reliable prediction of RHice in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere allows mitigating their formation by re-routing flights. We implemented a two-moment cloud ice microphysics parameterization within a ten-member Ensemble Prediction System (EPS) using the global ICON (ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic) model. RHice predictions were evaluated against radiosonde and aircraft observations from the Northern Hemisphere during 2024–2025. Treating ISSR prediction (RHice > 100 %) as a binary classification problem, we find that the probability of detection (POD) of ISSRs increases to 0.6 for the two-moment scheme (ICON 2-Mom), compared to 0.4 for the operational ICON with a one-moment ice microphysics scheme, while maintaining a low false positive rate (FPR < 0.1). Further evaluation of the ICON 2-Mom EPS using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) analysis shows a POD of 0.8 for a decision model that requires at least three ensemble members to predict ISSR, with an FPR of 0.13. Additionally, we incorporate ensemble spread information to develop a meta-model that further reduces the FPR. Since June 2024, more than 100 flights have been rerouted based on ICON 2-Mom EPS predictions in a contrail avoidance trial, demonstrating the practical value of improved ISSR forecasts for climate-conscious aviation. This study highlights the significant potential of ensemble-based modeling for predicting ISSRs and RHice, supporting environmentally optimized flight planning and advancing applications in weather and climate science."

The new maps showed improved accuracy in reflecting local economies, revealing that sectoral GDP distribution differs by country and affects disaster impact estimates. 
 Global risk assessments of economic losses by natural disasters while considering various land uses is essential. However, sector-specific, high-resolution pixel-level economic data are not yet available globally to assess exposure to local disasters such as floods. In this study, we employed new land-use data to construct a global, spatially distributed map of sector-specific gross domestic product (GDP). We developed three global GDP maps, SectGDP30, in 2010, 2015, and 2020 for the service, industry, and agriculture sector with 30 arcsec resolution. The map (SectGDP30) demonstrates strong consistency (R2 > 0.9) with actual sub-national statistical data, exhibiting superior alignment compared to conventional GDP maps (PB-method) reliant solely on gridded population information. The methodology refined GDP distribution for specific sectors. Industry GDP was more accurately mapped using non-residential land areas as a proxy, effectively capturing its localized concentrations. Agriculture GDP's accuracy improved by incorporating cropland data and a distance-based distribution assumption from population agglomeration. Application of this dataset in estimating flood-induced business interruption (BI) losses confirmed the map's capacity to represent inter-sectoral differences in estimated losses, reflecting varied hazard spatial distributions. This underscores the importance of considering sector-specific spatial patterns for accurate disaster damage assessment. These maps serve as a foundational tool for estimating detailed, sector-classified economic losses, enabling precise calculation of sector-specific impacts from diverse natural disasters worldwide. These global sectoral GDP maps (SectGDP30) are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15774017 (Shoji et al., 2025)."

 We introduce GlobalBuildingAtlas, a publicly available dataset providing global and complete coverage of building polygons, heights and Level of Detail 1 (LoD1) 3D building models. This is the first open dataset to offer high quality, consistent, and complete building data in 2D and 3D form at the individual building level on a global scale. Towards this dataset, we developed machine learning-based pipelines to derive building polygons and heights (called GBA.Height) from global PlanetScope satellite data, respectively. Also a quality-based fusion strategy was employed to generate higher-quality polygons (called GBA.Polygon) based on existing open building polygons, including our own derived one. With more than 2.75 billion buildings worldwide, GBA.Polygon surpasses the most comprehensive database to date by more than 1 billion buildings. GBA.Height offers the most detailed and accurate global 3D building height maps to date, achieving a spatial resolution of 3 m × 3 m – 30 times finer than previous global products (90 m), enabling a high-resolution and reliable analysis of building volumes at both local and global scales. Finally, we generated a global LoD1 building model (called GBA.LoD1) from the resulting GBA.Polygon and GBA.Height. GBA.LoD1 represents the first complete global LoD1 building models, including 2.68 billion building instances with predicted heights, i.e., with a height completeness of more than 97 %, achieving RMSEs ranging from 1.5 to 8.9 m across different continents. With its height accuracy, comprehensive global coverage and rich spatial details, GlobalBuildingAtlas offers novel insights on the status quo of global buildings, which unlocks unprecedented geospatial analysis possibilities, as showcased by a better illustration of where people live and a more comprehensive monitoring of the progress on the 11th Sustainable Development Goal of the United Nations.

We combine millions of ship and float measurements with advanced computer methods to create GEOXYGEN, a new monthly map of global ocean dissolved oxygen from 1960 to 2024. It shows where and how fast oxygen is changing, highlights blind spots near coasts and in deep water, and offers a solid basis to test and improve climate and ecosystem models. 
 Dissolved oxygen (DO) serves as an essential indicator of marine ecosystem health. However, sparse and uneven observations have limited our ability to characterize its full spatiotemporal variability, underscoring the continued need for long-term, high-resolution, and physically consistent global DO datasets. Here, we present GEOXYGEN, a global dataset of monthly DO fields at 0.5° × 0.5° resolution spanning 1960–2024 and depths from the surface to 5500 m (Wang et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17615657). GEOXYGEN is generated with a hierarchical modeling framework that accounts for regional and vertical heterogeneity. By integrating physical and biogeochemical predictors with an adaptive feature-selection strategy, GEOXYGEN achieves high predictive accuracy across all depth layers on an independent out-of-time test (R² > 0.92). The reconstructed spatial patterns align closely with the World Ocean Atlas 2023 climatology, and in subsurface and deep waters, GEOXYGEN demonstrates superior generalization relative to existing data-driven products. A sensitivity analysis further reveals that including coastal data in model training increases basin-wide uncertainty by approximately 7.5 %, underscoring that current observing systems remain insufficient to reliably resolve nearshore DO dynamics.

HyLake simulates lake surface temperature and the latent and sensible heat fluxes in Lake Taihu more accurately than traditional process-based models and other hybrid experiments across different forcing datasets. The proposed coupling strategy provides a reliable tool for quantifying the impacts of climate change on aquatic ecosystems. 
 Lake-atmosphere interactions play a critical role in Earth systems dynamics. However, accurately modelling key indicators of these interactions remains challenging due to their oversimplified physics in traditional process-based models or the limited interpretability of purely data-driven approaches. Hybrid models, which integrate physical principles with sparse observations, offer a promising path forward.This study introduces the Hybrid Lake Model v1.0 (HyLake v1.0), a novel framework that combines physics-based surface energy balance equations with a Bayesian Optimized Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory-based (BO-BLSTM-based) surrogate to approximate lake surface temperature (LST) dynamics. The model was trained using data from the Meiliangwan (MLW) site in Lake Taihu. We evaluate HyLake v1.0 against the Freshwater Lake (FLake) model and other hybrid benchmarks (Baseline and TaihuScene) across multiple sites in Lake Taihu using both eddy flux covariance observations and ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data.Results show that HyLake v1.0 outperformed all comparative models at the MLW site and demonstrated strong capability in simulating lake-atmosphere interactions. In experiments assessing generalization and transferability in ungauged lake sites, HyLake v1.0 consistently exhibited superior performance over FLake and TaihuScene across all Lake Taihu sites using both observation- and ERA5-based forcing. It also maintained excellent skill when applied to the ungauged Chaohu, confirming its robustness even with unlearned forcing datasets. This study underscores the potential of hybrid modeling to advance the representation land-atmosphere interaction in Earth system models."

As Mercury's largest mascon basin, identifying Caloris' configuration prior to volcanic infilling is a key step in determining the series of events that led to its current state. Here, we simulate the postimpact evolution of Caloris basin to explore the influence of cooling and isostatic adjustment on its configuration before volcanic plains emplacement. We find that the large volume of buoyant impact‐heated material uplifts the basin floor before cooling, explaining some of Caloris' long‐wavelength topographic variations. Subsequent thermal contraction and lithospheric thickening create a positive mass anomaly at Caloris' center before its volcanic infilling. This evolution shows a new mode of mascon formation—perhaps unique to Mercury where high impact velocities generate large volumes of impacted‐heated material—and provides a new interpretation of Caloris' geologic history."

Convection‐permitting models (CPMs) are increasingly used in climate studies, as they better represent many precipitation processes than non‐CPMs. We found significant differences in precipitation moisture sources over the Amazon Basin using 1‐year CPM and non‐CPM WRF simulations with moisture tracers. Notably, the CPM estimates that about half of precipitation in the central Andes comes from the Amazon basin; a 20%–30% higher estimate than the non‐CPM. This suggests long‐term CPMs with tracers could improve climatological estimates. However, their high computational cost is prohibitive. To overcome this, we developed a revised 2L‐DRM model that replicates CPM‐with‐tracers estimates at a fraction of the cost, using only standard outputs. We applied this model to South America, analyzing precipitation moisture sources across 15 regions. 2L‐DRM can be used for other regions as continental‐scale CPM climatological simulations become available."

Here we report its clear identification in a shale‐gas well core and explore its potential as a proxy for diagenesis or low‐grade metamorphism of organic‐rich sediments. A range of complementary results including petrography, geochemistry, rock magnetism and paleomagnetism, collectively support the identification of framboidal pyrrhotite, whose coexistence with other framboidal minerals indicates pseudomorphic replacement of framboidal pyrite. A strong correlation between total organic carbon and natural remanent magnetization, together with its restriction to organic‐rich layers, highlights organic matter's role in its genesis. Paleomagnetic and vitrinite reflectance data further link its formation to magmatic heating (∼274°C). We therefore propose hydrothermal replacement of framboidal pyrite by framboidal pyrrhotite, involving heating and organic matter.

Column‐scale tracer tests using sodium chloride and resazurin, coupled with subsurface transport modeling, quantified respiration rates over 77 days. At 20°C, pronounced bioclogging caused flow instability, fragmenting the resazurin plume into finger‐like channels and increasing its metabolic rate 12.7‐fold by day 29. Paradoxically, elevated temperatures reduced bioclogging, constrained microbial metabolism, and altered reaction‐transport dynamics. Instead of maintaining a fixed state, Damköhler numbers (Da) shifted dynamically, transitioning from reaction‐limited (Da < 1) to transport‐limited (Da > 1) conditions during biofilm development, with these shifts dampened at higher temperatures.

This pressure reduction weakens magnetic tension, resulting in a more dipolar magnetic field configuration that, in turn, suppresses further FLC scattering. This self‐regulating feedback loop prevents excessive FLC scattering and mitigates the overestimation of ring current decay often found in models using empirical magnetic fields.

However, emerging evidence suggests a direct link between antecedent heat conditions and subsequent precipitation extremes. As part of a typical extreme rainfall process, the high temperatures on July 26–27, 2023, drove the intensity and distribution of subsequent rainfall in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei region from July 29 to August 1.

However, as AMOC‐MV weakens under global warming, it remains unclear whether this linkage persists. Here, we use the Community Earth System Model version 1 Large Ensemble to demonstrate that the connection remains robust under global warming. We highlight that the TNA subsurface response and its changes are primarily confined to the western boundary, regulated by variations in the AMOC‐MV‐related North Brazil Current. In the TNA western boundary, a subsurface temperature dome, which dominates the subsurface thermal response by strengthening meridional heat transport, shifts southward due to changes in mean‐state AMOC and local winds.

This change was driven by decreasing LMI of local TCs and increasing LMI of migratory TCs from the western North Pacific. Attribution analysis showed that a westward shift in local TC genesis increased land constraints, suppressed TC development, and weakened LMI. In contrast, the poleward migration of TC tracks facilitated the increased entry of storms into the SCS through the Luzon Strait with minimal land interaction, thereby enhancing the LMI of migratory TCs. Additionally, favorable environmental conditions increase the frequency of rapid intensification events, further boosting LMI.

VHF Stratosphere‐Troposphere radars, however, provide methods to measure vertical air velocities (W) $W)$ in the tropo‐stratosphere. From Middle and Upper (MU) atmosphere radar data spanning 38 years (1987–2024), we found that the well‐known reversal in mean W $W$ profiles at the height of the jet stream maximum, with negative W $W$ below 12 km and positive W $W$ above occurs almost every month, not just in winter as previously reported. We developed a refined model, complementary to the ad‐hoc model by Muschinski (1996), https://doi.org/10.1175/1520‐0450(1996)035%3C2210:PEOKHI%3E2.0.CO;2, which accounts for power imbalance between symmetric oblique beams. This model confirms that the monthly mean W $W$ profiles above ∼4.0 km are primarily influenced by contamination from a slight tilt in the scatter diagram, induced by horizontal wind shear. Additionally, our analysis of 30 years of ERA5 reanalysis data indicates that adiabatic ascent/descent along potential temperature surfaces can also cause a W $W$ reversal in winter, consistent with earlier studies. However, the climatological mean vertical velocities are much weaker than those observed by the MU radar, suggesting that wind shear‐induced layer tilt dominates the long‐term effect."

This life‐sustaining feature, however, is increasingly vulnerable to disruption from rapid urbanization and climate change. To investigate the individual and combined impacts of these two drivers on fog dynamics, we employed a high‐resolution weather model and a full factorial design, excluding the effect of aerosols. Our results reveal that urbanization shifts the fog belt upward, reducing fog occurrence in lowlands while enhancing it at mid‐elevations. In contrast, warming‐induced circulation changes reduce fog in the west of the Central Mountain Range (CMR) but promote fog formation in the east. The complex interplay among local terrain, urbanization, and climate warming resulted in asymmetric changes in mountain fog, which can worsen the water stress differential between the western and eastern flanks of the CMR in Taiwan."

However, the underlying mechanism of the evolutions of spatiotemporally contiguous summer HWs remains unclear hindering the forecasting of HWs. Therefore, a 3D perspective of HWs was introduced in the present work (i.e., latitude × longitude × time), which can track the horizontal evolution of HWs continuously. Here, our work objectively followed the 3D evolutions of regional summer HWs in China during 1979–2022, and investigated their characteristics, including intensity, duration, and affected area. Among them, the dynamic evolutions of 29 HWs are influenced by compound typhoons and high‐pressure systems. Specifically, the high‐pressure system affects the triggering and maintenance of regional HWs by enhancing the surface heating and subsidence warming, whereas typhoon tracks can modulate the retreat of regional HWs. Westward‐moving typhoons that are influenced by easterly airflows on the southern edge of strong inland high‐pressure systems can force the high‐pressure system to slowly retreat eastward. This interaction results in a long duration and a large affected area of regional HWs. In contrast, northeastward‐moving typhoons quickly cut the weak inland high‐pressure system, and then the fragmented high‐pressure systems in turn promote the northeastward movement of typhoons, leading to the low intensity, short duration, and small affected area of the regional HWs. These findings systematically reveal the interactions between inland high‐pressure systems and typhoon tracks and provide new insights for improving the warning and forecasting skills for the 3D evolution of spatiotemporally contiguous HWs."

 HIV cure is exceptionally rare, documented in only six cases among the estimated 88 million individuals who have acquired HIV since the epidemic's onset1–6. Successful cures, including the pioneering Berlin patient, are limited to individuals receiving allogeneic stem cell transplants (allo-SCT) for hematological cancers. HIV resistance from stem cell donors with the rare homozygous CCR5 Δ32 mutation was long considered the main mechanism for HIV remission without antiretroviral therapy (ART), but recent reports highlight CCR5-independent mechanisms as important contributors to HIV cure6–8. Here, we provide new evidence for this conceptual shift, reporting exceptionally long, treatment-free HIV remission following allo-SCT with functionally active CCR5. A heterozygous CCR5 wild-type/Δ32 male living with HIV received allo-SCT from an HLA-matched unrelated heterozygous CCR5 wild-type/Δ32 donor as treatment for acute myeloid leukemia. Three years after allo-SCT, the patient discontinued ART. To date, HIV remission has been sustained for over six years with undetectable plasma HIV RNA. Reservoir analysis revealed intact proviral HIV before transplantation, but no replication-competent virus in blood or intestinal tissues after allo-SCT. Declining or absent HIV-specific antibody and T cell responses support the absence of viral activity. High antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity at the time of transplantation may have contributed to HIV reservoir clearance. These results demonstrate that CCR5Δ32-mediated HIV resistance is not essential for durable remission, underscoring the importance of effective viral reservoir reductions in HIV cure strategies."

 The identification of therapeutic strategies to induce sustained antiretroviral therapy (ART)-free control of HIV infection is a major priority.1 Combination immunotherapy including HIV vaccination, immune stimulation/latency reversal, and passive transfer of broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) has shown promise in non-human primate models,2–6 but few studies have translated such approaches into people. We performed a single-arm, proof-of-concept study in ten people with HIV on ART combining the following three approaches: (1) therapeutic vaccination with an HIV/Gag conserved element (CE)-targeted DNA+IL-12 prime/MVA boost regimen followed by (2) administration of two bNAbs (10-1074, VRC07-523LS) and a toll-like receptor 9 agonist (lefitolimod) during ART suppression, followed by (3) repeat bNAb administration at the time of ART interruption (NCT04357821). Seven of the ten participants exhibited post-intervention control after stopping ART, independent of residual bNAb plasma levels. Robust expansion of activated CD8+ T cells early in response to rebounding virus correlated with lower median viral load following peak viremia off ART. These data suggest that combination immunotherapy approaches might prove effective to induce sustained control of HIV by slowing rebound and improving CD8+ T cell responses, and that these approaches should continue to be optimized."

 Past atmospheric CO2 fluctuations are thought to be intricately tied to ocean circulation changes involving Southern Ocean and North Atlantic dynamics. The ocean’s capability to store carbon has been linked to the expansion and contraction of southern-sourced waters, but their provenance and structure remain poorly characterized in the past. Here we present neodymium isotope data from the Weddell–Enderby Basin, placing constraints on the spatiotemporal distribution of Antarctic Bottom Water in the Atlantic and Indian sectors of the Southern Ocean over the past 32,000 years. Our data reveal that glacial Antarctic Bottom Water was substantially contracted, with large volumes of the deep Southern Ocean occupied by carbon-rich Circumpolar Deep Waters sourced from the Pacific Ocean, conducive for lowering atmospheric CO2. During the last deglaciation, Antarctic Bottom Water expanded in two steps coinciding with Antarctic warming. This expansion drove Southern Ocean destratification, which possibly contributed to contemporaneous atmospheric CO2 rises. Different from the view that the North Atlantic processes dominated deglacial deep South Atlantic water-mass changes, our results indicate only limited influence from northern-sourced waters. Instead, Antarctic Bottom Water dynamics played a critical role in regulating deep ocean circulation and thereby carbon exchange between the deep Southern Ocean and the atmosphere.

Here, authors report a universal synthesis approach for layered transition-metal oxides by updating the conventional solid-state reaction with only dicyandiamide introduced. 
 Manganese-rich layered transition-metal oxides are of great interests as positive electrodes for sodium-ion batteries considering their high specific capacity and operating voltage. However, it remains challenging to synthesize layered transition-metal oxides with high stability and rapid ion-migration kinetics. Herein, we develop a straightforward and universal synthesis approach for P2-type layered transition-metal oxides by simply updating the conventional solid-state reaction with only additional dicyandiamide introduced. We reveal the ammonia released successfully restrains the irreversible oxygen redox for stabilizing cationic migration and decreases the crystallization temperature for high-quality structure formation. The effectively suppressed Jahn-Teller distortion and facilitated Na+ transport kinetics therefore endow Na1/2MnO2 with overall performance enhancement, including a 6.7-fold improvement in rate capability and enhanced cycling stability. Similar performance enhancements are also found in other manganese-based layered transition-metal oxides, presenting great strategy universality.

Here, the authors introduce metal chelates for a uniformly distributed tensile strain field, achieving a maximum efficiency of 24.47%. 
 Flexible perovskite solar cells show promise in photovoltaics due to their high energy-to-power efficiency and adaptability, making them a top choice for third-generation thin-film solar applications. However, the inherent defect and mechanical fragility of polycrystalline films posed a challenge that limited their photovoltaic and mechanical performance. Here, the nanomechanical properties of perovskite films are regulated to varying degrees by introducing metal chelates. Specifically, the metal chelates are embedded into the grain boundaries of perovskite, thereby creating a uniformly distributed tensile strain field. Through nanomechanical investigations of the tensile strain-induced modifications in the microstructure and photovoltaic performance of perovskite films, the flexible perovskite solar cells achieve a power conversion efficiency of 24.47%. This regulation strategy not only focuses on the nanomechanical properties of perovskite films but also reveals the correlation between the physical properties and the mechanical flexibility of perovskite solar cells.

 Reversible metal electrodeposition-based electrochromic devices (RMEDs) with broadband regulation manifest great promises as smart windows to increase building energy efficiency. However, manufacturing durable and scalable RMEDs at an agreeable cost is still challenged by the limited reversibility of interfacial plating (tinting)/stripping (bleaching). Here, we report a quasi-solid-state hydrogel electrolyte with well-tuned Cu:Zn ratio and pH values to achieve highly reversible CuZn-RMEDs. The dual-metal CuZn electrolyte ensures staged nucleation and homogeneous CuZn growth, and the appropriate pH guarantees effective stripping of CuZn metal layers, thus attaining reduced metal deposition activation energy (6.7 kJ mol-1), increased coloration efficiency, large transmittance modulation (ΔT = 78% @550 nm), and excellent reversibility (ΔT retention over 90% after 3000 cycles). In addition, the quasi-solid-state hydrogel matrix with abundant molecular chains can inhibit strong hydrogen bonds in aqueous electrolyte, achieving anti-freezing (−20°C) and leakage-free CuZn-RMEDs with fast switching kinetics (coloration time tc = 15.0 s, bleaching time tb = 24.0 s), extended memory effect, efficient thermal insulation, and effective reusability (2000 cycles) of both the transparent conductor and hydrogel electrolyte. The as-assembled CuZn-RMEDs manifest 18% to 33% energy saving across different climatic regions. This quasi-solid-state CuZn-RMED is a successful embodiment of cost-effective and durable electrochromic smart windows towards increasing buildings’ energy efficiency.

TMEM145 is expressed in both OHCs and spiral ganglion neurons, with specific localization to TM-ACs and HTCs in OHCs. Tmem145 knockout (KO) mice exhibit profound hearing impairment at 3 weeks of age, with complete loss of distortion product otoacoustic emissions, indicating OHC dysfunction. Immunostaining and scanning electron microscopy reveal the absence of TM-ACs and HTCs in Tmem145 KO mice. In heterologous cell systems, TMEM145 interacts with stereocilin and tubby, facilitating their extracellular secretion. TMEM145 is undetectable in Stereocilin KO and tubby mutant mice, indicating interdependence among these proteins. These findings establish TMEM145 as an essential membrane protein for the structural integrity of OHC stereocilia, providing insights into the molecular architecture of cochlear hair cells and their role in auditory function. The authors identify TMEM145 as a critical protein in cochlear outer hair cells, responsible for linking their stereocilia. Mice lacking TMEM145 develop severe hearing loss at an early age, providing new insights into hearing loss mechanisms."

Here, authors reveal the structural basis of PGE2 recognition and transport by PGT transporter. 
 Prostaglandins (PGs) are bioactive lipids that regulate inflammation, reproduction, and vasopermeability. Timely clearance of excessive PGs is critical to prevent potential damages caused by prolonged signalling. The high-affinity prostaglandin transporter (PGT) plays an essential role in this termination process by efficiently re-uptaking PGs into cells. Here, we report human PGT structures in different oligomerization and substrate-binding states. Beyond the canonical MFS-fold, PGT harbours a cystine-rich extracellular segment that incorporates a Kazal-like domain crucial for PGT localization and activity. Two distinct PGE2-bound structures revealed essential elements for substrate recognition, elucidating a PGE2-flipping process during the multi-stop translocation cycle. Notably, our data suggest that PGT may dimerize in detergent micelles and lipid nanodiscs. This dimerization would likely increase the mobility of the extracellular region and induces a profound rotation of the C-domain transmembrane helices, an interesting observation for MFS transporters. These functionally distinct snapshots thus shed light on prostaglandin clearance and reveal intriguing features of MFS transporters. PGT-mediated timely clearance of excessive prostaglandins is essential for health. Here, authors reveal the structural basis of PGE2 recognition and transport by PGT transporter."

This suggests that prediction accuracy alone does not necessarily translate into real-world clinical impact. 
 Emergency department (ED) crowding necessitates rapid, accurate risk stratification to optimize care and resource allocation. Traditional clinical prediction tools like NEWS, APACHE II, and SOFA score have limited generalizability or rely on extensive inputs, including vitals. We developed RISKINDEX, a machine-learning tool predicting 31-day mortality using routine laboratory values, age, and sex. To evaluate the clinical impact of a machine learning–based risk score in routine care, we conducted an investigator-initiated, open-label, randomized, non-inferiority trial (MARS-ED) at the Maastricht University Medical Center+ ED. Adult patients ( ≥ 18 years) assessed by an internal medicine specialist and with ≥4 laboratory tests were eligible. Patients were randomized 1:1 using computer-generated permuted blocks to standard care (n = 659) or standard care plus access to the RISKINDEX (n = 644). No blinding was possible because physicians needed to view the RISKINDEX. The primary outcomes for this study were the prognostic accuracy for 31-day mortality and clinical impact of the RISKINDEX. In total, 1303 participants were analyzed. RISKINDEX’s prognostic accuracy matched or outperformed clinical intuition (AUROC 0.84 vs. 0.73–0.76) and was statistically higher than NEWS, APACHE II, and SOFA prediction tools (AUROC 0.65–0.75). RISKINDEX predictions aligned with clinicians’ expectations in only about half of cases, with highest discordance among less experienced physicians. Despite its prognostic accuracy, the RISKINDEX did not alter treatment plans (1/644 changes; 0.16%) or clinical outcomes, and clinicians perceived low added value. No adverse events related to the intervention occurred, and recruitment was completed as planned. These findings show that prognostic accuracy alone is insufficient to achieve clinical impact in the ED and that user-centered, actionable model design is needed to ensure relevance, trust, and responsiveness.

Here, the authors propose a superconducting mechanism based on over-screening of Coulomb interaction due to charge fluctuations. 
 A microscopic mechanism for chiral p-wave superconductivity from Coulomb repulsion is proposed for spin- and valley-polarized state of rhombohedral multilayer graphene. The superconducting instability arises when strong Thomas-Fermi screening of the Coulomb potential allows Friedel oscillations to take over – leading to an effective attraction on length scales below the Fermi wavelength. The superconducting critical temperature is largest at low density below a Lifshitz transition to an annular Fermi sea, where the additional pocket strongly enhances Thomas-Fermi screening. The Lifshitz transition also marks a topological phase transition from a trivial to a topological superconducting phase hosting Majorana fermions. The chirality of the superconducting order parameter is selected by the chirality of the valley-polarized Bloch electrons. Our results are in reasonable agreement with observations in a recent experiment on tetralayer graphene.

 Arctic amplification weakens the meridional temperature gradient (∂T/∂y), reducing the Northern Hemisphere winter daily temperature variability (Tstd). However, the extent to which Tstd recovers following CO₂ removal remains uncertain. We investigate the hysteresis and reversibility of Tstd under various CO₂ pathways using UKESM1-0-LL. The mid-latitude Tstd reduced during the ramp-up phase partially recovers following CO₂ removal, but its magnitude depends on the region and peak CO₂ concentration. In the low-concentration experiments, Tstd nearly returns to pre-industrial levels, whereas the high-concentration experiments show hysteresis and irreversibility in eastern Canada and northwestern Eurasia. These regional differences are primarily driven by changes in local temperature gradients. Specifically, the dominant factor for eastern Canada is the meridional temperature gradient, whereas for northwestern Eurasia, it is the zonal temperature gradient related to the land-sea thermal contrast. These results suggest that the response of Tstd to CO2 removal differs depending on the region and the peak concentration."

 Cryoconite holes, small water-filled cylindrical pits on glacier surfaces, are crucial microbial habitats and play a pivotal role in darkening the Greenland Ice Sheet, potentially accelerating ice melt. To understand how their morphology influences microbial ecosystems and biogeochemical functions, we investigated cryoconite hole dimensions, microbial communities, and cryoconite characteristics across Issunguata Sermia (Glacier), southwest Greenland. Our findings reveal distinct morphological gradients: cryoconite holes were shallower in the rough crevasse zone near the glacier margin and significantly deeper in the flat ice zone at the glacier’s midline. These morphological differences were strongly linked to disparities in phototrophic community composition and relative abundance, including filamentous cyanobacteria and glacier algae, between the deeper and shallower holes. Furthermore, cryoconite from deeper holes exhibited significantly higher organic content and enriched carbon stable isotope signatures, suggesting enhanced in-situ microbial productivity, despite consistent meltwater geochemistry and mineral compositions across all sites. Our results unequivocally demonstrate that glacier surface topography primarily drives cryoconite hole development, critically shaping localized microbial communities, carbon cycling, and albedo feedbacks. This study highlights the complex physical-biological interplay in glaciers, offering crucial insights into ice sheet melt and carbon dynamics in a changing polar region.

For the first time, these localization targets are modeled nationwide with consistent methodology across 378 metropolitan areas, considering three different land reutilization scenarios: (1) shifting current commodity cropland to vegetables, (2) leveraging marginal urban land, and (3) a novel strategy of repurposing parking lots and roads, anticipating the future deployment of shared autonomous vehicle fleets. These scenarios, implemented nationwide, diffusing current, concentrated vegetable production, are evaluated in the context of land availability constraints and two critical environmental burdens: groundwater overdraft and fertilizer-related PM2.5 emissions. Broadly across the conterminous US metros, scenarios find few significant land constraints and reveal net environmental benefits to both groundwater overdraft and fertilizer-related PM2.5 emissions in 11%–55% of metros (scenario-dependent). The model also reveals where relocalization of vegetable farming would exacerbate existing environmental vulnerabilities.

This makes it unclear in which countries the net effect will lead to a worsening or easing of these potential impacts as the climate and economies change. We define a Cooling Deficit Index as the product of cooling degree days and the fraction of the population without air conditioning to indicate the extent to which high temperatures are experienced without access to cooling. We used this index to investigate the relationship between global warming, economic growth, and the fraction of population exposed to high temperatures without the benefits of air conditioning. We find that populations in lower-income countries tend to experience the greatest number of high-temperature days without access to cooling and are likely to face the largest increases in such days as global temperatures rise. These countries would require GDP growth rates that exceed historical rates to avoid increasing numbers of days with high temperatures experienced without air conditioning.

Our approach leverages a unique and comprehensive dataset that integrates survey based GHG audits from 482 farms across the United Kingdom (UK) with financial transaction data, obtained through a collaboration with a major high-street bank and a leading UK charity promoting sustainable agriculture. By combining granular farm-level emissions metrics with financial records, we demonstrate that a limited set of input variables focused on the highest impact areas—particularly dairy and beef cattle intensities—yield robust predictions that can explain up to 91% of the variation in farm-level emissions. Although this model does not replace the depth and specificity of established carbon calculators, it provides a pragmatic, scalable alternative for emissions reporting.

Large-scale assessments of soil organic carbon development in arable land are affected by the scarcity of reliable time series of soil organic carbon monitoring data and often fail to replicate observed trends or appreciate any effects induced by changes in soil management. This study quantifies C loss from contemporary soil management on specialist crop farms in the EU and the potential societal benefits from C sequestration and avoided C loss due to improved management. Our analysis is based on an evidence pool of 214 independent long-term time series of soil organic carbon measurements spanning a wide range of climatic conditions and soil types, and considers the implementation of reduced tillage, organic amendments, soil cover during winter, and crop rotations. Overall, we estimate the potential for C sequestration from improved soil management on specialist crop farms, representing 40% of all the arable land in the EU, to be 48 ( 15) million tonnes CO2 equivalents yearly, which corresponds to 17% ( 8) of the target for additional carbon removals in the soil and forest sinks under the Fit for 55 package. In addition, our results show high spatial variability in C losses due to current soil management practices and potential C sequestration from improvements. The annual climate-change mitigation value per unit of land with improved management shows a four-fold variation across countries, with Finland exhibiting the highest value and Cyprus the lowest. This demonstrates that a C payment eco-scheme should be adjusted spatially to achieve cost-effective soil organic carbon sequestration in arable soils in the EU."

Through a integration of satellite data and in-situ bio-optical measurements, we reveal a counterintuitive ecological response to TC ‘Chaba’ in 2022 that challenges conventional understanding. While satellite-detected Chla concentrations increased and phytoplankton division rates accelerated following TC passage, we surprisingly documented simultaneous declines in phytoplankton biomass and carbon-to-chlorophyll (C:Chl) ratios. Our analysis demonstrates that physiological regulation, rather than biomass accumulation, dominated high-Chla zones during and after TC disturbance, with C:Chl anomalies contributing over 60% to elevated Chla areas. This research presents a paradigm-shifting scenario: phytoplankton biomass began accumulating initiated pre-TC, yet increased loss rates during/after TC actually reduced phytoplankton biomass despite enhanced division rates. The fundamental decoupling between TC-induced Chla enhancement and phytoplankton biomass dynamics we document has profound implications for oceanic carbon cycling models and climate predictions, necessitating a recalibration of how we interpret satellite Chla signals in storm-affected marine ecosystems."

Over the past five decades, flood inundation models have emerged as essential tools for flood forecasting and risk management. Through an analysis of publications from 1970 to 2023, this review provides a foundational understanding of state-of-the-science flood model developments. The evolution of flood models in recent decades has been marked by significant technological advances, including enhancing traditional numerical modeling approaches and deploying them with widespread use of large-scale simulation and satellite remote sensing. The field has matured substantially over the past 50 years, and it seems to have reached an inflection point at which major research is poised to progress. The most ambitious research directions are those that involve coupling flood models with models in diverse fields and involve: (1) atmospheric sciences to construct a two-way coupled flood-land surface-atmosphere model, (2) epidemiology to assess the health impacts of floods, (3) economics to help develop a flood model damage footprint framework to quantify financial harm to those who occupy urban and agricultural land, (4) ecology to evaluate and quantify flood-induced ecological damage, (5) further development of groundwater flooding, glacial lake outburst flooding, sedimentation-induced flooding, plus investigation of the joint impact of multiple compounding flood types, (6) responsible advancement of AI-based flood models, (7) greater assimilation of multiple data sources that include high resolution satellite and drone imagery, crowdsourcing, and video data.

However, there is currently a lack of large-scale and detailed quantitative assessments for building losses caused by sea-level rise. This study takes 14 coastal provinces (autonomous regions, municipalities, and special administrative regions) in China as the research area. By integrating extreme sea level data, a digital elevation model, and building data, and by utilizing Python scripts and ArcGIS Pro software, this research quantitatively assesses the spatial distribution characteristics of land inundation and building loss under the combined effects of storm surges and tides, aiming to advance the quantitative study of building inundation exposure in coastal areas. The study finds that under sea-level rise resulting from a 100 year return period of extreme climate, the total potentially inundated area in China’s coastal provinces reaches 49 366.22 km2. Among these areas, buildings in 93 cities face varying degrees of inundation exposure. The losses are primarily concentrated in economically developed regions such as Jiangsu and Guangdong. In some areas, the potential density of inundated buildings exceeds 200 buildings/km2, which, coupled with high housing prices and dense construction, leads to extremely severe economic losses.

Yet, concerns persist that SAI may substantially reduce Asian monsoon (ASM) rainfall, a vital water resource for nearly half of the global population. Using idealized simulations from six climate models participating in the Geoengineering Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (GeoMIP6), we show that both greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation and equatorial SAI lead to an overall reduction in ASM rainfall, primarily through thermodynamic effects associated with decreased atmospheric moisture as GMST cools. Importantly, equatorial SAI produces no extra drying over the ASM region compared with GHG mitigation for the same magnitude of GMST cooling. Relative to a baseline with comparable GMST, all six models show no substantial drying over the ASM region beyond internal variability. A major part of the inter-model spread arises from differences of the changes in meridional insolation gradient, which may depend on the spatial distribution of aerosols. Smaller (larger) insolation reductions over the ASM region relative to the equator favor enhanced (suppressed) ascent air motion and rainfall over the ASM region, a relationship confirmed by single-model simulations with aerosol injections at varying latitudes. These results suggest that well-designed SAI deployment strategies could minimize risk of monsoon failure."

A big set of advanced remote-sensing techniques and retrieval algorithms are applied, so that a detailed view on the seeder-feeder cloud system is available. The gained knowledge can be used to improve weather models and weather forecasts. 
 A comprehensive approach to study the seeder-feeder mechanism in unprecedented detail from a combined remote-sensing, in situ, and model perspective is shown. This publication aims at investigating the role of the interplay of a seeder-feeder cloud system and its influence on precipitation formation based on a case study from 8 January 2024 observed over the Swiss Plateau in Switzerland.This case study offers an ideal setup for applying several advanced remote-sensing techniques and retrieval algorithms, including fall streak tracking, radar Doppler peak separation, dual-wavelength radar applications, a liquid detection retrieval, a riming retrieval, and an ice crystals shape retrieval. Results indicate that a large portion of ice mass was rimed, which is attributed to persistent coexistence of falling ice crystals and supercooled water within low-level supercooled liquid water layers. Interaction of seeder and feeder clouds results in a significant precipitation enhancement. This has implications on the water cycle. From the anti-correlation between surface precipitation and liquid water path we estimated that 20 %–40 % of the precipitation stems from the feeder cloud. However, we have to note that the value of 20 %–40 % is strongly dependent on the assumed reproduction rate of liquid water in the feeder cloud. This study aims at giving an overview from a remote-sensing, in situ and model perspective on a seeder-feeder event in an unprecedented detail by exploiting a big set of retrievals applicable to remote-sensing and in situ data. Utilizing different retrievals gives a consistent view on the seeder-feeder case study which is an important basis for future studies. It is demonstrated how improved understanding of seeder-feeder interactions can contribute to enhancing weather forecast models, particularly in regions affected by persistent low-level supercooled stratus clouds."

The analysis of observations gathered from research aircraft over the tropical ocean shows that the merging of thermals and clouds in the first kilometer of the atmosphere plays a key role in controlling the size, depth and spacing of clouds. This reveals a fundamental process through which clouds interact with each other and with their environment. 
 Observations from airborne field campaigns are used to study the interplay between boundary-layer thermals and clouds in the trades. The size distributions of thermal and cloud-base chords inferred from turbulence and horizontal lidar-radar measurements are robustly described by the sum of two exponentials. Analytical calculations and statistical simulations show that the merging of objects is sufficient to explain the two exponentials, representing, respectively, the populations of merged- and unmerged-object chords. They also show how circulations induced by convective objects facilitate the merging process. The observed day-to-day variability of these populations at cloud base can thus be tied to the variability of thermal merging across the depth of the subcloud layer. Clouds rooted in unmerged thermals are small and shallow while those rooted in merged thermals are wider and deeper. An intricate interplay between thermal- and cloud-merging arises: when thermal merging is weak, thermal number density is high and cloud bases merge easily, leading to strong mesoscale mass fluxes and “Gravel” shallow mesoscale organizations. In contrast, when thermal merging is strong, clouds are fed by sparser but wider thermals, leading to longer cloud lifetimes but weaker cloud merging, weaker mesoscale mass fluxes, and “Flower” mesoscale organizations. This interplay between thermal- and cloud-merging imposes an upper bound on cloud coverage and suggests a negative feedback on the growth of mesoscale circulations. Thermal merging also controls observed size distributions of thermals in deep convective regimes. The merging process thus appears to be a fundamental player in the mesoscale organization of convection."

The reactions also provide further insights into the oxidation capacity of Criegee intermediates. 
 Hydroxyacetonitrile (HOCH2CN) is released from wildfires and bleach cleaning environments, which is harmful to the environment and human health. However, its atmospheric lifetime remains unclear. Here, we theoretically investigate the reactions of Criegee intermediates (CH2OO and syn-CH3CHOO) with HOCH2CN to explore their reaction mechanisms and obtain their quantitative kinetics. Specifically, we employ computational strategies approaching CCSDT(Q)/CBS accuracy, combined with a dual-level strategy, to unravel the key factors governing the reaction kinetics. We find an unprecedentedly low enthalpy of activation of −5.61 kcal mol−1 at 0 K for CH2OO + HOCH2CN among CH2OO reaction with atmospheric species containing a C ≡ N group. Furthermore, we also find that the low enthalpy of activation is caused by hydrogen bonding interactions. Moreover, the present findings reveal the rate constant of CH2OO + HOCH2CN determined by loose and tight transition states has a significantly negative temperature dependence, reaching 10−10 cm3 molec.−1 s−1 close to the collisional limit at below 220 K. In addition, our findings also reveal that the rate constant of CH2OO + HOCH2CN is 103–102 times faster than that of OH + HOCH2CN below 260 K. The calculated kinetics in combination with data based on global atmospheric chemical transport model suggest that the CH2OO + HOCH2CN reaction dominates over the sink of HOCH2CN at southeast China, northern India at 1 km and in the Indonesian and Malaysian regions at 5 and 10 km. The present findings also reveal that the CH2OO + HOCH2CN reaction leads to the formation of glycolamide, which could contribution to the formation of secondary oganic aerosols."

Using a high-resolution global model, it shows the long-lasting storm is significantly linked to and supported by vertical wind shear up to 400 km ahead, with the mid-level jet stream playing a role in maintaining the shear. The findings highlight the value of such model in data-sparse regions for examining storms and their impacts. 
 The Congo Basin in Central Africa is one of three convective centers in the tropics, characterized by a high proportion of precipitation produced by mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). However, process-level understanding of these systems and their relationship to environmental factors over the Congo Basin remains unclear, largely due to scarce in-situ observations. This study employs the Model for Prediction Across Scales–Atmosphere (MPAS-A), a global cloud-resolving model, to investigate MCSs in this region. Compared to satellite-observed brightness temperature (Tb), MPAS-A realistically simulates key MCS features, allowing a detailed comparison between two mesoscale convective complex (MCC) cases: one over the southern mountainous region (MCC-south) and the other over the northern lowland forests (MCC-north). MCC-south is larger, longer-lived, and moves a longer distance than MCC-north. Our analysis shows that MCC-south is supported by higher convective energy and more favorable vertical wind shear. The shear extends up to 400 km ahead of the convection center, exhibits a strong association with Tb variability, and is well balanced by a moderately strong cold pool. In contrast, MCC-north features weaker, localized shear near the center and a stronger cold pool. The African Easterly Jet helps maintain the shear in both cases, but an overly strong jet may suppress low-level westerlies and weaken convection. These results show how latitude and topography modulate environmental influences on Congo Basin MCS developments. The findings underscore the value of global cloud-resolving models for understanding convective systems and their impacts on weather extremes and societal risks in data-sparse regions."

Radiosonde data, while reliable, has limited coverage. ERA5 (European Centre for Medium–Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5) is a reanalysis dataset that provides global data, enabling comparisons of tropopause height estimates and then analyzed for long-term trends. Results show a 32 m mean difference (radiosonde – ERA5) with trends of +9 m/year (radiosonde) and +7 m/year (ERA5), crucial for characterizing tropopause changes under climate change. 
 The tropopause plays a critical role in stratosphere-troposphere exchange and climate change. Its height is widely defined based on the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) threshold temperature gradient. High-resolution (5–10 m) soundings, therefore, are expected to substantially minimize uncertainties of tropopause height (TH) arising from limited vertical resolution and imprecise temperature measurements. The high-resolution radiosonde data, accumulated from 2000 to 2023 from a globally distributed, sparse network (about 1.5 million profiles from 222 stations), offers valuable insights into climatological tropopause variability. While radiosonde observations are limited by spatiotemporal coverage, European Centre for Medium–Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) reanalysis datasets offer globally complete tropopause representations. To leverage both the high resolution of radiosonde measurements and the global coverage of ERA5, this study compares their TH estimates and analyzes long-term trends across different latitude zones and seasons. The results indicate that the mean and absolute differences (radiosonde minus ERA5) in TH were 32 and 336 m, respectively, with larger discrepancies observed during the spring season in the tropics (±20°). Overall, point-to-point comparisons indicate that ERA5 effectively captures climatological TH variations in both time and space. Long-term trend analyses revealed increases of +9 m yr−1 (radiosonde) and +7 m yr−1 (ERA5) based on point-to-point comparisons. However, these site-specific trends may differ substantially from the long-term trends observed in ERA5 with complete spatiotemporal resolution, even showing opposite trends. Therefore, continued accumulation of high-resolution radiosonde profile data is crucial to further characterize tropopause changes in a warming climate."

The model skillfully captures important barrier dynamics through robust data integration and calibration of relatively simple model parameterizations, and can be used to understand and predict when, where, and how barriers evolve to inform decision-making processes. 
 Models of coastal barrier geomorphic and ecologic change are valuable tools for understanding and predicting when, where, and how barriers evolve and transition between ecogeomorphic states. Few existing models of barrier systems are designed to operate over spatiotemporal scales congruous with effective management practices (i.e., decades/kilometers, referred to herein as “mesoscales”), incorporate important ecogeomorphic feedbacks, and provide probabilistic projections of future change. Here, we present a new numerical model designed to address these gaps by explicitly yet efficiently simulating coupled aeolian, marine, vegetation, and shoreline components of barrier evolution over spatiotemporal scales relevant to management. The Mesoscale Explicit Ecogeomorphic Barrier model (MEEB) simulates subaerial ecomorphologic change of undeveloped barrier systems over kilometers and decades using meter-scale spatial resolution and weekly time steps. MEEB applies simplified parameterizations to represent and couple key ecogeomorphic processes: dune growth, vegetation expansion and mortality, beach and foredune erosion, barrier overwash, and shoreline and shoreface change. The model is parameterized and calibrated with observed elevation, vegetation, and water level data for a case study site of North Core Banks, NC, USA. Simulated ecogeomorphic change in model hindcasts agrees well with observations, demonstrating both favorable skill scores and qualitatively correct behavior. We also describe an additional model framework for producing probabilistic projections that account for uncertainties related to future forcing conditions and intrinsic stochastic dynamics and demonstrate the probabilistic framework's utility with example forecast simulations. As a mesoscale model, MEEB is designed to investigate questions about future barrier ecogeomorphic change of moderate complexity, offering semi-qualitative predictions and semi-quantitative explanations. For example, MEEB can be used to investigate how climate-induced shifts in ecological composition may alter the likelihood of morphologic impacts or to generate probabilistic projections of ecogeomorphic state change."

This study introduced an automated approach to refine key parameters, focusing on processes like cloud formation and atmospheric circulation. Testing adjustments to 10 and 20 parameters improved the model’s accuracy and stability, reducing errors in long-term simulations. This faster, more reliable method enhances climate models, supporting better future predictions and aiding global decision-making. 
 Parameterization in climate models often involves parameters that are poorly constrained by observations or theoretical understanding alone. Manual tuning by experts can be time-consuming, subjective, and prone to underestimating uncertainties. Automated tuning methods offer a promising alternative, enabling faster, objective improvements in model performance and better uncertainty quantification. This study presents an automated parameter-tuning framework that employs a derivative-free optimization solver (DFO-LS) to simultaneously perturb and tune multiple convection-related and microphysics parameters. The framework explicitly accounts for observational and initial condition uncertainties (internal variability) to calibrate a 1° resolution atmospheric model (GAMIL3). To evaluate its performance, two main tuning experiments were conducted, targeting 10 and 20 parameters, respectively. In addition, three sensitivity experiments tested the effect of varying initial parameter values in the 10-parameter case. Both tuning experiments achieved a rapid reduction in the cost function. The 10-parameter optimization improved model accuracy for 24 of 34 key variables, while expanding to 20 parameters yielded improvement for 25 variables, though some structural model biases appeared. Ten-year AMIP simulations validated the robustness and stability of the tuning results, showing that the improvements persisted over extended simulations. Additionally, evaluations of the coupled model with optimized parameters showed, compared to the default parameters settings, reduced climate drift, a more stable climate system, and more realistic sea surface temperatures, despite a residual global energy imbalance of 2.0 W m−2 (about 1.4 W m−2 arising from the intrinsic imbalance of the atmospheric component) and some remaining regional biases. The sensitivity experiments further underscored the efficiency of the tuning algorithm and highlight the importance of expert judgment in selecting initial parameter values. This tuning framework is broadly applicable to other general circulation models (GCMs), supporting comprehensive parameter tuning and advancing model development."

It introduces a new method to compute its volumetric fraction and physical effects using standard input data and soil mixture theory. Validated with experimental mixtures and field observations, the proposed framework improves the physical realism of soil property estimates. 
 Numerous studies have highlighted the critical role of soil organic matter (SOM) physical properties in simulating hydrological and energy exchanges within Earth system models. However, current approaches in their land surface model (LSM) components typically rely on empirically derived parameterizations that lack physical consistency and often fail to distinguish between soil organic carbon (SOC) and total SOM. This conceptual simplification leads to inaccurate estimates of the volumetric organic fraction of soils and, consequently, of their physical properties as highlighted in this study. A process-based framework grounded in soil mixture theory is thus proposed to provide a physically consistent representation of the effects of SOM on soil behavior. The volumetric fraction of SOM is derived using mass-volume relationships, combined with an SOC-to-SOM conversion based on recent pedotransfer functions. For LSMs using the Brooks and Corey model to simulate soil water retention and hydraulic conductivity, new parameterizations are proposed for SOM hydrodynamic properties as functions of bulk density and depth, informed by recent observational datasets. Validation against experimental binary mixtures and large in situ datasets shows significant improvements over conventional methods. Designed for compatibility with global soil databases, the framework enables more physically consistent SOM representation in LSMs without requiring additional inputs or calibration."

 Interventions to induce lasting HIV remission are needed to obviate the requirement for lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART). Durable post-intervention control (PIC) of viremia has been achieved in a subset of individuals following broadly neutralizing anti-HIV-1 antibody (bNAb) administration and analytical treatment interruption (ATI)1-4. Prior studies support a role for CD8+ T cells5-9 but the precise features of CD8+ T cells involved in PIC remain unclear. Here we mapped and functionally profiled CD8+ T cell responses to autologous HIV epitopes using longitudinal samples from four ATI trials in bNAb recipients. PIC was associated with superior pre-intervention HIV-specific CD8+ T cell proliferative capacity, stem cell-like memory phenotype, and recall cytotoxicity against autologous HIV peptide-pulsed CD4+ T cells. CD8+ T cell stemness was further increased following bNAb administration without emergence of new clonotypes targeting defined HLA-optimal epitopes. Multimodal single-cell analyses revealed molecular features associated with PIC and HIV-specific CD8+ T cell stemness, including signatures of metabolic fitness and reduced T cell exhaustion. These results identify immune features that precede subsequent PIC to inform the development of combination immunotherapies that will elicit durable HIV remission."

 Attention and working memory (WM) have traditionally been considered closely linked processes with shared neural mechanisms. In information selection, attention is often conceptualized as a gatekeeper to WM, regulating which information is encoded and stored. Here, combining tasks specifically designed to separate attention from WM encoding with a multimodal approach, we provide converging neural and causal evidence that these processes are dissociable. Functional MRI identifies the supramarginal gyrus (SMG) as the key region enabling this dissociation, while dynamic causal modeling reveals the neural circuitry through which the SMG exerts inhibitory control over attentional representations, regulating their integration into WM. Furthermore, neuromodulation via transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) demonstrates that enhancing SMG activity strengthens this inhibitory control. A second tDCS experiment using varied stimuli confirms the generalizability of the effect. Finally, a transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) experiment provides further causal evidence with greater spatial precision. These findings challenge the long-standing view that attention and WM encoding form a continuous process, demonstrating instead that they constitute two dissociable neural processes of information selection. Here, the authors combine brain imaging and non-invasive stimulation to show that attention and working memory are dissociable processes, with inhibitory control in the supramarginal gyrus gating what attended information reaches memory."

Here, the authors show that CIP2A with TOPBP1 mediates the mitotic recruitment of the SLX4/MUS81/XPF nuclease complex to replication stress-induced DNA lesions to maintain genome integrity. 
 Perturbed DNA replication can lead to incompletely replicated DNA when cells enter mitosis and can interfere with chromosome segregation. Cells therefore require mechanisms to resolve these lesions during mitosis. The CIP2A-TOPBP1 complex is described to tether fragmented DNA molecules during mitosis. Whether CIP2A also functions in processing of incompletely replicated DNA remained unclear. We show that CIP2A-TOPBP1 form large filamentous structures at sites of incomplete DNA replication during mitosis, and that CIP2A-TOPBP1 facilitate the recruitment of SMX tri-nuclease complex members SLX4, MUS81 and XPF-ERCC1. These structures form in proximity to sites of mitotic DNA synthesis, although CIP2A is not required for mitotic DNA synthesis. In addition to its globular and coiled-coil domain, the unstructured C-terminal domain of CIP2A is essential for CIP2A-TOPBP1 filamentous structure formation and recruitment of the SMX complex. BRCA1-/- and BRCA2-/- cells have increased mitotic DNA lesions that recruit CIP2A and SLX4. We show that the C-terminal part of CIP2A is required for survival of BRCA2-/- cells. Moreover, SLX4 is crucial for genome stability in BRCA2-/- cells. Combined, we demonstrate that CIP2A-TOPBP1 recruits the SMX complex during mitosis, which is required to resolve mitotic DNA lesions, allows faithful chromosome segregation and maintain viability of BRCA2-/- cells. How cells respond to replication-derived DNA damage that is carried over into mitosis is not well understood.

 Wide-bandgap (WBG) perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are employed for tandem solar cells. Understanding the crystallization mechanism of mixed-halide WBG perovskite will contribute to achieving the high-performance photovoltaics. Herein, we demonstrate that the asynchronous halide insertion is accompanied by random crystal facets and orientations, restricting the efficient carrier extraction. Guided by density functional theory calculations, we construct a π-conjugated molecular wall structure using o-phenylenediamine (OPD). The molecular wall at the grain boundary induces templated perovskite crystallization through the ortho-diamine group, enabling synchronous [PbBr6]4- and [PbI6]4- halide insertion. The OPD-treated perovskite film exhibits a preferred (100) facet and a highly vertical orientation. Benefited from the improved carrier extraction, the resulting WBG PSC (1.69 eV) achieves a power conversion efficiency of 24.13% (certified 23.43%), representing one of the highest values among WBG PSCs. Meanwhile, the improved perovskite crystal quality ensures the enhanced operational stability of the PSCs.

 Methane, a predominant component of human intestinal gas, has been reported to be associated with a reduction in intestinal transit speed, as well as correlations with elevated body mass index. While the gut methanogenic archaea that produce this gas have been studied, the countervailing role of methane-consuming bacteria (methanotrophs) within the human gut ecosystem remains a critical, under-explored area. The potential for these bacteria to act as a built-in sink for intestinal methane and thereby mitigate its negative physiological effects is unknown. Here, we isolate an unreported methanotroph from human fecal samples, classified as Methylocystis intestini. Using a mouse model, we observe that methane challenge is associated with gastrointestinal motility and fat metabolism. We then demonstrate that the administration of Methylocystis intestini effectively reverses these dysfunctional processes, restoring motility and metabolic parameters. Additional analysis of methane-oxidation genes abundance in 1207 public metagenomic sequences from individuals with varying health statuses, including obesity and constipation, provides consistent correlative support for our experimental conclusions. Expanding this view to a global scale, we conducted a metagenomic survey of 550 human fecal samples from populations across five continents. This broader analysis reveals that methane-oxidizing genes are not a rarity but a common feature of the human gut microbiome, being detectable in over 91% of samples. This ubiquity underscores their fundamental role in human biology. Collectively, our findings establish gut methanotrophs as key mediators of intestinal methane level. Their presence is widespread across global populations, and their functional capacity can balance the effects of methane on host physiology. This work elucidates a crucial component of gut homeostasis and opens a promising avenue for developing microbiome-based therapeutic strategies aimed at managing methane-related gastrointestinal disorders by harnessing the power of these native methane-consuming bacteria. Here, the authors identify a methane-consuming human gut bacterium, Methylocystis intestini, showing it can affect digestion and fat metabolism by regulating gut methane levels, revealing a natural gut microbial potential mechanism helping maintain healthy gut function and balance."

Here the authors show that HNSCC cancer cells promote the expression of caveolin-2 (Cav2) on neural cells, while Cav2-expressing neurons or glial cells induce a mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation phenotype in cancer cells to maintain cancer stemness. 
 Cancer cells and the nervous system engage in a dynamic interplay, significantly influencing initiation and progression in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Our findings highlight that cancer cells drive an increase in caveolin-2 (Cav2) expression within trigeminal ganglia and associated neural fibers in the tumor milieu, fostering a reciprocal attractant relationship between tumor cells and nerves. Notably, the knockout of Cav2, either globally or specifically in sensory neurons or glial cells, markedly attenuates the growth of orthotopically implanted tongue tumors. Moreover, Cav2-expressing nerves are implicated in shifting cancer cell metabolism towards mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, a process involved in maintenance of cancer stem cells (CSCs). Our results also demonstrate that Cav2-expressing nerves confer stemness properties to cancer cells. Disruption of Cav2 expression, both globally and in specific neural cell types, impedes tumorigenesis and progression in a 4-NQO-induced HNSCC mouse model. This interplay observed between cancer cells, neurons, and glial cells suggests a potential mechanism through which tumor-associated nerves might influence cancer stemness via metabolic reprogramming. This highlights a possible direction for anticancer therapy that warrants further investigation. The peripheral nervous system plays a role in the development of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). Here the authors show that HNSCC cancer cells promote the expression of caveolin-2 (Cav2) on neural cells, while Cav2-expressing neurons or glial cells induce a mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation phenotype in cancer cells to maintain cancer stemness."

Here, the authors use atomic force spectroscopy to reveal symmetry breaking in the proton arrangement in cyclic hydrogen bonds caused by nuclear quantum effects. 
 In hydrogen-bonded materials and biosystems, microscopic proton ordering, which is strongly influenced by the quantum nature of protons, underpins diverse macroscopic phenomena, including phase transitions, chemical reactions, biomolecular processes and collective proton transfer. Yet resolving proton arrangements and characterizing their quantum behavior at the atomic scale remain challenging due to the small size of protons and the lack of effective approaches. Here, we exploit bond-resolved atomic force microscopy and spectroscopy (BR-AFM/AFS) to probe signatures of proton ordering in surface-confined benzimidazole (BI) assemblies. By performing BR-AFS along the apparent H-bond between proton donor and acceptor nitrogen atoms, we extract information consistent with H-bonding directionality and signatures compatible with quantum proton delocalization. We observe anomalous rotational-symmetry breaking in the proton order of the cyclic hexamers, arising from the coexistence of both localized and quantum-delocalized protons. The chirality of a single hexamer can be reversibly switched by altering its adsorption registry combined with collective transfer of six protons. Path-integral molecular dynamics calculations unravel that nuclear quantum effects promote proton delocalization and concomitant reduction of donor-acceptor distance. Our findings enable atomic-level detection of complex proton orders, engineering proton-based quantum states, and elucidation of long-range proton transfer mechanisms in molecular architectures. Detecting proton arrangements and quantum behavior at the atomic level is a challenge.

 Colloidal self-assembly can typically be controlled only globally, at $$\ge$$101 μm scale, such as in liquid-liquid crystalline phase separation (LLCPS) of anisotropic tactoidal droplets. Here, we introduce a stimuli-responsive approach allowing a fully reversible structural control of LLCPS morphologies at the individual droplet level. Using amyloid-based tactoids and multiphoton absorption with localized photothermal effect, we can cut, ablate, and self-heal individual tactoids, and -when desired- print, erase, and store structural information within at sub-micron resolution. We exploit the nematic-isotropic-nematic transition within single tactoids to locally melt the liquid crystalline (LC) order into the isotropic phase, leaving unchanged the bulk dispersion structure. The locally melted nematic field recovers its ground-state LC order within minutes after the exposure, showing both self-healing and short-term memory-storage features. Furthermore, hybrid cholesteric tactoids functionalized by guest nanoparticles can be re-modeled into new tactoids with different symmetry and functionalities, for example, featuring laser-induced fluorescent encoding.

 Dielectric waveguides are an emerging platform for terahertz (THz) integrated circuits, but a key challenge for dense integration is the realization of terminations that enable both multi-port device characterization and elimination of electromagnetic interference. Here, we demonstrate a compact, broadband termination by coating silicon waveguides with ultrathin single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films. Fabricated via a floating-catalyst (aerosol) chemical vapor deposition process, film thicknesses vary from 2 to 53 nm and are characterized in 140-220 GHz. A 53 nm thick film introduces up to 47 dB of attenuation while maintaining over 20 dB reflection loss, confirming nearly reflection-free absorption. Shielding analysis shows absorption dominates over reflection, and a record specific shielding efficiency of 5.5 × 109 dB cm2 g−1 is achieved. This approach offers a footprint-efficient solution for high-density THz circuits without bulky, radiative terminations.

 The concept of land-use intensity has been widely used to quantify human impacts in terrestrial systems, yet such approaches fail to capture the cumulative effects of land use on connected river networks. Here, we introduce the Land Use Intensity Index for Stream Ecosystems (LUIS), a spatially explicit, hydrologically informed index that integrates crop-specific inputs of nitrogen, phosphorus, and pesticides with river network structure. To evaluate the relationship between agricultural pressures and water quality, we used logistic regression and a random forest classification model to assess overall ecological status and biological quality elements across Germany. Pesticide pressure showed the strongest association with ecological status, exhibiting the highest effect sizes, R² values, and predictor importance across both low- and high-order streams. These associations were especially pronounced in low-order streams and the central highlands, likely due to their limited dilution capacity and direct exposure to runoff. Phosphorus showed secondary relevance, particularly in higher-order streams, while nitrogen’s effects were less distinct. LUIS is a valuable tool for assessing the compound-specific and combined pressures of agricultural land use on stream ecosystems. Its mechanistically informed yet conceptually flexible framework provides a solid basis for future development and integration into operational monitoring and management contexts.

 The floor of deep summit craters is often obscured, hindering monitoring and limiting understanding of the dynamic processes within it. At Lascar Volcano, a sudden eruption in December 2022 was accompanied by lava emplacement. We employed satellite and drone imagery to generate high-resolution point clouds, optical and thermal orthomosaics through photogrammetry. Quantitative morphological analysis revealed an initial crater floor uplift from lava extrusion, followed by rapid subsidence that reduced nearly half the volume and formed a central funnel-shaped depression. To investigate surface deformation linked to internal structure evolution, we experimentally simulate lava dome extrusion and subsidence in a scaled 3D-printed mold. The analogue experiments reproduced a funnel-shaped structure consistent with satellite observations and demonstrated the extrusion along divergent faults followed by piston-like subsidence accommodated along convergent faults.

 Upwelling systems are critical drivers of regional climate variability, through their influence on ocean–atmosphere interactions and biogeochemical cycles. The Benguela Upwelling System, closely tied to Southern Ocean fronts and Indian-Atlantic water exchange, offers key insights into regional to global climatic shifts. This study analyses evolution of the Benguela Upwelling System during ~11.7 Ma–Holocene, using planktic foraminiferal relative abundance and oxygen and carbon stable isotope analysis from Ocean Drilling Program Site 1087. The data reveal unimpeded flow of Indian Ocean waters into the Southeast Atlantic before the onset of upwelling at ~10 Ma. The upwelling system was fully developed at ~9.8 Ma, which intensified between ~8.0 and 4.8 Ma, aided by strong southeast trade winds. The intense upwelling in Late Miocene Cooling interval triggered and intensified aridification in southern Africa. Upwelling and aridification became decoupled between ~4.8 and 3.7 Ma, coinciding with enhanced interoceanic exchange and the intrusion of warm Angola Current (Benguela Niño-like conditions). The reintensification of upwelling in the Plio-Pleistocene terminated Benguela Niño-like conditions and overshadowed signals of Indian Ocean inflow.

In this study, we established a CFC-11 emission inventory from coal combustion in China during 2000–2021. We found that CFC-11 emissions from coal combustion exhibited fluctuations and an overall upward trend, peaking in 2016, and that Hebei and Shandong had higher emissions. The CFC-11 emissions from coal combustion in the coastal regions might influence the monitored CFC-11 concentrations. 
 The trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) emission from its production and use (PAU) has drawn widespread interest, while its combustion sources have been overlooked. This study identified CFC-11 emission factors (EFs) of 3.6, 3.2 and 0.025 mg kg−1 from the combustion of domestic chunk coal, honeycomb briquettes and coal-fired power plants, respectively. A multi-year (2000–2021) emission inventory of CFC-11 from coal combustion in China was established. Results indicated that the CFC-11 annual emission from coal combustion in China was, on average, 233.5 t yr−1. It exhibited fluctuations and maintained an overall upward trend, accounting for 0.8 % of PAU emissions in 2000 and increasing to 9.8 % in 2021, with the peak value appearing in 2016. In the Shandong and Hebei provinces, which have high coal consumption amounts, the CFC-11 emissions from coal combustion increased by approximately 74 % during 2014–2017 compared to 2011–2012. At the Gosan station close to the Chinese mainland, CFC-11 emitted from coal combustion in Hebei and Shandong was 0.5 ppt of its average concentration during January 2016. An additional climate effect of the clean heating and coal-to-electricity policies in China was also observed, with an obvious decrease (2.2 × 106 and 3.4 × 107 t) in CO2-equivalent emission. This study provides substantial evidence of CFC-11 emission from coal combustion and highlights the role of combustion emission against the background of reducing CFC-11 from PAU.

 The Mediterranean region is characterized by a highly variable climate marked by prolonged dry spell interspersed with intense rainfall events mainly in autumn. These climatic extremes exacerbate droughts, flash floods and soil erosion, resulting in significant environmental and agricultural challenges across Mediterranean catchments. The dynamics of water and sediment fluxes in these environments are the result of complex interactions between climate, land use and management. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for recommending effective management strategies to mitigate erosion and runoff impacts.

It's freely available in two versions: one for climate trend analysis and another for training AI wave models, providing a valuable tool for ocean research and forecasting. 
 Satellite altimeters provide long-term, high-accuracy observations of significant wave height (SWH) over the global ocean. However, their sparse spatial and temporal sampling introduces undersampling errors in wave climate analyses. Direct gridding of multi-mission altimeter data through spatiotemporal interpolation still results in low-accuracy global SWH fields due to this limitation. To overcome this challenge, we use SWH outputs from a WAVEWATCH III hindcast as a background field and apply an offline post-fusion with along-track, jointly calibrated altimeter observations from the Climate Change Initiative Sea State dataset. Unlike data assimilation within numerical wave models, this offline fusion approach allows retrospective correction of past model outputs using future observations. Validation against buoy measurements and independent satellite data demonstrates that the fused gridded product achieves high accuracy. To address different application needs, we provide two versions of the fused dataset: 1) A ""two-sat"" version that incorporates data from only two satellites at any given time, designed for wave climate studies. This configuration ensures temporal consistency by maintaining a stable data volume over the entire time span. 2) A ""multi-sat"" version that integrates data from as many altimeter missions as possible, intended to support applications such as the training of artificial intelligence-based wave models, where higher spatial and temporal accuracy is prioritized.

We extended an adjoint method to optimize spatiotemporally varying parameters together with the atmosphere forcing and the initial conditions using satellite and in-situ observations. Seasonally, this scheme demonstrates a more prominent advantage in mid-autumn and show great potential for accurately reproducing the Arctic changes. 
 Parameters in sea ice-ocean coupled models greatly affect the simulated evolution of the ocean and sea ice, and are typically tuned to bring the model state close to observations. Using an adjoint method, spatiotemporally varying parameters of an Arctic sea ice-ocean coupled model are optimized simultaneously with the initial conditions and atmospheric forcing by assimilating satellite and in-situ observations. The assimilation results show that the joint state and parameter estimation (SPE) substantially improves the sea ice concentration simulations. Particularly in October, when the ocean surface starts to refreeze, SPE reduces the lead closing parameter Ho (which determines the minimum ice thickness formed in the open water), thereby increasing the sea ice growth and facilitating the seasonal rapid sea ice recovery in the Arctic's Pacific sector. Comparisons with sea ice thickness observations from the moored upward-looking sonars and Ice Mass Balance buoys demonstrate that incorporating optimized model parameters into the coupled model also leads to better sea ice thickness estimation. Given that the optimal set of sea ice parameters may evolve alongside the thinning of Arctic sea ice, the adjoint-based SPE scheme has the potential to more accurately reconstruct the histical Arctic ocean and sea ice changes covering the satellite era, supporting research on Arctic sea ice and ocean variability."

King;Zebedee Nicholls;Mark D. Zelinka;Malte Meinshausen,Standardising the “Gregory method” for calculating  equilibrium climate sensitivity,"The Gregory method is a common approach for calculating the equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS). However, studies which apply this method lack transparency in how model data is processed prior to calculating the ECS, inhibiting replicability. Different choices of global weighting, net radiative flux variable, anomaly calculation, and linear regression fit can affect the ECS estimates. We investigate the impact of these choices and propose a standardised method for future ECS calculations. 
 The equilibrium climate sensitivity (ECS) – the equilibrium global mean temperature response to a doubling of atmospheric CO2 – is a high-profile metric for quantifying the Earth system's response to human-induced climate change. A widely applied approach to estimating the ECS is the “Gregory method” (Gregory et al., 2004), which uses an ordinary least squares (OLS) regression between the net radiative flux, N, and surface air temperature anomalies, ΔT, from a 150 year experiment in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations are quadrupled. The ECS is determined by extrapolating the linear fit to N=0, i.e. the ΔT-intercept, indicating the point at which the system is back in equilibrium. This method has been used to compare ECS estimates across the CMIP5 and CMIP6 ensembles and will likely be a key diagnostic for CMIP7. Despite its widespread application, there is little consistency or transparency between studies in how the climate model data is processed prior to the regression, leading to potential discrepancies in ECS estimates. We identify 32 alternative data processing pathways, varying by differences in global mean weighting, net radiative flux variable, anomaly calculation method, and linear regression fit. Using 44 CMIP6 models, we systematically assess the impact of these choices on ECS estimates and calculate uncertainty ranges using two bootstrap approaches. While the inter-model ECS range is insensitive to the data processing pathway, individual outlier models exhibit notable differences. Approximating a model's native grid cell area (if irregular) with cosine of the latitude can decrease the ECS by 11 %, the choice of N-variable can change the ECS by 6 %, and some anomaly calculation methods can introduce spurious temporal correlations in the processed data. Beyond data processing choices, we also evaluate an alternative linear regression method – total least squares (TLS) – which has a more statistically robust basis than OLS. However, for consistency with previous literature, and given TLS may reduce the ECS compared to OLS (by up to 24 %), thereby making a known bias in the Gregory method worse, we do not feel there is sufficient clarity to recommend a transition to TLS in all cases. To improve reproducibility and comparability in future studies, we recommend a standardised Gregory method: weighting the global mean by cell area, using the top of the atmosphere (as opposed to the top of model) N-variable, and calculating anomalies by first applying a rolling average to the preindustrial control timeseries then subtracting from the raw CO2 quadrupling experiment. This approach accounts for model drift while reducing noise in the data to best meet the pre-conditions of the linear regression. While CMIP6 results of the multi-model mean ECS appear insensitive to these processing choices, similar assumptions may not hold for CMIP7, underscoring the need for standardised data preparation in future climate sensitivity assessments."

 We develop a new Earth System model configuration framed into the ICON architecture, which provides the baseline for the next generation of climate predictions and projections (hereafter ICON XPP – where XPP stands for eXtended Predictions and Projections). ICON XPP comprises the atmospheric component of the numerical weather prediction (ICON NWP), the ICON ocean and land surface components, and an ensemble-variational data assimilation system, all adjusted to an Earth System model for pursuing climate research and operational climate forecasting. Two baseline configurations are presented: (1) a 160 km atmosphere and a 40 km ocean resolution, and (2) 80 km atmosphere and 20 km ocean resolution. A CMIP DECK (Diagnostic, Evaluation and Characterization of Klima) experimentation framework is used for a first evaluation.ICON XPP depicts the basic properties of the coupled climate. The pre-industrial climate shows a top-of-atmosphere balanced radiation budget and a mean global near-surface temperature of 13.8–14.0 °C. The ocean shows circulation strengths in the range of the observed values, such as the AMOC at 16–18 Sv and the flows through the common passages. The current climate is characterized by a trend in the global mean temperature of ∼ 1.2 °C since the 1850s, similar to reference datasets. Regionally, the hydroclimate differs greatly from observed conditions. For example, the inter-tropical convergence zone (ITCZ) has a double peak and a wet southern subtropical branch across the oceans. Further, the Southern Ocean sea surface temperature has a strong positive mean bias with temperatures up to 5 °C higher than observations.Dynamical processes, such as El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) performs similarly to CMIP6-like coupled models. Tropical waves and the Madden-Julian Oscillation are well captured, and the 40 km atmospheric configuration has a spontaneous weak quasi-biennial oscillation. The atmospheric dynamics in the northern extra-tropics of both configurations represent well the position of the jet stream as well as the influences of the transient momentum transports and their feedbacks on the jet stream. Overall, ICON XPP performs similarly to climate models performed in CMIP6 making it a good basis for climate forecasts and projections, and climate research."

 De novo enzyme design seeks to build proteins containing ideal active sites with catalytic residues surrounding and stabilizing the transition state(s) of the target chemical reaction1–7. The generative artificial intelligence method RFdiffusion8,9 solves this problem, but requires specifying both the sequence position and backbone coordinates for each catalytic residue, limiting sampling. Here we introduce RFdiffusion2, which eliminates these requirements, and use it to design zinc metallohydrolases starting from quantum chemistry-derived active site geometries. From an initial set of 96 designs tested experimentally, the most active has a catalytic efficiency (kcat/KM) of 16,000 M−1 s−1, orders of magnitude higher than previously designed metallohydrolases6,7,10,11. A second round of 96 designs yielded 3 additional highly active enzymes, with kcat/KM values of up to 53,000 M−1 s−1 and a catalytic rate constant (kcat) of up to 1.5 s−1. The design models of the four most active designs differ from known structures and from each other, and the crystal structure of the most active design is very close to the design model, demonstrating the accuracy of the design method. The most active enzymes are predicted by PLACER12 and Chai-1 (ref. 13) to have preorganized active sites that effectively position the substrate for nucleophilic attack by a water molecule activated by the bound metal. The ability to generate highly active enzymes directly from the computer, without experimental optimization, should enable a new generation of potent designer catalysts14,15.

 Maintaining biodiversity is central to the sustainable development agenda1. However, a lack of context-specific biodiversity information at policy-relevant scales has posed major limitations to decision-makers2,3. To address this challenge, we undertook a comprehensive assessment of the biodiversity intactness of sub-Saharan Africa4 using place-based knowledge of 200 African biodiversity experts5. We estimate that the region has on average lost 24% of its pre-colonial and pre-industrial faunal and floral population abundances, ranging from losses of <20% for disturbance-adapted herbaceous plants to 80% for some large mammals. Rwanda and Nigeria are the least intact (<55%), whereas Namibia and Botswana are the most intact (>85%). Notably, most remaining organisms occur in unprotected, relatively untransformed rangelands and natural forests. Losses in biodiversity intactness in the worst-affected biomes are driven by land transformation into cropland in grasslands and fynbos (Mediterranean-type ecosystems), by non-agricultural degradation in forests and by a combination of the two drivers in savannas. This assessment provides decision-makers with multifaceted, contextually appropriate and policy-relevant information on the state of biodiversity in an understudied region of the world. Our approach could be used in other regions, including better-studied localities, to integrate contextual, place-based knowledge into multiscale assessments of biodiversity status and impacts. Regional, place-based biodiversity information is used to comprehensively map and quantify biodiversity intactness of sub-Saharan Africa to inform national and global sustainability policies and planning."

 Neutrinos are the most abundant fundamental matter particles in the Universe and play a crucial part in particle physics and cosmology. Neutrino oscillation, discovered about 25 years ago, shows that the three known species mix with each other. Anomalous results from reactor and radioactive-source experiments1 suggest a possible fourth neutrino state, the sterile neutrino, which does not interact through the weak force. The Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino (KATRIN) experiment2, primarily designed to measure the neutrino mass using tritium β-decay, also searches for sterile neutrinos suggested by these anomalies. A sterile-neutrino signal would appear as a distortion in the β-decay energy spectrum, characterized by a discontinuity in curvature (kink) related to the sterile-neutrino mass. This signature, which depends only on the shape of the spectrum rather than its absolute normalization, offers a robust, complementary approach to reactor experiments. Here we report the analysis of the energy spectrum of 36 million tritium β-decay electrons recorded in 259 measurement days within the last 40 eV below the endpoint. The results exclude a substantial part of the parameter space suggested by the gallium anomaly and challenge the Neutrino-4 claim. Together with other neutrino-disappearance experiments, KATRIN probes sterile-to-active mass splittings from a fraction of an eV2 to several hundred eV2, excluding light sterile neutrinos with mixing angles above a few per cent. The analysis of the energy spectrum of 36 million tritium β-decay electrons recorded in 259 measurement days within the last 40 eV below the endpoint challenges the Neutrino-4 claim."

 Breast cancer remains a major global health challenge1. Here, to comprehensively characterize its genomic landscape and the clinical significance of genomic characteristics, we analysed whole-genome sequences from 1,364 clinically annotated breast cancers, with transcriptome data available for most cases. Our study expands the repertoire of oncogenic alterations and identifies novel driver genes, recurrent gene fusions, structural variants and copy number alterations. Timing analyses on copy number alterations suggest that genomic instability emerges decades before tumour diagnosis, and offer insights into early initiation of tumorigenesis. Pattern-driven genomic features, including mutational signatures2, homologous recombination deficiency3, tumour mutational burden and tumour heterogeneity scores4, were associated with clinical outcomes, highlighting their potential utility as predictive biomarkers for clinical evaluation of treatments such as CDK4/6 and HER2 inhibitors, as well as adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These findings highlight the power of large-scale, clinically annotated whole-genome sequencing in advancing our understanding of how genomic alterations shape patient outcomes.

 Stem cell-derived embryo models could greatly facilitate our understanding of embryonic development. Although human and monkey embryo models have reached early gastrulation stage1–7, the development of robust models beyond this time remains to be accomplished8. Here, using an optimized 3D suspension culture system, we have successfully advanced the in vitro culture of a stem cell-derived monkey blastoid to day 25. Morphological and histological analyses showed that these monkey embryoids underwent gastrulation and largely recapitulated key developmental events of the late gastrulation stage observed in vivo, with the appearance of a neural plate, haematopoietic system, allantois, primitive gut, primordial germ cells, yolk sac structures and progenitors of other organs, excluding trophoblast derivatives. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses revealed that the lineage composition and differentiation trajectories of cells in these monkey embryoids were similar to those found in natural embryos during gastrulation. Thus, this primate stem cell-derived embryo model provides a valuable platform for dissecting the mechanisms of primate embryonic development from blastocyst to late gastrulation stage.

 The origin of eukaryotes was a formative but poorly understood event in the history of life. Current hypotheses of eukaryogenesis differ principally in the timing of mitochondrial endosymbiosis relative to the acquisition of other eukaryote novelties1. Discriminating among these hypotheses has been challenging, because there are no living lineages representative of intermediate steps within eukaryogenesis. However, many eukaryotic cell functions are contingent on genes that emerged from duplication events during eukaryogenesis2,3. Consequently, the timescale of these duplications can provide insights into the sequence of steps in the evolutionary assembly of the eukaryotic cell. Here we show, using a relaxed molecular clock4, that the process of eukaryogenesis spanned the Mesoarchaean to late Palaeoproterozoic eras. Within these constraints, we dated the timing of these gene duplications, revealing that the eukaryotic host cell already had complex cellular features before mitochondrial endosymbiosis, including an elaborated cytoskeleton, membrane trafficking, endomembrane, phagocytotic machinery and a nucleus, all between 3.0 and 2.25 billion years ago, after which mitochondrial endosymbiosis occurred. Our results enable us to reject mitochondrion-early scenarios of eukaryogenesis5, instead supporting a complexified-archaean, late-mitochondrion sequence for the assembly of eukaryote characteristics. Our inference of a complex archaeal host cell is compatible with hypotheses on the adaptive benefits of syntrophy6,7 in oceans that would have remained largely anoxic for more than a billion years8,9. Analysis of eukaryotic gene sequences using a relaxed molecular clock methodology indicate that eukaryotes emerged 3.0–2.25 billion years ago as a result of mitochondrial endosymbiosis with complex archaea that already possessed an elaborated cytoskeleton, membrane trafficking, endomembrane, phagocytotic machinery and a nucleus."

 The appropriate generation of upper-layer neurons is necessary to create the circuits that underlie complex brain functions. Radial progenitors divide asymmetrically to generate neurogenic intermediate progenitors (IPs; also known as intermediate precursors), and the symmetric proliferation of IPs rapidly expands the cortical neuronal population. The dynamic maintenance of balanced diversity of cortical progenitors and the resultant generation, placement and connectivity of appropriate numbers of different classes of neurons serve to guide the formation of a properly wired cerebral cortex1–12. However, the molecular logic that instructs progenitor balance remains unclear. Here we show that members of the tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC)—proteins that are major regulators of cellular metabolism—function to sculpt radial progenitor–intermediate progenitor balance, radial unit organization and the resultant generation of upper-layer neurons. Developmental deletion of TSC proteins alters the radial progenitor and IP balance and changes radial unit composition, leading to increased upper-layer neuron generation and aberrant cortical connectivity. Human-specific modulation of TSC protein expression through human-gained enhancers affects progenitor balance and generation of upper-layer neurons. Evolutionary downregulation of TSC protein expression may therefore provide an effective route to radial unit sculpting and the expanded generation of upper-layer neurons necessary for higher-order brain functions in humans. The balance between radial progenitors and intermediate precursors to generate upper-layer neurons during the development and evolution of the cerebral cortex is mediated by members of the tuberous sclerosis complex."
10.1038/s41586-025-09794-2,False,Nature,该研究论文主要关注丹麦环境微生物组的图谱构建，特别是人类活动对微生物多样性的影响以及与气候变化相关的微生物功能群（如硝化菌）的研究。虽然微生物活动与某些大气成分（如N2O）的排放有关，但论文本身并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,[],C.

Albertsen,The&#xa0;Microflora Danica atlas of Danish environmental microbiomes,"Microflora Danica—an atlas of Danish environmental microbiomes—reveals that although human-disturbed habitats have high alpha diversity, species reoccur, revealing hidden homogeneity. 
 Over the past 20 years, there have been considerable advances in revealing the microbiomes that underpin processes in natural and human-associated environments. Recent large-scale metagenome surveys have recorded the variety of microbial life in the oceans1, in the human gut2 and on Earth3, with compilations encompassing thousands of public datasets4,5. However, despite their broad scope, these studies often lack functional information, and their sample locations are frequently sparsely distributed, limited in resolution or lacking metadata. Here we present Microflora Danica—an atlas of Danish environmental microbiomes encompassing 10,683 shotgun metagenomes and 450 nearly full-length 16S and 18S rRNA datasets, linked to a five-level habitat classification scheme. We show that although human-disturbed habitats have high alpha diversity, species reoccur, revealing hidden homogeneity. This underlines the role of natural systems in maintaining total species (gamma) diversity and emphasizes the need for national baselines for tracking microbial responses to land-use and climate change. Consequently, we focused our dataset exploration on nitrifiers, a functional group closely linked to climate change and of major importance for Denmark’s primary land use: agriculture. We identify several lineages encoding nitrifier key genes and reveal the effects of land disturbance on the abundance of well-studied, as well as uncharacterized, nitrifier groups, with potential implications for N2O emissions. Microflora Danica offers an unparalleled resource for addressing fundamental questions in microbial ecology about what drives microbial diversity, distribution and function. Microflora Danica—an atlas of Danish environmental microbiomes—reveals that although human-disturbed habitats have high alpha diversity, species reoccur, revealing hidden homogeneity."

Snigirev,Determination of the spin and parity of all-charm tetraquarks,"The CMS Collaboration reports the measurement of the spin, parity, and charge conjugation properties of all-charm tetraquarks, exotic fleeting particles formed in proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. 
 The traditional quark model1,2 accounts for the existence of baryons, such as protons and neutrons, which consist of three quarks, as well as mesons, composed of a quark–antiquark pair. Only recently has substantial evidence started to accumulate for exotic states composed of four or five quarks and antiquarks3. The exact nature of their internal structure remains uncertain4–29. Here we report the first measurement of quantum numbers of the recently discovered family of three all-charm tetraquarks30–32, using data collected by the CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider from 2016 to 2018 (refs. 33,34). The angular analysis techniques developed for the discovery and characterization of the Higgs boson35–37 have been applied to the new exotic states. Here we show that the quantum numbers for parity P and charge conjugation C symmetries are found to be +1. The spin J of these exotic states is determined to be consistent with 2ħ, while 0ħ and 1ħ are excluded at 95% and 99% confidence levels, respectively. The JPC = 2++ assignment implies particular configurations of constituent spins and orbital angular momenta, which constrain the possible internal structure of these tetraquarks. The CMS Collaboration reports the measurement of the spin, parity, and charge conjugation properties of all-charm tetraquarks, exotic fleeting particles formed in proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider."

Borlaff;Pamela M. Marcum;Steve B. Howell,Satellite megaconstellations will threaten space-based astronomy,"Rapidly growing satellite constellations pose a substantial threat to astronomical observations, with projections indicating that future space telescopes will have more than 96% of their exposures affected by satellite trails, necessitating urgent mitigation strategies. 
 Rapidly growing satellite constellations have raised strong concerns among the scientific community1–4. Reflections from satellites can be visible to the unaided eye and extremely bright for professional telescopes. These trails already affect astronomical images across the complete electromagnetic spectrum, with a noticeable cost for operations and mitigation efforts. Contrary to popular perception, satellite trails affect not only ground-based observatories but also space observatories such as the Hubble Space Telescope5. However, the current number of satellites is only a fraction (less than 3%) of those to be launched in the next decade. Here we show a forecast of the satellite trail contamination levels for a series of international low-Earth-orbit telescopes on the basis of the proposed telecommunication industry constellations. Our results show that if these constellations are completed, one-third of the images of the Hubble Space Telescope will be contaminated, while the SPHEREx (Spectro-Photometer for the History of the Universe, Epoch of Reionization and Ices Explorer), ARRAKIHS (Analysis of Resolved Remnants of Accreted galaxies as a Key Instrument for Halo Surveys) and Xuntian space telescopes will have more than 96% of their exposures affected, with

               trails per exposure, respectively, with an average surface brightness of μ = 19 ± 2 mag arcsec−2. Our results demonstrate that light contamination is a growing threat for space telescope operations. We propose a series of actions to minimize the impact of satellite constellations, allowing researchers to predict, model and correct unwanted satellite light pollution from science observations.

However, current design methods require testing a large number of designs and mostly produce de novo enzymes with low catalytic activities1–3. As a result, they require costly experimental optimization and high-throughput screening to be industrially viable4,5. Here we present rotamer inverted fragment finder–diffusion (Riff-Diff), a hybrid machine learning and atomistic modelling strategy for scaffolding catalytic arrays in de novo proteins. We highlight the general applicability of Riff-Diff by designing enzymes for two mechanistically distinct chemical transformations, the retro-aldol reaction and the Morita–Baylis–Hillman reaction. We show that in both cases, it is possible to generate catalysts that exhibit activities rivalling those optimized by in vitro evolution, along with exquisite stereoselectivity. High-resolution structures of six of the designs revealed near-atomic active site design precision. The design strategy can, in principle, be applied to any catalytically competent amino acid array. These findings lay the basis for practical applicability of de novo protein catalysts in synthesis and describe fundamental principles of protein design and enzyme catalysis. A hybrid machine learning and atomistic modelling strategy enables one-shot design of efficient enzymes to catalyse diverse biological and non-biological chemical transformations."

 Extreme weather events such as hurricanes and floods cause increasing damage to communities, leading to substantial economic losses and displacement of populations1–6. Previous research suggests that there are disparities in the resilience capacity of neighbourhoods, predicting a recovery mechanism of either segmented withdrawal or reinforcement across different neighbourhood groups7–12. Assessing these hypotheses and investigating if—and to what extent—neighbourhood built environments recover at scale has been difficult because previous measures have relied on aggregated survey data1,7,9–14. Here we construct a building-level disaster recovery dataset covering 2,195 census tracts spanning 16 states and across 12 extreme weather events in the USA from 2007 to 2023 using historical street view imagery and multimodal machine learning. Our analysis shows that in the aftermath of extreme weather events, lower-income neighbourhoods are less likely to rebuild and do not return to their pre-disaster state, whereas higher-income areas rebuild and tend to improve compared with their pre-disaster state, highlighting increasing disparities in their built environments. We further investigate those disparities by examining the deployment of disaster recovery assistance and insurance policies, and identify a resource gap for lower-income neighbourhoods that may explain unequal community responses to extreme weather events. Our findings demonstrate the value of analysing neighbourhood recovery trajectories at a higher resolution and larger scale to inform responsive policy designs, and suggest the importance of restructuring the recovery financial assistance framework to promote more climate resilient communities. Higher-income neighbourhoods rebuild and improve after disasters while lower-income areas do not return to pre-disaster conditions."

Brucks;Jacqueline R. Rifkin;Jeff S. Johnson,Video-call glitches trigger uncanniness and harm consequential life outcomes,"Glitches in video calls can have a negative effect on the judgement of the people involved and correspond to worse outcomes in major areas of life such as job interviews and parole hearings. 
 People are increasingly using video calls for high-stakes interactions that once required face-to-face contact: from medical consultations1,2, to job interviews3, to court proceedings4. But video calling introduces a new communication issue: minor glitches, or intermittent errors in the transmission of audiovisual information during a virtual interaction5. Here, through five experiments and three supplementary studies using both live and recorded interactions, we show that minor audiovisual glitches during video calls harm interpersonal judgements in consequential life domains (for example, hiring decisions after a virtual interview, or trust in a medical provider after a telehealth visit). In addition, two archival datasets from real-world video calls reveal that glitches are associated with both reduced social connection and a lower likelihood of being granted criminal parole. We find that audiovisual glitches damage interpersonal judgements because they break the illusion of face-to-face contact (for example, by distorting faces, misaligning audio and visual cues or making movements appear ‘choppy’), evoking ‘uncanniness’—a strange, creepy or eerie feeling6,7. As the uncanniness of a glitch increases, so does its negative effect on interpersonal judgements. Furthermore, audiovisual glitches undermine interpersonal judgements only in video calls that simulate face-to-face interaction, showing that the negative effect produced by glitches goes beyond mere disruptiveness, comprehension difficulties and negative attributions. These findings have important implications for digital equity. Despite being considered a boon to access, virtual communication might unintentionally perpetuate inequality. Because disadvantaged groups often have poorer internet connections8–12, they are likely to encounter more glitches, and, in turn, to experience worse outcomes in consequential contexts such as health, careers, justice and social connection. Glitches in video calls can have a negative effect on the judgement of the people involved and correspond to worse outcomes in major areas of life such as job interviews and parole hearings."

Zhang,Search for light sterile neutrinos with two neutrino beams at MicroBooNE,"Data obtained from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber are used to exclude the single light sterile neutrino interpretation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies at the 95% confidence level. 
 The existence of three distinct neutrino flavours, νe, νμ and ντ, is a central tenet of the Standard Model of particle physics1,2. Quantum-mechanical interference can allow a neutrino of one initial flavour to be detected sometime later as a different flavour, a process called neutrino oscillation. Several anomalous observations inconsistent with this three-flavour picture have motivated the hypothesis that an additional neutrino state exists, which does not interact directly with matter, termed as ‘sterile’ neutrino, νs (refs. 3–9). This includes anomalous observations from the Liquid Scintillator Neutrino Detector (LSND)3 experiment and Mini-Booster Neutrino Experiment (MiniBooNE)4,5, consistent with νμ → νe transitions at a distance inconsistent with the three-neutrino picture. Here we use data obtained from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber10 in two accelerator neutrino beams to exclude the single light sterile neutrino interpretation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies at the 95% confidence level (CL). Moreover, we rule out a notable portion of the parameter space that could explain the gallium anomaly6–8. This is one of the first measurements to use two accelerator neutrino beams to break a degeneracy between νe appearance and disappearance, which would otherwise weaken the sensitivity to the sterile neutrino hypothesis. We find no evidence for either νμ → νe flavour transitions or νe disappearance that would indicate non-standard flavour oscillations. Our results indicate that previous anomalous observations consistent with νμ → νe transitions cannot be explained by introducing a single sterile neutrino state. Data obtained from the MicroBooNE liquid-argon time projection chamber are used to exclude the single light sterile neutrino interpretation of the LSND and MiniBooNE anomalies at the 95% confidence level."

 Codon usage bias—the preferential use of certain synonymous codons—is a fundamental feature of all genomes. Codon usage has a key role in determining gene-expression levels in all organisms that have so far been studied1–3. Nearly all human-infecting viruses show patterns of codon usage that are distinct from those of human genes—yet they express their proteins efficiently in host cells to cause diseases and pandemics. The mechanism behind this evasion of codon usage control by viral RNA translation is unknown. Here we show that viral proteins are subject to strong codon usage control when they are translated like human genes, but that they can evade this control when translated from viral replicons. This evasion is mediated by viral 5′ untranslated regions (UTRs) in diverse human viruses, which support codon-usage-insensitive translation. Canonical mRNA translation depends on codon usage, requiring the 5′ cap, 3′ polyA tail and their associated proteins, which suggests that mRNA looping has a role in the effect of codon usage on translation. Notably, RNA circularization for mRNAs with viral 5′ UTRs restores codon-usage-dependent translation, owing mainly to non-optimal codon-usage-mediated repression. These results suggest that mRNA circularization is crucial for initiating codon-usage-dependent translation, and that viral RNAs bypass this mechanism by blocking circularization, allowing efficient translation despite their poor codon usage profiles. Rather than adapting to the codon usage of their host, viruses use viral 5′ untranslated regions to initiate translation, which allows them to produce viral proteins in host cells efficiently despite poor codon usage profiles."

 Homo sapiens evolved hundreds of thousands of years ago in Africa, later spreading across the globe1, but the early evolutionary process is debated2–6. Here we present whole-genome sequencing data for 28 ancient southern African individuals, including six individuals with 25× to 7.2× genome coverage, dated to between 10,200 and 150 calibrated years before present (cal. bp). All ancient southern Africans dated to more than 1,400 cal. bp show a genetic make-up that is outside the range of genetic variation in modern-day humans (including southern African Khoe-San people, although some retain up to 80% ancient southern African ancestry), manifesting in a large fraction of Homo sapiens-specific variants that are unique to ancient southern Africans. Homo sapiens-specific variants at amino acid-altering sites fixed for all humans—which are likely to have evolved rapidly on the Homo sapiens branch—were enriched for genes associated with kidney function. Some Homo sapiens-specific variants fixed in ancient southern Africans—which are likely to have adapted rapidly on the southern African branch—were enriched for genes associated with protection against ultraviolet light. The ancient southern Africans show little spatiotemporal stratification for 9,000 years, consistent with a large, stable Holocene population transcending archaeological phases. While southern Africa served as a long-standing geographical refugium, there is outward gene flow over 8,000 years ago; however, inward gene flow manifests only after around 1,400 years ago. The ancient genomes reported here are therefore key to the evolution of Homo sapiens, and are important for advancing our understanding of human genomic variation.

 Neutrophils exhibit remarkable phenotypic and functional diversity across tissues and diseases1,2, yet the lack of understanding of how this immune compartment is globally organized challenges translation to the clinic. Here we performed single-cell transcriptional profiling of neutrophils spanning 47 anatomical, physiological and pathological scenarios to generate an integrated map of the global neutrophil compartment in mice, which we refer to as NeuMap. NeuMap integrates and expands existing models3,4 to generate fundamental new insights; it reveals that neutrophils organize in a finite number of functional hubs that distribute sequentially during maturation to then branch out into interferon-responsive and immunosuppressive states, as well as a functionally silent state that dominates in the healthy circulation. Computational modelling and timestamp analyses identify prototypical trajectories that connect these hubs, and reveal that the dynamics and preferred paths vary during health, inflammation and cancer. We show that TGFβ, IFNβ and GM-CSF push neutrophils along the different trajectories, and projection of chromatin accessibility sites onto NeuMap reveals that the transcription factor JUNB controls angiogenic and immunosuppressive states and promotes tissue revascularization. The architecture of NeuMap appears to be conserved across sex, environmental and genetic backgrounds, as well as in humans. Finally, we show that NeuMap enables inference of the pathophysiological state of the host by profiling blood neutrophils. Our study delineates the global architecture of the neutrophil compartment and establishes a framework for exploration and exploitation of neutrophil biology.

 Colorectal cancer (CRC) has traditionally been thought to develop through stepwise mutation of the APC tumour suppressor and other driver genes, coupled with expansion of positively selected clones. However, recent publications show that many premalignant lesions comprise multiple clones expressing different mutant APC proteins1–4. Here, by mediating transformation on different mouse backgrounds containing mutations in Kras or other common CRC driver genes, we establish that the presence of diverse priming events in the normal mouse intestinal epithelium can change the transformation and clonal-selection landscape, permitting the fixation of strong driver mutations in Apc and Ctnnb1 that are otherwise lost due to negative selection. These findings, combined with our demonstration of mutational patterns consistent with similar priming events in human CRC, suggest that the order in which driver mutations occur in intestinal epithelium can determine whether clones are positively or negatively selected and can shape subsequent tumour development.

 Recently, the Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has emerged as a superconductor with a transition temperature (Tc) of ~80 K above 14 GPa1-3. Achieving higher Tc in nickelate superconductors, along with the synthesis of reproducible high-quality single crystals without relying on high oxygen-pressure growth conditions, remains a significant challenge4-7. Here we report superconductivity up to 96 K under high pressure in bilayer nickelate single crystals synthesized at ambient pressure. Energy dispersive spectroscopy, single-crystal X-ray diffraction, nuclear quadrupole resonance, and scanning transmission electron microscopy evidenced high homogeneity and crystal quality of the flux-grown La2SmNi2O7-δ single crystals. La2SmNi2O7 exhibits clear bulk superconductivity, including zero resistivity (Tc,maxonset = 92 K and Tc,maxzero = 73 K at 21 GPa) and Meissner effect (Tc = 60 K at 20.6 GPa). Low-temperature high-pressure structural study indicates that both monoclinic and tetragonal structures can support superconductivity in this bilayer nickelate. Furthermore, we established a correlation between higher Tc under high pressures and larger in-plane lattice distortion at ambient conditions, corroborated by observing even higher Tconset of 96 K in La1.57Sm1.43Ni2O7-δ. This study overcomes key limitations in nickelate superconductor crystal growth, resolves the crystal structure in the superconducting state, and demonstrates an effective pathway towards achieving higher Tc."

 The Southern Ocean absorbs most of the excess heat resulting from climate change. However, climate projections show a persistent warm summer bias in its sea surface temperatures, indicating a limited understanding of the air–sea heat exchange mechanisms governing this region. Here we examine the impact of storms on the interannual variability of Southern Ocean surface temperatures during summer using in situ observations from underwater and surface robotic vehicles, climate reanalyses and satellite data. We show that synoptic-scale storms regulate summer sea surface temperatures through alteration of the effective heat capacity of the mixed layer and the entrainment of colder water from below. Storms reduce the summer ocean heat gain by limiting solar radiation reaching the surface. This effect is partially offset by a reduction in heat loss due to turbulent air–sea exchange. We also find that interannual variations in sea surface temperature during summer in the Southern Ocean are driven by changes in storm-mean wind speeds, which are linked to the Southern Annular Mode. Our results demonstrate a causal link between storm forcing and sea surface temperature variability, which is critical for reducing warming biases in climate models and improving future climate projections.

Lauretta,Bio-essential sugars in samples from asteroid Bennu,"Samples returned from asteroid Bennu contain bio-essential sugars such as ribose and glucose that may have formed in the parent asteroid from brines containing formaldehyde, according to a geochemical study. 
 Deliveries of organic molecules from space, such as those found in carbonaceous meteorites, have long been hypothesized as a source of the inventory of the first life on Earth. This hypothesis is strengthened by detections of two of life’s fundamental building blocks—nucleobases and protein-building amino acids—in pristine samples returned by spacecraft from the carbonaceous asteroids Bennu and Ryugu. However, life also requires sugars, which cannot be searched for in Ryugu samples due to limited available mass, and their presence in some meteorites is equivocal owing to terrestrial exposure. Here we analyse an extract from a sample of asteroid (101955) Bennu collected by the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft and identify several bio-essential sugars, including ribose (RNA sugar) and glucose (metabolism substrate). These sugars complete the inventory of ingredients crucial to life. Their distribution is consistent with that in the condensation products of formaldehyde solution. Given that Bennu contains formaldehyde and originates from an ancient parent asteroid that underwent long-term alteration by aqueous fluids, we postulate that the detected sugars formed in the parent asteroid from brines containing formaldehyde. This indicates that material with all three components necessary to life could have been dispersed to prebiotic Earth and other inner planets.

Here, the authors describe a two tiers mechanism required to sustain Pol Epsilon processivity: CHTF18-dependent loading of PCNA at leading strand and dsDNA binding by its POLE3-POLE4 subunits. 
 The maintenance of genome stability requires efficient leading strand synthesis by DNA Polymerase Epsilon (Polε). By performing CRISPR genetic screens in cells lacking the POLE4 subunit of Polε we define a genetic map of the factors required to support Polε function in the absence of its accessory subunits. A set of genes involved in iron metabolism emerge as required to sustain Iron Sulphur Cluster (ISC)-dependent Polε activity. We then dissect a synthetic lethal interaction between POLE3-POLE4 and the CHTF18-RFC2/5 complex. By combining cell biology, structural modelling and biochemistry, we define the existence of two tiers of regulation of Polε processivity: leading strand-specific loading of PCNA by CHTF18-RFC2/5 and “gripping” of newly synthesised dsDNA by POLE3-POLE4. The combined loss of these functions is incompatible with leading strand synthesis and viability. In summary, we describe the biochemical basis of human leading strand synthesis and the consequence of its dysfunction in genome stability. How DNA Polymerase Epsilon accomplishes continuous leading strand synthesis during DNA replication is not understood.

Here, the authors identify pericytes as an active paracrine signaling hub within the tumor parenchyma that orchestrates a tumor-suppressive microenvironment, suggesting pericyte preservation as a key feature of future therapeutic regimens for glioblastoma. 
 Glioblastoma (GBM) is characterized by fast progression, infiltrative growth pattern, and a high relapse rate. A defining feature of GBM is the existence of spatially and functionally distinct cellular niches, where malignant cells engage in paracrine crosstalk with cell types comprising the tumor microenvironment. Here, we identify pericytes as the most active paracrine signaling hub within the tumor parenchyma. Their depletion through genetic engineering results in accelerated tumor progression and shortened survival. Mechanistic studies reveal that pericyte deficiency remodels the endothelium and impacts the immune cell landscape, exacerbating tumor cell invasion and immune suppression. Specifically, the pericyte-deprived endothelium recruits perivascular, tumor-associated macrophages polarized towards an immune-suppressive phenotype. The recruited macrophages express Hepatocyte Growth Factor, which reinforces activation of its receptor tyrosine kinase MET on GBM cells harboring a pronounced mesenchymal subtype driven by the key phenotypic regulator Fosl1. Indeed, orthotopic implantation of MET-expressing GBM cells corroborates their superior tumor-initiating and invasive capabilities. Thus, pericytes represent critical modulators of GBM development by orchestrating a tumor-suppressive microenvironment, highlighting the importance of their preservation in therapy. Improved understanding of the tumor ecosystem in glioblastoma is critical for developing new treatment strategies for the disease.

 Pattern-recognition receptor (PRR) agonists are valuable agents across multiple medical applications, from vaccinology to immune-oncology. However, well-defined and potent small molecule agonists for many PRRs still await discovery and development. Screening of chemical libraries of ~200,000 small molecules for maturation of human monocytic cells by quantifying NF-κB activation and cell adherence was completed. From this screen, we selected a thiazole benzamide derivative, PVP-057, for its robust immunomodulatory properties, low toxicity profile, and concentration-dependent activity. In vitro investigation of pathway and receptor activation reveals that PVP-057 is a Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3) agonist. As a single-component adjuvant, administered intramuscularly or intradermally to female mice, PVP-057 enhances long-term humoral immunogenicity of varicella-zoster virus glycoprotein E to levels comparable to those induced by the clinical grade standard benchmark adjuvant, AS01B, while concurrently inducing cell-mediated immunity. To demonstrate the large-scale and precise synthesis necessary for the efficient mass production of a small molecule agonist, a green chemistry approach was completed, devising a three-step, 24-hour synthesis scheme for PVP-057, with a reliable purity of ~98%. Featuring highly efficient and scalable synthesis, a distinct TLR3-dependent mechanism of action, and robust adjuvanticity, the PVP-057 pharmacophore has prophylactic and therapeutic potential.

Here, the authors reported hydrogen-bond nanoconfined self-destructive polymers that have reversible solid-fluid switching capability at 25 °C and maintain good mechanical properties. 
 Conventional materials typically maintain a stable solid state under specific application conditions. However, materials that combine high mechanical strength with reversible switching states are highly desirable for advanced technologies. Here, we present hydrogen-bond nanoconfined self-destructive polymers (HNSPs) that have robust mechanics and reversible solid-fluid switching capability at 25 °C. Upon exposure to moisture, HNSPs spontaneously transition from solid to fluid, with humidity-tunable switching rates. HNSPs with weight ratios (Rm) of 1.7 is 1.69 times higher self-destructive rate than those with Rm of 2.1, and at 90% relative humidity (RH), Rm=2.0 samples exhibit an 804.27% higher self-destructive efficiency than at 60% RH. Heating can reverse the fluid back to a solid, enabling reversible, humidity-programmable behavior. Mechanistically, large ordered hydrogen-bond clusters, reduced chain entanglement, and abundant hydrophilic groups collectively facilitate switching. This work provides a simple yet versatile strategy for designing robust, switchable self-destructive polymers, broadening their potential in next-generation devices.

Here the authors show that, in septic mice, platelets activate perivascular mast cells to cause systemic hypotension and vascular pathology, while inhibiting platelets or mast cell activation suppresses septic shock induction, thereby implicating potential therapy targets. 
 The critical events that trigger sepsis progression into life-threatening septic shock remain unclear. In agreement with reports that link a drop in platelet count to a complicated clinical course in sepsis patients, here we report that, during sepsis, mouse platelets become activated, deposit systemically on vascular walls, and stimulate perivascular mast cells (MC) by releasing platelet activating factor (PAF). In mouse models and patient samples, MC activation correlates with the development of shock in sepsis and is mechanistically linked to shock by inducing systemic hypotension, vascular leakage and microvascular perfusion abnormalities. Preventing platelet or MC activation, or inhibiting the activity of the major MC granule constituent chymase, averts progression from sepsis to shock and reduces mortality of septic mice. Thus, our work establishes that, during sepsis progression, platelet microvascular adhesion leads to MC-mediated vascular changes to culminate in septic shock and septic shock-associated mortality. Sepsis may progress into lethal septic shock, but the cellular mechanisms are still unclear. Here the authors show that, in septic mice, platelets activate perivascular mast cells to cause systemic hypotension and vascular pathology, while inhibiting platelets or mast cell activation suppresses septic shock induction, thereby implicating potential therapy targets."

Here, using RNA-sequencing data from a large clinical trial in NSCLC patients, the authors define four molecular subsets with distinct tumour-intrinsic and -extrinsic features with differing outcomes to immunotherapy combinations. 
 The phase 3 IMpower150 trial in treatment-naïve patients with metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) demonstrates significantly longer progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) with first-line atezolizumab (anti-PD-L1)-bevacizumab (anti-VEGF)-carboplatin-paclitaxel (ABCP) than with bevacizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel (BCP). We characterise four molecular NSCLC subtypes identified by unsupervised clustering of transcriptomes of 564 pre-treatment primary tumour samples from IMpower150 using non-negative matrix factorization (NMF1-4). Each subtype has distinct tumour PD-L1 expression levels, epithelial characteristics, immune composition, and treatment outcomes. Both NMF2 (enriched in tumour proliferation signal, macrophages, and monocytes) and NMF4 (enriched in B cells and T cells) have elevated tumour PD-L1 expression. Of these two, only NMF4 demonstrates PFS and OS benefits with ABCP versus either BCP or atezolizumab-carboplatin-paclitaxel (ACP). Patients with NMF1 (enriched in basal and squamous-like cells) have improved outcomes on ABCP compared with ACP or BCP; those with NMF3 (enriched in adenocarcinoma signatures) show similar outcomes among treatments. These insights could help inform individualised first-line treatment for metastatic NSCLC. Standard first line therapy in patients with non-small cell lung cancer is immunotherapy but responses vary and consistent predictive biomarkers are lacking.

 Mutation sequencing of cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in liquid biopsy is crucial for tumor precision medicine, resistance profiling, and clinical decision-making. However, cfDNA mutation profiling in blood samples remains challenging due to its low abundance and high background noise. Here, we develop an Enzymatic Cleavage-directed Single Nucleotide Variant Sequencing (EC-SNV-Seq) assay technology for multiple cfDNA mutation detections. The EC-SNV-Seq assay integrates Argonaute-mediated cleavage and stem-loop DNA-initiated cascade-PCR amplification, achieving a sensitivity of 0.01% variant allele frequency. As a proof of concept, we apply the EC-SNV-Seq assay to detect multiple cfDNA mutations in KRAS, EGFR, and PIK3CA genes with single-nucleotide resolution. We further validate that EC-SNV-Seq detects early-stage multi-cancer and identifies single-nucleotide variants in a single patient plasma sample. Lastly, we evaluate its feasibility for multi-cancer early detection in population-scale screening using pooled plasma samples. The EC-SNV-Seq assay can enable highly sensitive and specific identification of low-frequency mutations, facilitating early cancer diagnosis and personalized treatment strategies.

Here, authors demonstrate how networks of spiking photonic crystal nanolasers can be trained to perform Bayesian inference through sampling from multivariate probability distributions. 
 Owing to their significant advantages in terms of bandwidth, power efficiency, and latency, optical neuromorphic systems have arisen as interesting alternatives to digital electronic devices. Recently, photonic crystal nanolasers with excitable behavior were first demonstrated. Depending on the pumping strength, they emit short optical pulses – spikes – at various intervals on a nanosecond timescale. In this theoretical work, we show how networks of such photonic spiking neurons can be used for Bayesian inference through sampling from learned probability distributions. We provide a detailed derivation of translation rules from conventional sampling networks, such as Boltzmann machines, to photonic spiking networks and demonstrate their functionality across a range of generative tasks. Finally, we provide estimates of processing speed and power consumption, for which we expect improvements of several orders of magnitude over current state-of-the-art neuromorphic systems. Optical neuromorphic systems promise significant advantages in terms of bandwidth, power efficiency, and speed.

This study maps ghost forests at the individual tree level along the US Atlantic coastal region. 
 Rising sea levels have driven widespread coastal tree die-off, forming large swaths of standing dead trees known as ‘ghost forests’. While reports of coastal forest loss are accumulating, its true severity and factors determining the underlying mortality risks remain poorly understood. Here we mapped over 10 million individual dead trees across the US Atlantic region, a sea level rise hotspot, using deep learning and sub-metre aerial imagery. Our analysis reveals disproportionate and pervasive tree mortality in many previously unrecognized ghost forest hotspots, with over 6 million dead trees concentrated in low-lying (<5 m) forests, primarily driven by salinization rather than flooding alone. Notably, man-made flood obstructions (roads and levees), when present, have reduced forest loss by 40% and 79% respectively, but they can only provide temporary protection against rising seas. These findings highlight the alarming decline in coastal forests and the need for strategic long-term planning to preserve the critical services that coastal ecosystems provide. Large swathes of standing dead trees or ‘ghost forests’ can form owing to rising sea levels in coastal areas, but the extent to which this occurs is unclear.

This study examines the socioecological impacts and global change drivers associated with plant invasions in India from 2006 to 2022. 
 Invasive plants, alongside other global changes, are transforming ecosystems globally. Strategic responses depend on monitoring invasions and arising socioecological risks particularly in the biodiverse and socioeconomically vulnerable regions. Using 16 years (2006–2022) of systematic monitoring over 277,000 km2 in India, we analyse the nexus between plant invasions and global changes, including propagule pressure, forest warming and drying, altered fire and herbivory dynamics and rapid land-use transformation. Annually, ~15,500 km2 of natural areas are invaded by at least one new species, exposing ~11,200 km2 of herbivore occupancy to forage loss. These invasions potentially limit resources for tiger food chains across ~5,950 km2 annually. Invasions have exposed 144 million people, 2.79 million livestock and 0.2 million km2 of smallholder agriculture to cascading impacts. By identifying socioecological risk hotspots for prioritizing investments, our findings offer critical insights to guide targeted restoration and safeguard biodiversity and vulnerable livelihoods.

 As a group of concerned organic pollutants, polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are able to accumulate in crops, thereby posing potential ecological risks. Phytohormone herbicides, such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), are widely used in agriculture to control weeds. Here, we found that IAA at environmentally relevant concentrations promoted the absorption and translocation of 6:2 chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) in wheat via activated multiple channel proteins. Furthermore, IAA facilitated unloading of 6:2 Cl-PFESA from cortex to xylem, thereby significantly promoting its translocation. The conformation transformation of channel proteins regulated by IAA greatly promotes dissociation of 6:2 Cl-PFESA from the bound proteins. The electrostatic interaction between 6:2 Cl-PFESA and gate residues enlarges the channel radius and promotes its absorption. These findings provide the evidence regarding the potential ecological risks associated with 6:2 Cl-PFESA accumulation in wheat caused by the application of IAA in agriculture. Commonly used auxin herbicides at environmentally relevant concentrations promoted the absorption and translocation of chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl sulfonate in wheat, indicating ecological risk, according to plant exposure experiments."

 Rock mass volume estimation is crucial for assessing landslide hazard, but it is often challenging. Seismic ambient noise data and polarisation analysis can be used to identify the eigenfrequencies of the blocks, which are in turn related to their volume. The aim of this work is to propose a procedure to build an eigenfrequency-volume abacus to estimate the order of magnitude of blocks’ volumes from the extracted resonance frequencies independently estimating the blocks’ area. The resonance frequency is extracted from seismic noise measurements analysed using the Horizontal-to-Vertical Spectral Ratio technique. The abacus is developed here by means of numerical simulations and field data, acquired over lateral spreads and block slides on Malta Island, where independent direct estimates of the blocks’ volume are available. These were used to validate the proposed methodology in two test sites.

While recent studies have highlighted the formers’ superior skill on standard forecast metrics, questions remain regarding their ability to forecast physically complex, derived variables, particularly in the context of extreme events. In this study, we assess the performance of two leading operational data-driven models (GraphCast and Pangu-Weather) in forecasting integrated vapour transport (IVT) and atmospheric rivers (ARs), using ECMWF’s IFS-HRES as a reference physics-based forecast. Forecasts are evaluated against ERA5 reanalysis over one year of global data, using three AR detection algorithms and lead times ranging from 1 to 10 days. Results show that data-driven models achieved root-mean-square errors for IVT comparable to or slightly better than IFS-HRES, particularly in the tropics and at shorter lead times. However, they achieved a poorer representation of the higher quantiles of the IVT distribution. A case study of a high-impact AR event revealed that all models could forecast the main event characteristics up to five days in advance. However, AR characteristics and detection performance varied substantially across detection algorithms. Notably, the geometrically stricter detection method highlighted a clearer advantage for IFS-HRES, especially in the midlatitudes and at shorter leads. Overall, while no model systematically outperformed the others across all AR detection algorithms, the results suggest that physics-based models may retain advantages in forecasting geometrically and physically consistent derived features like ARs, particularly under strict detection criteria. These findings underscore the importance of targeted evaluation frameworks for derived and extreme phenomena as data-driven models become more central in operational forecasting."

Moreover, three distinct heatwave events were identified: 3–11 June (9 days), 17 June–1 July (15 days), and 6–21 July (16 days), highlighting the prolonged and intense nature of the heat stress. Seasonal forecasting systems (GCFS, SEAS5, and Météo-France) consistently demonstrated the capability to predict above-climatological-mean temperatures over the Eastern Mediterranean, particularly the Balkan Peninsula, showcasing robust regional warming trend capture, though with variations in accuracy across lead times. The accurate prediction of subtropical influences, as evidenced by consistent positive temperature anomaly forecasts over North Africa and the Iberian Peninsula, underscores the forecasting systems’ capacity to represent large-scale circulation patterns, yet the predictive skill for midlatitude blocking events and their spatial extent remains subject to limitations and model-specific variations. Despite the inherent limitations in long-range meteorological predictability, particularly concerning heatwave timing and location, the study emphasizes the critical imperative for continued refinement of seasonal forecasting models to enhance societal resilience against the escalating impacts of climate change, particularly through improved representation of synoptic atmospheric drivers."

This study investigates Pan-Arctic climate responses to carbon dioxide removal (CDR) using nine CMIP6 models from the CDR Model Intercomparison Project (CDRMIP) and also analyzes two ScenarioMIP pathways, SSP126 and SSP534-over, which feature declining CO₂ concentrations. Our results reveal significant hysteresis and asymmetric responses in both temperature and precipitation during CO₂ increase and decrease phases. The multi-model mean shows that when CO₂ concentrations return to pre-industrial levels, the pan-Arctic region retains a warming of approximately 1.5 °C and increased precipitation of about 0.1 mm d−1 compared to initial conditions. Notably, temperature and precipitation changes in the pan-Arctic at peak CO₂ are approximately twice the global average. We identify substantial inter-model uncertainties, primarily driven by divergent representations of Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) responses and associated North Atlantic cooling patterns in the ramp-up period. Two models (CESM2 and NorESM2-LM) simulate particularly strong AMOC weakening during the ramp-up phase, resulting in reduced warming and wetting trends across the pan-Arctic. A similar persistence of warmer and wetter conditions is also found under the SSP126 and SSP534-over scenarios. These findings highlight the irreversible nature of Arctic climate change even under aggressive CDR scenarios and emphasize the need for improved representation of Arctic processes in climate models to reduce uncertainties in climate projection and mitigation strategy design."

However, most existing research tends to attribute such loss exclusively to either consumers or producers, which overlooks a more equitable perspective that integrates both parties’ responsibilities. By drawing upon welfare economics, this study allocates the biodiversity loss arising from crop trade between producers and consumers. We developed a high-resolution distribution map illustrating the allocation of export-induced biodiversity loss among consumers and producers. We also trace the origin of biodiversity loss allocated to consumers.

Harley,Temperature and stagnation effects on ozone sensitivity to NOx and VOC: an adjoint modeling study in central California,"Climate change is making heatwaves and stagnant weather more frequent, which can worsen air pollution. We studied how these extreme conditions affect the sources of summer ozone in California's Central Valley. Using a state-of-the-art modeling tool, we found that weather changes can greatly shift which, where, and when to reduce emissions for the largest air quality benefits. Our results highlight the need to account for extreme weather in designing effective air quality strategies. 
 Extreme weather events like heatwaves and stagnation are increasing with climate change. While their effects on ozone levels have been extensively studied, how extreme weather alters O3-NOx-VOC sensitivity and optimal mitigation strategies is less explored. Here, we apply the CMAQ adjoint model over central California to quantify ozone sensitivity to spatiotemporally resolved precursor emissions under three meteorological scenarios (baseline, high-T, and stagnation) and three emission years (2000, 2012, and 2022). Results show that meteorology-induced changes in sensitivity are comparable in magnitude to those from decadal emission reductions. Higher temperature (+5 °C) amplifies ozone sensitivity to both NOx and VOC, with the largest relative increase in biogenic VOC sources. High-T conditions shift ozone chemistry toward NOx limitation under a VOC-limited emission scenario, but increase the relative importance of VOC control for a NOx-limited scenario. Stagnation consistently pushes ozone chemistry toward VOC limitation across emission scenarios, increasing VOC sensitivity by a factor of ∼ 3–4. Stagnation also spatially shifts influential source areas, especially for NOx, and temporally amplifies prior-day emission impacts due to enhanced pollutant carryover. As the study domain transitions to a NOx-limited regime over time, we identify a growing subset of “climate-resilient” source targets that remain impactful across meteorological scenarios, along with spatial convergence in optimal locations for NOx and VOC emission control. These findings underscore both the need and feasibility to consider meteorological extremes in the design of ozone mitigation strategies for a warming climate."

The new estimates showed improved accuracy and coverage relative to previous estimates, but highlighted remaining uncertainty in some poorly sampled regions. The work was largely motivated by a need for accurate input data for regional ocean models. 
 Accurate and gap-free historical datasets of oceanic nutrient concentrations, dissolved oxygen, and carbonate chemistry, are needed for the analysis of anthropogenic impacts and development of predictive models, including as boundary conditions for regional ocean models. We developed low-bias, quasi-optimal 4D interpolations of observed values at latitudes >40° N, excluding Mediterranean and Black Seas, for years 1980–2020 inclusive. Our approach used output from the NorESM-OCv1.2 ocean model hindcast as a basis for kernel-smoothing bias correction and optimal interpolation of anomalies, obtaining monthly reanalysis data at NorESM grid points (30–90 km spatial resolution) and all model depth levels. Based on cross-validation tests with spatially-separated training and test subset locations, the resulting products showed equal or better out-of-sample accuracy compared to standard climatological products from the World Ocean Atlas 2023 and GLODAPv2, and also compared to existing non-climatological products from machine learning and biogeochemical reanalysis/hindcast datasets from CMEMS/Copernicus. The new products showed skill in tracking smooth seasonal and interannual variations not included in the standard climatologies, and improved spatial coverage and detail resolution in northern/Arctic regions, compared to all tested alternatives. Significant uncertainties remained, however, largely due to sparse observational coverage in seasonal and permanent ice-covered regions, and limited resolution in coastal regions.

 Publicly available datasets for oil spill detection are scarce, making it difficult to compare the performance of different detection algorithms. To address this, this paper introduces a comprehensive labeled dataset of oil slicks, look-alikes, and other remarkable oceanic phenomena, derived from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) products in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea in 2019. The dataset contains 3225 oil objects across 1365 image patches, along with an additional 2290 image patches featuring look-alikes or other phenomena. Data are available at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.980773 (Yang and Singha, 2025).This dataset enables researchers to evaluate their oil spill detection models and compare performance with other studies. To facilitate this, the performance of an oil spill detector from a previous study on the dataset is provided as a baseline. In addition, to help the researchers better understand what phenomena their object detector might be confusing with oil slicks, the image patches without oil objects were sorted into several subgroups. On the other hand, for researchers looking to apply object detection models to oil slick detection but lacking a starting dataset, this dataset can serve as a valuable training resource. Beyond dataset presentation, this paper also explains the formation of different oceanic phenomena and their SAR signatures, supported by examples and supplementary materials.

Hence, SMLs can serve as low-cost rainfall sensors complementary to conventional instruments. However, a significant challenge for opportunistic sensors, such as SMLs and their terrestrial counterpart, i.e., commercial microwave links (CMLs), stems from potential ownership issues, possibly hindering progress in the development of processing tools and validation studies. This underscores the critical need for open data. While CML open datasets are already available, there are no large SML datasets in public repositories. To fill this gap, we introduce here the OpenSat4Weather dataset, a comprehensive and openly accessible collection of data from 215 SML sensors located in Southern France, covering a five-month period from August to December 2022. The dataset is accessible at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16530166. OpenSat4Weather also includes concurrent conventional data: 6-minute rainfall depths from 113 operational rain gauges, and radar-based estimates of rainfall intensity along each SML path. The radar data are derived from the gauge-adjusted weather radar product Panthere from Météo-France. Additionally, ERA5 reanalysis data of the 0-degree isotherm height are provided for rain height estimation, which is essential for accurate conversion of the received signal level into rainfall intensity."

 As part of the European Space Agency's Climate Change Initiative the one channel US satellite microwave radiometer Nimbus-5 ESMR (N5ESMR) level 1 data have been reprocessed to estimate global sea ice concentration from 11 December 1972 to 16 May 1977.

A new methodology using locally and seasonally variable algorithm coefficients called tie points has been used to calculate the sea ice concentration in both first-year ice and multi-year ice in the Arctic and the radiometrically distinct ice types A and B in Antarctica. Validation of sea ice concentration using Arctic sea ice charts from the US National Ice Center shows an overestimation of open-water SIC of up to 20 % in some places and an underestimation of SIC in sea ice covered regions near the ice edge. Validation also shows that local dynamical tie points (LDTP) improve the mapping of sea ice concentration for different types of ice, while estimates of the extent of sea ice are identical to the previous processing of the same data in Kolbe et al. (2024). A new set of quality control (QC) filters has been developed that discards far fewer data points (57.7 % reduction) than the filters in the previous processing. The data set therefore closes significant gaps in the sea ice concentration and sea ice extent record compared to the earlier data record. Of the 1.6 billion data points recorded by the satellite, 23.0 % have been discarded. 1136 days during the 1616-day period from 1972 to 1977 are covered (at least partly), which gives estimates of the mean monthly sea ice minimum and maximum extent in the Arctic and Antarctica during this period, except for some dropouts in 1973 and 1975."

By combining existing maps with information learned from satellite images, we produced nationwide maps at 10-meter resolution from 2018 to 2021. The maps agree well with local statistics and clearly reveal shifting crop patterns. These results can support better agricultural planning, farm management, and climate-smart decisions. 
 Mapping complex cropping patterns and temporal dynamics is of great significance for addressing the challenges faced by agricultural systems. However, in China, annual nationwide maps depicting multiple crops and rotation sequences are still lacking. In this study, we developed a data-driven crop mapping framework by integrating multiple existing crop products with the Google Satellite Embeddings derived from the AlphaEarth foundation model, and produced 10-meter resolution mapping of complex cropping patterns across China from 2018 to 2021. Firstly, we integrated multiple publicly available crop mapping products within a harmonized framework that applies a unified cropland extent and cropping intensity, providing a systematic assessment of their consistency at pixel level. Consistency analysis results classify the study area into areas with consistency and areas with confusion, the latter serving as the mapping focus. Then, by combining harmonized crop data layers with random forest classifiers trained on foundation-derived embedding features, our framework effectively enhanced the spatial coherence and temporal stability, achieving an overall accuracy of 92.60 % and an F1 score of 0.7584. Compared with ADM-2 statistics, the mapped cropping areas achieved high consistency (R² = 0.849, RMSE = 4.61, MAE = 2.07).

We contribute to bridging this gap by coupling a animal population model with a vegetation and thus enable future research in this topic. 
 Animal herbivory can have large and diverse impacts on vegetation and hence on the state and function of ecosystems. Despite this, quantitative understanding of vegetation responses to consumption of green leaf tissue by herbivores is currently lacking. The large-scale impacts of changes in herbivore abundance on ecosystem function have yet to be investigated. Process-based modelling can help to quantify how animals affect important processes, such as ecosystem carbon cycling. To do so, we linked the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ-GUESS with Madingley, a model of multi-trophic functional diversity. This implementation allows us to simulate feedbacks between the availability of green vegetation biomass, herbivory and the whole trophic chain in response to monthly consumption of leaf biomass. In the coupled model system, we see an overall reduction in ecosystem productivity (NPP −5.2 %), leaf area index (−9.0 %) and carbon mass (−9.7 %), compared to the stand-alone version of LPJ-GUESS, with the highest impact on carbon mass in the boreal ecosystems (−42 %). We observe ecosystem composition to shift from boreal coniferous forests (without animals) to boreal mixed forests (with animals), as well as a general increase in herbaceous vegetation. Indirect effects like an increased light transfer facilitating growth of lower canopy layers are also captured by the model system. Overall, the results of this study underpin the important role of animals in ecosystem functioning and highlight the important contribution of process-based modelling towards a better understanding of complex food web interconnections."

Lecavalier;Kevin Hank;David Pollard,The glacial systems model (GSM) Version 25G,"We document the glacial system model (GSM), a 3D glaciological ice sheet systems model specifically designed for large ensemble modelling in glacial cycle contexts. The model is distinguished by the breadth of relevant processes represented for this context. This ranges from meltwater surface drainage with proglacial lake formation to state-of-the-art subglacial sediment production/transport/deposition. The other key distinguishing design feature is attention to addressing process uncertainties. 
 We document the glacial system model (GSM), which is designed for large ensemble ice sheet modelling in glacial cycle contexts.  A distinguishing feature is the extent to which it addresses relevant forcing and process uncertainties.  The GSM has evolved from three decades of effort to constrain the last glacial cycle evolution of each ice sheet that was present (North American, Greenlandic, Icelandic, Eurasian, Patagonian, and Antarctic, and soon Tibetan).  The core ice dynamics uses a hybrid shallow-shelf and shallow-ice approximation with full thermo-mechanical coupling. It also includes one of the largest range of relevant processes for the above context of any model to date, ranging from visco-elastic glacial isostatic adjustment with 0-order geoidal deflection to state-of-the-art subglacial sediment production, transport, and deposition. Furthermore, the GSM is to date the only model to have all of the above processes bidirectionally coupled with each other. Other relevant distinguishing features include: permafrost resolving bed-thermodynamics, a fast diagnostic solution of down-slope surface drainage and lake filling, subgrid hypsometric surface mass balance and ice flow, simple thermodynamic lake and sea ice representations, subglacial hydrology with dynamically evolving partitioning between distributed and channelized flow, and surface melt that physically accounts for insolation changes via a novel insolation above freezing scheme.To address the most challenging part of paleo ice sheet modelling, the GSM includes both a 2D energy balance climate model and variants of traditional input time series weighted interpolation (aka “glacial indexing”) of fields from General Circulation Model (GCM) simulations, all under ensemble parametric specification.  It also includes options for one and two way scripted coupling with climate models.We demonstrate the significant errors that can ensue in the glacial cycle simulation of a single ice sheet when three aspects of glacial isostatic adjustment are ignored (as is typical). These are geoidal deformation, global ice load input, and correction of initial topography for present-day isostatic disequilibrium.  We also draw attention to the relatively high sensitivity of the GSM (and presumably other ice sheet models) to the specification of the temperature dependence for basal sliding activation.The associated code archive includes configuration options for all major last glacial cycle ice sheets as well as idealized geometries and validation test setups."

We adapted the ORCHIDEE model to simulate Faidherbia albida, a tree that taps deep groundwater. This work highlights the need to integrate deep water uptake in land surface models for groundwater-dependent ecosystems, as it could enhance predictions, helping to sustain agroforestry in a changing climate. 
 The Sahel region is characterized by its semi-arid climate and open-canopy agroforestry systems, which play an important role in global carbon dynamics. Parkland agroforestry has the potential to sequester carbon at an average rate of 0.4 tC ha−1 yr−1, which, if expanded to its maximum potential extent, would correspond to an additional carbon stock of approximately 558 TgC compared to treeless croplands. However, land surface models (LSM) used in global climate modeling struggle to represent carbon dynamics in these ecosystems due to the inadequate representation of deep-roots tapping groundwater during dry periods, key environmental control for many agroforestry systems such as the widespread parklands based on the phreatophytic species Faidherbia albida. This study explores the sensitivity of Faidherbia albida parklands to tree density and water availability (rainfall and soil water content in the capillary fringe of the groundwater table) using a new configuration of the ORCHIDEE LSM. To this aim, the ORCHIDEE LSM was modified to simulate the growth of Faidherbia albida by simulating its inverted phenology based on forced temporal series of soil water content of soil layers between 4 and 5 m and water saturation below 5 m and by adjusting the photosynthesis and carbon allocation parameters for Faidherbia albida and associated crops. The model was evaluated against independent eddy covariance and meteorological data from the Niakhar agroforestry site in Senegal. Simulation outputs were analyzed in terms of leaf area index (LAI), gross primary productivity (GPP), latent heat (LE), sensible heat (H) and net radiation (Rn). The model simulated tree GPP of 4.08 ± 0.21 tC ha−1 yr−1 compared to observed GPP of 5.06 ± 0.49 tC ha−1 yr−1. For croplands, the model produced GPP of 7.97 ± 0.89 tC ha−1 yr−1 compared to observed values of 7.78 ± 1.75 tC ha−1 yr−1. Simulations revealed that tree density positively influenced annual carbon uptake but reduced crop harvest at highest tree densities, indicating a trade-off between carbon sequestration and crop yield. Sensitivity analyses showed that interannual variability in soil water content in the capillary fringe of the groundwater table and rainfall influenced differently crop, tree and ecosystem carbon and energy fluxes. Despite its strengths, the model exhibited limited responsiveness of tree productivity to soil water content variability in the capillary fringe of the groundwater table, highlighting the need for enhanced representation of water uptake by tree roots in the model. These findings emphasize the importance of accurately modeling both surface soil water and groundwater dynamics and phenology to predict the responses of semi-arid agroforestry systems to climate variability. This study enhances our understanding of carbon and energy flux partitioning in complex, water-stressed and groundwater dependent agroforestry systems."

The model includes a single-layer aquifer and is designed to capture long-term mean groundwater dynamics under varying climate types. The manuscript describes the model structure, input datasets, and evaluation against available observations. 
 Groundwater plays a critical role in regulating the global hydrological cycle and serves as the most stable freshwater resource for human daily water consumption. However, many global water models, including H08, a global water model considering human water use activities, downplay the groundwater component, i.e., the underground aquifer is often described as a simple lumped model where no lateral groundwater movement or the water table is represented. Here, we present a global H08-MODFLOW groundwater model (H08-GM), built at a five-arcmin spatial resolution, aiming to enhance the capability of the original H08 model in simulating groundwater flows. We describe the basic model setups and simulations under steady-state conditions in this paper. The Local One-At-A-Time (OAT) Sensitivity Tests are first conducted to select the best-run model simulations against in-situ observations. At the global scale, all model runs demonstrate overall good performance of groundwater head, whereas perform poorly in simulating Water Table Depth (WTD, groundwater table below land surface), which is shown to be a common issue in other global groundwater models. Our analysis also reveals two complementary global relationships: one between groundwater depth and topographic slope, and another along gradients of human activity (irrigation and population), together demonstrating how natural and anthropogenic processes jointly control the spatial distribution of WTD. We further use the model to reveal the mechanisms controlling groundwater flow dynamics and present the global cell-to-cell net groundwater lateral flow map. We found that the magnitude of the net groundwater lateral flow in some regions is non-negligible to annual groundwater recharge. This highlights the important role of the lateral groundwater flow in maintaining the regional water budget. The steady-state simulation from this study provides the necessary initial condition for the transient simulations, which is essentially important to analyze the global groundwater decline trends and will be presented in another paper. Although developed in the one-way coupled manner, the H08-GM model can provide a powerful tool for large-scale groundwater studies, which enables direct comparison with other groundwater models joined the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP), and is essential to advance the development of the next-generation global water models."

 The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 7 (CMIP7) undertook an extensive process to gather community input and refine data requests related to impacts and adaptation applications of Earth System Model (ESM) outputs. The Impacts and Adaptation (I&A) Data Request Team worked with CMIP7 leadership to distribute an open solicitation across many communities that use climate model outputs requesting inputs for new and existing variables, the most applicable temporal characteristics, and groupings of variables that together allow for specific application opportunities. This input was then collated and translated into CMIP7 standard templates for inclusion in the broader data request, leading to 13 I&A data request opportunities, 60 variable groups and 539 unique variables sought by vulnerability, impacts, adaptation, and climate services user communities. Here, we describe these opportunities and variable groups, as well as new insights into how ESM groups can prioritize outputs that set off a chain of further analyses, ultimately informing decisions impacting society and natural systems. These include an emphasis on high-resolution outputs to allow further modeling of climate impacts at regional and local scales, improved representation of extreme weather events, enhanced accuracy of downscaling and bias-adjustment techniques, and support for more detailed assessments for decision-making in adaptation and mitigation strategies. There is also broad interest in more extensive provisioning of two-dimensional variables at the Earth's surface, prioritizing experiments that enhance our understanding of both the recent past and future scenarios, and providing outputs that allow further downscaling and bias adjustment. We emphasize that variable groups are the fundamental level at which to engage with the I&A data request, matching the scale of input and the way output provision enables specific I&A applications. Given resource constraints, we applaud CMIP7 efforts to foster strong engagement and communication between ESM groups and the I&A team to build consensus around prudent compromises in priority variables, temporal resolutions, simulation experiments, time subsets, and ensemble members."

 The Sargasso Sea, at the centre of the North Atlantic subtropical gyre, draws its name from the endemic floating brown macroalgae, Sargassum, which provides shelter and habitat for life in the pelagic zone. In 2011, the Sargassum footprint expanded to include the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt in the tropical Atlantic, but little is known about how Sargassum in the Sargasso Sea changed thereafter. Here we use satellite and in situ data to show that Sargassum in the north Sargasso Sea has declined dramatically since 2015. Accompanying this decline is a disruption in local Sargassum seasonal growth cycles, whereby the previously consistent fall-to-winter north Sargasso Sea biomass maxima have shifted to spring-to-summer peaks that mirror those of the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt—a result of advection from this latter region. We posit that the north Sargasso Sea decline is due to reduced Sargassum supply from a historical Gulf of Mexico source region, possibly attributable to increasing sea surface temperatures and more frequent marine heatwaves in the Gulf of Mexico. Together, proliferation in the Great Atlantic Sargassum Belt and decline in the north Sargasso Sea may represent the beginnings of a regime shift in Sargassum distribution.

 The Great Oxidation Event across the Archaean–Proterozoic transition was one of the most transformative environmental changes in Earth history. However, uncertainties remain about when and where it began. Here we synthesize the phylogenetic record of cyanobacteria and geochemical records of nitrogen and thallium isotopes and find converging evidence for oxygenated bottom waters on marine shelves in the Neoarchaean about 200 million years before the Great Oxidation Event. The O2 was produced by benthic microbial mats, the dominant morphotypes of cyanobacteria at that time. Conditions were sufficiently oxidizing to stabilize nitrate and manganese oxides in sediments. Box modelling shows that micromolar levels of dissolved O2 were attainable in this scenario under plausible Archaean conditions. The rise of O2 was initiated on marine mud according to our synthesis. Productive Neoarchaean shelves may have been more oxidizing at the bottom than the top, consistent with the ‘upside down’ Archaean biosphere hypothesis.

 DNA G-quadruplexes (G4s), formed by guanine-rich sequences in mammalian genomes, are non-canonical structures implicated in gene regulation. However, their strand-specific genomic distribution and mechanistic roles in transcription remain poorly understood. Here, we report a strand-specific G4 sequencing (ssG4-seq) method for global profiling of G4 structures across multiple mammalian genomes. This method faithfully recapitulates known G4 structures and identifies thousands of previously unannotated G4s in human K562 cells. Remarkably, over 95% of G4s are located at enhancers and promoters across species, with promoters containing dual-strand G4s exhibiting significantly stronger transcriptional activation compared to those with single-strand G4s. Mechanistically, we identify SP1 as a potent G4 reader that facilitates transcription by modulating enhancer-promoter chromatin looping. Furthermore, we demonstrate that cancer-associated mutations can destabilize G4 structures, impair SP1-mediated chromatin interactions, and contribute to tumorigenesis. Our study demonstrates the power of ssG4-seq in elucidating G4 functions in gene regulation and disease. DNA G-quadruplexes help regulate genes, but their strand-specific roles are unclear.

The study shows that PGK1-serine axis regulates and drives aging and damage of podocytes. 
 Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major health issue, with podocyte injury with senescence playing a central role in glomerulosclerosis. This study investigates the link between glycolysis-derived serine metabolism and podocyte injury with senescence, focusing on the role of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) in the regulation of L-serine synthesis and podocyte homeostasis. Using in vivo and in vitro models, we examined the effects of angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced metabolic dysregulation on serine metabolism and its impact on podocyte function. The results demonstrate that Ang II downregulates PGK1 expression through the transcription factor FOXA1, leading to reduced L-serine biosynthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and increased cellular senescence in podocytes. Supplementing with L-serine or enhancing PGK1 expression in podocytes alleviated these pathological changes, restored mitochondrial function, and reduced senescence-associated phenotypes in CKD mouse models. Moreover, PGK1 was found to interact with keratin, type II cytoskeletal 1 (KRT1), stabilizing the cytoskeletal integrity of podocytes. These findings identify a novel metabolic pathway linking glycolysis, serine metabolism, and podocyte injury with senescence, suggesting that targeting the PGK1-serine axis may offer therapeutic potential for slowing podocyte senescence and CKD progression.

 Combinatorial optimization underpins applications in artificial intelligence, logistics, and network design, yet classical techniques such as greedy search and dynamic programming struggle to balance efficiency and solution quality at scale. We present a probabilistic framework that embeds true random number generators based on spin-transfer-torque magnetic tunnel junctions into a greedy solver. Intrinsic stochastic switching enables configurable random number distributions, which we use to inject controlled randomness via a temperature parameter that interpolates between deterministic and stochastic choices, balancing exploration and exploitation. Applied to the traveling salesman problem, the framework yields high-quality tours and outperforms simulated annealing and genetic algorithms in solution quality and convergence speed. In larger instances with up to 70 cities, it maintains its advantage, reaching near-optimal solutions with fewer iterations and reduced computational cost. These results show that hardware true randomness with tunable statistics can improve heuristic search and motivate integrated, energy-efficient probabilistic hardware for scalable optimization.

 Aqueous zinc metal batteries often encounter uncontrollable failure or performance decay under thermal environments, primarily due to the severe side reactions caused by aqueous electrolytes. Here, an organic-inorganic-H2O multiphase aqueous soggy sand electrolyte is reported to enhance high-temperature performance of aqueous zinc metal batteries. Soggy sand components form strong interactions between the heterogeneous phases, reconstructing hydrogen-bond networks and forming water-deficient solvation structures, which greatly limits water activity and improves thermal stability, eliminating parasitic reactions and inspiring a uniform Zn deposition at elevated temperatures. As a result, multiphase aqueous soggy sand electrolyte enables aqueous zinc metal batteries to achieve an operating temperature of 140 °C, a lifespan of 1700 cycles, and a current density of 8 A g−1. More importantly, the application of this electrolyte allows the stable cycling of Zn metal pouch cells under continuous operation at elevated temperatures.

This study reveals its influence on over half of the global vegetated area resilience and identifies future hotspots of ecosystem vulnerability. 
 A thorough understanding of vegetation resilience to climate variability is critical for sustaining ecosystem functions and terrestrial carbon sinks. Although the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is a key driver of global extreme weather events and vegetation dynamics, its impacts on vegetation resilience remain unclear. Here we estimate global present-day (1981–2018) and future (2015–2100) vegetation resilience using a lag-1 autocorrelation analysis of global leaf area index (LAI) time series and investigate its teleconnection to ENSO. Our findings reveal that ENSO significantly affects vegetation resilience across 53% of the global vegetated area. Within these regions, 15% are linked primarily to large-scale atmospheric synchrony with ENSO, 51% are mainly shaped by ENSO-driven local climate anomalies, and the remaining 34% are influenced by both processes. Future projections suggest that the area impacted via ENSO-driven climate anomalies may expand by 7-10%, with Eastern Siberia and northern North America newly affected. Our study provides a coherent global assessment of vegetation resilience sensitivity to ENSO, identifies teleconnected hotspots and potential influential pathways, and informs targeted restoration and climate-adaptive ecosystem governance under climate change.

Here, authors introduce a urea-based hydrotrope to create a high-concentration ferrous sulfate electrolyte, enabling stable, dendrite-free cycling and advancing cost-effective, sustainable energy storage. 
 Iron metal-based energy storage devices hold great potential in stationary grid-scale sustainable energy due to the high theoretical specific capacity, ultralow cost, and abundance of iron. However, their practical deployment is limited by the poor reversibility of iron plating and stripping, as well as competitive hydrogen evolution. Here we introduce the concept of hydrotropy into iron electrolytes by developing an environmentally friendly and cost-effective high-concentration ferrous sulfate electrolyte using urea as a hydrotropic agent. The designed electrolyte increases the Coulombic efficiency of iron metal electrodes to approximately 96.5%, compared with ~84.6% for the dilute electrolyte. Molecular dynamics simulations and Raman spectroscopy illustrate that urea regulates the competitive coordination of anions and urea in the iron solvation sheath, while reconstructing the hydrogen-bond network in free water molecules. This reduces the activity of both solvated and free water, thereby alleviating hydrogen evolution. Moreover, the coordinated anions and urea molecules facilitate the in-situ formation of an organic-inorganic hybrid protective layer on the metallic iron, establishing a physical barrier against water and promoting homogeneous interfacial reactions. This work demonstrates an appealing opportunity to design cost-effective and high-performance electrolytes and propels the practical application of iron metal-based energy storage devices.

 Accurate prediction of biomolecular complex structures is fundamental for understanding biological processes and rational therapeutic design. Recent advances in deep learning methods, particularly all-atom structure prediction models, have significantly expanded their capabilities to include diverse biomolecular entities, such as proteins, nucleic acids, ligands, and ions. However, comprehensive benchmarks covering multiple interaction types and molecular diversity remain scarce, limiting fair and rigorous assessment of model performance and generalizability. To address this gap, we introduce FoldBench, an extensive benchmark dataset consisting of 1522 biological assemblies categorized into nine distinct prediction tasks. Our evaluations reveal critical performance dependencies, showing that ligand docking accuracy notably diminishes as ligand similarity to the training set decreases, a pattern similarly observed in protein-protein interaction modeling. Furthermore, antibody-antigen predictions remain particularly challenging, with current methods exhibiting failure rates exceeding 50%. Among evaluated models, AlphaFold 3 consistently demonstrates superior accuracy across the majority of tasks. In summary, our results highlight significant advancements yet reveal persistent limitations within the field, providing crucial insights and benchmarks to inform future model development and refinement.

May,Rift linkage and inheritance determine collisional mountain belt evolution,"Using 3D numerical models, this research shows how pre-existing rift basin structures influence the shape and growth of mountain belts, offering a way to link surface topography with deep Earth processes in regions like the Pyrenees and Caucasus. 
 Many mountain belts - such as the Pyrenees, European Alps, Greater Caucasus, or Atlas - form through inversion of pre-collisional extensional basins. These orogens exhibit three-dimensional complexity, with along-strike variations in topography, orientation, and deformation patterns. Yet, the relationship between these characteristics and the inherited extensional architecture remains enigmatic. Here, we use 3D geodynamic models coupled to a landscape evolution model to investigate how pre-collisional rift-linkage controls rift inversion and mountain belt evolution. Our results show that initial mountain belt structure reflects the inherited basin geometry, while later growth is governed by subduction polarity. This polarity depends on the magnitude of basin offset and the presence of pre-existing structural weaknesses. Comparison with natural examples suggests that along-strike variations observed in the Greater Caucasus, Atlas, and Pyrenees can be explained by the inversion of segmented and offset rift basins.

 Most contemporary chemical processes rely on non-renewable resources and reagents associated with negative impact on environment and human health. As a result, the safe-and-sustainable-by-design (SSbD) framework is launched to guide the innovation towards safe and sustainable materials and chemical products. Bisphenol A (BPA) is a widely used chemical in the production of plastics but known to activate oestrogen receptors and linked by numerous studies to adverse effects on both human health and the environment. Here we demonstrate how SSbD can lead a multidisciplinary study for the identification of non-oestrogenic BPA analogues suitable for incorporation into high-performance polymeric materials. Toxicological evaluation of a library of 172 bisphenols using an in silico model identified 20 promising candidates that are synthesized from renewable lignin-sourced feedstocks via benign dehydrative catalytic routes. Subsequent in vitro assessment of their oestrogen receptor activity identifies bisguaiacol F as optimal BPA analogue, which is incorporated into a polyester with attractive thermal stability and flexibility.

The authors use ionic liquids to construct molecular bridges between the catalyst’s active sites and the reactants, thereby enhancing urea production. 
 The electrochemical co-reduction of abundant carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrates (NO3−) offers a more sustainable strategy for synthesizing urea, which is a critical nitrogen source for fertilizers. However, constrained proton-coupled electron transfer and limited opportunity for C–N coupling lead to a low urea production rate. In this work, we incorporated ionic liquid and copper [Cu(II)] into the zeolitic imidazolate framework-8 to create the IL@Cu-ZIF-8 catalyst. The as-prepared catalyst demonstrates excellent performance for the co-reduction of CO2 and NO3− to urea. At −0.5 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode, the production rate of urea can reach 140 μmol h−1 cm−2 (~42,000 mg h−1 gcat−1), with a Faradaic efficiency toward urea of 55.3%. A total of 0.53 g of pure urea was generated over a 25-cm2 IL@Cu-ZIF-8 electrode after 5 h of electrolysis. Mechanism studies show that ionic liquid within the catalyst acts as a molecular bridge, linking the active centres of the catalyst and reactants through versatile interactions, which increases the concentration of surface reactants and reduces the proton-coupled electron transfer barrier, thereby promoting C–N coupling for urea synthesis. This work introduces an efficient strategy for urea electrosynthesis with a high production rate, representing a significant step toward scalable electrochemical synthesis of nitrogen-containing compounds.

Here this work shows an organic formulation that is non-corrosive and delivers better performance, opening vast chemical space for electrolyte design. 
 The transition to clean energy necessitates the development of alternative or complementary battery chemistries to lithium-ion batteries. Aluminium (Al) metal batteries (AMBs) are a promising option owing to their high energy density and advantages in terms of abundance, recyclability, manufacturability and sustainability. However, state-of-the-art AMBs rely primarily on electrolytes featuring chloroaluminate anions such as Al2Cl7−. Unfortunately, such electrolytes create a disparity between achievable energy density and potential, in addition to having high corrosivity, high cost, high viscosity and poor transport kinetics. Here we break this paradigm by formulating an organochloro electrolyte with AlCl3 salt in dipropyl ether (DPE) solvent. Notably, this AlCl3/DPE electrolyte shows no corrosion behaviour towards stainless steel current collectors during 90-day soaking. It enables stable cycling of the Al anode for over 2,000 h at 0.2 mA cm−2 and a high Coulombic efficiency of 99.85%, and prototype Al//Mo6S8 full cells survive 300 cycles. Underlying these unprecedented performances is the unique organochloro solvation structure, AlCl2(DPE)2+, which is desolvatable and immobilizes free Cl−. By extending the horizon of electrolyte design into the organic domain, this work addresses the notorious issues facing AMBs and paves the way for the implementation of multivalent rechargeable batteries. Despite various advantages of aluminium batteries, their application is hindered by the use of ionic liquid electrolytes.

The location accuracy near the ground surface reached ~30 m, taking high-speed video observations as reference. DAS provides an acoustic imprint of lightning polarity asymmetry.

 Previous studies using an emergent constraint have suggested that climate models underestimate the winter jet stream response to sea ice loss, casting doubt on the quality of mid-latitude climate projections. However, the robustness of this emergent constraint has been questioned. Here, we propose a more robust emergent constraint based on lower stratospheric winds. Using coordinated sea ice loss experiments with bespoke versions of two state-of-the-art climate models along with a multi-model archive, we identify a strong relationship between these winds and the jet stream response. The new emergent constraint reduces the uncertainty in the response by 62% and indicates that the real-world response closely matches the multi-model mean—suggesting no systematic underestimation, in contrast to earlier studies. Our results underscore the importance of reducing lower stratospheric wind biases and increase confidence in climate model projections of a future poleward shift of the jet stream in response to global warming."

 Human activities are expected to delay the next glacial inception because of the long atmospheric lifetime of anthropogenic CO2. Here we present Earth system model simulations for the next 200,000 years with dynamic ice sheets and interactive atmospheric CO2, exploring how emissions will impact a future glacial inception. Historical emissions (500 PgC) are unlikely to delay inception, expected to occur under natural conditions around 50,000 years from now, while a doubling of current emissions (1000 PgC) would delay inception for another 50,000 years. Inception is generally expected within the next 200,000 years for emissions up to 5000 PgC.

 Billions of birds have adapted to traveling life, with the atmosphere playing an essential role in their migration. In Asia, monsoons represent a dominant large-scale circulation that may shape migration along the East Asia-Australasian Flyway. Here we combined satellite tracking of three migratory shorebirds, including Chinese egrets (Egretta eulophotes), Vega gulls (Larus vegae), and pied avocets (Recurvirostra avosetta), with analyses of monsoon index to examine how wind influence migration. We estimated flight speeds, energy use and atmosphere circulation patterns to assess the contribution of monsoon winds. The results reveal that monsoon provides substantial support to migratory shorebirds, enhancing flight speeds and reducing energetic costs, and the initiation of migration is associated with synchronous changes in monsoons systems. We suggest the monsoon creates continuous wind fields, and forms wind expressways for migratory birds in East Asia.

 The Main Marmara Fault (MMF), a major strand of the North Anatolian Fault beneath the Sea of Marmara, includes a 150 km locked segment that poses a critical seismic risk to İstanbul, a megacity of over 15 million people. Although significant progress has been made in characterizing rupture segmentation along the MMF, the underlying physical controls remain poorly understood. Here, we use seismic cycle simulations to explore the influence of along-strike variations in sediment thickness and temperature on earthquake rupture and recurrence behavior. We construct a three-dimensional rheological model by integrating regional heat flow and laboratory-derived frictional properties for basement rocks and basin sediments. The simulations reproduce key features of the historical seismic record, including the 1766 and 1912 M > 7 earthquakes. A rheological barrier in the Central Basin segment associated with the thick sedimentary cover and a regional thermal anomaly restricts earthquake size and the multiple fault bends influence epicentral locations. Over 10,000 years of simulated seismic cycles, earthquakes do not exceed M 7.3. Earthquake hazard in the Marmara region is controlled by the interaction between fault geometry and rheology, underscoring the need for integrated structural, thermal, and lithological models in seismic hazard assessment.

 Instability at volcanic edifices poses significant hazards, yet the processes driving rock weakening, particularly on steep, eroding flanks, remain poorly understood due to limited accessibility. Hydrothermal alteration is a key factor in weakening volcanic rocks, contributing to edifice destabilization and flank instability. La Fossa cone (Vulcano, Italy) provides an ideal setting for this study, with accessible hydrothermal alteration at the crater rim and similar alteration along inaccessible flanks that have a recent history of mass wasting. Here, we developed an integrated methodology combining drone photogrammetry with in situ Schmidt hammer testing to derive an empirical alteration-to-strength relationship for the crater rim and applied this knowledge to alteration sites on inaccessible flanks. An alteration map was generated using a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to aid our classifications. This map was used to transpose over 1000 Schmidt hammer measurements (R-values ranging from 10.5 to 82), creating a thematic strength-alteration map. Results indicate a ~50% reduction in relative rock strength correlating with areas of degassing and hydrothermal activity, which coincides with past mass-wasting events.

 The first wave of the second plague pandemic, the Black Death, claimed much of Europe’s human population in just a few years after 1347 CE. While it is accepted that the causative bacterium Yersinia pestis originated from wildlife rodent populations in central Asia and reached Europe via the Black Sea region, reasons for the timing, spread and virulence of the onset of the Black Death are still debated. Here, we argue that a post-volcanic climate downturn and trans-Mediterranean famine from 1345–1347 CE forced the Italian maritime republics of Venice, Genoa and Pisa to activate their well-established supply network and import grain from the Mongols of the Golden Horde around the Sea of Azov in 1347 CE. This climate-driven change in long-distance grain trade not only prevented large parts of Italy from starvation but also introduced the plague bacterium to Mediterranean harbours and fueled its rapid dispersal across much of Europe.

Translating how these changes impact communities and ecosystems requires time-varying data of Global Surface Water Extents (GSWE). Traditionally, GSWE mapping has been limited to static estimates, with recent efforts focusing on annual averages, frequency and occurrence of long-term variations. Building upon these foundational capabilities, we harnessed remotely sensed Sentinel-2 based near real-time Dynamic World (DW) land cover products to produce the first-of-its-kind 10 m resolution GSWE dataset representing 2015–2023. Our dataset estimated 2.5 million km2 of permanent waters and 8 million km2 of seasonal waters worldwide. Comparing our Sentinel-2 based data to contemporary Landsat-based GSWE, we observed that our data mapped less water within the >50% probability of occurrence range, suggesting a lower presence of open permanent water especially in high latitudes, deviating from what we previously learnt from Landsat data. Statistical analysis compared to well-established observational products and widely used GSWE datasets across some of the world’s most ecologically significant regions, including Pantanal in South America and Haor in South Asia, supports the overall physical realism of our data in predicting global open surface water dynamics. Our key contribution is a prototype Open Science operational framework that extracts routinely available DW products, runs geospatial analytics, and creates actionable water information for educators, researchers, and stakeholders at any scale of practical interest. We present examples of this operational capability through instant mapping of flood in Spain and drought in Lake Urmia, Central Asia, frequent monitoring of river extent changes at the Ganges–Brahmaputra confluence, and above all, interoperability with other existing GSWE applications."

The effectiveness of existing EU policies aimed at mitigating nutrient pollution will be influenced by the combined impact of climate variability and change. It remains uncertain whether current policies will suffice to reduce nutrient pollution to levels compatible with good environmental conditions in freshwaters and coastal waters. This study quantifies nitrogen and phosphorus fluxes in European freshwater systems and their delivery to the sea, considering the effects of existing EU policies and climate change up to 2050. Using the GREEN model, we simulated total nitrogen and phosphorus loads from 1990 to 2021 and projected future changes until 2050 using climate projections from 11 regional climate models (EURO-CORDEX) under the RCP 4.5 scenario. Our results indicate that implementing current EU policies—Common Agricultural Policy, Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive, FitFor55 package for climate neutrality—will reduce nutrient loads to European seas by 2050, with a 10% decrease in nitrogen and 8% decrease in phosphorus loads compared to 2020 values, albeit with significant uncertainty related to climate variability. Regional differences are also explored. Nutrient concentrations in the EU river network are expected to decrease slightly, as well as the potential risk for coastal eutrophication (ICEP index). However, further reductions of 10%–20% beyond existing policies may be necessary to achieve good conditions in large rivers. These reductions could come from improved agricultural practices, nature-based solutions and wetland restoration. Our study suggests that while current measures will lead to improvements by 2050, additional efforts will be required in some regions to achieve good environmental conditions, highlighting the need for integrated nutrient management to avoid imbalances between nitrogen and phosphorus in receiving waters."

However, as drought-heatwave combined events become more prevalent, cooling efforts may be compromised by water-saving strategies. This paper considers the heat implications of restricting irrigation and aims to further understanding of how water-saving and cooling objectives compete. Using ecohydrological modelling, validated for Melbourne, Australia, five irrigation scenarios were simulated over 10 years. To determine the level of heat stress under the five irrigation scenarios, the ecohydrological model, Urban Tethys-Chloris (UT&amp;C), simulated temperatures and thermal stress in a Melbourne street. Results predict that heat stress is reduced with increasing irrigation amount. Every 1.5 mm of additional irrigation each week (up to 28 mm wk−1) is predicted to reduce the number of heat stress days (where maximum Universal Thermal Climate Index (UTCI) > 32 °C) at the study site by one per year, with irrigation most effective at cooling when air temperatures are the hottest. The number of days with a mean air temperature over 28 °C is predicted to increase by 15% and 20%, respectively, if irrigation is restricted or stopped entirely. Therefore, ensuring the maintenance of irrigation during hot periods may prevent deaths. Our results suggest that the amount of irrigation required to decrease the mean air temperature by 1 °C is approximately 7 mm d−1 for oceanic climates, consistent with predictions in previous studies. We also predict the effect of irrigation amount on the number of heat stress days (UTCI > 32 °C). This relationship is important in understanding and communicating the impacts of water restrictions on urban heat. Furthermore, innovative urban planning and design, including onsite alternative water sources for irrigation, may enable irrigation for cooling, without exascerbating water stress."

Yet, how weather disasters already affect the peoples of Amazonia remains understudied. To quantify regional impacts, we compiled and analyzed reports on weather disaster category, frequency, human, and economic impacts from 2013 to 2023 across five Amazonian countries. We counted 12 541 disaster reports, affecting up to >3 million Amazonians and >100 000 pieces of public infrastructure in a single year. There were disproportionate concentrations of landslides in the Amazon-Andes of Ecuador, and fires associated with agricultural management and sometimes land grabbing in the Orinoco-Amazon ecotone of Colombia and along the southern Arc of Deforestation of Bolivia and Brazil. We argue that weather disaster impacts in the Amazon are underreported because: (1) data from four Amazonian countries could not be obtained, (2) cross-country reporting was not standardized and (3) it varied such that virtually all heatwave and most drought data came from Brazil, despite published evidence that both disaster types are present throughout the region. Disaster impacts are already significant, underscoring the need for transboundary policies on land use, local adaptation strategies for communities and infrastructure, and coordinated regional efforts to share and update weather disaster management plans. Developing consistent, accessible, and interoperable datasets across the region is fundamental to building a comprehensive understanding of weather-related disasters in the Amazon and to informing effective public policies that strengthen prevention, response, and adaptation efforts.

A large number of sub-3 nm particles and naturally charged ions were present in the Amazonia boundary layer, and they showed a clear diurnal variation. The research will contribute to a better understanding of atmospheric processes in the pristine environment. 
 The Amazon rainforest is a unique environment to investigate aerosol properties with limited impact from human activities, further providing a new perspective to look at the aerosol characteristics in regions heavily affected by anthropogenic emissions. Obtaining the size distributions of nucleation mode particles in the atmosphere is key to understanding aerosol formation, evolution and their impacts. Although routine and long-term aerosol measurements have been conducted in the Amazon region, information regarding sub-10 nm particles is still limited. In this study, we performed aerosol measurements from December 2022 to January 2023 on a 54 m high platform of the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO). Three advanced instruments namely the Nano Condensation Nuclei Counter (nCNC), the Neutral Cluster and Air Ion Spectrometer (NAIS), and the Nano-Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS), were employed to measure the number size distributions of aerosol particles and naturally charged ions smaller than 40 nm. The results reveal that the median total number concentration of the measured particles with diameters ranging from 1.5–1000 nm was 969 cm−3. We found a large number of particles smaller than 3.5 nm, which accounted for up to 59 % of the measured total number concentration. There was a significant increase in the number concentration of sub-3 nm particles in January 2023 (median, 573 cm−3) compared to December 2022 (371 cm−3). The median number concentration of particles above 3.5 nm in December and January were 481 and 335 cm−3, respectively. No typical regional new particle formation events were observed throughout the measurement period. However, clear diurnal variations were observed for the sub-3 nm particles under pristine conditions, with the maximum concentration around noontime. Similar diurnal patterns were also observed for natural cluster ions (0.8–2 nm), with their concentration in January slightly higher than in December. Quantifying the properties of the aerosol particles in the Amazon rainforest helps to understand the processes governing the aerosol budget in the pristine atmosphere, and is essential for determining the impact of anthropogenic aerosols on climate."

First, a rice training dataset comprising 155 images was created. Then, we developed the annual result enhancement (ARE) method to diminish the impact of the limited training sample. In comparison to traditional rice mapping methods, the accuracy of results obtained using the ARE method is significantly improved. 
 Northeast China, a significant production base for paddy rice, has received lots of attention in crop mapping. However, understanding the spatiotemporal dynamics of paddy rice expansion in this region remains limited, making it difficult to track the changes in paddy rice planting over time. For the first time, this study utilized multi-sensor Landsat data and a deep learning model, the full resolution network (FR-Net), to explore the annual mapping of paddy rice for Northeast China from 1985 to 2023 (available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27604839.v1, Zhang et al., 2024). First, a cross-sensor paddy training dataset comprising 155 Landsat images was created to map the paddy rice. Then, we developed the annual result enhancement (ARE) method, which considers the differences in category probability of FR-Net at different stages to diminish the impact of the limited training sample in large-scale and across-sensor paddy rice mapping. ARE integrates differences in category probability and confidence levels of the FR-Net across phenological stages, effectively reducing classification uncertainty. This approach could mitigate the impact of limited training sample on large-scale and across-sensor paddy rice mapping. The accuracy of the paddy rice dataset was evaluated using 107 954 ground truth samples. In comparison to traditional rice mapping methods, the results obtained using the ARE method showed a 5 % increase in the F1 score. The overall mapping result obtained from the FR-Net model and ARE methods achieved high average values of user accuracy (UA) of paddy, producer accuracy (PA) of paddy, overall accuracy (OA), F1 score, and Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 0.93, 0.91, 0.91, 0.92, and 0.82, respectively. The study revealed that the area used for paddy rice cultivation in Northeast China increased from 1.11 × 104 to 6.45 × 104 km2 between 1985 to 2023. Between 1985 and 2023, there was an overall expansion of 5.34 × 104 km2 in the paddy rice cultivation area, with the highest growth (4.33 × 104 km2) occurring in Heilongjiang province. This study shows that long-history crop mapping could be achieved with deep learning, and the result of paddy rice will be beneficial for making timely adjustments to cultivation patterns and ensuring food security."

Existing tools lack integrated workflows. We developed UpsFrac, an open-source software that integrates fracture modeling and permeability upscaling. It handles complex fracture patterns and rock properties. The software enables uncertainty quantification, helping scientists make accurate and efficient predictions for groundwater protection and renewable energy development. 
 The efficient and accurate simulation of fluid flow and heat transport underground plays an important role in groundwater migration and geothermal resource prediction. Rock fractures are complex in geological settings, exhibiting multiple-scale properties with varied patterns under different geological conditions. Modelling and upscaling the permeability of fractured porous rocks are both important and sophisticated processes in numerical simulations. While existing tools like MRST offer upscaling capabilities, they often lack integrated workflows for automated uncertainty quantification and direct coupling between fractal-based DFM generation and flow-based upscaling within a single framework. In this study, we propose an integrated methodology for modelling and upscaling the permeability of fractured porous rocks and develop an open-source software, UpsFrac, to implement this approach. The software considers complex fracture geometries in discrete fracture models (DFM) that are created deterministically and stochastically. UpsFrac employs conforming grid-based DFM with explicit matrix-fracture coupling, ensuring higher accuracy for complex fracture networks. The software can characterize the complexity of fractured porous rocks, including power law (fractal) length distribution, correlations between fracture length and aperture, and the effects of rock matrix properties. The state-of-the-art upscaling method, the multiple-boundary fracture upscaling (MFU) method, is applied to calculate equivalent fracture permeability, which links the fine-scale discrete fracture model to the coarse-scale equivalent fracture model. The current implementation is 2D and MATLAB-based, built upon fracture modelling code ADFNE and reservoir simulation code MRST, which can easily run DFM ensembles for uncertainty analysis. The code is available in open repositories to encourage modelling and upscaling of complex fractured porous rocks, allowing users to develop their own routines within the current framework and benefiting a broader community."

 There is great public concern about the potential use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) for political persuasion and the resulting impacts on elections and democracy1–6. We inform these concerns using pre-registered experiments to assess the ability of large language models to influence voter attitudes. In the context of the 2024 US presidential election, the 2025 Canadian federal election and the 2025 Polish presidential election, we assigned participants randomly to have a conversation with an AI model that advocated for one of the top two candidates. We observed significant treatment effects on candidate preference that are larger than typically observed from traditional video advertisements7–9. We also document large persuasion effects on Massachusetts residents’ support for a ballot measure legalizing psychedelics. Examining the persuasion strategies9 used by the models indicates that they persuade with relevant facts and evidence, rather than using sophisticated psychological persuasion techniques. Not all facts and evidence presented, however, were accurate; across all three countries, the AI models advocating for candidates on the political right made more inaccurate claims. Together, these findings highlight the potential for AI to influence voters and the important role it might play in future elections.

 Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains highly lethal due to its aggressive nature and limited treatment options, with the efficacy of immunotherapy constrained by a uniquely immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). In this study, we identify TNK2/ACK1 as a key regulator of the immunosuppressive TME in PDAC. TNK2/ACK1 is significantly upregulated in PDAC, at least in part via gene amplification and KRAS-G12 mutations. Mechanistically, TNK2/ACK1 directly phosphorylates and activates STAT5A to induce the expression of the immune checkpoint HVEM, which suppresses CD8⁺ T-cell function via its receptor BTLA. Pharmacologic targeting of TNK2/ACK1 with AIM100 or (R)−9b enhances CD8⁺ T-cell activation and cytotoxicity while reprogramming the TME. Furthermore, combining TNK2/ACK1 inhibitors with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy or with nab-paclitaxel plus gemcitabine demonstrates promising antitumor efficacy in both allograft and spontaneous PDAC models. Overall, our findings reveal a mechanism of immune evasion and provide a potential framework for developing tailored immunotherapeutic strategies in PDAC.

 Quasiparticles describe collective excitations in many-body systems, and their symmetry classification is of fundamental importance for physical processes such as excited states, transport phenomena, and phase transitions. Recent studies have introduced chirality as an additional degree of freedom in condensed matter physics, leading to a range of novel phenomena. Among these, chiral phonons are of special interest because they carry angular momentum and therefore intrinsically break time reversal symmetry, which non-trivially bridges the spin system with the lattice. Here, we directly prove the presence of chiral phonons in a prototypical polar LiNbO3 crystal. Our demonstration of chiral phonons in a ferroelectric enables in-situ electrical control of momentum-dependent “magnetic” polarization with the reversible phonon handedness. This ferroic control of phonon chirality has substantial potential in the emerging field of chiral phononics, particularly along the associated control of its phonon angular momentum.

Here, the authors develop a bone-targeted nanoparticle that selectively eliminates osteoclasts and generates pro-regenerative apoptotic bodies, restoring bone density and treating osteoporosis. 
 Osteoporosis therapies remain limited by non-specific osteoclast inhibition, which disrupts physiological bone remodeling and increases fracture risk. Here we show that selectively targeting mature osteoclasts via enzyme-responsive nanoparticles could eliminate pathological bone resorption while generating apoptotic bodies (ABs) to promote regeneration. We design OsteoSAVE, a peptide-based nanoparticle integrating a cathepsin K (CTSK)-cleavable linker, a bone-targeting motif, and a self-assembling biphenyl core. Upon CTSK-mediated hydrolysis, OsteoSAVE transforms into nanofibers within osteoclast lysosomes, inducing apoptosis and releasing ABs enriched with PDGF-BB. Mechanistic studies confirm CTSK-selective cleavage and charge-driven cellular specificity. In ovariectomized mice, OsteoSAVE restores bone density by coupling osteoclast elimination with ABs-mediated osteogenesis via PI3K/AKT activation in mesenchymal stem cells. This work establishes enzyme-triggered supramolecular self-assembly as a paradigm for dual-action therapies that recalibrate bone homeostasis without disrupting physiological processes.

 Connexin-32 (Cx32) gap junction channels (GJCs) mediate intercellular coupling in various tissues, including myelinating Schwann cells. Mutations in Cx32, such as W3S, are associated with X-linked Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT1X) disease. Lipids regulate Cx32 GJC permeation, although the regulatory mechanism is unclear. Here, we determine the cryo-EM structures of Cx32 GJCs reconstituted in nanodiscs, revealing that phospholipids block the Cx32 GJC pore by binding to the site formed by N-terminal gating helices. The phospholipid-bound state is contingent on the presence of a sterol molecule in a hydrophobic pocket formed by the N-terminus: the N-terminal helix of Cx32 fails to sustain a phospholipid binding site in the absence of cholesterol hemisuccinate. The CMT1X-linked W3S mutant which has an impaired sterol binding site adopts a conformation of the N-terminus incompatible with phospholipid binding. Our results indicate that different lipid species control connexin channel gating directly by influencing the conformation of the N-terminal gating helix.

Subtype-specific patterns of activation dynamics are revealed that indicate underlying physical constraints on HA adaptation. 
 Increase in human H5N1 spillover infections resulting from dissemination of highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) virus into bird and mammal populations raises concerns about HPAI gaining human transmissibility. Studies identified hemagglutinin (HA) acid stability and receptor preference as essential traits that shape host tropism. Mutations that increase HA stability and affinity for α−2,6-linked sialic acids have been shown to confer airborne transmissibility in a ferret model, however mechanisms of activation of H5 subtype HA are poorly understood and the effect of adaptive mutations on HA function has been largely inferred from static structures. Here, we use hydrogen/deuterium-exchange mass spectrometry to dissect activation dynamics for two ancestral H5 HPAI HA, their transmission-adapted HA, and a contemporary HA. We identify variation in receptor binding site flexibility and demonstrate that adaptive mutations result in suppression of fusion peptide dynamics and stabilization of a key interface involved in activation. The contemporary H5 isolated from a spillover event exhibits a relatively protected fusion peptide and moderately depressed activation pH compared to ancestral HAs. Our studies of activation dynamics in H5 together with analysis of H1 and H3 HAs reveal subtype-specific patterns that correlate with mutation sites and indicate underlying physical constraints on influenza HA adaptation.

Here, the authors report on the dynamic chemistry of hexahydrotriazine units to develop recyclable aerogels. 
 Organic aerogels have emerged as promising materials for advanced thermal insulation. However, their chemically robust covalent networks pose a major barrier for effective recycling. Introducing specific chemical bonds into the aerogel scaffold that enable on-demand reversibility offers a viable pathway to enhance recyclability and promote the sustainable use of these materials. In this work, we demonstrate that hexahydrotriazine (HT) units undergo nucleophilic attack by amines and engage in metathesis reactions, fundamentally redefining their reactive behaviors. Based on this, we introduce a waste-minimized, closed-loop chemical recycling process for highly porous, thermally superinsulating organic aerogels. These materials are partially depolymerized into soluble oligomers upon exposure to primary amines and can be reassembled into fresh polymer networks on demand. Additionally, by varying the amine feedstocks during depolymerization, we tailor key aerogel properties, such as thermal conductivity and flame resistance, beyond their initial synthesis. Under heat and pressure, HT bond exchange enables aerogels to transform into high-performance thermoset-like films, which can subsequently revert to aerogels. This breakthrough in HT chemistry sets a benchmark for atom-efficient recycling, reprogramming, and reprocessing of HT-based materials, providing a transformative foundation for a circular materials platform with broad impact. The sustainable use of organic aerogels is limited by their non-recyclability owing to the covalently-crosslinked networks that constitute their structures.

Here, the authors report an integrated electrochemical strategy for converting renewable fatty acids into liquid alkanes under mild and scalable conditions. 
 Upgrading fatty acid derivatives is a promising route to sustainable diesel and jet fuels, but conventional processes require high temperature, pressure, and large H₂ input, while contaminants in waste oil deactivate catalysts, demanding costly purification. Here, we present an integrated electrochemical strategy combining anodic decarboxylation, cathodic proton reduction, and olefin hydrogenation in one reactor, upgrading fatty acid derivatives to long-chain alkanes under mild conditions (60 °C, 1 atm) without external hydrogen. A high alkane yield of 88.9% is achieved and the reported performance is competitive. Experiments and calculations reveal that fatty acid chain length governs product yield and distribution by influencing –H departure and Cγ–Cβ–COOH bond cleavage barriers. This approach shows high activity and selectivity toward diverse feedstocks, including unsaturated fatty acids, esters, mixtures, crude acids, and waste oils. Powered by solar energy, approximately 40 g of long-chain alkanes are produced in a 1 L reactor, highlighting its scalability and potential for green fuel synthesis.

This research demonstrates such matching could minimize intertemporal welfare trade-offs and avoid various risks for permanent removal. 
 Unlike CO2, methane emissions have a particularly large short-term effect on temperature. We argue that these largely temporary temperature effects of methane emissions are apt to be offset by temporary CO2 removal. Temporally matching offsetting temperature reductions to the temperature impulse of methane eliminates the sizable intertemporal welfare transfers that occur when methane is offset by equivalent permanent CO2 removals. Assessing equivalence based on avoided economic damages suggests that about 87 temporary CO2 removals over a period of 30 years are needed to offset 1 t of methane. Agreement on the appropriate quantity of temporary CO2 offsets is insensitive to controversial parameters such as the social discount rate, climate damages and future emission scenarios. Short-term monitoring periods of 20–30 years are likely to be more credibly enforceable for various nature-based CO2 removal projects than long-term monitoring requirements. Methane emissions have a large short-term impact on temperature, which can be potentially offset by nature-based solutions that provide temporary carbon storage.

 In the face of the climate and biodiversity crisis, global targets for the restoration of degraded lands have become ever more ambitious and urgent. Here we explain the case for placing justice at the heart of restoration practice. Although this is increasingly accepted, there is an unfortunate tendency to address justice in superficial ways, through tokenistic forms of participation and benefit sharing. We address this problem by classifying the different levels at which justice can be addressed and elaborating the level that restoration practice should aspire to if it is to be just and transformative.

Fire represents a mainstay for rural communities managing tropical landscapes, but these can lead to uncontrolled ‘wild’ fires that pose a major threat to people and the ecosystem, leading to a cycle of increased susceptibility to fire and increased vulnerability of people and peat ecosystem to future fires. Using an exposure-sensitivity-adaptive capacity framework, we constructed indicators of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity of peatlands and communities to fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan (Indonesia) and used these indicators to calculate the social and ecological vulnerability of peatlands and communities to fires. We operationalized this framework and defined spatial indicators which we used to construct three indices of vulnerability (ecological vulnerability, social vulnerability of villages to burning, and social vulnerability of villages to smoke-haze). Our assessment found peatlands with high ecological vulnerability on eastern Sumatra (Riau, Jambi and South Sumatra), southern Kalimantan (Central and South Kalimantan), and East Kalimantan. Majority of these provinces overlapped with sites of high social vulnerability for burning (North Sumatra, Riau, South Sumatra, Central Kalimantan, and South Kalimantan) and high social vulnerability for smoke-haze (Riau, Jambi, South Sumatra, Central Kalimantan, and South Kalimantan). As districts play an important role in land use decisions and fire mitigation efforts, we identified the top six districts that had high numbers of villages with high ecological and social vulnerability scores. Hotspot analyses showed that ecological vulnerability hotspots were co-located with social vulnerability hotspots but clusters of social vulnerability hotspots for burning did not necessarily overlap with social vulnerability hotspots for smoke-haze. Our vulnerability assessment of peatlands and villages is the foundation for an important tool for policymakers at multiple governance levels to identify high ecological and social vulnerability to peatland fires and channel aid and mitigation efforts where they are most needed."

However, due to methodological challenges, field measurements of N2 emissions remain rare, leaving denitrification losses poorly characterised across most cropping systems and comprehensive N budgets lacking. This constrains parameterization and validation of biogeochemical models, impeding efforts to forecast denitrification losses under changing conditions and design effective mitigation strategies. This study (i) reviewed the current literature on field-based N2 measurements, (ii) tested the ability of five different models to accurately simulate denitrification losses, and (iii) simulated denitrification losses from agricultural soils in Germany using gridded and point-based modelling frameworks. Results show that field studies suitable for model calibration remain scarce and mostly limited to temperate systems. Simulated cumulative N2 emissions varied widely between models, ranging from 0.89 to 6.07 kg N ha−1, far below the observed N2 emissions of 21 ± 3 kg N ha−1. The ratio of N2O to (N2O + N2) emitted ( ), a key determinant of the climate impact of denitrification, was not only strongly overestimated by all models but also exhibited considerable variations, ranging from 0.056 to 0.707, compared to the measured ratio of 0.006. Models also failed to capture expected responses of to environmental drivers. For Germany, simulated average N2 emissions from agricultural soils ranged from 1.7 to 14.5 kg N ha−1yr−1, with corresponding ratios ranging from 0.18 to 0.59. Spatial patterns of emissions also differed significantly across modelling frameworks, reflecting large structural uncertainties. These findings highlight that both N2 emissions and ratios remain poorly represented in current models, severely limiting our ability to establish reliable N budgets and develop targeted N management strategies. Coordinated advancements in field-based measurements and modelling are urgently needed to improve the representation of denitrification in biogeochemical models."

Previous studies have highlighted its potential and the role of improve management practice, but many relied on static land-use assumptions or limited spatial data, overlooking socio-economic and climate-driven changes that affect land availability. This study assessed the global SOC sequestration potential of cropland and bioenergy land under three land-use pathways: business as-usual (BAU), a sustainable food system (FOOD), and a 2 °C climate target (2°). Our results show that both climate and food policies may influence SOC sequestration through land-use changes. Under the 2 °C scenario, large-scale expansion of bioenergy crops could increase SOC stocks by about 7% (∼9 Gt CO2). In contrast, the FOOD scenario achieves only modest SOC gains, slightly lower than BAU (−1.59 Gt CO₂). This because dietary shifts reduce pasture demand but do not significantly change cropland area, and bioenergy deployment is limited. While plant-based diets improve food system efficiency and reduce emissions, their SOC benefits are indirect and depend on how freed-up land is used for mitigation, such as afforestation or bioenergy production. Regions with significant bioenergy expansion—such as Latin America, reforming economies, and OECD/EU countries—show the highest SOC gains. Regions with large cropland areas, including the Middle East, Africa, and Asia, contribute 70% of the global potential. Moreover substantial SOC potential can be realized at a cost below $100 per ton of CO₂, highlighting SOC sequestration as a feasible and economically viable climate mitigation strategy. Our study findings underscore the trade-offs between food system transformation, land-use efficiency, and carbon storage, and emphasize that climate policies promoting bioenergy expansion can achieve substantial SOC gains, while dietary policies alone have limited impact if without strategic land management."

Moose have two main strategies for thermal regulation: shifting activity patterns and selecting habitat that provides thermal refuge. In this study, we compared how moose use these two strategies in response to winter temperature across their latitudinal range. First, we used hidden Markov models to delineate encamped and traveling movement states for five populations of global positioning system-collared moose in relation to time of day, temperature, and snow depth. Next, we used step-selection functions to determine influential covariates of encamped locations. As air temperatures and snow depths increased, moose from all populations were more likely to remain in an encamped, relatively stationary state. All moose became less diurnal and more nocturnal at high temperatures, although the magnitude of changes in activity varied by population. Encamped northern moose selected shrubby habitat that presents foraging opportunities, whereas encamped southern moose selected for coniferous forest that provides poor forage but offers shade in southern regions. The only moose population to select for lower temperatures also experienced the warmest winter on record during our study period, which may explain this population’s low overall activity rates. Our results indicate that moose along their southern range extent are responding to elevated mid-winter temperatures by initially altering activity patterns and subsequently selecting for potential thermal refugia at the expense of foraging habitat, while northern moose were unlikely to shift habitat selection based on temperature unless faced with an anomalously warm winter. As climate change is implicated in range contraction and population declines, our findings suggest that high winter temperatures may be causing moose to not only reduce overall activity but also to forgo preferred foraging habitat in favor of prioritizing thermal refuge, thus forcing a trade-off between nutrition and thermoregulation."

Influenced by global change factors like climate change and intensified land use, especially urbanization and agriculture, these blooms are expected to become more common worldwide. Despite extensive research on bloom dynamics, mechanisms, and toxicity (notably of cyanobacteria), there is no comprehensive synthesis of their effects on ecosystem services. To address this, we conducted a systematic review of 48 studies globally documenting the impacts of phytoplankton blooms on key ecosystem services: fisheries, drinking water supply, and recreation. In fisheries, blooms cause significant losses primarily through fish mortality and habitat degradation, with toxins also reducing fish activity. Drinking water services experience serious disruptions, sometimes requiring costly treatment upgrades, while consumer complaints about taste and odor are common. Recreational activities suffer from swimming bans, decreased site attractiveness, and health risks. Toxic cyanobacterial blooms were the most frequently reported and damaging, though non-toxic algal blooms also cause notable problems. While some studies mention potential benefits of non-toxic blooms, these are limited and highly context-dependent. Our review also underscores the value of including grey literature alongside peer-reviewed studies to capture a fuller range of bloom impacts. Finally, we compiled cost estimates from various contexts, providing a benchmark for assessing the economic burden of phytoplankton blooms. The diversity and severity of impacts call for proactive, adaptive management strategies to mitigate disruptions and safeguard ecosystem services in lakes and reservoirs facing growing bloom pressures."

Despite significant growth in total production, it fails to ensure food security for all, drives biodiversity decline, and majorly contributes to climate change. Research on agrifood-system burdens often focusses on the national level and isolated burdens, ignoring their systemic complexity. We address this knowledge gap by combining global subnational datasets proxying four key dimensions of agrifood-system burdens: environmental footprint, climate change, income poverty, and malnutrition. We map global hotspots of co-occurring agrifood-system burdens for 2017. We overlay these with data on ambient population counts, agricultural areas, farm size distributions, and lands inhabited by Indigenous peoples to identify spatial correspondence between people in vulnerable contexts and food production regions facing these burdens. We further assess countries’ relative burden against their inequality and governance indicators. Burden hotspots occupy many regions worldwide, especially in low-income, (sub)tropical regions. Single burdens occupy regions harbouring about 5 billion people (∼66% of the global population) and 1.8 billion ha of agricultural lands (∼40%), while multiple burdens occupy regions with about 1.9 billion people and 470 million ha agricultural lands. Environmental footprint is the strongest contributor to these burden profiles. Regions with traditionally marginalised communities (i.e. small-scale farmers and Indigenous peoples) disproportionally face multiple burdens. Agrifood-system burdens are more prevalent in countries with higher economic inequality and poorer governance. Burden profiles vary substantially within and between countries, necessitating regionalised and context-specific policies for effective, bundled, and targeted solutions. Addressing agrifood-system burdens can also synergise with tackling other current global challenges, like biodiversity loss and environmental justice."

 The impact of aviation soot on natural cirrus clouds is considered the most uncertain among the climate impacts of the aviation sector. In this study, a global aerosol-climate model equipped with a cirrus parametrisation is applied to quantify the impact of aviation soot on natural cirrus clouds and its resulting climate effect. For the first time, the cirrus parametrisation in the model is driven by novel laboratory measurements specifically targeting the ice nucleation ability of aviation soot, thus enabling an experimentally-constrained estimate of the aviation-soot cirrus effect. The results indicate no statistically significant impact of aviation soot on natural cirrus clouds, with an effective radiative forcing of −6.9 ± 29.8 mW m−2 (95 % confidence interval). Sensitivity simulations conducted to investigate the role of other ice nucleating particles (INPs) competing with aviation soot for ice supersaturation in the cirrus regime (soot from sources other than aviation, mineral dust and ammonium sulphate) further show that the impact of aviation soot remains statistically insignificant also when the impact of these other INPs on cirrus is reduced in the model. Acknowledging that the complexity of the soot cirrus interaction is associated with uncertainties, the model results supported by dedicated laboratory measurements suggest that the climate impact due to the aviation soot cirrus effect is likely negligible with no statistical significance."

Based on detailed air measurements and modeling, the research shows these gases strongly influence radicals and ozone formation. Overlooking them may lead to ineffective policies. The findings highlight the need for better measurement of these gases to improve pollution forecasts and support smarter air quality strategies. 
 Photochemical ozone (O3) pollution remains a persistent environmental challenge, and growing evidence highlights the critical role of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) in photochemical processes. However, comprehensive and quantitative measurements of OVOCs remain limited. This study investigates the impact of OVOCs on O3 formation mechanisms and radical budgets by intergrating high-resolution field measurements from a subtropical coastal region in South China with observation-based photochemical modeling. 63 OVOC species were measured by a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-ToF-MS), and accounted for 72 %–77 % of total VOC concentrations. The O3-precusor relationship analysis revealed a transition regime for O3 formation and high sensitivity to OVOCs. OVOC-related reactions, including OVOC photolysis, OVOC oxidation by OH and NO3 radicals, contributed approximately 36 %–73 % to daytime production rates of HO2 and RO2 radicals. Model simulations without comprehensive consideration of OVOCs would significantly underestimate daytime production rates of O3 and ROx radicals by 41 %–48 %, and shift the diagnosis of O3 formation from a transition regime to a VOC-limited regime, leading to biased policy recommendations and potentially ineffective control strategies. These findings underscore the critical role of OVOCs in atmospheric photochemistry and highlight the urgent need for comprehensive OVOC quantification to improve OVOC-inclusive model frameworks. Such improvements are essential for accurately characterizing O3-precursor relationships and for developing effective and sustainable strategies to mitigate regional O3 pollution."

Our shipboard measurements highlight the preferential formation of N-containing secondary water-soluble OAs associated with the predominant diatoms including ice algae during the bloom after sea ice melting/retreat in the subarctic ocean. 
 The Sea of Okhotsk is one of the most biologically productive regions, where primary production during spring phytoplankton blooms after sea ice melting/retreat has the potential to contribute to the sea-to-air emission flux of atmospheric organic aerosols (OAs). To elucidate the effect of oceanic biological activity during blooms on the formation process of OAs, aerosol samples and surface seawater were collected during the bloom period of April 2021. Organic matter (OM) was the dominant component of submicrometer aerosols during both the bloom (53 ± 16 %) and bloom-decay periods (44 ± 12 %), with OM being highly water-soluble during the bloom. Stable carbon isotope ratios of aerosol organic carbon (OC) showed that 73 %–82 % of the observed aerosols were of marine origin. Relations between water-soluble OC (WSOC) and molecular tracers suggested that aerosol WSOC of marine origin was likely affected by secondary formation from precursors such as α-pinene and DMS-relevant compounds rather than primary emissions of sea spray aerosols. The amounts of water-soluble organic nitrogen (WSON) in aerosol and dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in seawater during the bloom were larger than those during bloom-decay period, suggesting the preferential formation of N-containing water-soluble OAs of marine origin during the bloom. The increase in the amount of DON during the bloom was likely associated with the predominant diatoms, Thalassiosira spp. and Fragilariopsis spp. This study highlights the significant contribution of the secondary formation of marine biogenic OAs with increased N-containing components during the bloom after sea ice melting/retreat in the subarctic ocean."

Advanced techniques revealed key intermediates (hydroxyl peroxyamines, amino hydroperoxides) and novel pathways, establishing a quantitative framework linking molecular processes to aerosol aging for atmospheric chemistry models. 
 Atmospheric amines critically contribute to secondary aerosols formation via heterogeneous reactions, yet the molecular mechanisms governing heterogeneous amination chemistry of aerosols remain unclear. Here, we utilize an integrated tandem flow-tube system coupled with online ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to elucidate the amination chemistry of ethylamine (EA) with representative organic aerosol components, including C20–C54 secondary ozonides (SOZs), C17–C27 carboxylic acids, and aldehydes. Our experiments provide evidence for the formation of four key intermediates: hydroxyl peroxyamines, amino hydroperoxides, peroxyamines, and amino ethers, which mediate SOZs conversion to hydroxyimines, amides, and imines. Furthermore, dihydroxylamines and hydroxylamines are identified as characteristic intermediates in carboxylic acids and aldehydes amination. Quantitative heterogeneous reactivity measurements (Δγeff) reveal that SOZs exhibit a pronounced inverse dependence on carbon chain length, e.g., C21 SOZ (Δγeff = 1.0 × 10−4) > C49 SOZ (Δγeff = 5.7 × 10−6), with consistently lower reactivity than acids and aldehydes, e.g., C17 acid (Δγeff = 2.3 × 10−4). The amination mechanism of SOZs is initiated by EA addition, followed by either hydroxyl peroxyamines-mediated dehydration yielding hydroxyimines and amides, or amino hydroperoxides-driven H2O2 elimination forming imines. For carboxylic acids and aldehydes, EA addition leads to dihydroxylamines and hydroxylamines formation, which subsequently dehydrate to produce amides and imines. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding amine-driven aerosol aging processes that affects atmospheric chemistry, air quality, and climate systems."

Ice crystals were grown under conditions that mimic cirrus clouds in the presence of carbonyl vapors. Ice and gas samples were collected and analyzed to calculate ice uptake coefficients for 14 carbonyls at different temperatures. This revealed an inverse relationship between uptake and temperature. Vapor pressure and molar mass were found to be the most significant factors in uptake. 
 Carbonyls are highly relevant atmospheric constituents that influence tropospheric photochemistry and oxidative capacity. They can be removed from the upper troposphere via ice phase deposition scavenging. The gas-volume uptake coefficients for 14 different carbonyl compounds were determined using a flowtube apparatus. Ice crystals were grown from vapor deposition in the presence of gas phase carbonyls at −20, −30, and −40 °C. Using van't Hoff analysis, the entropy and enthalpy of uptake were determined. An inverse relationship between uptake coefficients and temperature was observed for all species except methyl vinyl ketone. A linear correlation between ΔS and ΔH arose which was statistically validated and determined with 99 % confidence to not be a statistical artifact. This compensation behavior could be an indication of a surface liquid layer or quasi-liquid layer behavior involved in the uptake process and could also indicate a single dominant influence on a compound's uptake. The most significant physicochemical properties correlated with uptake were identified to be vapor pressure and molar mass, which indicate that smaller compounds with higher vapor pressures are more readily taken into the ice phase.

Williams,The influence of climate variability on transatlantic flight times,"We use measured transatlantic flight times since 1994 from the IAGOS (In-Service Aircraft for a GlobalObserving System) program to assess the impact of the North Atlantic Oscillation, El Nino-Southern Oscillation, Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and solar cycle. We show that they drive changes to one-way flight times of over an hour and to round-trip flight times by several minutes per flight. They thus cause variability in total CO2 emissions of 10s of kT/month and financial cost of millions of US dollars/month over the full transatlantic fleet. 
 Transatlantic aviation is a major industry and even small flight time changes have major economic and environmental implications. While our ability to optimise these flights for background wind variations at day-to-day scales is excellent, at the longer timescales needed for sustainability planning and fuel cost hedging these capabilities are more limited. Here, we quantify the association between four climate indices (the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the North Atlantic Oscillation, the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation and solar irradiance) and transatlantic flight times using thirty years of commercial flight data. This allows us to identify whether these indices can be used to identify systematic flight time shifts. We find that ENSO and the NAO are associated with statistically-significant changes in one-way flight times of up to 82.2 ± 3.5 min, and changes in round-trip times of 4.8 ± 0.5 and 4.0 ± 0.8 min respectively, while the QBO and TSI have weaker but significant effects. Together, these indices plus a linear trend explain up to 27 % of variation depending on season and direction, and are associated with month-to-month fuel cost & CO2 emission variations of up to 27MUSD & 120 kT for one-way trips and USD 5 million  & 23 kT for round trips. We also show that westward, round-trip and non-winter-eastward flight times have increased by several minutes per decade since the 1990s. Our results provide the first observational quantitative basis for aviation fuel and carbon cost management at monthly and longer timescales."

National emissions show a clear three‑phase pattern, with uncertainties below 5 % (1σ) at the national scale but much higher at the provincial level (10–50 %, 1σ). High-emission regions often have the largest uncertainties. Our findings support more accurate emission estimates and the verification emission reduction policies. 
 Accurate quantification of anthropogenic CO2 emissions is crucial for mitigating climate change and verifying emission reduction policies. This study conducts a comparative analysis of China's anthropogenic CO2 emissions for the period between 2000 and 2023 based on six widely used bottom-up inventories at their latest version (ODIAC2023, EDGAR2024, MEIC-global-CO2 v1.0, CAMS-GLOB-ANT v6.2, GEMS v1.0, and CEADs). The national total CO2 emissions increase from 3.43 (3.21–3.63) Gt yr−1 in 2000 to 12.03 (11.35–12.98) Gt yr−1 in 2023, with three growth periods: rapid growth (2000–2013, 0.56 ± 0.013 Gt yr−1), near-stagnation (2013–2016, −0.07 ± 0.022 Gt yr−1), and renewed growth (2016–2023, 0.30 ± 0.016 Gt yr−1). Emissions are dominated by the electricity and heat production, and the industry and construction (78 % of total emissions), with the former replacing the latter as the largest source after 2017. EDGAR consistently reports the highest national CO2 emissions, while MEIC provides the lowest, contributing to the large deviations after 2012. EDGAR and MEIC report different spatial distributions of the transport sector. EDGAR concentrates emissions along major roads and MEIC distributes them more diffusely. Extreme outliers (> 105 t CO2 km−2 yr−1, against an average of 102 t CO2 km−2 yr−1) in these inventories arise from discrepancies in point source data in the Carbon Monitoring for Action (CARMA) versus the China Power Emissions Database (CPED). Overall, the uncertainty of total national anthropogenic CO2 emissions is within 5 % (1σ), and the uncertainties are about 10 %–50 % (1σ) at the provincial level. Our study underscores that the improved spatial proxies, consistent regional inventories, and continued methodological updates are essential for improving the robustness of China's CO2 emission assessments and supporting mitigation planning."

We observed unusually high water vapor and ice levels up to 1.5 kilometers above the tropopause. Although the extra water vapor lasted only a few days to weeks, it shows how such storms can temporarily alter the upper atmosphere’s composition. 
 This study examines the cloud microphysical properties and trace gas signatures associated with a convective overshooting event observed during the TPEx (TropoPause composition gradients and mixing Experiment) campaign in June 2024 over Sweden. While recent studies have predominantly focused on convective overshootings in sub(tropical) air masses, this particular event took place during a cold air outbreak characterized by low tropopause altitudes of 9 km. The measurements by the  microphysical cloud spectrometer reveal that ice particles were transported into the lower stratosphere, with detections extending up to 1.5 km above the tropopause. At this altitude, a pronounced stratospheric ozone concentration of approximately 600 ppbv and a notable tropospheric water vapor concentration of up to 60 ppmv (+30 ppmv) were recorded, the latter being twice as high as background levels at the same height. This substantial injection of tropospheric air and ice particles was linked to gravity wave breaking, and subsequently irreversible mixing near the overshooting top. Forward trajectories indicate that the impact of the overshoot on the lower stratosphere, especially regarding the observed hydration, is relatively short-lived with a life time of several days (at 330 K) to weeks (at 345 K)."

We investigated ice formation in the presence of pure and binary mixtures of common minerals using a microfluidic device. The mineral with the best ability to initiate ice formation alone (that is, at the highest temperature) typically determined when ice formed in the binary mixture. 
 Mineral dusts are among the most active ice-nucleating particles present in cloud droplets, with their properties influencing radiative properties and precipitation formation. To improve weather predictions and climate projections, it is important to understand under which conditions ice will form on mineral dusts. Laboratory experiments have primarily focused on single minerals, and field samples are complex mixtures that cannot be controlled in their composition or particle size. To fill this gap, a bottom-up investigation of suspensions containing pure or binary mixtures of microcline, montmorillonite, or quartz at concentrations between 0.0001 and 0.1 wt % is presented. Arrays of monodisperse aqueous droplets (diameters of 75 µm) are generated using a microfluidic device and subsequently cooled at a rate of 1 K min−1. The probability of freezing in the presence of binary mixtures generally follows that of the most ice-active mineral. Each pure mineral's nucleation site density is fit as a function of temperature and used to predict the frozen fraction curves for each binary mixture assuming additivity of mineral surface area. Predictions are also made for Arizona Test Dust from the obtained pure mineral fits, and general agreement with experiments is observed. This work presents a systematic study of ice formation in the presence of pure and binary mixtures of common mineral dusts, providing information for the future design of composition-aware parameterizations for ice nucleation in the atmosphere."

 Aerosol acidity (pH) affects aerosol composition and properties, and therefore climate, human health and ecosystems. Fine aerosol acidity and its seasonal variation at 6 sites (Finokalia, Patras, Thissio, Ioannina, Thessaloniki, and Xanthi) in Greece were investigated during 2019–2020. The thermodynamic model ISORROPIA-lite was used to calculate aerosol water and acidity based on measurements of the chemical composition of PM2.5 and available gas-phase concentrations of HNO3, NH3, and HCl. During winter the fine aerosols were acidic to moderately acidic throughout Greece with an overall mean aerosol pH of 3.57±0.44 in urban areas and 3.05±0.50 in remote locations. The highest aerosol pH (4.08±0.42) in January 2020 was found in Ioannina due to, among others, high K+ levels from biomass burning emissions. Aerosols in Xanthi were the most acidic due to high sulfate levels. Similar seasonal profiles of aerosol pH were observed at all sites studied with different factors contributing to this seasonality. During the summer PM2.5 at Thissio, Ioannina and Finokalia was acidic with a mean aerosol pH across all three sites of 1.76±0.40. During this season, sulfates were the driver of the higher acidity conditions at Thissio and Finokalia, with other factors such as the semivolatiles and temperature contributing to a lesser extent. At Ioannina, temperature along with the total ammonia and nitrate were the main contributors to the seasonal difference of the aerosol pH, while some of the nonvolatile species also contributed. In most cases, the importance of organics for aerosol pH was small."

We conducted atmospheric methane and ethane measurements using a vehicle in the world’s largest megacity, Tokyo, to identify locations and types of emissions and to examine preliminary estimates of their magnitudes. Waste sectors and fugitive natural gas emissions were found to be the major urban sources, and our data suggested need of improved accounting of natural gas related emissions. 
 To investigate distributions and magnitudes of methane (CH4) emissions in Tokyo, the world's largest megacity, a vehicle-based mobile measurement was set up and 3-week measurement campaign was conducted in September to October 2023. As part of the campaign, we conducted a control release experiment to link downwind excess CH4 values to CH4 emission rate at the source. The empirical equation derived from the experiment was significantly different from those reported by previous studies, suggesting the limitation of such enhancement-to-emission rate conversion, which is a source of large uncertainty in estimating urban CH4 emissions based on street-level measurements. The uncertainty stems from different experiment settings and underlying assumptions (e.g., source distance and height) which do not always represent actual urban measurement environments. The mobile measurement campaign covered a large extent of the Greater Tokyo Area with total driving distance of over 2000 km. Locations of CH4 enhancement were identified and C2H6-to-CH4 enhancement ratios were determined for individual locations to categorize them into biogenic, fossil fuel and combustion CH4 sources. Among a total of 565 locations inferred as CH4 sources, 53 % and 42 % were considered as biogenic and fossil fuel origins, respectively, with the rest being minor contributions from combustion. Based on the statistics of measured CH4 excesses, CH4 emissions were estimated for the specific areas where relatively high measurement coverage was achieved. In the areas with biogenic facilities (landfill and wastewater treatment plants), our emission estimates are well correlated with local government reporting, indicating actual key contributions of the waste-sector facilities. On the other hand, in the residential areas, CH4 emissions were predominantly of fossil-fuel origin, with a magnitude comparable to the area with waste facilities. However, such fossil-fuel emissions are not accounted for in local government reporting. This result highlights the need for improved accounting of urban fossil fuel-related emissions."

The Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties algorithm can retrieve aerosol size distribution parameters using only aerosol optical depth (AOD) as input that is continuously observed by sun photometers worldwide. In this study, we apply the algorithm to AOD measured by sun photometers and spectroradiometers to assess the performance and limitations of such retrievals and investigate the effect of the spectral range. 
 Several sun photometer networks worldwide include instruments for aerosol optical depth (AOD) observations, such as Global Atmospheric Atmosphere Watch-Precision Filter Radiometer (GAW-PFR) and Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET). AERONET provides additional aerosol properties such as the detailed volume size distribution and the single scattering albedo through inversion modelling of sky radiance measurements. However, the data availability for such properties is limited due to the limited number of daily almucantar sky radiance scans and cloudiness. AOD is measured significantly more frequently as there can be one measurement even every minute. Also, the AOD measurements are affected only by clouds being too close or covering the solar disk. The Generalized Retrieval of Atmosphere and Surface Properties (GRASP) is a flexible inversion model to retrieve aerosol properties from various observations. One of its capabilities is the retrieval of the volume concentration, the volume median radius and geometric standard deviation for each aerosol size distribution mode and the separation of AOD to each mode using only spectral AOD as an input parameter (known as the GRASP-AOD application). Such properties are important for various applications, as the size of aerosols affects their interaction with solar radiation, clouds and radiative forcing modelling. Particle size also shows significant differences depending on the aerosol type such as dust or biomass burning. In this study, we selected four common stations of GAW-PFR and AERONET, used GRASP to retrieve the bimodal size distribution parameters from AOD measured by GAW-PFR instruments (PFRs) and validated the results for different conditions using AERONET data as reference. One of those sites includes a multi-year parallel timeseries from two different BTS spectroradiometers that combined can provide direct spectral irradiance (and as a result AOD) in the 300–2150 nm range. Using this dataset, we were able to investigate the effect and potential benefits of the increased spectral range on GRASP-AOD retrievals. This is mostly focused on the retrieval of the coarse mode volume median radius, which is particularly challenging with the filter radiometers measuring up to 862 or 1020 nm. We also assessed the performance for certain dust and biomass burning cases. Our results showed good agreement between PFR AOD-based and AERONET sky radiance inversions for AOD modal separation and volume concentrations. Significant improvement of the PFR-AERONET intercomparison was also possible for the fine mode volume and effective radius when restricting the datasets to AOD at 500 nm > 0.1 and Ångström Exponent (AE) > 1. Also, the results showed consistency with previous study regarding the validation of such retrievals using AERONET AOD. Focusing on conditions with high proportion of dust particles, we found consistent results with the general casesUsing AOD with a larger spectral range (from BTS spectroradiometer), we found that the wavelength selection may affect the results and that using longer wavelengths can increase the sensitivity of coarse mode volume median radius to AOD and improve the correlation of the GRASP BTS AOD-based and AERONET datasets. However, the available data were limited, so it is not clear under what conditions the inclusion of such wavelengths will result in more accurate retrievals or to what extent.Finally, we were able to reproduce with GRASP the aerosol size characteristics of unusual biomass burning cases from the Canadian wildfires during 2023, but the results showed systematically increased fine mode radius and concentration compared to the AERONET output."

Hare,Sensitivity of tunable infrared laser spectroscopic measurements of Δ′17O in CO2 to analytical conditions,"Rare forms of oxygen, called isotopes, in carbon dioxide help scientists understand important atmopsheric processes, for example where CO2 comes from. In this paper, we examined how to improve the accuracy of a laser-based method for measuring oxygen isotopes in CO2, focusing on the rare mass-17 isotope. By testing instruments in two labs, we identified ways to make the results more reliable. Our findings provide practical guidance and support wider use of this method in environmental studies. 
 Triple oxygen isotope (Δ′17O) measurements of CO2 are increasingly used in atmospheric and paleoenvironmental research, supported by the rise of tunable infrared laser direct absorption spectroscopy (TILDAS) as a cost- and time-effective method for quantifying rare isotopologues in CO2. In this study we use data from two TILDAS instruments (University of Göttingen and University of Cape Town) to evaluate how the stability of analytical conditions, such as temperature, optical cell pressure, and the analyte's CO2 concentration influences measurement repeatability. We identify the mismatch in CO2 concentration between sample and working gas as the most significant factor affecting the repeatability of Δ′17O measurements. The resulting scale-offset effect can amount to several ppm per µmol mol−1 mismatch, depending on instrumental configuration.  Applying empirical corrections for such offsets significantly improves repeatability. We show that maintaining electronics temperature, cell temperature, and cell pressure stability within ±0.1 K, ±1 mK, and ±10 Pa, respectively, across the cycles of a replicate measurement is sufficient to avoid any resolvable impact on the internal error. Over multi-week timescales, drift in measured isotope ratios is primarily driven by variations in the temperature of electronic components, while fluctuations in cell temperature, pressure, and analyte concentration exert smaller but detectable influences. We conclude with practical recommendations for achieving high precision triple oxygen isotope measurements with TILDAS, emphasizing that continuous monitoring and reporting of analytical conditions is essential."

These gaps limit our ability to understand currents and climate patterns. We propose expanding modern ocean monitoring tools to improve future predictions. 
 The Indonesian Seas and Surroundings (ISS) play an important role in global ocean circulation by connecting the Pacific and Indian Oceans via the global thermohaline circulation. This region regulates the exchange of water mass, heat, salinity, and biogeochemical elements, further influencing the global climate and carbon cycle. Consequently, in this region, extensive observations and surveys, particularly the in-situ measurements, have been conducted in this region over the past two centuries. This study analyzed over 461 865 oceanographic casts from multiple international repositories, with 360 409 casts, or 21.97 % rejection, after rigorous quality control. The results show that data collection was sparse and temporally limited before the early 19th century, with a marked increase beginning in the mid-20th century. Spatially, observations are heavily concentrated along major international shipping routes, including the Makassar Strait, Malacca Strait, and South China Seas, while vast areas, such as the Halmahera Sea, Timor Sea, Java Sea, and Sulawesi Sea, remain poorly detected. Temperature and salinity are the most collected data, whereas deep-sea observations, particularly below 800 m, are critically lacking, with limited measurements of essential ocean variables such as dissolved oxygen, nutrients, and currents. Additionally, coastal regions exhibit substantial data deficiencies. Given the region's complex ocean-atmosphere interactions and unique topographic features, the current observational coverage remains insufficient to resolve the uncertainties in Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) variability, ocean heat transport, and monsoon forecasting.

 We present a new gridded data set of air temperature change across global land and ocean extending back to the 1780s. This data set, called the GloSAT reference analysis, has two novel features: it uses marine air temperature observations rather than the sea surface temperature measurements typically used by pre-existing data sets, and it extends further into the past than existing merged land and ocean instrumental temperature records which typically estimate temperature changes from the middle to late 19th century onwards. New estimates of diurnal-heating biases in marine air temperatures have enabled the use of daytime observations, extending the data set further into the past compared to nighttime-only marine air temperature data. The data set uses an extended version of the CRUTEM5 station database over land areas, incorporating newly available bias adjustments for non-standard thermometer enclosures used prior to the adoption of Stevenson screens and new climatological normal estimates for stations with limited data in the 1961–1990 baseline period. Land and marine temperature anomalies are combined to produce a gridded data set following the methods developed for HadCRUT5.

Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of using machine learning models to integrate observations, and support in-depth analyses of carbon transport and storage mechanisms. This can foster broader utilization of Argo floats data in ocean carbon research. 
 The Southern Ocean plays a crucial role in regulating atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations and modulating the global oceanic carbon cycle, thereby substantially mitigating the effects of anthropogenic climate change. However, due to the region's challenging environment and sparse observational coverage, large uncertainties remain regarding the magnitude and mechanisms of carbon uptake in the Southern Ocean. In recent decades, the deployment of Argo float arrays has facilitated autonomous and continuous profiling of hydrographic and biogeochemical properties from the surface to depths of up to 6000 m, complementing traditional ship-based observations. Nevertheless, high-resolution, integrated datasets that combine ship-based and Argo-derived observations remain rare, partly due to the challenges of data harmonization, quality control, and uncertainty estimation, as well as the indirect nature of carbonate system parameter retrievals from Argo measurements. Here, we present a comprehensive, quality-controlled reconstruction of key carbonate system parameters in the Southern Ocean interior – including total alkalinity (TA), dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC), pH (total scale), nitrate (NO3), phosphate (PO4), silicate (SiO4), anthropogenic carbon (Cant), and aragonite saturation (Ωar) – by leveraging machine learning techniques and integrating all available Argo float profiles with ship-based survey data. The resulting datasets are gridded at 1°×1° horizontal resolution and 84 vertical pressure levels (0–5600 m), and are provided as distinct climatological products: the Float Grid (using all Argo float profiles) and the All-Data Grid (integrating all available Argo and ship-based observations). The Float Grid is further separated into the Non-O2-Float Grid (limited to Core Argo floats) and O2-Float Grid (limited to oxygen-measured Biogeochemical Argo floats). Each gridded product is accompanied by uncertainty estimates. The climatological products cover nearly the whole Sothern Ocean based on direct measurements instead of applying interpolating mapping methods, thereby providing a more robust result.

This study focuses on the northwestern Pacific region (0–40° N, 120–160° E) and proposes an attention-enhanced three dimensional U-Net++ model, which reconstructs daily T–S fields (26 layers, 1/4° resolution, 5–2000 m depth) using real-time available sea surface temperature (SST) and sea surface height (SSH) data. The model introduces cross-scale feature aggregation and selective information gating, allowing it to emphasize temporally coherent surface features most relevant to subsurface variability, while suppressing noise propagation and over-smoothing. By integrating 26 consecutive days of SST and SSH as inputs, the model effectively alleviates the underdetermined problem of mapping limited surface observations to full-depth structures. In addition, a two-stage transfer learning strategy is employed: the model is first pretrained using monthly SST/SSH data and the gridded Argo data to learn observation-dominated low-frequency spatiotemporal patterns, and then fine-tuned using daily SST/SSH data and the high-resolution reanalysis to capture the meso-scale dynamic processes. Evaluation results demonstrate that the reconstructed T-S fields exhibit better agreement with in-situ T-S profiles from World Ocean Database than previous studies, both during the validation period and in long-term statistical analyses, indicating the reliability and accuracy of the proposed approach for subsurface ocean field reconstruction. The reconstructed T-S field is available at https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.31950 (Wang et al., 2025)."

With this new database it was possible to summarize extreme events of precipitation and temperature in Mexico and to show that there is an undeniable warming trend in Mexico; however, further studies are needed in order to pinpoint the areas where climate change is having a profound impact. 
 This work presents Mexico's High Resolution Climate Database (MexHiResClimDB), which is a newly developed gridded, high-resolution climate dataset comprised of daily, monthly and yearly precipitation and temperature (Tmin, Tmax, Tavg). This new database provides the largest temporal coverage of the aforementioned climate variables at the highest spatial resolution (20 arcsec, or 560 m on Mexico's CCL projection) when compared to the other currently available gridded datasets for Mexico and its development has allowed for the analysis of the country's climate extremes for the 1951–2020 period. By comparing the spatial distribution of precipitation from the MexHiResClimDB with other gridded data (Daymet, L15, CHIRPS and PERSIANN CDR), it was found that the precipitation provided by this new dataset adequately represents the spatial variation of extreme precipitation events, in particular for the precipitation that occurred during 15–16 September  2013, caused by the presence of Tropical storm Manuel in the Pacific Ocean and Hurricane Ingrid (Cat 1) in the Gulf of Mexico. Using data from 61 days retrieved from Automated Weather Stations located throughout Mexico – and correspoding to the two months with the largest precipitation in Mexico – it was found that precipitation data from MexHiResClimDB has the lowest MAE (8.7 mm), compared to those of L15 (9.5 mm), Daymet (10.1 mm) and CHIRPS (11.7 mm). For Tmin and Tmax, the lowest MAE was obtained with MexHiResClimDB (1.7 and 1.8 °C, respectively), followed by Daymet (2.0 °C for both temperatures) and L15 (2.4 and 2.5 °C). With this new database an analysis of the extreme events of precipitation and temperature in Mexico for the 1951–2020 period was undertaken: the wettest year was 1958, the wettest day 26 September 1970, and September of 2013 the wettest month. It was also found that eight out of the ten days with the highest Tmin occurred in 2020, the two months with the highest Tmin were July and August of 2020 and that the six years with the highest Tmin were 2015–2020. When Tmax was analysed, it was found that the hottest day was 15 June 1998, while June of 1998 was the hottest month and 2020 the hottest year, and that the four hottest years occurred between 2011–2020. Nationwide (and considering 1961–1990 as the baseline period), Tmin, Tavg and Tmax have increased, with their anomalies drastically increasing in recent years and reaching values above 1.0 °C in 2020. At the same time, precipitation has also decreased in recent years – which combined with the increase in temperature will have severe impacts on water availability. This new database provides a tool to quantify – in detail – the spatio-temporal variability of climate throughout Mexico.The MexHiResClimDB entire dataset is available on Figshare (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.7689428.v2, Carrera-Hernández, 2025a)."

This data paper provides 16 years of hourly concentrations and fluxes of 11 solutes and runoff rates (2010–2024) from two runoff gauging stations, one affected by deforestation and one not, illustrating forest-management effects on solute transport processes at the catchment scale. 
 A substantial body of knowledge concerning the functioning of catchments has been derived from the observation and quantification of solute and suspended matter fluxes in rivers. The Wüstebach catchment is a hydrological observatory that is part of the German TERENO (Terrestrial Environmental Observatories) network. In 2013, the Eifel National Park undertook a partial deforestation of the spruce forest with the objective of facilitating the regrowth of a natural forest. This data paper presents 16 years of estimated hourly stream-water flux data of nine continuously monitored macro- and micronutrients, as well as dissolved ionic aluminum and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), along with the measured solute concentrations and discharge rates observed in the Wüstebach catchment (from 2010 to 2024).To estimate hourly stream-water fluxes from weekly manual grab samples and event autosampler data, we employed the R software package LOADFLEX, which implements a number of solute prediction methods, including regressions, interpolations, the period-weighted approach, and the more recently developed composite method. A comparison of the predicted nitrate concentrations with hourly nitrate reference data was conducted to assess the optimal prediction approach for the Wüstebach catchment. The analysis showed that the composite model is best suited to calculate the nitrate fluxes. Accordingly, this model was selected to calculate the fluxes of all considered macro- and micronutrients, dissolved aluminum and DOC. Flux data were compiled in the same way for a neighboring reference catchment with similar characteristics but without clear-cutting, in order to identify the effects of deforestation and afforestation on the cycling and transport of nutrients. We anticipate that this comprehensive data set will facilitate new insights into the influence of deforestation and afforestation on solute fluxes at the catchment scale. The dataset, entitled “Wüstebach data paper: Long-term hourly solute flux data 2010–2024”, is shared via Forschungszentrum Jülich: https://doi.org/10.26165/JUELICH-DATA/AKAMNQ (Bogena and Herrmann, 2025)."

Samples are collected via fixed and mobile platforms and processed using a standardized pipeline. The dataset supports observational and modelling analyses of seasonal, spatial, and compositional variability in INPs. 
 Ice nucleating particles (INPs) play a critical role in cloud microphysics and precipitation formation, yet long-term, spatially extensive observational datasets remain limited. Here, we present one of the most comprehensive publicly available datasets of immersion-mode INP concentrations using a single analytical method, generated through the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility. INP filter samples have been collected across a broad range of environments – including agricultural plains, Arctic coastlines, high-elevation mountain sites, marine regions, and urban areas – via fixed observatories, mobile facility deployments, and vertically-resolved tethered balloon system operations. We describe the standardized processing and quality assurance pipeline, from filter collection and processing using the Ice Nucleation Spectrometer to final data products archived on the ARM Data Discovery portal. The dataset includes both total INP concentrations and selectively treated samples, allowing for classification of biological, organic, and inorganic INP types. It features a continuous 5-year record of INP measurements from a central U.S. site, with data collection still ongoing. Seasonal and site-specific differences in INP concentrations are illustrated through intercomparisons at −10 and −20 °C, revealing distinct regional sources and atmospheric drivers. We also outline mechanisms for researchers to access existing data, request additional sample analyses, and propose future field campaigns involving ARM INP measurements. This dataset supports a wide range of scientific applications, from observational and mechanistic studies to model development, and provides critical constraints on aerosol-cloud interactions across diverse atmospheric regimes (Creamean et al., 2024, 2020b; https://doi.org/10.5439/1770816)."

Using multi-source satellite data and machine learning, this study mapped annual building heights at 30-meter detail from 1990 to 2019, revealing both horizontal and vertical urban growth. The open dataset offers new insights into how Chinese cities expand and renew, supporting research and planning for urban development. 
 Long-term building height data are critical for analyzing urban morphological evolution and renewal processes, yet such datasets at fine spatial resolutions remain scarce for large geographical regions. This study proposes a framework to generate continuous annual building height maps for China at 30 m spatial resolution from 1990 to 2019, integrating multi-source remote sensing data (Landsat, Sentinel-1/2, et al.) through the eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model. The framework reconstructs Vertical-Vertical (VV) band, incorporates reference data derived from the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) algorithm, and utilizes Total Variation (TV) denoising to achieve temporal consistency, while retaining inter-annual building height variations. Validation results demonstrate stable performance of the building height estimates over the past three decades, with nationwide RMSE values ranging between 5.96 and 6.69 m. Comparisons with existing datasets confirm consistency with reference building heights and their temporal evolution driven by urban development and renewal. Furthermore, our dataset shows pronounced horizontal and vertical expansion of Chinese cities between 1990 and 2019, as the total impervious surface area increases from 56,413.68 to 174,320.66 km² and overall building volume rises from 471.24 to 884.69 km³. Provincial contributions to national building volume change substantially over time, with Hebei (12.9 %), Shandong (11.4 %), and Henan (10.3 %) leading in 1990, while Shandong (10.0 %), Guangdong (8.0 %) and Jiangsu (8.0 %) are in the leading positions in 2019. The resulting annual 30 m resolution building height datasets, made openly accessible, provide a valuable foundation for cross-city comparisons, long-term three-dimensional (3D) urban morphology studies, and policy-relevant planning in fast-growing Chinese cities."

We compiled 1475 measurements from field samples and laboratory experiments, conducted since 2014, to facilitate the differentiation of CH4 formation pathways and processes, to identify existing gaps limiting application of Δ13CH3D and Δ12CH2D2, and to develop isotope ratio source signature inputs for global CH4 flux modelling. 
 Measurements of methane (CH4) molecules containing two rare isotopes (13CH3D and 12CH2D2), also termed doubly substituted or “clumped” isotopologues, have the potential to provide two additional isotopic dimensions to help investigate the mechanisms underlying global atmospheric trends in CH4. In this work, we summarise the current state of research on doubly substituted CH4 isotopologues, with an emphasis on compiling results of all relevant work. The database comprises 1475 records compiled from the literature published until April 2025 (https://doi.org/10.5285/51ae627da5fb41b8a767ee6c653f83e6, Defratyka et al., 2025). For field samples, 40 % of records were sourced from natural gas reservoirs, while microbial terrestrial (e.g., agriculture, lake, wetland) samples account only for 12.5 %. Lakes samples contribute 75 % to collected microbial terrestrial samples. There is limited or no representation of samples coming from significant microbial CH4 sources to the atmosphere, like wetlands, agricultural practices and landfills. To date, laboratory experiments were mostly focused on microbial (28 % of samples from laboratory experiments) and pyrogenic (15 %) methanogenesis or anaerobic (16 %), and aerobic (8 %) CH4 oxidation, with only single study of photochemical oxidation via OH and Cl, which constitutes 5 % of the laboratory experiments entries. The distinct ranges of Δ13CH3D and Δ12CH2D2 values measured in these studies suggests their potential to improve our understanding of atmospheric CH4. This work provides an overview of the major gaps in measurements and identifies where further studies should be focussed to enable the highest impact on understanding global CH4."

The new version of the coupled climate model was designed to better capture smaller-scale ocean motions. While this configuration improves the representation of many aspects of the climate system, some biases from the existing lower-resolution version persist. 
 A new configuration of the Australian Community Climate and Earth System Simulator coupled model, ACCESS-CM2, with a higher resolution ocean-sea ice component at 0.25° is introduced. The higher resolution ACCESS-CM2-025 model was developed to better represent the ocean mesoscale and expand the scope of climate modelling research applications. The individual model components have not been changed compared with ACCESS-CM2-1, the existing lower resolution version of the model at 1°, which was one of Australia's contributions to the World Climate Research Program's Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). This paper assesses the simulated climate for a 500 years present-day run in ACCESS-CM2-025 against observations, the lower resolution ACCESS-CM2-1 model, and two ocean-sea ice models using the same model components and comparable grid resolutions but with prescribed atmospheric forcing. ACCESS-CM2-025 is more energetic and performs better in regions of elevated ocean mesoscale variability such as at western boundary currents. The higher resolution ACCESS-CM2-025 also features a more realistic ENSO life cycle and seasonality, with a reduced biennality, which is common in the lower resolution ACCESS-CM2-1. Both ACCESS-CM2 models share many biases, particularly near the sea surface and also affecting sea ice coverage, reflecting insufficiency in the atmospheric model component. While ACCESS-CM2-025 exhibits improved time-mean deep convection, sea ice, and mixed layer depth in the North Atlantic, it also experiences multidecadal variability, which is evident in many variables, including the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation."

FRISIA includes previously uncaptured coastal socio-economic feedback and a diverse set of impact strains, thereby improving the represenation of SLR impacts in IAMs. Here we describe the baseline behaviour of FRISIA, explore the effects of the additional feedback and showcase the coupling of FRISIA to an IAM. 
 Global warming is expected to lead to a substantial rise in coastal sea levels by the end of the century, which imposes future impacts and adaptation challenges on the coastal zone. Capturing the socio-economic costs of sea level rise (SLR) is therefore an important component of climate impacts in integrated assessment models (IAMs). However, there is a lack of process-based models of SLR impacts with a focus on global, time-varying dynamics. Current SLR impact models often follow a cost-benefit analysis approach, fail to represent diverse pathways of SLR impacts, or do not include coastal adaptation. Here, we present the Feedback-based knowledge Repository for Integrated assessments of Sea level rise Impacts and Adaptation version 1.0 (FRISIAv1.0), a model designed for process-based, non-equilibrium IAMs that follows a system dynamics approach. FRISIA's SLR component is based on existing models of SLR, while its impact component is a substantially modified adaptation of the Coastal Impact and Adaptation Model (CIAM) for use in globally or regionally aggregated models. While a reduced-feedback version of FRISIA approximately reproduces CIAM results, the integration of additional feedbacks in FRISIA leads to emerging new behaviours, such as a potential peak and decline in SLR-driven storm surge damages in the early 22nd century, due to economic feedbacks in the coastal zone. When coupling FRISIA to an IAM, global GDP is reduced by 1.5 %–6.2 % (17th–83rd percentile range) under the mean SSP5-8.5 global-mean sea level rise from the IPCC's AR6 report (0.77 m by 2100) and no coastal adaptation, which is in the range of previous studies. The coupling of a diverse set of SLR impact streams from FRISIA into a system dynamics IAM has the advantage of leading to a wide range of socio-economic consequences that go beyond just a reduction in global GDP, such as an effect on inflation. Our simulations highlight the benefits of accounting for dynamic coastal feedback and coupling diverse SLR impact and cost strains to IAMs, and showcase that FRISIAv1.0 is a useful tool for doing so."

Additionally, we found that viscosity responds nonlinearly to the inclusion of thermodynamic sea-ice growth. 
 We present WIce-FOAM 1.0, a numerical model built on OpenFOAM that couples the dynamics and thermodynamics of heterogeneous sea ice to analyse waves' response in marginal ice zone regions composed of consolidated ice floes and interstitial grease ice. The model represents prototypical conditions on the 5 km scale, where each 10 m grid cell classified as ice floe or grease ice may contain both ice types, but are predominantly occupied by one. Our model aims to study the mean shear viscosity of heterogeneous sea ice to bridge the gap with larger-scale ocean-sea ice models in which sub-grid details and wave effects are neglected. We tested the model in the Southern Ocean using a realistic sea-ice field from a SAR satellite image and complemented our analysis by idealised simulations. The thermodynamic model was coupled online to optimize the stiffness of the process scales and to explicitly account for the distinct characteristics of different ice types. We first investigated the dynamic response of sea ice to one-way wave forcing across a range of wave periods and directions. The results show that the domain-averaged sea-ice viscosity is scale invariant from approximately 800 m to 5 km and is primarily governed by the relative proportion of ice floes to grease ice, with less sensitivity to wave periods and directions. While the wave direction affects the local strain rate and viscosity, and the presence and orientation of narrow connections between the larger ice floes significantly influence the mean viscosity, these effects do not break the observed scale invariance. Finally, we demonstrate that, despite the different time scales, the mean viscosity responds nonlinearly to the inclusion of thermodynamic sea-ice growth. This model represents a first step towards a mechanistic understanding and description of heterogeneous sea ice, which is common in the Antarctic and is increasing in the warming Arctic. It can be used to design field experiments and to derive parametrisations of waves-in-ice response for large-scale sea-ice models."

It builds on the LISFLOOD-FP 8.0 and 8.1 papers published in GMD: whereas LISFLOOD-FP 8.0 focussed on GPU-parallelisation, and LISFLOOD-FP 8.1 focussed on static mesh adaptivity of (multi)wavelets, LISFLOOD-FP 8.2 combines GPU (graphics processing unit)-parallelisation with multiwavelet dynamic mesh adaptivity to drastically reduce simulation runtimes, achieving up to a 4.5-fold speedup. 
 The second-order discontinuous Galerkin (DG2) solver of the two-dimensional shallow water equations in the raster-based LISFLOOD-FP 8.0 hydrodynamic modelling framework is mostly suited for predicting small-scale transients that emerge in rapid, multiscale floods caused by impact events like tsunamis. However, this DG2 solver can only be used for simulations on a uniform grid where it may yield inefficient runtimes even when using its graphics processing unit (GPU) parallelised version (GPU-DG2). To boost efficiency, the new LISFLOOD-FP 8.2 version integrates GPU parallelised dynamic (in time) grid resolution adaptivity of multiwavelets (MW) with the DG2 solver (GPU-MWDG2). The GPU-MWDG2 solver performs dyadic grid refinement, starting from a single grid cell, with a maximum refinement level, L, based on the resolution of the Digital Elevation Model (DEM). Furthermore, the dynamic GPU-MWDG2 adaptivity is driven by one error threshold, ε, against normalised details of all prognostic variables. Its accuracy and efficiency, as well as the practical validity of recommended ε choices between 10−4 and 10−3, are assessed for four laboratory/field-scale benchmarks of tsunami-induced flooding with different impact event complexities (i.e. single- vs. multi-peaked) and L values. Rigorous accuracy and efficiency metrics consistently show that GPU-MWDG2 simulations with ε = 10−3 preserve the predictions of the GPU-DG2 simulation on the uniform DEM grid, whereas ε = 10−4 may slightly improve velocity-related predictions. Efficiency-wise, GPU-MWDG2 yields considerable speedups from L ≥ 10 – due to its scalability on the GPU with increasing L – which can be around 2.0-to-4.5-fold. Generally, the bigger the L ≥ 10, the lower the event complexity over the simulated duration, and the closer the ε to 10−3, the larger the GPU-MWDG2 speedups over GPU-DG2.

We use four case studies to demonstrate the functionalities introduced to r.avaflow  v4 and to discuss the related chances and challenges: (i) a generic planar rock slide with interlayer shearing, and (ii)–(iv) semi-generic representations of the prehistoric Köfels rock slide (Austria), the prehistoric East Fogo landslide and tsunami (Cape Verde), and the Dösen rock glacier (Austria). Our results clearly reveal the high potential of the additional functionalities to widen the scope of r.avaflow beyond the simulation of extremely rapid and freely deforming mass flows. Combinations of the layered model, mechanically controlled deformation, and the slow-flow model unlock potentials yet barely explored in the field of GIS-based landslide simulations. In addition, the layered model facilitates a more realistic simulation of landslide-reservoir interactions. We also highlight the limitations regarding the physical basis and the application of the functionalities presented.

The multi-target calibration yielded unbiased predictions for all variables simultaneously and produced similar distributions of prediction–observation residuals for both calibration and out-of-sample test data, indicating that the model generalises robustly across diverse environments. We found that a step-wise approach to successive model integration and calibration yielded best results, and that correlations among parameters related to the representation of water stress effects underpinned non-robust parameter estimations. This likely indicates a dominant source of model structural uncertainty related to the representation of the response of photosynthesis to dry conditions in soil and air."

Designed as a community resource, validation configuration files can serve as a knowledge-sharing platform. The main objective is to improve the credibility of Integrated Assessment Models by promoting standardized validation practices. 
 Integrated assessment models (IAMs) are crucial for climate policymaking, offering climate mitigation scenarios and contributing to IPCC assessments. However, IAMs face criticism for lack of transparency and limited ability to represent recent technology diffusion and dynamics. We introduce the Potsdam Integrated Assessment Modeling validation tool, piamValidation, an open-source R package for validating IAM scenarios. The piamValidation tool enables systematic comparisons of variables from extensive IAM datasets against historical data and feasibility bounds or across scenarios and models. This functionality is particularly valuable for harmonizing scenarios across multiple IAMs. Moreover, the tool facilitates the systematic comparison of near-term technology dynamics with external observational data, including historical trends, near-term developments, and empirical findings. We apply the tool in two application cases. First, to scenarios from the Network for Greening the Financial System (NGFS) to demonstrate its general applicability, and second to the integrated assessment model REMIND for near-term technology trend validation, illustrating its potential to enhance the transparency and reliability of IAMs."

Gad,Comparison of precipitation parameterizations in Regional  Climate Model (RegCM5): a case study of the  Upper Blue Nile Basin (UBNB),"Regional Climate Model version 5 (RegCM5) reasonably reproduced the dominant spatiotemporal pattern of annual precipitation over the basin using the Emanuel convective scheme with the Nogherotto–Tompkins (NoTo) large-scale scheme. Using the MOLOCH non-hydrostatic dynamical core is recommended in future research for improving precipitation simulation and assessing the impacts of land-use change, due to dam-induced reservoirs on local climate. 
 Accurate simulation of precipitation over complex terrains such as the Upper Blue Nile Basin (UBNB) is essential for water resource management and climate impact assessments. The UBNB is characterized by complex terrain and convective precipitation systems that challenge the fine-scale climate simulation processes. This research aims to investigate the best precipitation parameterizations in the Regional Climate Model System (RegCM5) simulating different convective and large-scale schemes over the UBNB domain with 10 km resolution. The RegCM5 is driven by the fifth-generation atmospheric reanalysis (ERA5) for the period of (2000–2009) using the hydrostatic dynamical core. The total precipitation simulations of the different calibration scenarios are assessed to select the optimal RegCM5 configuration over the UBNB. Results show that the model succeeds to capture the dominant spatiotemporal pattern of the precipitation, and the Emanuel scheme coupled with Nogherotto-Tompkins (NoTo) reduces the dominant wet bias in the precipitation simulation. The model highlights challenges in reproducing the UBNB's precipitation variability with a moderate to relatively good correlation of precipitation patterns from 0.46 to 0.77, where deficiency in capturing the large-scale circulations, especially the low-level circulations. The research recommended to focus on dynamics advancement and exploring parameterization schemes that enhance the precipitation representation, such as the Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) in Future."

Stephens;Colin Zarzycki;Gerhard Dikta;Yun Qian;Shaocheng Xie,QuadTune version 1: a regional tuner for global atmospheric models,"Global models of the atmosphere contain errors that lead to inaccurate simulations. A software tool (""QuadTune"") is presented that attempts to mitigate errors related to suboptimal parameter values. It also displays diagnostic plots that provide hints about where structural errors might lie in the model. 
 When a new, better-formulated physical parameterization is introduced into a global atmospheric model, aspects of the global model solutions are sometimes degraded. Then, in order to use the new global model to address science questions, there is an incentive to restore its accuracy.  Oftentimes this restoration is achieved by tuning of model parameter values. Unfortunately, the retuning process is expensive because characterizing the parameter dependence requires numerous time-consuming global simulations.To reduce the cost of tuning, this manuscript introduces a “poor man's” model tuner, “QuadTune”. QuadTune carves the globe into regions and approximates the model parameter dependence through the use of an uncorrelated quadratic emulator (i.e., response surface). The simplicity of the emulator reduces the required number of global model simulations and aids explainability of tuner behavior.Tuning removes parametric error but leaves behind model structural error. Structural error manifests itself as regional residual biases, such as stubborn biases and tuning trade-offs. To visualize these residual biases, QuadTune's software includes a set of diagnostic plots. This paper illustrates the use of the plots for characterizing residual biases with an example tuning problem."

Here, we improve the simulation of volcanic material transport using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-Chem) version 4.8. Analysis of ash, sulfate, and SO2 mass budgets was performed. The direct radiative effect of volcanic aerosols was implemented. A preprocessor, PrepEmisSources, was developed to streamline the preparation of volcanic emissions. 
 Volcanic eruptions are one of the major natural hazards, exerting profound effects on the environment and climate. The emissions associated with such eruptions pose substantial risks to terrestrial systems and public health, particularly through the induction of acid rain and air pollution. Volcanic ash influences populations at distances reaching several thousand kilometers from the erupted volcano. Also, accurate forecasting of volcanic clouds is crucial for air traffic control. This study introduces enhancements to the simulation of volcanic eruptions and the transport of volcanic material using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem) version 4.8. Improvements include the addition of wet and dry deposition of ash and sulfate, improved SO2 chemical transformation mechanisms, and corrections of the gravitational deposition of ash. Ash, sulfate, and SO2 mass balance analyses were conducted. Furthermore, we included the direct radiative effect of ash and sulfate aerosols. Additionally, we developed an open-source Python-written emission preprocessor called PrepEmisSources to facilitate and streamline the preparation of volcanic emissions. Accordingly, the model code was extended to simulate complex volcanic emission scenarios using the emissions file prepared using the PrepEmisSources tool. The results suggest that the enhanced WRF-Chem v4.8 code provides an accurate representation of volcanic ash, SO2, and sulfate dispersion, deposition, and SO2 chemical transformation. These improvements will aid in volcanic debris forecasting and will allow for the use of the model for assessments of volcanic aerosols on climate and for geoengineering problems, including modeling of stratospheric aerosol injection."

The forecasts are produced daily and provide sea ice concentration predictions for the next 10 days. We evaluate the MET-AICE forecasts from the first year of operation, and we compare them to forecasts produced by three physically-based models. We show that MET-AICE is skillful and provides more accurate forecasts than the physically-based models. 
 There is an increasing need for reliable short-term sea ice forecasts that can support maritime operations in polar regions. While numerous studies have shown the potential of machine learning for sea ice forecasting, there are currently only a few operational data-driven sea ice prediction systems. Here, we introduce MET-AICE, a prediction system providing sea ice concentration forecasts for the next 10 d in the European Arctic. To our knowledge, it is the first operational data-driven prediction system designed for short-term sea ice forecasting. MET-AICE has been trained to predict sea ice concentration observations from the Advanced Microwave Scanning Radiometer 2 (AMSR2) at 5 km resolution. After one year of operation, we show that MET-AICE considerably outperforms persistence of AMSR2 observations (errors about 30 % lower on average), as well as forecasts from several dynamical models such as TOPAZ5, Barents-2.5 km and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Integrated Forecasting System."

A rotational bulge stabilizes the orientation of planets. Having only a tiny stabilizer, the rotational pole of Venus has been expected to separate from the figure pole in response to mantle flow, which has been used to explain why both poles are observed to be 0.5° apart. Here, we couple 3D mantle‐convection simulations and polar motion dynamics to explore how mantle flow, and in particular surface mobilization, drives Venus's polar motion. We provide a predictive framework for polar motion on slow rotators and show that the spin/figure pole separation (or offset) follows a simple law: it scales with the figure‐axis drift rate times the planet's Chandler period. Contrary to prior expectations, stronger internal loading does not amplify the offset, and the mantle‐driven polar motion is smooth rather than wobbly, more similar to that of fast rotators. In models matching Venus's geoid, figure‐axis drift rates reach only up to a few °/Myr, too slow compared to ca. 60°/Myr that is needed to match the observed offset. We therefore exclude mantle convection as the cause of Venus' spin and figure poles separation, and suggest that atmospheric and solid tides are not balanced instead."

However, not including end‐users, especially decision‐makers representing communities vulnerable to climate change, can limit model utility, increase epistemic risks, and lead to information misuse in decision‐making. While the ESM community increasingly values broad community engagement, end‐users may not initially perceive models as useful for local planning. Co‐designing models with end‐users fosters two‐way learning: users better understand models and their outputs, while modelers gain insights into fine‐scale local processes like monitoring practices and management priorities. Higher‐level co‐design can lead to more customized, priority‐driven, and useful modeling products. Despite these benefits, modelers often struggle to initiate meaningful partnerships with local communities. Therefore, this paper explores model co‐design from the perspective of modelers. This study presents two case studies where modelers and social scientists collaborated with Indigenous communities' decision‐makers to reflect their priorities in model design and application. In the Arctic Rivers Project, high‐resolution climate and hydrology data sets for Alaska were developed with guidance from an Indigenous Advisory Council, using optimized, coupled land‐atmosphere models. In the Mid‐Klamath Project, we partnered with the Karuk Tribe's Department of Natural Resources to assess climate change and prescribed burning impacts on terrestrial hydrology in the Klamath River Basin. Drawing from these studies, we introduce a four‐level framework: (a) Co‐design Configuration; (b) Model Tuning; (c) Incorporate Contextual Knowledge; (d) Co‐develop New Model Functions. We aim to help researchers consider and compare co‐design across diverse modeling projects systematically and coherently."

While previous studies have emphasized the role of large‐scale climate modes in this variability, the contribution of synoptic‐scale storms remains unclear. Using oceanic observations and the ERA5 reanalysis, we conduct a mixed‐layer heat budget analysis during storm‐active and storm‐weak periods within 1950–2020. Our results reveal that frequent storms contribute to a cumulative cooling of Tm, primarily through anomalous meridional Ekman heat transport. During storm‐active periods, a stronger Aleutian Low coincides with increased storm activity and enhanced cumulative Ekman cooling, vice‐versa during storm‐weak periods. These findings highlight the importance of storm frequency in shaping decadal upper‐ocean variability and in improving decadal climate prediction skill with high‐resolution models."

At the Lassen Volcanic Center (LVC) of the Cascade arc, limited detection of DLP activity hinders classification of anomalous seismic behavior and its relationship to the LVC magmatic system. This study uses a template matching approach with seismic data from temporary nodal and permanent stations to detect and locate DLP earthquakes near the LVC between 2017 and 2024. Within the DLP catalog of 611 events, a transition occurs from scattered (2017–2020) to oscillatory (2021–2024) occurrence rates. During the oscillatory period, regional earthquakes with large amplitude velocity waveforms observed near the LVC are associated with abrupt changes in DLP occurrence rates. Continued monitoring of DLP activity has the potential to better define the processes that drive volcanic unrest at the LVC in the future."

We present petrological and geochemical analyses of six very‐low‐Ti (VLT) basalt fragments from Chang'e‐6 (CE6) samples. These basalts yield a Pb‐Pb age of around 2.9 Ga, representing the youngest reported VLT volcanism. They are slightly older than the low‐Ti basalts from the same soils and exhibit distinct pyroxene compositions and 238U/204Pb ratios, indicating derivation from distinct mantle sources. Compared to Apollo and Luna VLT basalts, these samples share similarly depleted Sr‐Pb isotopes but display elevated rare earth element concentrations and TiO2 contents. These basalts most likely derived from low‐degree melting of an olivine‐orthopyroxene source followed by 30%–40% fractional crystallization. Further diffusion chronometry reveals rapid magma ascent from magma chamber to surface, likely facilitated by the thin lunar crust resulting from the South Pole‐Aitken basin‐forming impact.

However, the geomagnetic reversal pattern during the Ediacaran–Cambrian transition remains elusive. Here we present an integrated magneto‐ and cyclo‐stratigraphic study of a ∼1.8‐Myr‐long, late Ediacaran succession in Newfoundland, Canada. We obtained a reversal frequency of 10–12 Myr−1, documenting a hyperactively reversing geodynamo during the late Ediacaran. Together with the updated reversal records and paleointensity data sets, we propose a >70‐Myr‐long interval of geomagnetic reversal hyperactivity before the Ordovician Reversed Superchron, forming a hyperactivity‐superchron couplet that recurs in the mid‐Paleozoic and Mesozoic. These findings suggest that the onset of the ∼200‐Myr‐long cycle in geomagnetic field behavior has occurred since at least ∼570 Ma, earlier than previously envisaged."

Many reservoirs experience water level fluctuations including periods of drawdown tied to drought. To examine sensitivity of water clarity to drawdown, we compiled 30 years of water level and Secchi depth measurements in southern Great Plains reservoirs (n = 84) positioned across a climate gradient from the arid west to the wetter east. Mixed‐effect models incorporated reservoir‐specific coefficients relating Secchi depth to water storage volume. Predictions from the best model indicated that many reservoirs lost more than half of their Secchi depth as water levels approached their recorded lows. Reservoirs in west and central Texas tended to experience more severe drawdown and more pronounced loss of water clarity during drawdown. These results show that droughts can cause a dual setback in which the loss of water quantity coincides with loss of water quality in reservoirs."

The event generated seismic, hydroacoustic, and atmospheric infrasound waves recorded by a local network comprising land‐ and iceshelf‐based seismometers, an underwater hydrophone, and an on‐ice infrasound array. Analysis of the seismic and hydroacoustic data shows that the collapse occurred in at least three stages separated by approximately 16.5 and 8 s. The first stage produced a seismic head wave, a P‐wave, and a Rayleigh wave, and clear hydroacoustic and infrasound arrivals. Later stages were dominated by hydroacoustic and seismic Rayleigh waves. Two localization techniques were benchmarked: azimuthal cross‐bearing and a Bayesian joint inversion based on time‐difference‐of‐arrival.

The centroid depth (∼4.8 km) was robustly constrained by seismic and geodetic data. The three‐segment fault model indicates a dominant northward‐propagating rupture with two high‐slip asperities peaking at ∼4 m. The 24‐s rupture involved primarily Faults 1 and 2, with a strike change from N190°E to N150°E and dip angles of 35°–50°. Normal‐faulting dominated above 10 km depth, generating discontinuous surface fractures with vertical offsets up to 2.3 m.

The present study aims to investigate shear‐induced permeability evolution of a natural sandstone fracture using a novel modeling approach. Combining a mechanical discrete element model and a hydraulic finite element model, three normal stress‐related hydro‐mechanical regimes can be identified. Under low normal stress conditions (<4.0 MPa), permeability is enhanced during shearing due to dilation on intact asperities. With increasing normal stress, asperities break and gouge is formed, leading to a normal stress‐related transition where permeability tends to decrease during shearing. In our study, this transition occurs when normal stress equals the rock's ultimate tensile strength (4.0 MPa). For normal stresses >4.0 MPa, permeability decreases during shearing due to intense fracture surface damage."

To understand the geological controls on mixed‐mode frictional behaviors in these settings, we performed friction experiments on fault gouges from the polyphase‐altered carbonate Massenkalk Formation in Germany, a regional priority target for geothermal energy production. The experiments, performed at conditions consistent with ∼4 km deep geothermal reservoir, yield evolved friction coefficients of ∼0.48 for limestone and ∼0.61 for dolostone, whereas the silicate‐carbonate fault gouges exhibit ∼0.55. Dolostone gouges exhibit unstable sliding at low displacement rates, whereas the limestone and silicate‐carbonate gouges are stable at all investigated conditions, with the dolostone and silicate‐carbonate samples exhibiting the most significant microstructural strain localization. These results suggest that the geochemical alteration history of geothermal systems may facilitate hybrid frictional behaviors of seismic and aseismic slip within the same reservoir, and that cataclastic strain localization style is independent of frictional behavior."

Its seasonality, however, shows an out‐of‐phase relation between sea surface temperature (SST) (peaking in December–February, DJF) and wind (peaking in June–August, JJA) indices that remain unclear. Through a mixed‐layer heat budget analysis, we reveal that thermodynamical wind‐evaporation‐SST feedback dominates SPMM‐SST growth, with its efficiency controlled by the seasonal cycle of mixed‐layer depth, dominating SPMM seasonality. Dynamical processes suppress SPMM‐SST anomalies, with meridional advection acting as the dominant damping mechanism in both JJA and DJF, and being particularly strong in JJA. Stronger meridional advection damping in JJA enlarges the DJF peak of SPMM‐SST, indicating a role beyond thermodynamics. Further investigation reveals that the meridional advection arises largely from wind stress‐driven Ekman transport. These findings highlight the importance of meridional advection process in shaping SPMM seasonality, offering insights for improving SPMM‐related climate predictability."

Composite analysis demonstrates that the El Niño–Southern Oscillation induced winds are largely responsible for variations in latent heat flux, which alter MLD and modulate the subduction rates. In addition, a west‐strong/east‐weak subduction rate pattern in 1963–1978 and a west‐weak/east‐strong subduction rate pattern in 1998–2011 are observed.

Enhanced drop coalescence from turbulence substantially increases the production of drizzle embryos just above cloud base, which in turn act as seeds that accelerate rain drop growth at mid and upper cloud levels even in highly polluted conditions. In contrast, pollution aerosols strongly inhibit rainfall when the commonly assumed gravitational‐only collision kernel is used and turbulent coalescence is neglected. Overall, turbulence‐enhanced drop coalescence strongly influences the response of warm cumulus clouds and precipitation to aerosol loading, suggesting that the effects of turbulent coalescence should be included in Earth system model representations of aerosol‐cloud‐precipitation interactions and aerosol indirect radiative forcing."

Here we analyze the strong motion data recorded at a near‐fault station during the 2025 Mw 7.8 Myanmar earthquake to estimate the detailed source process around that station. By comparing simulated velocity waveforms under various conditions with the observed one, we find that a supershear rupture with speed surpassing 2 $\sqrt{2}$ times S‐wave speed is required to fit the first‐order features of the observation. Moreover, a fault barrier at ∼6 km south of the station is inferred by the reversed‐polarity fault‐parallel secondary pulse following the main pulse, interpreted as a stopping phase.

After correcting for SMB‐induced elastic deformation, we find that most GPS sites in the TAM region exhibit velocities approaching zero, with a median rate of 0.67 mm/yr.

This study diagnoses mortality trends in EM‐DAT, the largest public disaster mortality database, using a nonstationary Poisson‐Generalized Pareto statistical model. Several trends in frequency and/or intensity of deadly hazards are identified and discussed. Most notably, Asian floods and storms became less deadly and frequent due to reduced vulnerability via increased adaptive capacity, which is conservatively estimated to have saved 350,000 (95% CI: 220,000–560,000) lives.

Here, simultaneous observations of thermospheric meridional winds and ionospheric electron density from the Sanya Incoherent Scatter Radar (SYISR) reveal that the terdiurnal tide (TDT), a crucial agent in atmosphere‐ionosphere coupling, is strongly correlated with ionospheric F‐layer oscillations on a day‐to‐day basis. During a major sudden stratospheric warming in 2024, day‐to‐day variability of both the TDT amplitudes and F‐layer oscillations exhibited pronounced modulation by enhanced planetary waves (PWs). Bispectral analysis revealed nonlinear interactions between PWs, the TDT, and secondary waves at lower and upper sidebands. The ionospheric bispectrum showed peaks shifted toward shorter periods than the PWs themselves.

Our analysis reveals that both extreme positive and negative IOD (EXpIOD/EXnIOD) events could enhance rainfall over western South Asia during August–September, even when ENSO signals are removed. This asymmetric influence arises from moisture convergence driven by anomalous winds. AGCM simulations indicate that EXpIOD‐related suppressed convection over the eastern pole induces a westward‐extended Gill‐type anticyclone, whose southwesterlies reinforce the background monsoon and promote orographic rainfall near the Western Ghats. Contrastingly, EXnIOD features an eastward‐shifted dipole; positive convection in the east drives a cyclonic circulation that transports Bay of Bengal moisture westward. This flow converges with cross‐equatorial southwesterlies generated by the western pole, enhancing rainfall over western India. These results suggest that the pattern asymmetry between EXpIOD and EXnIOD is a key factor that deserves consideration when assessing IOD‐monsoon interactions."

Discrepancies between recent and previous generations of climate models highlight the need for better representation of low‐level clouds over the Southern Ocean (SO)—a region with unique modeling challenges due to complex interactions among dynamics, microphysics, and radiation, compounded by a historical lack of in situ observations. This study evaluates the performance of a convection‐permitting WRF model configuration during post‐frontal conditions, using recent field campaign data and satellite observations for validation. Our results show that the simulation effectively reproduces the key morphological distinctions between closed and open mesoscale cellular convective clouds (MCC), aligning with both in situ and remote sensing data. The simulation captures the higher cloud cover in closed MCC regions (65%) with lower cloud top heights (1.3 km), compared to open MCC regions (46%) with higher cloud tops (2.3 km), consistent with field measurements. Additionally, the simulation reproduces qualitative differences in ice production and precipitation frequency between closed and open MCCs. However, particularly at higher latitudes, the simulation underestimates cloud cover and significantly underrepresents precipitation and ice production, likely due to limitations in the representation of ice production mechanisms. This research also sets the stage for further analysis of the processes driving the mesoscale organization and transitions between open and closed MCC states (Part II). The combined use of field observations, satellite data, and convection‐permitting simulations provides a comprehensive framework for advancing our understanding of these cloud systems and their role in climate sensitivity."

Specifically, we compare modeling results obtained with and without applying the corrections of the top plume height and wind entrainment coefficient. We show that, by applying the corrections, we significantly reduce the discrepancy between the simulated and satellite‐retrieved ash cloud observations."

Persistent O3 extremes, with daily maximum 8‐hr average (MDA8) of 100–150 ppbv, have become more frequent. Using observations and chemistry‐climate model simulations, we identify key drivers of these trends. As aerosol declines reduce HOx scavenging and enhance radiation, afforestation‐induced increases in isoprene emissions enhance HOx supply during heat waves, thereby accelerating O3 formation in NOx‐rich environments. Aerosol declines have the greatest impact on lower‐percentile O3 increases, while biosphere‐atmosphere interactions during compound heat waves and droughts amplify high‐O3 extremes. On days when observed MDA8 O3 exceeds 100 ppbv, impacts of aerosol decline are statistically insignificant (3.1 ± 4.1 ppbv) while contributions are 6.6 ± 2.0 ppbv from interactions of afforestation‐driven isoprene with urban nitrogen oxides (NOx) and 5.3 ± 2.5 ppbv from reduced stomatal O3 uptake by drought‐stressed vegetation. Droughts limit dry deposition enhancement from afforestation by reducing stomatal uptake. Incorporating afforestation‐related changes in isoprene emissions improves agreement between simulated tropospheric HCHO and satellite observations. Simulated site‐days with MDA8 O3 > 100 ppbv increase from 11% to 18%, aligning with observed 17%. Offsetting afforestation‐driven O3 increases requires 40%–50% reductions in anthropogenic emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Marked NOx reductions over the decade have shifted O3 production in NCP from VOC‐limited to a transitional regime. A 50% joint reduction in anthropogenic VOC and NOx emissions can lower O3 by 13.2 ± 3.3 ppbv, eliminating events above 100 ppbv, whereas reductions below 20% in either are insufficient."

Holmes,The GOES Eastern United States Fire Emissions Inventory,"Prescribed wildland and agricultural fires are common in the eastern United States (U.S.), but their small size and short durations have led polar‐orbiting satellite data sets to underestimate their emissions due to omission. The higher temporal resolution of the GOES‐16 Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) improves fire detection, enabling development of a new biomass burning emissions inventory: GOES Eastern U.S. Fire Emissions (GEUFE, pronounced “goofy”). GEUFE is based on geostationary fire radiative power (FRP) observations, incorporates improved crop type classification for agricultural fires, and includes a new emission factor (EF) compilation for 16 land cover types in the eastern U.S., including forest, crop, and grassland types that differ markedly from globally reported EF values. GEUFE provides daily estimates of dry matter (DM) consumption and emissions of CO2, CO, NOx, NH3, SO2, organic carbon (OC), black carbon (BC), and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) at 2 km resolution. An intercomparison of 10 biomass burning emissions inventories (GEUFE, GBBEPx, QFED, NEI‐2017, RAVE, FEER, VFEI, GFAS, FINN, GFED) showed that OC estimates in the eastern U.S. during August 2019–July 2020 ranged from 0.05 to 1.32 Tg yr−1, with both EFs and DM consumption driving the large spread in aerosol estimates. GEUFE, at 0.64 Tg yr−1, is at the high end of this range due both to region‐specific EFs and continuous GOES‐16 monitoring, reducing missed short‐lived fires. GEUFE is a process‐based inventory that eliminates reliance on empirical scaling factors, such as QFED's aerosol optical depth‐based adjustments, while explaining previously inferred “missing emissions” from small fires."

Thunderstorms represent a major type of precipitation system across the TP and contribute significantly to regional rainfall. This study generated newly a continuous thunderstorm data set clustered by applying the density‐based spatial clustering of application with noise algorithm to lightning data obtained from the World Wide Lightning Location Network from 2010 to 2024. On the basis of this data set, a significant increase in thunderstorm activity was found over the TP in recent two decades, with the maximum rate of increase reaching 2.7 10−4 km−2 thunderstorms per year in the south‐central TP. At the same time, a weak decreasing trend of the thunderstorm intensity, as evidenced by its lightning production capacity. Investigations suggest that the increase in thunderstorm numbers is mainly driven by increased convective available potential energy due to the increased near‐surface moisture over the TP. A decrease in ice‐phase processes and more warm rainfall across the TP, caused by increased near‐surface moisture in western TP and warming in eastern TP, has resulted in decreased thunderstorm intensity. These findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of severe weather changes on the future global energy reallocation and water cycle."

Mini Micropulse Lidar (MPL) observations of the normalized ratio backscatter and depolarization ratios show pollen plumes emanating from the forest on 9 days during the pine and oak pollination time periods, with highly depolarizing particles within the boundary layer up to about 500 m–1.6 km depending on the meteorological conditions. We calculate the total particle backscatter and aerosol optical depth (AOD) on the 9 pollen plume days and find that during pollen plume events, the pollen contributes approximately 50% to the total AOD, with daily contributions ranging from 25% to 97%. Single particle measurements from passive samplers at three heights in and above the forest canopy (1.5, 15, and 30 m) observe pine and oak pollen grains, with biological aerosol particles comprising a large component of supermicron aerosols.

Using 26‐year observations by the Ku band radars onboard the Global Precipitation Mission and the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission satellites, isolated pixels with detectable radar echoes at altitude and without precipitation at the surface are identified as candidate “first echoes.” In general, the appearance of the “first echoes” show three altitude‐related modes in the tropics. The shallow mode at 1.5–2 km is mainly from the growth of warm rain from rapid coalescence. The mid mode between 0°C and −7°C is found mainly over land and coastal regions, that can be explained by the enhanced radar reflectivity by ice particles through heterogenous ice nucleation at relative warmer temperatures, followed by active riming. The deep mode between −12°C and −25°C is frequently found over both land and ocean. Around 12% of isolated echoes, mainly over desert regions, could be the remnant of dissipating precipitation, like virga. Cloud base height and total column water vapor derived from ERA5 reanalysis are found positively related to the “first echo” height. The mid mode first echoes are more likely found in a moist (ice‐supersaturated) environment, a favorable condition for crystal growth following heterogeneous ice nucleation. While the shallow mode over ocean tends to have more sea salt aerosols, large smoke and sulfate aerosol concentrations are often associated with the mid mode, and large dust aerosol concentrations are often involved with the deep mode."

Ullrich,A Greening Future Elevates Flash Drought Risk in Northern Mid‐to‐High Latitudes,"Flash droughts have become a growing concern, as they can emerge rapidly and increase the risk of crop failure. Although past studies have investigated the meteorological drivers and future changes of flash drought, why flash drought is more frequent over humid and vegetated regions remains underexplored. This study delves further into the mechanism by which vegetation regulates flash drought and its future change using observations from multiple data sets and large ensemble simulations from three Earth system models. On an interannual timescale, both observations and simulations show robust increases in flash drought frequency and a higher flash‐to‐sub‐seasonal drought ratio during spring or antecedent conditions with dense vegetation, supporting the important role of vegetation in flash drought occurrence, especially in the northern mid‐to‐high latitudes. In the latter regions, the large ensemble simulations show robust increases in flash drought (e.g., 67% and 46% increases in Eastern U.S. and North Asia in 2050–2100 relative to 1950–2000 under the high emission scenario), where the growing season is lengthening. Although greening might suggest reduced drought stress, it drives precipitation‐soil moisture‐evapotranspiration decoupling by increasing evapotranspiration partitioning to transpiration. As transpiration can access deep soil water through the plant root system, its increased portion can weaken the constraints of concurrent precipitation on evapotranspiration, thus accelerating soil moisture depletion under high evaporative demand, driving a slow‐to‐rapid drought transition. How vegetation regulates flash drought by regulating surface moisture budget is supported by observations and simulations. Although warming supports early planting, agriculture may increasingly be threatened by surging flash drought risk."

We present the first continental‐scale quantification of future climate change impacts on streamflow intermittence, achieved for Europe at a high spatial resolution that captures headwater streams. A hybrid modeling approach combines physics‐based and data‐based modeling, with a random forest model, trained on historical streamflow observations, using predictors representing the impact of climate change on high‐resolution (500 m) streamflow. These predictors were derived from a low‐resolution (50 km) global hydrological model, WaterGAP, which was driven by the outputs of five global climate models. The generated monthly time series of intermittence status for over 1.5 million reaches were used to calculate five ecologically relevant indicators of streamflow intermittence change. In Europe, the number of non‐perennial reach‐months is projected to increase in the future, for both low (SSP1‐RCP2.6) and high (SSP5‐RCP8.5) greenhouse gas emissions scenarios, in almost all climate zones, particularly in August and September. Under SSP1‐RCP2.6, 3.8% of all reach‐months may experience no‐flow conditions in 2071–2100, only a small increase from 3.5% in 1985–2014. Under SSP5‐8.5, however, a larger increase to 4.8% of all reach‐months is expected; 2.8% of European reaches are projected to shift from being perennial to non‐perennial, even where annual precipitation increases, while 0.7% are projected to shift from non‐perennial to perennial. These shifts represent a fundamental change in ecological habitat and connectivity i.e. bound to erode aquatic species diversity and alter ecosystem functions across more than 87.000 km of river segments."

Most experimental studies rely on short‐term, single‐factor experiments in stable and food‐unlimited environments, making it difficult to provide practical guidance to growers and decision‐makers. To address this knowledge gap, we developed a land‐based automated system to expose bivalves to future climate scenarios under field‐realistic conditions using unfiltered, ambient seawater, assessing survival, growth, reproduction, and next‐generation development. Here we present the first results of exposing Pacific oysters and Mediterranean mussels, the two most cultivated species in the Mediterranean area, to present conditions and projected scenarios for the years 2050, 2075, and 2100. For the first time, our results reveal that future warming and acidification conditions have a dramatic impact on the production yield of oysters and mussels. Oysters exposed to conditions projected for 2100 exhibited a 7% reduction in survival and a 40% reduction in growth rate, along with lower reproductive maturity, which in turn negatively affected the early development of their offspring. Mussels are already experiencing summer temperatures above their upper thermal limits, with around 40% mortality observed under current conditions and near‐total mortality under those projected for 2050. These patterns reflect sporadic mass‐mortality events reported elsewhere in the Mediterranean and indicate that mussel farming in the region could be severely compromised by mid‐century.

Using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) models, we assess projected changes in compound heatwaves (CHWs, defined as co‐occurring daytime and nighttime heatwaves) across Africa at three global warming levels (GWLs; 1.5°C, 2°C, and 3°C) and under three Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP245, SSP370, and SSP585). Our findings reveal a robust intensification of CHWs with increasing GWLs across all scenarios. Even though the projected change is consistent across all three scenarios, under SSP370 the population exposure is higher due to a larger increase in population. Similarly, under SSP585, the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) exposure is higher because of rapid GDP growth fueled by fossil energy. Western, central, and eastern Africa are the most affected, with exposures increasing by tens to thousands of times. Additionally, rare CHWs historically occurring once every 50 or 100 years are projected to become more frequent, potentially recurring every 5–6 years, even under modest 1.5°C warming. We find a strong, statistically significant positive correlation (r > 0.85, p < 0.01) between near‐surface temperature and changes in CHW metrics, indicating continued warming will further exacerbate CHWs. Surface energy budget analysis reveals that this projected warming is driven primarily by enhanced net downwelling surface radiation, modulated by enhanced downwelling longwave radiation under clear‐sky conditions. Strengthening mid‐to upper‐tropospheric anticyclonic systems further contribute to warming."

However, tracking progress under the Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) policy, which aims to balance degradation with restoration, requires a systematic assessment of cumulative trends, a critical underexplored gap. Here, we present the first comprehensive annual assessment of land‐use changes in these hotspots (1992–2022) guided by the LDN framework. We found that 9.4% of hotspots experienced land‐use change, with rates declining by 0.06 Mha/year (1992–2015) before accelerating to 0.4 Mha/year (2016–2022). While human‐driven impacts (e.g., deforestation, agriculture shifts) initially dominated, causing net natural ecosystem losses, post‐2015 land‐use improvement efforts (e.g., revegetation) increased. Yet, net land‐use degradation outweighed improvement, resulting in a land‐use debt of 29.1 Mha (0.9% of global hotspots). Driven by tropical deforestation, dryland degradation, agricultural shifts and urbanization, this debt correlated with impaired ecosystem structure and function. For instance, agricultural dynamics strongly correlated with reduced greenness in high‐debt continents like Asia and the Americas (r = −0.92 and r = −0.80, respectively). Despite continental‐scale greenness stabilization post‐2015 (stable NDVI > 92%), these regions showed reversed carbon uptake, with net primary productivity declining to −0.0032 and −0.002 Kg C/m2 yr−1, respectively. This vegetation greenness paradox, where stable structural greenness masks functional degradation, reveals that current improvements remain insufficient to offset historical degradation, and that structural stabilization may not guarantee functional integrity. Thus, reversing land‐use debt necessitates a locally tailored policy framework that prioritizes functional recovery alongside structural greening to ensure LDN restoration practices deliver ecosystem integrity in these hotspots."

Data from five different satellite instruments going back to 2001 show that Canada and most provinces and territories experienced peak visible‐wavelength aerosol optical depth and ultraviolet aerosol index values in 2023. Longer‐term, 2023 had the highest number of “smoke” or “haze” reports in weather records by a factor of two compared with the previous record in 1981, and by a factor of seven compared with the 1953–2022 average. These reports show an east‐to‐west shift in Canada's summer air pollution patterns. Smoke and haze in eastern Canada have decreased since the 1980s because of pollution control measures domestically and in the US. On the other hand, wildfire smoke has increased in the Northwest Territories, British Columbia, Alberta, and Saskatchewan since the 2010s, and is now the main air quality concern in western Canada. Interpreting the analysis here for Canada alongside previous work over the US, there was a shift over North America in summer air quality concerns from the east to the west. Climate model projections suggest more wildfire‐driven smoke in the future throughout North America, particularly in the west. In contrast to air pollution from smokestacks and tailpipes that can be addressed at the source through government regulation, a future with more wildfire smoke will require downwind mitigation and will be the responsibility of public health officials."

While process‐based models and remote sensing can bridge this data gap, their estimates often fail to capture real IWW and are associated with large uncertainties. Here, we present a knowledge‐informed, explainable machine learning framework that combines random forest (RF) with Shapley additive explanations to generate spatially explicit IWW estimates across China. Our framework incorporates irrigation domain knowledge, state‐of‐the‐art irrigated cropland maps, and various socioeconomic, hydroclimatic, and auxiliary factors. RF shows reasonable performance in spatial and temporal cross‐validation, achieving a coefficient of determination exceeding 0.85 and a root mean square error below 0.45 km3/year when evaluated against held‐out prefecture‐level data. The predictions of IWW depth are primarily driven by geographic and knowledge‐based predictors, most of which exhibit nonlinear and non‐monotonic impacts on model outputs. By integrating the RF model with a temporal downscaling approach, we develop a new gridded IWW product for China (named CIWW1km), which provides monthly IWW depth and volume at 1 km resolution from 2000 to 2020. CIWW1km aligns closely with prefecture‐level IWW reports and explains over 85% of the variance in independent IWW observations (i.e., data excluded from training) across over 150 basins and counties. It highlights a rapid increase in IWW in China's arid zone, driven by irrigated area expansions.

Understanding its variability is crucial for improving predictions on subseasonal‐to‐seasonal timescales and for developing reliable climate change projections.

Temporal analysis reveals the impacts of major socioeconomic and climatic disruptions on urban water use in the period 2011–2021, including the COVID lockdown, the rapid growth of data centers, and the drought of 2012. In addition, our analysis suggests that economic growth in small and mid‐sized US cities continues to be accompanied by rising water use, contrasting with the opposite trend observed in large cities in prior studies. This implies that as smaller cities develop, their water use may increase above current levels until incomes reach a higher threshold, highlighting the need to improve water use efficiency.

These disproportionate impacts create shared challenges that require cross‐border mitigation efforts. However, understanding how coastal areas exhibit common risk patterns and how such patterns can inform risk‐based cooperation remains fairly limited. Here, we investigated international cooperation potential among 126 coastal countries from an integrated perspective of their risk similarity, geopolitical stance, and knowledge exchange. We conducted a high‐resolution assessment of multiple hazard risks (including earthquakes, landslides, flooding, and cyclones) and developed a bottom‐up similarity measure to identify common risk profiles across regions from both size and space. Our analysis revealed a notably high degree of risk similarity across country pairs, suggesting greater potential for cooperation than that previously recognized; 89% of country pairs with high risk similarity lacked strong partnerships in consensus‐building or knowledge‐sharing. This cooperation gap was even more pronounced in the Global South and small island developing states. Instead of relying solely on geographic proximity or existing alliances, we argue for a shift in focus toward partnerships grounded in shared risk challenges.

First, we classify TWL storms based on their shape. We identify four storm types around Europe that reflect the different relative contributions of TWL components. Second, we introduce a method to determine the duration of individual historical storms, which is applied to estimate the durations of return level events using storm duration functions. We emphasize the importance of accurate duration functions, especially for the longest storms observed in the Mediterranean Sea, for both historical and extrapolated return period events. Third, we implement a new method to design hydrographs for extreme events, enabling the assessment of water volumes resulting from different scenarios.

Here we apply a statistical attribution‐and‐projection approach to thousands of streamgages across CONUS and assess how the frequency of flood events is expected to change under multiple scenarios. We find that more frequent flood events are projected for the eastern United States, whereas decreases are slightly more common than increases in the U.S. Southwest and Great Plains. Additionally, the seasonality of flood events is projected to shift, with distinct regional patterns based on geography, topography, and season. These changes are expected to manifest themselves by the middle of this century, highlighting the pressing needs for flood mitigation and adaptation efforts."

Here, we introduce an integrated modeling framework to jointly explore water and sediment release strategies alongside dam planning, addressing the complex interplay between sediment transport, hydrology, and reservoir operations. Applied to the 3S river basin, a critical tributary of the Mekong River, the framework provides novel insights into optimizing sediment connectivity and hydropower production. By analyzing spatio‐temporal sediment dynamics and employing multi‐objective optimization, we assess how coordinated reservoir management can reconcile competing objectives. Our results show a fundamental shift in sediment transport dynamics, with hydropower infrastructure replacing hydro‐climatic variability as the dominant control. Since 2018, sediment loads at the basin outlet have dropped from an average of 25 Mt/yr to less than 10 Mt/yr, primarily due to Lower Sesan 2 dam. Optimizing flushing and sluicing strategies, we reveal the importance of coordinated reservoir operations: 57% of the identified Pareto‐optimal solutions outperform current dam management practices in all the objectives considered. This study highlights the importance of integrating sediment management with hydropower development and operations, providing a transferable framework for sustainable river basin management globally."

However, these objectives often conflict, as habitat loss and fragmentation caused by transportation networks and subsequent development are regarded as significant threats to biodiversity. Quantifying the extent of these contradictions and identifying strategies for balancing these goals are essential. In this study, an index of natural habitat areas without roads (i.e., roadless areas) is employed to quantify the contradiction and analyze changes in China's roadless areas from 2000 to 2020, with projections for potential changes from 2020 to 2035. The findings indicate that China's roadless area decreased significantly from 4.94 million km2 in 2000 to 4.31 million km2 in 2020, reflecting a reduction rate of 12.7%. It is conservatively estimated that this loss will continue at a rate of 4.58% over the next 15 years. Currently, only 22.8% and 35.8% of the total roadless area in 2020 are situated within biodiversity conservation priority areas and protected areas, respectively, highlighting significant conservation gaps. To address the rapid decline and inadequate protection of roadless areas in China, this study proposes several recommendations, including optimizing transportation route planning to avoid unnecessary loss of roadless area, constructing wildlife crossing structures to enhance habitat connectivity, and integrating high ecological value roadless areas into the conservation framework. This study offers valuable insights into the effective protection of ecosystem integrity amidst the expansion of road networks and presents new solutions for ensuring timely compliance with international agreements, such as the Convention on Biological Diversity."

Climate projections are rarely downscaled appropriately to assess future changes in storm surge and concurrent river discharge extremes, and their interactions to exacerbate flooding. This is the first time that hourly and fine spatial resolution (7/2.2 km sea level/precipitation), physically consistent, climate projections are used to assess changes in storm surge and river discharge‐driven compound events. The analysis, applied to the Dyfi estuary, western UK, uses 12 downscaled perturbed parameter ensembles for the high‐emissions “RCP8.5” scenario from a global climate model (HadGEM3‐GC3.0). Residual surge and river discharge projections are assessed independently to identify changes in magnitudes and return periods—then combined to identify changing patterns of dependence and timing of compound events. Under RCP8.5 scenario to 2080, river discharge is expected to increase by 28%–29% for 1/20 and 1/50‐year events. Extreme (95th percentile) discharge events are more likely to occur concurrently with extreme surges, and compound events will occur more often, and with a shorter time lag between peak surge and peak discharge—potentially compounding flooding further. The analysis provided forcing conditions representative of future 1 in 20‐year and 1 in 50‐year events used to simulate a potential increased flood footprint in the estuary. The research raises the question of the wider pattern of future compound events throughout the UK, and worldwide, highlighting the critical need for downscaled, coastal and fluvial projections to futureproof flood management strategies."

While nitrogen fertilization and water‐saving irrigation are recognized as effective GHG mitigation strategies in rice cultivation, their synergistic effects and underlying mechanisms remain inadequately characterized. Based on 2,689 observations from 203 peer‐reviewed articles across 129 sites in major Asian rice cultivation areas, this meta‐analysis quantifies the comprehensive impacts of coupled water‐nitrogen management on rice yield and GHG emissions. Results revealed that nitrogen fertilization alone increased yield by 38.26% but elevated global warming potential (GWP) by 56.98%, whereas Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) irrigation reduced CH4 emissions (50.71%) and GWP (43.73%) without significantly affecting yield. Combined implementation of both practices increased yield by 46.67% while reducing yield‐scaled GWP (GHGI) by 36.17%. Under AWD conditions, nitrogen application rates of 180–270 kg ha−1 maximized GHGI reduction potential (42.31%). Random forest analysis identified soil pH, fertilizer type and precipitation as key determinants of mitigation efficacy. Our spatially‐explicit water‐nitrogen optimization model demonstrated that 67% of regional rice fields are suitable for AWD implementation, and that current nitrogen inputs could be reduced by 31% while maintaining yields and achieving a 49% reduction in GHGI. This study reveals critical water‐nitrogen synergistic mechanisms in rice agroecosystems and provides quantitative frameworks for optimizing management practices at regional scales, offering a sustainable pathway toward achieving future food security and climate change mitigation goals in Earth's most productive rice regions."

In today's rapidly warming world, many changes in the climate are detectable, even in the presence of internal variability, but whether climate changes under net zero are expected to be detectable is less well understood. Here, we use a set of 1000‐year‐long net zero carbon dioxide emissions simulations branching from different points in the 21st century to examine detectability of large‐scale, regional and local climate changes as time passes under net zero emissions. We find that even after net zero, there are continued detectable changes to climate for centuries. While local changes and changes in extremes are more challenging to detect, Southern Hemisphere warming and Northern Hemisphere cooling become detectable at many locations within a few centuries under net zero emissions. We also study how detectable delays in achieving emissions cessation are across climate indices. We find that for global mean surface temperature and other large‐scale indices, such as Antarctic and Arctic sea ice extent, the effects of an additional 5 years of high greenhouse gas emissions are detectable. Such delays in emissions cessation result in significantly different local temperatures for most of the planet, and most of the global population. The long simulations used here help with identifying local climate change signals. Multi‐model frameworks will be useful to examine confidence in these changes and improve understanding of post‐net zero climate changes."

Using Community Earth System Model ensemble simulations, we assess the response of climate metrics relevant to a set of climate tipping elements in SAI scenarios targeting different temperature stabilization goals and for implementation at different latitudes. We analyze responses of tipping element metrics in simulations of a multi‐objective SAI strategy that is designed to simultaneously stabilize global mean temperature (T0), interhemispheric temperature gradient (T1), and equator‐to‐pole temperature gradient (T2), as well as simulations of SAI strategies designed just to stabilize T0. We show that SAI strategies considered here would reduce the risks for many tipping elements, but may either increase or decrease the risk of Antarctic ice sheet collapse and Sahel greening, depending on the specifics of injection strategy. For the same 1.0°C temperature stabilization target, high‐latitude injection would reduce the risk of northern cryosphere‐related tipping elements more effectively, such as Greenland ice sheet, Barents winter sea ice, and boreal permafrost. Meanwhile, low‐latitude injection would be more effective in stabilizing low‐latitude biosphere‐related tipping elements such as Amazon rainforest and coral reefs. The multi‐objective SAI injection is more effective in reducing the risk of most high‐latitude tipping elements than low‐latitude injection, and is more effective in reducing the risk of most low‐latitude tipping elements than high‐latitude injection. Our study highlights the importance of careful consideration in the trade‐offs between tipping element risk reduction and temperature pattern optimization in response to SAI strategies."

Since individuals' dietary behavior is largely influenced by their demographic and anthropometric attributes, it is crucial to identify individuals who have a high dietary WF and prioritize them as the focus of policies. Several studies analyzing the driving factors behind dietary WF exist but have multiple limitations. These include the statistical models with rather modest performances, lack of rigorous sensitivity analysis/feature importance (FI) analysis, and lack of generalization ability. Here, we developed a novel ML‐based framework for analyzing the driving forces behind dietary WF. The framework incorporated three machine learning (ML) models (Extra‐Trees (ET), Histogram‐based Gradient Boosting (HGB), and eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)) and an ML explanation approach Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). This framework was applied to a case study on Chinese inhabitants. The derived results validated the proposed framework and demonstrated ML's superiority over conventional statistical methods. XGB was identified as the optimal model as it effectively captured the variability in the data and showed good generalization performance. The FI analysis for XGB revealed the most influential features on dietary WF, with income level, urbanization level, education level, and gender emerging as the top four features in descending order. Through the subsequent SHAP dependence analysis, the priority groups for dietary WF reduction interventions were identified as high‐income residents, urban residents, highly educated residents, and male residents. In light of these findings and their underlying causes, the paper concluded with a set of policy recommendations."

Crop production depends not only on yield but also on the harvestable fraction (HF), the ratio of harvested areas to planted areas. While the impacts of climate fluctuations on crop yields are well‐document, the role of HF‐a critical yet underexplored factor‐remains poorly understood. This study introduces HF as a key metric for assessing how temperature, drought, and precipitation affect the production of major staple crops (winter wheat, spring wheat, and maize) in the United States at the county level. Our findings indicate that Killing Degree Days (KDD) and Drought Days (DD) are key drivers of production declines, reducing both yield and HF. From 1982 to 2020, changes in KDD and DD led to more significant reductions in crop production in the Midwest compared to other regions. Projections for 2021–2100 under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) indicate even steeper declines in yield, HF and production, especially under the high‐emission scenario (SSP5‐8.5), with anticipated net production decreases of 6.08%, 8.2%, and 7.57% for the three crops. Although HF may increase in colder regions, this does not offset losses in warmer areas, leading to net HF decreases of 0.36%, 2.09%, and 5.82% for the three crops. This study finds that drought and extreme heat considerably reduce food production by simultaneously lowering yields and HF and underscores the need for adaptive strategies that address both yield and HF to enhance food security in a changing climate."

Horowitz,Impact of Future Methane Emission Trajectories on Atmospheric Composition and Climate in a Future Hydrogen Economy,"Hydrogen (H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$) is projected to have an increasingly important role in a future low‐carbon economy. In a future H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ economy, H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ emissions could increase across the supply chain. When H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$, a radiatively inert gas, is emitted, it undergoes similar chemical reactions to methane (CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$) in the atmosphere, leading to detrimental climate as well as air quality effects. Here, we study the interactions between hypothetical future increases in H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ emissions and possible future CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$ emission trajectories, utilizing the GFDL AM4.1 atmospheric chemistry‐climate model (CCM) driven by H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ and CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$ emissions to more fully simulate their chemical feedbacks. Due to their chemical coupling, the effects of H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ on atmospheric composition are dependent on background CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$ emission levels. However, despite this dependency, the climate impact of H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ remains largely independent of background CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$ emission levels, because of offsetting changes in the forcing from radiatively active gases as well as model rapid adjustments. Next, we find that an ambitious 45% anthropogenic CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$ emission reduction not only delivers greater surface cooling than the surface warming caused from a hypothetical high‐end 480% H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ emission increase, but also effectively counteracts the atmospheric composition impacts from the increase in H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ emissions as well. Increased H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ adoption in an H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ economy, replacing fossil fuels, could contribute to reductions in other short‐lived climate forcer emissions, such as ozone precursors and aerosols. When these additional reductions are considered, CH4 ${\mathrm{H}}_{4}$ mitigation is increasingly important so as to maximize the climate and air quality benefits of an H2 ${\mathrm{H}}_{2}$ economy."

Despite their importance, our understanding of long‐term changes in global nitrogen cycles remains limited. The foliar nitrogen stable isotope ratio (δ15N) serves as a valuable metric for assessing changes in nitrogen cycling and potentially in plant nitrogen availability. However, existing observations of δ15N suffer from spatial bias and temporal discontinuity with contradictory findings across biomes, hindering our ability to detect and attribute drivers of change. Leveraging ground‐based observations as our calibration source, we derived annual maps of foliar δ15N spanning from 1984 to 2022 globally from Landsat spectra. We found that the Landsat‐derived δ15N effectively captured the observations, with an R2 of 0.77 and a normalized root mean square error of 0.15. Globally, we found widespread temporal changes in δ15N with significant decreases for 44% and increases for 16% of vegetated ecosystems. Foliar δ15N mostly declined in forest ecosystems but increased in non‐forest land cover types. Gross primary productivity and its trend consistently explained spatiotemporal variation of δ15N globally, indicating increasing plant demand could lead to decreasing δ15N. Our study presents an innovative approach to effectively monitor and track potential changes in global nitrogen cycles over the past four decades, setting the stage for more impactful management and conservation strategies."

We used birth records in 2011–2020. Mean, minimum, and maximum daily temperatures were obtained from meteorological stations in 26 municipalities representing different climatic zones of Chile. We explored different windows of exposure (entire pregnancy, trimester, and gestational week) and calculated temperature percentiles based on climatic zone for each window. The 50th percentile served as the reference for comparison. General additive models and distributed lag nonlinear models (DLNM) adjusted for month and year of last menstrual cycle, maternal and paternal: age, education, and employment. Exposure to cold mean temperatures (≤10th percentile) in the total pregnancy period and each trimester was associated with a lower mean birth weight (−28.7 g for the total period, −45.9, −36.1, and −83.4 g for trimester 1, 2, and 3, respectively), whereas exposure to warm mean temperatures was associated with higher birth weight (21.3 g for >90th percentile). For extreme temperatures, exposure to both cold (≤10th percentile for minimum) and hot (>90th percentile for maximum) in the total pregnancy period related to lower birth weight: −48.7 g (95% CI −49.7; −47.6) and −17.48 g (95% CI −18.5; −16.4), respectively, with similar effects by trimester. In DLNM, consistent effects were observed later in pregnancy. Lower birthweight was observed with exposure to extreme cold and heat, while warmer mean temperatures were associated with higher birthweight.

Previous research highlights the environmental justice implications of this situation in the US, including fugitive methane emissions and the disproportionate concentration of pipelines in counties with high social vulnerability. However, gaps in publicly‐available data make it difficult to understand the intersection of social factors, pipeline prevalence, and race, particularly in rural areas and at community‐level spatial scales. This study begins to address this gap by examining the relationship between natural gas pipeline prevalence and demographics at the census block group level. This study uses North Carolina as a case study due to the state's dramatic increase in natural gas consumption driving an increase in pipeline infrastructure in recent years. This work highlights two critical findings: First, African American and American Indian people make up a disproportionately large share of the population living in block groups characterized by high social vulnerability and high densities of natural gas pipelines. Second, our main finding is insensitive to the threshold used to determine disproportionality, suggesting these results are robust. These data demonstrate a need for more equitable methods for energy infrastructure planning and maintenance.

Land‐use patterns (e.g., proximity to agriculture) and soil properties (e.g., moisture) are associated with abundance of individual pathogenic bacteria. However, there are major uncertainties in (a) the importance of local/regional land‐use decisions relative to overall natural variability of pathogenicity and (b) the correlations among pathogen abundance, climate‐linked physical processes increasing pathogen mobility, and the vulnerability of human receptors. This impairs identification of priority areas for outbreak surveillance, which has traditionally focused on food and water distribution networks, and the development of process‐based risk screening models. Here, we analyze a novel data set of 622 soil samples covering 42 of the 48 contiguous United States. We describe (a) the relationship between putative pathogenicity and natural and land‐use drivers and (b) how hotspots of putative pathogen abundance intersect with climate‐linked hazard of mobilization via fire, floods, wind, and fluvial transport, and the social vulnerability of local human populations. Variability in putative pathogenicity can be partially explained by known drivers, with natural variables having greater explanatory power than land‐use variables. Relative abundance of putative pathogens is generally higher in forested ecoregions, notably in the eastern and southeastern United States and in proximity to surface waters. Higher relative abundance of putative pathogens, climate risks promoting pathogen mobility, and a relatively vulnerable rural population intersect in the southeastern United States.

Here, we developed a risk assessment tool for coastal communities, leveraging hindcast oceanographic simulations (2017–2019), to link changes in temperature and salinity at the coastline to high wastewater concentrations. We first calculated the modeled timescales (i.e., duration and return time) of wastewater exposure for popular beaches in the region. Most high wastewater exposure events occurred about once a month and lasted less than a week at the southern locations (e.g., Imperial Beach), and occurred less frequently and for shorter periods of time further north (e.g., Coronado). Using the same hindcast simulations, we then identified relationships between anomalous environmental conditions and wastewater concentration along the coastline. High wastewater concentrations were typically associated with lower salinity and temperature, reflecting the low salinity of wastewater and the colder temperatures of water originating south of the USA‐Mexico border. Statistical models with only parameters of salinity and temperature anomalies captured a large proportion of the variation in wastewater‐associated risk of illness (R2 = 0.63–0.78). We tested the risk assessment approach with several months of recent observations (January–December 2024) to show how this tool may be practically applied.

 The majority of breast cancers are driven by oestrogen receptor-α (ERα) activation, and endocrine therapy represents the mainstay treatment for these patients1. However, resistance is common and tumours often progress after years of endocrine suppression2. Periodic fasting enhances the efficacy of standard endocrine therapy and delays acquired drug resistance, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear3. Here we show that fasting induces extensive epigenetic reprogramming in ERα-positive breast cancer xenografts when combined with endocrine therapy, with large-scale activation of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and progesterone receptor signalling and concomitant reduction in the activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) family members. GR-driven gene programmes are selectively activated in in vivo models of ERα-positive breast cancer during fasting, and GR knockout hinders the anti-tumour effects of fasting combined with tamoxifen. Exogenous administration of GR ligands recapitulates fasting-enhanced anti-oestrogen action, thus promoting tumour regression. Patients undergoing a cyclic fasting-mimicking diet exhibited increased blood progesterone and cortisol concentrations. Additionally, tumours collected after the fasting-mimicking diet showed an inverse correlation of GR activation with proliferation markers, providing clinical confirmation of our observations in animal models. Our results indicate that GR activation has a pivotal role in the ability of fasting to enhance endocrine therapy activity in breast cancer and suggest that corticosteroid administration should be evaluated as an adjuvant to endocrine therapy in this setting. Beneficial effects of fasting combined with endocrine therapy for oestrogen receptor-α-expressing breast cancers can be recapitulated using exogenous glucocorticoid receptor ligands instead of fasting to reduce harmful effects."

 Dislocations are the crystalline defects responsible for the mechanical properties of conventional metals and alloys. When they become scarce or constrained, such as in nanocrystals1, grain-boundary-based mechanisms may compensate and lead to permanent deformation2,3. Shear-migration coupling is thought to be the most efficient of these processes4,5, but despite intense research activity, no consensus has emerged to quantify the possible shear produced by a migrating grain boundary6. Here we show experimentally that, in small-grained polycrystals, this shear does not depend on the grain boundary misorientation and that its efficiency remains low. These findings support a new concept of grain boundaries that may not be considered as crystalline defects carrying an intrinsic ‘coupling factor’7 (similarly to the Burgers vector of a dislocation) but rather as specific lattices containing peculiar defects, known as disconnections, that will, in turn, govern the properties, at least mechanical, of grain boundaries. They also confirm that polycrystals can plastically deform without dislocations but less effectively, providing a potential path to explain the poor ductility of nanocrystalline metals at low and room temperature. Experimental observations in small-grained polycrystals suggest a new concept of considering metallic grain boundaries not as defects but as separate defect-containing lattices, providing a potential explanation for the deformation behaviour of nanocrystalline metals."

 Gene drive technology presents a transformative approach to combatting malaria by introducing genetic modifications into wild mosquito populations to reduce their vectorial capacity. Although effective modifications have been developed, these efforts have been confined to laboratories in the global north. We previously demonstrated that modifying Anopheles gambiae to express two exogenous antimicrobial peptides inhibits the sporogonic development of laboratory-cultured Plasmodium falciparum, with models predicting substantial contributions to malaria elimination in Africa when integrated with gene drive1–3. However, the effectiveness of this modification against genetically diverse, naturally circulating parasite isolates remained unknown. To address this critical gap, we adapted our technology for an African context by establishing infrastructural and research capacity in Tanzania, enabling the engineering of local A. gambiae under containment. Here we report the generation of a transgenic strain equipped with non-autonomous gene drive capabilities that robustly inhibits genetically diverse P. falciparum isolates obtained from naturally infected children. These genetic modifications were efficiently inherited by progeny when supplemented with Cas9 endonuclease provided by another locally engineered strain. Our work brings gene drive technology a critical step closer to application, providing a locally tailored and powerful tool for malaria eradication through the targeted dissemination of beneficial genetic traits in wild mosquito populations.

 Type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) are unique in their efferocytosis1 and cross-presenting abilities2, resulting in antigen-specific T cell immunity3 or tolerance4–8. However, the mechanisms that underlie cDC1 tolerogenic function remain largely unknown. Here we show that the erythropoietin receptor (EPOR) acts as a critical switch that determines the tolerogenic function of cDC1s and the threshold of antigen-specific T cell responses. In total lymphoid irradiation-induced allograft tolerance9,10, cDC1s upregulate EPOR expression, and conditional knockout of EPOR in cDC1s diminishes antigen-specific induction and expansion of FOXP3+ regulatory T (Treg) cells, resulting in allograft rejection. Mechanistically, EPOR promotes efferocytosis-induced tolerogenic maturation7,11 of splenic cDC1s towards late-stage CCR7+ cDC1s characterized by increased expression of the integrin β8 gene12 (Itgb8), and conditional knockout of Itgb8 in cDC1s impairs tolerance induced by total lymphoid irradiation plus anti-thymocyte serum. Migratory cDC1s in peripheral lymph nodes preferentially express EPOR, and their FOXP3+ Treg cell-inducing capacity is enhanced by erythropoietin. Reciprocally, loss of EPOR enables immunogenic maturation of peripheral lymph node migratory and splenic CCR7+ cDC1s by upregulating genes involved in MHC class II- and class I-mediated antigen presentation, cross-presentation and costimulation. EPOR deficiency in cDC1s reduces tumour growth by enhancing anti-tumour T cell immunity, particularly increasing the generation of precursor exhausted tumour antigen-specific CD8+ T cells13 in tumour-draining lymph nodes and supporting their maintenance within tumours, while concurrently reducing intratumoural Treg cells. Targeting EPOR on cDC1s to induce or inhibit T cell immune tolerance could have potential for treating a variety of diseases. The tolerogenic activity of type 1 conventional dendritic cells (cDC1s) is determined by EPOR, which is preferentially expressed in cDC1s and induces antigen-specific FOXP3-expressing regulatory T cells."

 Microfold (M) cells are rare intestinal epithelial cells that reside in the follicle-associated epithelium of Peyer’s patches1. M cells transport luminal antigens to submucosal antigen-presenting cells2,3. These insights primarily derive from transmission electron microscopy and studies using genetically modified mice2–4. Here we establish an intestinal organoid model to study human M cells and reconstruct the differentiation trajectory of M cells through transcriptome profiling. The results indicate that as well as facilitating luminal antigen transport, human M cells also directly present antigens via the class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC-II). Notably, the related enterocytes only express MHC-II in chronic inflammatory states and do not express typical dendritic cell markers. Human M cells physiologically express a gene profile that resembles that of dendritic cells. Similar to dendritic cells, M cell development is induced by RANKL and CSF2 and requires the transcription factors SPIB and RUNX2. HLA-DQ2.5 M cells process and present gluten antigen as demonstrated in organoid–T cell co-culture assays. These findings suggest that M cells may have a central role in coeliac disease.

 Iron–sulfur (Fe–S) clusters are essential metallocofactors that perform a multitude of biological functions1–7. Their synthesis is tightly regulated and defects in this process lead to severe diseases8–10, such as Friedreich’s ataxia, which is caused by defective expression of frataxin (FXN)11. However, the underlying mechanisms that regulate this process remain unclear. Here we show that efficient Fe–S cluster assembly requires a fine-tuned balance in the ratio of FXN and ferredoxin-2 (FDX2). Fe–S clusters are assembled on the scaffold protein ISCU2; sulfur is provided as a persulfide by NFS1, and the persulfide is cleaved into sulfide by FDX2 (refs. 12,13). FXN stimulates the whole process by accelerating the transfer of persulfide to ISCU2 (refs. 12,14,15). Using an in-vitro-reconstituted human system, we show that any deviation from a close-to-equal amount of FXN and FDX2 downregulates Fe–S cluster synthesis. Structure–function investigation reveals that this is due to competition between FXN and FDX2 and their similar affinities for the same binding site on the NFS1–ISCU2 complex, with higher levels of FXN impairing the persulfide reductase activity of FDX2 and higher levels of FDX2 slowing the FXN-accelerated transfer of persulfide to ISCU2. We also find that FDX2 directly hinders persulfide generation and transfer to ISCU2 by interacting with the persulfide-carrying mobile loop of NFS1. We further show that knocking down the expression of FDX2 increases fly lifespan in a Drosophila model of Friedreich’s ataxia. Together, this work highlights a direct regulation of Fe–S cluster biosynthesis through antagonistic binding of FXN and FDX2, and suggests that decreasing FDX2 in the context of FXN deficiency in Friedreich’s ataxia might constitute a novel therapeutic axis. A finely balanced ratio of ferredoxin-2 (FDX2) and frataxin (FXN) is essential for the synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters, and interventions targeting this ratio could provide a way to treat related diseases, such as Friedreich’s ataxia."

Conde;Jean-François Lemaître;Fernando Colchero;Shinichi Nakagawa,Sterilization and contraception increase lifespan across vertebrates,"Data collected from zoos and aquariums worldwide show that hormonal contraception or permanent surgical sterilization in mammals increase life expectancy, with different mechanisms in males and females. 
 Reproduction is hypothesized to constrain lifespan1,2 and contribute to sex differences in ageing3–5. Various sterilization and contraception methods inhibit reproduction, but predictions differ for how these influence survival, depending on sex5, how sex hormones are affected4 and species life history6. Here, using data from mammalian species housed in zoos and aquariums worldwide, we show that ongoing hormonal contraception and permanent surgical sterilization are associated with increased life expectancy. These effects occur in both males and females, although the sexes are differently protected from specific causes of death. Evidence of improved survival in males is also restricted to castration, with stronger effects occurring after pre-pubertal surgery. Complementary meta-analyses of published data reveal improved survival with sterilization across vertebrates and increased healthspan in gonadectomized rodents. Improved survival occurs in laboratory and wild environments, and with female sterilization approaches that either remove the ovaries or leave them intact. Reported increases in survival in castrated men7–9 resemble the effects in other species, whereas survival of women is slightly decreased after permanent surgical sterilization. Thus the hormonal drive to reproduce constrains adult survival across vertebrates, regardless of the environment in which an animal resides. Data collected from zoos and aquariums worldwide show that hormonal contraception or permanent surgical sterilization in mammals increase life expectancy, with different mechanisms in males and females."

 Fire-making is a uniquely human innovation that stands apart from other complex behaviours such as tool production, symbolic culture and social communication. Controlled fire use provided adaptive opportunities that had profound effects on human evolution. Benefits included warmth, protection from predators, cooking and creation of illuminated spaces that became focal points for social interaction1–3. Fire use developed over a million years, progressing from harvesting natural fire to maintaining and ultimately making fire4. However, determining when and how fire use evolved is challenging because natural and anthropogenic burning are hard to distinguish5–7. Although geochemical methods have improved interpretations of heated deposits, unequivocal evidence of deliberate fire-making has remained elusive. Here we present evidence of fire-making on a 400,000-year-old buried landsurface at Barnham (UK), where heated sediments and fire-cracked flint handaxes were found alongside two fragments of iron pyrite—a mineral used in later periods to strike sparks with flint. Geological studies show that pyrite is locally rare, suggesting it was brought deliberately to the site for fire-making. The emergence of this technological capability provided important social and adaptive benefits, including the ability to cook food on demand—particularly meat—thereby enhancing digestibility and energy availability, which may have been crucial for hominin brain evolution3.

Zurlo,Observation of deuteron and antideuteron formation from resonance-decay nucleons,"The ALICE Collaboration provides details on the microscopic mechanism that ends up creating antideuteron in high-energy proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider. 
 High-energy hadronic collisions generate environments characterized by temperatures above 100 MeV (refs. 1,2), about 100,000 times hotter than the centre of the Sun. At present, it is therefore unclear how light (anti)nuclei with mass number A of a few units, such as the deuteron, 3He or 4He, each bound by only a few MeV, can emerge from these collisions3,4. Here, the ALICE Collaboration reports that deuteron–pion momentum correlations in proton–proton (pp) collisions provide model-independent evidence that about 90% of the observed (anti)deuterons are produced in nuclear reactions5 following the decay of short-lived resonances, such as the Δ(1232). These findings, obtained by the ALICE Collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider, resolve a gap in our understanding of nucleosynthesis in ultrarelativistic hadronic collisions. Apart from offering insights on how (anti)nuclei are formed in hadronic collisions, the results can be used in the modelling of the production of light and heavy nuclei in cosmic rays6 and dark-matter decays7,8. The ALICE Collaboration provides details on the microscopic mechanism that ends up creating antideuteron in high-energy proton–proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider."

 Tropical forests represent the warmest and wettest of Earth’s biomes, but with continued anthropogenic warming, they will be pushed to climate states with no current analogue1,2. Droughts in the tropics are already becoming more intense as they occur at successively higher temperatures3–5. Here we synthesize multiple datasets to assess the effects of hot droughts on a central Amazon forest. First, a more than 30-year record of annually resolved forest demographic data from a selective logging experiment showed higher tree mortality during intense droughts, particularly among fast-growing pioneer species with low wood density. Second, analysis of ecophysiological field measurements from the 2015 and 2023 El Niño droughts identified a soil moisture threshold beyond which transpiration rates rapidly declined. As rainless days beyond this threshold continued, drought conditions intensified, increasing the potential for tree mortality from hydraulic failure and carbon starvation. Third, analyses from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 demonstrated that under high-emission scenarios, a large area of tropical forest will shift to a hotter ‘hypertropical’ climate by 2100. Last, under a hypertropical climate, temperature and moisture conditions during typical dry season months will more frequently exceed identified drought mortality thresholds, elevating the risk of forest dieback. Present-day hot droughts are harbingers of this emerging climate, offering a window for studying tropical forests under expected extreme future conditions6–8. Thirty years of forest demographic data, combined with recent ecophysiological measurements, reveal that intense Amazon droughts sharply increase tree mortality once soil moisture falls below a threshold, and that these hot droughts will become more frequent and intense as Earth warms towards hypertropical conditions."

 Mitochondrial protein import is required for maintaining organellar function1. Perturbations in this process are associated with various physiological and disease conditions2. Several stress responses, including the mitochondrial compromised protein import response (mitoCPR), combat damage caused by mitochondrial protein import defects2. However, how this defect is sensed remains largely unknown. Here we reveal that the conserved mitochondrial Hsp70 co-chaperone, Mge1, acts as a stress messenger in budding yeast. During mitochondrial stress, unimported Mge1 entered the nucleus and triggered the transcription of mitoCPR target genes. This was mediated by the interaction of Mge1 with the transcription factor Pdr3 on DNA regulatory elements. The mitochondrial targeting sequence of Mge1 was both sufficient and essential for mitoCPR induction, demonstrating that in addition to their roles in mitochondrial protein import, targeting sequences can also function as signalling molecules. As protein import defects are a common consequence of various types of mitochondrial damage3,4, these findings suggest a novel function for the targeting sequence of Mge1 as an indicator of mitochondrial health. Cells can sense mitochondrial damage through signalling via an unimported mitochondrial targeting sequence."

 Adipose tissue maintains energy homeostasis by storing lipids during nutrient surplus and releasing them through lipolysis in times of energy demand1,2. While lipolysis is essential for short-term metabolic adaptation, prolonged metabolic stress requires adaptive changes that preserve energy reserves2,3. Here we report that β3-adrenergic activation of adipocytes induces a transient and depot-specific infiltration of neutrophils into white adipose tissue (WAT), particularly in lipid-rich visceral WAT. Neutrophil recruitment requires the stimulation of both lipolysis and p38 MAPK in adipocytes, and is mediated by the secretion of leukotriene B4. Recruited neutrophils undergo activation in situ, and locally secrete IL-1β, which suppresses lipolysis and limits excessive energy loss. Neutrophil depletion or blockade of IL-1β production increases lipolysis, leading to reduced WAT mass after repeated β3-adrenergic stimulation. Together, these findings reveal a role of neutrophil-derived IL-1β in preserving lipid stores during metabolic stress, highlighting a physiological function of innate immune cells in limiting lipid loss and maintaining energy homeostasis. Neutrophil-derived IL-1β has a role in preserving lipid stores during metabolic stress."

 Psychiatric disorders display high levels of comorbidity and genetic overlap1,2, challenging current diagnostic boundaries. For disorders for which diagnostic separation has been most debated, such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder3, genomic methods have revealed that the majority of genetic signal is shared4. While over a hundred pleiotropic loci have been identified by recent cross-disorder analyses5, the full scope of shared and disorder-specific genetic influences remains poorly defined. Here we addressed this gap by triangulating across a suite of cutting-edge statistical and functional genomic analyses applied to 14 childhood- and adult-onset psychiatric disorders (1,056,201 cases). Using genetic association data from common variants, we identified and characterized five underlying genomic factors that explained the majority of the genetic variance of the individual disorders (around 66% on average) and were associated with 238 pleiotropic loci. The two factors defined by (1) Schizophrenia and bipolar disorders (SB factor); and (2) major depression, PTSD and anxiety (Internalizing factor) showed high levels of polygenic overlap6 and local genetic correlation and very few disorder-specific loci. The genetic signal shared across all 14 disorders was enriched for broad biological processes (for example, transcriptional regulation), while more specific pathways were shared at the level of the individual factors. The shared genetic signal across the SB factor was substantially enriched in genes expressed in excitatory neurons, whereas the Internalizing factor was associated with oligodendrocyte biology. These observations may inform a more neurobiologically valid psychiatric nosology and implicate targets for therapeutic development designed to treat commonly occurring comorbid presentations. Genomic analyses applied to 14 childhood- and adult-onset psychiatric disorders identifies five underlying genomic factors that explain the majority of the genetic variance of the individual disorders."

 All genomes have mobile genetic segments called transposable elements (TEs)1. Here we describe a system, which we term SOS splicing, that protects Caenorhabditis elegans and human genes against DNA-transposon-mediated disruption by excising these TEs from host mRNAs. SOS splicing, which seems to operate independently of the spliceosome, is a pattern-recognition system triggered by the base-pairing of inverted terminal repeat elements, which are a defining feature of DNA transposons. We identify three factors required for SOS splicing in both C. elegans and human cells: AKAP17A, which binds TE-containing mRNAs; the RNA ligase RTCB; and CAAP1, which bridges RTCB and AKAP17A to allow RTCB to ligate mRNA fragments generated by TE excision. We propose that SOS splicing is a previously undescribed conserved and RNA-structure-directed mode of mRNA splicing, and that an identified function of SOS splicing is to genetically buffer animals from the deleterious effects of DNA-transposon-mediated gene perturbation. A new type of mRNA splicing mechanism discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans that detects and removes inverted repeats also occurs in human cells, thereby providing another strategy to protect against the negative effects of transposable elements."

 Understanding lung cancer evolution can identify tools for intercepting its growth1,2. Here, in a landscape analysis of 1,024 lung adenocarcinomas (LUADs) with deep whole-genome sequencing integrated with multiomic data, we identified 542 LUADs with a diverse clonal architecture. In this group, we observed divergent evolutionary trajectories based on tobacco smoking exposure, ancestry and sex. LUAD from smokers showed an abundance of tobacco-related C:G>A:T driver mutations3 in KRAS and short subclonal diversification. LUAD in people who have never smoked (hereafter, never-smokers) showed early occurrence of copy-number alterations and EGFR mutations associated with SBS5 and SBS40a mutational signatures. Tumours containing EGFR mutations exhibited long latency, particularly in female individuals of European-ancestry. Tumours from Asian never-smokers showed a short clonal evolution. Importantly, we found that the mutational signature ID24 is a marker of a previously unrecognized mechanism for LUAD evolution. Tumours with ID2 showed short latency and high long interspersed nuclear element-1 (LINE-1, hereafter L1) retrotransposon activity linked to L1 promoter demethylation. These tumours exhibited an aggressive phenotype with genomic instability, elevated hypoxia scores, low neoantigen burden, metastasis propensity and poor overall survival. Reactivated L1-retrotransposition-induced mutagenesis probably contributes to the mutational signature ID2, including through the regulation of the transcriptional factor ZNF695, a member of the KZFP family5. The complex nature of LUAD evolution creates both challenges and opportunities for screening and treatment plans. Lung adenocarcinomas bearing the ID2 mutational signature display increased LINE-1 retrotransposon activity, which contributes to their fast evolutionary dynamics and aggressive phenotype."

 The extent to which exogenous sources, including cancer treatment, contribute to somatic evolution in normal tissue remains unclear. Here we used high-depth duplex sequencing1 (more than 30,000× coverage) to analyse 168 cancer-free samples representing 16 organs from 22 patients with metastatic cancer enroled in the PEACE research autopsy study. In every sample, we identified somatic mutations (range 305–2,854 mutations) at low variant allele frequencies (median 0.0000323). We extracted 16 distinct single-base substitution mutational signatures, reflecting processes that have moulded the genomes of normal cells. We identified alcohol-induced mutation acquisition in liver, smoking-induced mutagenesis in lung and cardiac tissue, and multiple treatment-induced processes, which correlated with therapy type and duration. Exogenous sources, including treatment, underpinned, on average, more than 40% of mutations in liver but less than 10% of mutations in brain samples. Finally, we observed tissue-specific selection, with positive selection in tissues such as lung (PTEN and PIK3CA), liver (NF2L2) and spleen (BRAF and NOTCH2), and limited selection in others, such as brain and cardiac tissue. More than 25% of driver mutations in normal tissue exposed to systemic anti-cancer therapy, including in TP53, could be attributed to treatment. Immunotherapy, although not associated with increased mutagenesis, was linked to driver mutations in PPM1D and TP53, illustrating how non-mutagenic treatment can sculpt somatic evolution. Our study reveals the rich tapestry of mutational processes and driver mutations in normal tissue, and the profound effect of lifetime exposures, including cancer treatment, on somatic evolution. High-depth sequencing of non-cancerous tissue from patients with metastatic cancer reveals single-base mutational signatures of alcohol, smoking and cancer treatments, and reveals how exogenous factors, including cancer therapies, affect somatic cell evolution."

 The Kunming–Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework calls for rapid global expansion of protected areas in response to ongoing biodiversity loss and ecosystem degradation1. One of its strongest selling points is the benefits protected areas provide to adjacent human communities2,3. However, little attention has been paid to how policy and management can support such benefits. Here, to address this gap, I explored influences on the effect sizes of vegetation spillovers from a candidate 12,513 Australian protected areas, defining spillovers as the difference in vegetation outside a protected area that occurs as a consequence of the existence of the protected area4. In 2020, 71% (2,189) out of the 3,063 protected areas for which full analysis was possible had a positive spillover effect of 0.1 or greater on at least 1 of 10 vegetation cover classes. Many protected area types were significant predictors of spillover magnitude. The covariance explained by protected area type with local and contextual variables was 14%, suggesting that internal management moderates adjacent locations. These findings highlight the potential to include spillover effects explicitly in global policy frameworks and suggest a pathway to an empirical basis for monitoring and accounting schemes that support biodiversity conservation and ecosystem service provision adjacent to protected areas. Analysis of effect sizes of vegetation spillovers from protected areas in Australia shows that 71% of over 3,063 analysed protected areas had a positive spillover effect, and that these effects covary with protected area management type."

 The exceptionally low-energy 229Th nuclear isomeric state is expected to provide several new and powerful applications1,2, including the construction of a robust and portable solid-state nuclear clock3, perhaps contributing to a redefinition of the second4, exploration of nuclear superradiance5,6 and tests of fundamental physics7–10. Further, analogous to the capabilities of traditional Mössbauer spectroscopy, the sensitivity of the nucleus to its environment can be used to realize laser Mössbauer spectroscopy and, with it, new types of strain and temperature sensors3,11 and a new probe of the solid-state environment12,13, all with excellent sensitivity. However, current models for examining the nuclear transition in a solid require the use of a high-bandgap, vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) transmissive host, severely limiting the applicability of these techniques. Here we report the first, to the authors’ knowledge, demonstration of laser-induced conversion electron Mössbauer spectroscopy (CEMS) of the 229Th isomer in a thin ThO2 sample whose bandgap (approximately 6 eV) is considerably smaller than the nuclear isomeric state energy (8.4 eV). Unlike fluorescence spectroscopy of the 229Th isomeric transition, this technique is compatible with materials whose bandgap is less than the nuclear transition energy, opening a wider class of systems to study and the potential of a conversion-electron-based nuclear clock.

 Targeting innate immunity holds promise in cancer immunotherapy, particularly in improving checkpoint inhibitors. However, the use of agonists of the promising innate receptors TLRs and STING1–4 is facing challenges. Here we examined the antitumour function of the α-kinase 1 (ALPK1) receptor for bacterial ADP-heptose (ADP-Hep)5–7. Treatment of mice with ADP-Hep induced multiple proinflammatory factors including CXCL10 and CCL2, and stimulated Alpk1-dependent antitumour immunity. Mice bearing a gain-of-function ALPK1(T237M) disease variant8 also rejected grafted tumours. Using medicinal chemistry, we identified a more potent analogue, UDSP-Hep. In contrast to ADP-Hep, UDSP-Hep distinguished Alpk1 polymorphism, which correlates with mouse susceptibility to bacteria-associated colitis9–12. UDSP-Hep exhibited a stronger Alpk1-mediated antitumour effect and synergized with checkpoint inhibitors. The effect required CD8+ T cells, dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages, and was sensitive to antibodies that block CXCL10 or CCL2 function. ALPK1 agonists activated DCs for cross-presentation, promoting tumour-specific T cell expansion in the tumour-draining lymph nodes. ALPK1 has wider expression than STING in non-immune cells with a distinct inflammatory signature. UDSP-Hep is differentiated from STING agonists in stimulating tumour-cell antigen presentation, macrophage–DC cross-priming and protective memory T cell differentiation, and it does not induce T cell apoptosis. Our study elucidates the antitumour effect of ALPK1 agonism and suggests the potential of ALPK1 agonists in cancer immunotherapy.

 Genetic association studies provide a unique tool for identifying candidate causal links from genes to human traits and diseases. However, it is challenging to determine the biological mechanisms underlying most associations, and we lack genome-scale approaches for inferring causal mechanistic pathways from genes to cellular functions to traits. Here we propose approaches to bridge this gap by combining quantitative estimates of gene–trait relationships from loss-of-function burden tests1 with gene-regulatory connections inferred from Perturb-seq experiments2 in relevant cell types. By combining these two forms of data, we aim to build causal graphs in which the directional associations of genes with a trait can be explained by their regulatory effects on biological programs or direct effects on the trait3. As a proof of concept, we constructed a causal graph of the gene-regulatory hierarchy that jointly controls three partially co-regulated blood traits. We propose that perturbation studies in trait-relevant cell types, coupled with gene-level effect sizes for traits, can bridge the gap between genetic association and biological mechanism. Approaches combining genetic association and Perturb-seq data that link genetic variants to functional programs to traits are described."

 Frataxin is a key component of an ancient, mitochondrial iron–sulfur cluster biosynthetic machinery, serving as an allosteric activator of the cysteine desulfurase NFS1 (refs. 1–5). Loss of frataxin levels underlies Friedreich’s ataxia6, the most common inherited ataxia. Yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans and human cells can tolerate loss of frataxin when grown in ‘permissive’ low oxygen tensions7. Here we conducted an unbiased, genome-scale forward genetic screen in C. elegans leveraging permissive and non-permissive oxygen tensions to discover suppressor mutations that bypass the need for frataxin. All mutations act dominantly and are in the ferredoxin FDX2/fdx-2 or in the cysteine desulfurase NFS1/nfs-1 genes, resulting in amino-acid substitutions at the FDX2–NFS1 binding interface. Our genetic and biochemical analyses show that the suppressor mutations boost iron–sulfur cluster levels in the absence of frataxin. We also demonstrate that an excess of FDX2 inhibits frataxin-stimulated NFS1 activity in vitro and blocks the synthesis of iron–sulfur clusters in mammalian cell culture. These findings are consistent with structural and biochemical evidence that frataxin and FDX2 compete for occupancy at the same site on NFS1 (refs. 8,9). We show that lowering levels of wild-type FDX2 through loss of one gene copy can ameliorate the growth of frataxin mutant C. elegans or the ataxia phenotype of a mouse model of Friedreich’s ataxia under normoxic conditions. These genetic and biochemical studies indicate that restoring the stoichiometric balance of frataxin and FDX2 through partial knockdown of FDX2 may be a potential therapy for Friedreich’s ataxia. A forward genetic screen in Caenorhabditis elegans reveals that decreased levels of the ferredoxin FDX2 suppress the loss of frataxin in worms and in mice by relief of FDX2 inhibition of frataxin-stimulated NFS1 activity."

 The incidence of cardiometabolic diseases is increasing globally, and both poor diet and the human gut microbiome have been implicated1. However, the field lacks large-scale, comprehensive studies exploring these links in diverse populations2. Here, in over 34,000 US and UK participants with metagenomic, diet, anthropometric and host health data, we identified known and yet-to-be-cultured gut microbiome species associated significantly with different diets and risk factors. We developed a ranking of species most favourably and unfavourably associated with human health markers, called the ‘ZOE Microbiome Health Ranking 2025’. This system showed strong and reproducible associations between the ranking of microbial species and both body mass index and host disease conditions on more than 7,800 additional public samples. In an additional 746 people from two dietary interventional clinical trials, favourably ranked species increased in abundance and prevalence, and unfavourably ranked species reduced over time. In conclusion, these analyses provide strong support for the association of both diet and microbiome with health markers, and the summary system can be used to inform the basis for future causal and mechanistic studies. It should be emphasized, however, that causal inference is not possible without prospective cohort studies and interventional clinical trials.

Hemingway,Sedimentary conditions drive modern pyrite burial flux to exceed oxidation,"Modern pyrite burial in seafloor sediments exceeds pyrite oxidation on land, indicating that the sulfur cycle is out of balance, and acts to increase atmospheric oxygen levels, according to a diagenetic model validated by sediment cores. 
 Pyrite (iron sulfide) formation and burial in sediments decreases atmospheric CO2 and increases O2 levels. However, the environmental and sedimentological conditions that regulate pyrite burial remain poorly constrained. Here we investigate such controlling mechanisms using a non-dimensional diagenetic model that extracts the natural variables governing pyrite formation rate and sulfur isotopic composition (δ34S). Both properties are controlled by the local ratios of organic carbon content to sulfate concentration and organic carbon reactivity to sedimentation rate; formation rate is additionally sensitive to reactive iron delivery. Using only globally interpolated boundary conditions, our model accurately predicts signals in 216 sediment cores distributed across the modern ocean. Extrapolating this, we estimate a global pyrite burial flux of 7.0 × 1012 mol S yr−1 (sensitivity test range: 2.5 × 1012 to 19.0 × 1012 mol S yr−1) with a weighted-average δ34S value of −4‰ (range: −8 to +3‰). This flux is substantially larger than terrestrial pyrite oxidation, indicating that the sulfur cycle is currently not in steady state but is instead described by net pyrite burial and thus atmospheric O2 accumulation. Finally, we interpret the geologic pyrite δ34S record within this model framework and identify flooded shelf area as the main control on pyrite burial throughout the Phanerozoic Eon. Modern pyrite burial in seafloor sediments exceeds pyrite oxidation on land, indicating that the sulfur cycle is out of balance, and acts to increase atmospheric oxygen levels, according to a diagenetic model validated by sediment cores."

 Iron is the primary limiting nutrient for phytoplankton growth, and consequently CO2 drawdown, in the Southern Ocean. A recurring phytoplankton bloom above the Australian Antarctic Ridge was recently attributed to hydrothermally sourced iron. Here we examine satellite remote-sensing estimates of net primary production, earthquake location catalogues and Lagrangian plume modelling of particle trajectories in surface ocean currents to show that interannual variability in net primary production is related to seismicity and the advective spread of downstream surface waters. By spatially decomposing the relationship between seismicity, advective spread and net primary production, we demonstrate that net primary production at the surface, above the hydrothermal vents, can be predicted by elevated seismicity in the months before the growing season. Farther from the vents, greater advective spread reduces net primary production. We hypothesize that the connection between earthquakes and net primary production is mediated by the link between seismicity and hydrothermal emissions while advective spread controls the dilution of entrained iron; however, the physical mechanism behind the rapid surfacing of hydrothermal iron is still unknown. These findings challenge prevailing views on how geophysical processes influence ocean primary production.

Comparison to previous heart-derived fibrils reveals variations linked to sequence differences and insights into fibril assembly and organ tropism in AL amyloidosis. 
 Systemic light-chain amyloidosis (AL) is characterized by the misfolding and aggregation of immunoglobulin light chains (LCs) into amyloid fibrils, leading to multiorgan deposition and dysfunction, with the kidneys being one of the most commonly involved organs. Here, we report high-resolution cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structures of AL amyloid fibrils from the kidney of a male patient with renal AL amyloidosis. Two distinct polymorphic fibril structures, polymorph A and polymorph B, were identified, both featuring ordered cores (Gln16-Ser95) with β-sheet-rich architectures stabilized by interchain hydrogen bonds and salt bridges. Notably, six mutations in the IGLV1-44*01 gene sequence, including Gln39His and Tyr37Phe, were identified within the fibril core. These mutations influence fibril stability and aggregation by altering intramolecular and intermolecular interactions, such as CH-π stacking and salt bridge formation. Comparative analysis with previously reported heart-derived IGLV1-44 fibrils reveals structural variations linked to light-chain sequence differences. Our findings provide critical insights into the molecular determinants of fibril assembly and organ tropism in AL amyloidosis.

Here, Verkest et al. combine 3DMINFLUX nanoscopy, electrophysiology and mutagenesis to obtain unprecedented molecular insights into Yoda’s mode-of-action. 
 The small molecule Yoda1 has become an indispensable tool for dissecting the role of the mechanically activated ion channel PIEZO1 in physiological and pathological contexts. Previous studies proposed that Yoda1 first binds to a hydrophobic pocket at the interface of the transmembrane helical units 8 and 9 close to the inner leaflet of the membrane to induce conformational flattening and thus channel activation and then transitions to a deeper located binding site with higher affinity in the open conformation. Here, using site-directed mutagenesis, electrophysiology, computational modelling and 3D-MINFLUX nanoscopy, we refine this model by demonstrating that mutation of the previously proposed Yoda1 binding site-I, solely abolishes Yoda1-induced activation and channel flattening but preserves modulation of mechanically-evoked PIEZO1 currents, whereas mutation of F1715, which lines a transient binding cavity accessible only in the flattened PIEZO1 conformation, eliminated modulation without affecting Yoda-induced calcium entry. Thus, our data support a revised model for Yoda’s mode of action that distinguishes discrete allosteric pathways for PIEZO1 activation versus modulation and provides a framework for the design of next-generation use-dependent PIEZO1 modulators. The small molecule Yoda1 is a crucial pharmacological tool for studying the ion channel PIEZO1.

 The rapid emergence of RNA therapeutics has highlighted the need for more efficient, scalable and sustainable methods for their manufacture. Biocatalytic approaches hold particular promise, but rely on a secure, sustainable and low-cost supply of nucleoside triphosphate (NTP) building blocks, including those containing chemical modifications. Here we report the development of a biocatalytic approach and engineered enzymes to convert widely available nucleosides into NTPs featuring pharmaceutically relevant modifications using inexpensive phosphate donors. Importantly our strategy obviates the need for ATP as a phosphate donor that complicates NTP isolation using existing methods. To showcase the utility of our approach, we employ an engineered acid phosphatase, polyphosphate kinase and acetate kinase to produce 2′-O-methoxyethyl-ATP (2′-MOE-ATP) and 2′-fluoro-ATP, key building blocks of commercial therapeutics. Finally, we show that crude NTPs from our process can be used directly in enzymatic oligonucleotide synthesis, obviating the need for costly NTP isolation or purification steps.

Here, the authors monitor ribosome binding to the GTPase EF-G and the ensuing mechanical work on mRNA in real time, uncovering a major energetic contribution from EF-G binding, rather than GTP hydrolysis, to the mechanical work. 
 The GTPase EF-G catalyzes translocation of mRNA and tRNAs relative to the ribosome and helps maintain the reading frame during protein synthesis. Which events directly require EF-G-mediated GTP hydrolysis during translocation are still debated. Using high-resolution optical tweezers endowed with single-molecule fluorescence detection, we simultaneously monitored binding of fluorescently-labeled EF-G to ribosomes and either mRNA unwinding or mRNA translocation relative to the body domain of the small ribosomal subunit. Using EF-G mutants and GTP analogs, we find that neither mRNA unwinding nor translocation require GTP hydrolysis and that these are independent events that may or may not temporally coincide. We propose that “tight binding” of EF-G to the ribosome triggers mRNA unwinding and translocation of mRNA relative to the 30S body domain and that while GTP hydrolysis kinetically accelerates translocation, it is thermodynamically required only to liberate the tightly bound EF-G from the ribosome.

 The preservation and faithful propagation of genetic information is essential for all life forms and depends on cellular pathways that enable replication, recombination, and repair of DNA. The multifunctional XPF-ERCC1 DNA endonuclease complex acts in several DNA repair pathways and interacts with numerous partner proteins and large DNA repair assemblies, including the nucleotide excision repair machinery and the SMX tri-endonuclease complex. Here, we report structures of XPF-ERCC1 in complex with the DNA repair factors SLX4 and SLX4IP, thereby identifying key residues responsible for direct interactions with XPF-ERCC1. When introduced into human cells, point mutations in these interfaces impair the interactions between XPF-ERCC1 and SLX4 or SLX4IP, and disruption of the XPF-SLX4IP interface leads to cis-platin sensitivity. Furthermore, our data reveal the structure of the human XPF-ERCC1-SLX4IP-SLX4330-555 complex with DNA bound at its active site, and they complete the structural characterisation of molecular interactions required to assemble the SMX complex.

A study now finds that state-owned companies dominate ownership of these risks, with the top 25 of these companies holding up to US$770 billion under a 1.5 °C scenario. 
 Existing fossil-fuel-burning power plants must be retired (or retrofitted with technology to capture and store CO2 emissions) before the end of their operating lifespans to achieve the most ambitious international climate goals (around 2 °C). Abbreviated power-plant lifespans, costly retrofits and lost revenues to power-plant owners in turn represent stranded assets, namely investments that can no longer earn a viable return because of climate policies. Here we use detailed data of power plants worldwide to evaluate the scale of financial risks by region, generator type and corporate ownership. We find that of the 100 companies that own the most stranded assets by value, the very largest are state-owned and the top 25 companies cumulatively hold upwards of US$770 and US$224 billion in stranded assets under a 1.5 °C scenario and 2.0 °C, respectively.

This work now presents a cathode that delivers longer cycle life than high-Ni chemistry while substantially reducing Ni use. 
 The transition to sustainable energy storage demands lithium-ion batteries with high energy density and reduced reliance on critical metals such as nickel (Ni), yet current strategies to increase capacity have largely depended on raising Ni content, leading to escalating supply risks, rising costs and sustainability concerns. More critically, Ni-rich cathodes suffer from rapid electrochemical degradation driven by structural instability, creating an insurmountable trade-off between capacity and cycle life. Here we introduce a low-Ni chemistry cathode, Li(Li0.05Ni0.57Mn0.31Co0.07)O2, with a radial phase integration design that overcomes these limitations, enabling a remarkable Ni usage reduction (Ni < 0.6) while demonstrating high capacity (215 mAh g−1) and markedly improved cyclability (~97% retention over 400 cycles) compared to conventional high-Ni cathodes (Ni = 0.8). Advanced X-ray and electron microscopy analyses reveal that the designed cathode exhibits a highly reversible oxygen anionic redox, benefiting from a structurally stable surface and minimizing irreversible phase transitions. Moreover, the integrated structure substantially mitigates lattice strain and improves mechanical stability even under harsh conditions. This advance offers a general design principle for developing next-generation cathodes that combine resource efficiency with long-term electrochemical reliability. Current lithium-ion batteries still rely heavily on nickel (Ni), whose growing demand raises serious economic and environmental concerns. This work now presents a cathode that delivers longer cycle life than high-Ni chemistry while substantially reducing Ni use."

A study maps these risks globally and finds that factoring them into plant closures could improve reliability while supporting climate goals. 
 Hydroclimatic risks, such as increased water temperatures and water shortages, can impair the cooling efficiency of thermal power plants, threatening energy security. These risks worsen when decommissioning strategies for the low-carbon transition prioritize retiring smaller but lower-risk plants while keeping larger yet higher-risk ones. Yet, how hydroclimatic risks interact with these strategies remain poorly understood. Here we develop a global unit-level, capacity-specific framework to systematically assess hydroclimatic risks to thermal power generation under climate change. This framework maps risk intensification and risk-level escalation, and evaluates how integrating hydroclimatic risks into decommissioning plans can enhance energy security. We find that by the 2050s, ~60.5% of global thermal power capacity would face greater hydroclimatic risks under SSP370, as indicated by declining usable capacity ratios (UCRs)—the share of nameplate capacity that remains operable under hydroclimatic constraints. Integrating unit-level hydroclimatic risk constraints into decommissioning strategies could effectively raise the average UCRs of priority-retention units by 26–37 percentage points, although these units are typically slightly older. Our findings underscore the importance of incorporating hydroclimatic risks into decommissioning decisions to balance energy security and climate mitigation goals.

 Wetlands serve as vital carbon sinks; however, compared with the surface carbon pool, the relative stock and stability of organic carbon (OC) buried in deep sediment layers remain uncertain, particularly in alpine regions. Based on 42 sediment across seven wetlands on the Qinghai-Xizang Plateau, this study disentangled the OC accumulation process and its drivers since the Holocene. Our results highlighted that deep sediments ( >1 m) stored ~70% of the total OC in alpine wetlands, much of which was labile. Historical warming facilitated the accumulation of such labile OC. Moreover, an intercalated sedimentary structure, formed by silt and fine-grained clay both below and above the OC-rich layer, prevented them from rapid decomposition. Given that elevated groundwater temperatures and intensified hydrological processes in alpine regions may stimulate the decomposition of these massive labile OC pools, releasing carbon into surface water or the atmosphere, future climate change assessments should take this long-overlooked carbon pool into account.

We find that the integrated groundwater-crop-irrigation interactions amplify MCS frequency by 24-35%, extend storm lifetime by up to 10%, and accelerate storm movement. Moisture from Corn Belt ET enhances the warm-moist inflows, sustaining convective cells and enhancing precipitation near the storm center, with more pronounced effects in stronger storms. These findings highlight the significant role of shallow groundwater and agricultural activities in intensifying convective storms, creating cascading hazards that threaten water and food security. The groundwater-crop-irrigation interactions across the US Corn Belt amplify convective storm frequency, extend storm lifetime, and accelerate storm movement, based on a high-resolution regional climate model coupled with an advanced water vapor tracer."

 Technological progress can help reduce the flood adaptation gap, but its sector-specific impacts remain unclear. Here, we developed a text-mining approach to analyze how four technologies—drones, online rescue forms, navigation apps, and drainage systems—affect perceived flood losses. We applied this model to 3.58 million social media posts from extreme floods in two Chinese cities. Results show highly heterogeneous effects: drones and online rescue forms support multisectoral recovery, while navigation apps and drainage mainly target traffic and buildings. For reducing casualties and restoring communication and water/electricity supply, drones (43.0%–62.2%) and online rescue forms (19.5%–37.1%) ranked higher in importance than rescue effort effectiveness (17.3%–28.5%). Technology adoption reduced perceived losses primarily by improving rescue effectiveness, with online rescue forms showing the strongest propagation path (coefficient: 0.577–0.579). This study provides a text-based framework for evaluating technology in flood adaptation and supports planning under resource constraints. Drones and online rescue forms lead to broad flood recovery, while navigation apps and drainage target traffic and buildings, according to text-mining modeling of millions of posts revealing sector-specific technology impacts and adaptation pathways."

 Driven by the essential role of blue carbon ecosystems in mitigating climate change and by scarce regional data, here we aim to quantify carbon sequestration rates and storage in a Moroccan coastal vegetated ecosystem over time using nuclear approaches. The carbon stocks recorded over the past 60 years ranged from 1.35 to 11.07 Mg Corg ha−1 in Merja Kahla and from 3.55 to 54.48 Mg Corg ha−1 and from 3.57 to 104.58 Mg Corg ha−1 in two cores from Merja Zerga. The highest carbon accumulation rates were observed in the top 5 cm of sediment cores, ranging from 14.60 to 53.08 g OC m−2 yr−1, suggesting a noticeable increase in recent years. These findings highlight the need to integrate blue carbon ecosystems into national policies as nature-based solutions for mitigating climate change and for enhancing the management and conservation of coastal and marine resources threatened by human activities. Carbon accumulation rates in seagrass sediments in Northern Morocco have increased in recent years, according to sediment core analysis from coastal vegetated ecosystems in Northern Morocco."

 Phreatic eruptions are a potentially lethal type of volcanic activity that is notoriously difficult to forecast. Understanding the complex processes that make eruptions more likely is a key step towards detecting precursory signals. Here, we employ 3-dimensional numerical models of heat and fluid flow based on field and laboratory data from Whakaari/White Island Volcano in New Zealand to explore the thermal, hydraulic, and geologic conditions that promote phreatic eruptions. Our results show that hydrothermally mineralised low-permeability seals can trap rising steam and magmatic gases until the pressure exceeds the tensile strength of the rock within days to months. Changes in persistent degassing through secondary vents can provide valuable insights into when the main sealed conduit is building to eruption. This study provides new insights into the timescales and mechanisms promoting phreatic eruptions, and a starting point to quantitatively interpret volcanic signals in terms of subsurface activity and eruptive potential. Phreatic eruptions at Whakaari volcano are influenced by subsurface pressurisation magnitudes and timescales, which are significantly influenced by hydrothermal mineralisation and magmatic gas input rates, according to 3-dimensional numerical modelling of volcanic hydrothermal systems."

Even with a simple approach to account for atmospheric chemistry and ratio variability, a strong correlation could be observed, allowing the construction of a high temporal resolution NOx-based ffCO2 record with uncertainties comparable to the use of CO as proxy. Comparisons with independent records show good agreement between them. 
 Radiocarbon (14CO2) observations are the benchmark for quantifying fossil fuel CO2 (ffCO2) in the atmosphere, but continuous 14CO2 measurements are not yet available. Continuous estimates of ffCO2 can be made by observing continuously measurable proxies that are co-emitted during fossil fuel combustion. This paper investigates the potential and challenges of using in situ NOx observations in urban areas to quantitatively estimate hourly ffCO2 enhancements, in the example of the ICOS pilot station in Heidelberg, Germany. The short atmospheric lifetime of NOx limits the use of the observed signal to a local area. Thus, a local NOx and ffCO2 background was approximated using the Stochastic Time-Inverted Lagrangian Transport (STILT) model and bottom-up emission estimates from the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO). Using 14CO2 data from 185 hourly integrated flask samples between 2020–2021, mean ratios of local excess NOx (ΔNOx) to local excess ffCO2 (ΔffCO2) of 1.40 ppb ppm−1 for winter and 2.12 ppb ppm−1 for summer were calculated. These ratios were applied to the ΔNOx time series to construct continuous ΔffCO2 estimates. The uncertainty of the ΔNOx-based ΔffCO2 record was estimated at 3.94 ppm. Comparisons with 14CO2-based and ΔCO-based ΔffCO2 estimates showed good agreement, while still demonstrating distinct behaviour for individual events. ΔNOx shows considerable potential as ΔffCO2 proxy and as useful addition to ΔCO-based estimates, as both proxies have different footprints due to their lifetimes.

Here, we reveal an anthropogenic‐forced seasonal change in the land–sea thermal contrast by analyzing the evolution of its temperature annual cycle (TACL–S). We find a significant reduction in TACL–S in the northern mid‐latitudes, dominated by stronger winter land warming, alongside an increase in the northern high latitudes, dominated by stronger winter sea warming, during 1941–2014. In particular, these anthropogenic changes are projected to intensify in 2015–2100, with an additional emergence of TACL–S increases dominated by summer land warming in the southern mid‐latitudes. Thus, a future tripolar pattern of TACL–S heralds novel land–sea climate regimes with far‐reaching climatic impacts."

Here we use a simple metric, the Arctic residence time of air, that is, the time air spends uninterruptedly north of 70° ${}^{\circ}$N, to evaluate how these changes have affected the high‐latitude atmospheric circulation in the last 40 years. We find that, on average, near‐surface air resides between 7 (winter) and 12 (summer) days in the Arctic. This residence time has decreased almost year‐round since the 1980s, especially pronounced in the seasonal transition periods (fall: − ${-}$0.9 days; spring: − ${-}$1.4 days). The more pronounced reduction in spring also affects higher atmospheric layers. Our analysis indicates that this reduction is likely linked to the observed sea ice loss, decrease in snow cover, and increase in temperature. Furthermore, it indicates a speed‐up of the circulation, effectively making the Arctic less isolated and more prone to influences from mid‐latitudes."

At Sumisu Caldera, trapdoor faulting has recurred quasi‐regularly, roughly at ∼10‐year intervals, generating earthquakes of moment magnitude 5.4–5.7 and producing tsunamis due to meter‐scale co‐seismic uplift. To assess event similarity and infer controlling factors, we compare seismic and tsunami waveforms at broadband period range (0.2–500 s). The 1996, 2015, and 2024 events exhibit nearly identical waveforms, indicating rupture of a persistent major asperity with stable geometry and processes. Similar but non‐identical earthquakes suggest partial rupture or additional minor asperities. Comparable repeating sequences at other submarine calderas further support that trapdoor faulting is generally governed by major asperities, while variations in recurrence patterns may reflect differences in fault properties among calderas. These results demonstrate that trapdoor faulting recurrency is controlled by major asperities on ring faults, sustained by long‐term, stable magma supply."

While MHWs in coastal and estuarine systems have been studied separately, their spatial coherence remains significantly understudied. Here we analyze over 2 decades of high‐frequency in situ temperature data from 54 stations across 20 U.S. estuaries and 13 coastal buoys to assess MHW co‐occurrences. We find that estuarine and coastal MHWs co‐occur only ∼21% of the time, a 57% decrease compared to co‐occurrence within estuaries (∼49%). Maximum co‐occurrence occurs at zero lag, suggesting synchronous synoptic‐scale atmospheric forcing, likely via air–sea heat fluxes. Co‐occurrence shows strong seasonality, peaking in fall and weakening in summer, and declines exponentially with distance, with an e‐folding scale O(100 km), consistent with synoptic‐scale atmospheric forcing. This study offers the most comprehensive assessment to date of estuarine‐coastal MHW co‐occurrence and offers a baseline for understanding and forecasting these extreme events."

However, due to the well‐known “double penalty” effect, MSE‐based losses often lead to overly smoothed prediction fields and a systematic underestimation of the frequency of heavy rainfall. To address this limitation, we propose a novel probability‐matching (PM) based loss for ML precipitation nowcasting and short‐term forecasting, comparing its performance with other classical losses. Comprehensive skill evaluation demonstrates that PM‐based loss offers relatively more balanced and consistent performance across metrics, particularly its lower forecast bias from light to heavy rainfall intensities. Spectral power analysis further indicates that PM‐based loss better preserves small‐scale precipitation variability throughout the forecast period. Additionally, it results in a forecast frequency distribution of precipitation that more closely aligns with the observed distribution. These findings indicate consistent improvements in predictive skill and reliability of ML precipitation forecasts when trained with the PM‐based loss."

The model is applied to MJ≥4.0 ${M}_{J}\ge 4.0$ earthquakes that occurred between 2001 and 2010 around the Kakioka (KAK) station in Japan, with two types of anomalies, ultralow frequency (ULF) magnetic anomalies and carbon monoxide (CO) anomalies, as external excitations. Results indicate that 14.33% of the earthquakes can be interpreted by the external excitation of anomalies. Proposed ETAS + ULF + CO model achieves an overall probability gain of 1,013.55 in forecasting 218 earthquakes compared to the purely temporal ETAS model. Statistical significance is assessed by fitting the same model to the same earthquake catalog but with randomized anomaly occurrence times, confirming that the performance improvement is not due to overfitting.

However, distinguishing between key magnetospheric regions–such as inner belt, slot region, outer belt, and plasma sheet–based on low‐altitude data remains challenging, particularly for missions lacking pitch‐angle resolution. A commonly used boundary indicator, the flux anisotropy (i.e., precipitating‐to‐trapped flux ratio), is unavailable in such cases. In this study, we propose an alternative approach to identify the plasma sheet—radiation belt interface, commonly associated with the isotropy boundary, using high energy‐resolution measurements from the Colorado Inner Radiation Belt Experiment (CIRBE) CubeSat. We demonstrate that this boundary is marked by a distinct spectral change: a power‐law form in the plasma sheet transitions to an exponential form within the outer radiation belt. These findings are supported by comparisons with Polar‐orbiting Operational Environmental Satellites (POES) observations, and we discuss the potential mechanisms responsible for the spectral transition."

In high ALI years when the Aleutian Low is weakened, the RI ratio is significantly reduced over the region spanning 5°N–25°N, 135°E–160°E, predominantly driven by enhanced 850–200‐hPa vertical wind shear (VWS). Other commonly investigated RI‐related environmental variables show only small ALI‐driven modulations over the primary focus region of this study. In high ALI years, enhanced VWS is mainly induced by anomalous westerlies in the southeastern part of a broad anomalous cyclone centered in the subtropical central North Pacific. This anomalous cyclone can be further linked to strong wave activity fluxes originating from the AL region and propagating southward into the subtropical North Pacific."

In this study we find that subsurface temperature variability near the ice shelves in the Amundsen Sea Embayment from a global ocean‐sea ice model is able to track observed temperature variability and satellite‐derived basal melt rates. Simulated ocean temperature variability is controlled by a two‐stage response to the regional winds. A weakening of the prevailing southeasterly winds initially redistributes heat by lifting the thermocline, bringing warm mCDW up from depth near the ice shelf front. This is followed by a lagged widespread warming across the continental shelf due to water mass property changes, driven by horizontal advection and vertical mixing. Our results suggest a limited role of internal ocean variability and meltwater feedbacks on the observed variability on interannual timescales."

However, there is substantial intermodel spread in the projected AMOC decline, and its contribution to uncertainty in projected Arctic warming has not yet been quantified. To investigate this, we perform model experiments that increase CO2 concentrations while imposing the intermodel spread in the AMOC decline. We find that this intermodel spread in the AMOC decline reproduces 45% of the total intermodel spread in Arctic warming. A smaller AMOC decline increases Arctic warming via increased northward ocean heat transport, atmospheric moisture transport, and positive Arctic feedbacks. Arctic warming is more sensitive to AMOC differences that produce larger sea‐ice changes. Combined with a strong correlation between a small AMOC decline and Arctic warming across models, these results indicate that ocean circulation is a key source of model uncertainty in projections of Arctic warming."

We conduct laboratory fluid injection experiments on representative faults with distinct surface mineralogy, injecting fluid at a constant rate of 0.6 mL/min and under a confining pressure of 20 MPa, to examine how mineralogy affects fluid‐driven slip and seismicity. We find that the fault surface with a higher content of tectosilicates (quartz, microcline, albite, totaling 96%) exhibit higher shear strength. The tectosilicate‐rich fault takes a longer time to reactivate but accumulates seismic moment more rapidly, indicating more intense seismicity. In contrast, the fault containing abundant phyllosilicates (50% biotite) promotes a transition from unsteady stick‐slip to steady slip during fluid injection. Stick‐slip events in the tectosilicate‐rich fault exhibit higher peak slip rates and greater slip displacements. We propose a microscopic mechanism to elaborate how fluids may influence mineral friction and thereby affect injection‐induced fault slip."

 Mazdutide is a once-weekly glucagon and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor dual agonist developed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes (T2D) 1. This study assessed the efficacy and safety of mazdutide versus dulaglutide in participants with T2D on background oral anti-diabetic drugs. In this randomised phase 3 study, 731 participants with T2D were randomised 1:1:1 to receive mazdutide 4 mg, mazdutide 6 mg or dulaglutide 1.5 mg for 28 weeks. Both mazdutide doses demonstrated non-inferiority and superiority to dulaglutide 1.5 mg in mean change in HbA1c from baseline to week 28, with the least squares (LS) mean treatment difference of −0.24% (p=0.0032) for mazdutide 4 mg and −0.30% (p=0.0003) for mazdutide 6 mg vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Significantly greater weight reductions were achieved with mazdutide versus dulaglutide, with LS mean treatment difference of −3.78% for mazdutide 4 mg and −5.76% for mazdutide 6 mg vs dulaglutide (both p<0.0001). Moreover, significantly more participants with mazdutide achieved the composite endpoint of HbA1c <7.0% with ≥5% weight reduction vs dulaglutide 1.5 mg at week 28 (both p<0.0001).

 Despite advances in type 2 diabetes (T2D) management, unmet needs remain for therapies that effectively control hyperglycaemia while addressing the comorbid metabolic disorders1, 2. Here we assessed the efficacy and safety of the dual glucagon receptor (GCGR)/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist mazdutide monotherapy versus placebo in Chinese adults with T2D inadequately controlled with diet and exercise alone. In this phase 3 trial, 320 participants (mean HbA1c of 8.24%, BMI of 28.2 kg/m2, and diabetes duration of 1.9 years) were randomised 1:1:1 to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of mazdutide 4 mg, 6 mg, or placebo for 24 weeks, followed by a 24-week extended mazdutide treatment. At week 24, mazdutide significantly reduced HbA1c versus placebo (primary endpoint): -1.57% with mazdutide 4 mg and -2.15% with mazdutide 6 mg, versus -0.14% with placebo, with treatment differences of -1.43% and -2.02% (both p <0.0001). Significant weight loss at week 24 occurred with -5.61% (4 mg) and -7.81% (6 mg) versus -1.26% (placebo) (both p<0.0001). Additionally, significantly more participants with mazdutide achieved clinically relevant HbA1c target (<7.0%), weight loss goal (≥5%), and composite endpoints (HbA1c <7.0% and weight loss ≥5%) versus placebo (all p <0.0001). The most common adverse events—diarrhoea, decreased appetite, and nausea—were consistent with GLP-1R agonists. These results establish mazdutide monotherapy as an effective intervention providing clinically meaningful glycaemic control and weight reduction alongside a favourable safety profile in this population."

 Ageing erodes human immunity, in part by reshaping the T cell repertoire, leading to increased vulnerability to infection, malignancy and vaccine failure1–3. Attempts to rejuvenate immune function have yielded only modest results and are limited by toxicity or lack of clinical feasibility1,3–5. Here we show that the liver can be transiently repurposed to restore age-diminished immune cues and improve T cell function in aged mice. These immune cues were found by performing multi-omic mapping across central and peripheral niches in young and aged animals, leading to the identification of Notch and Fms-like tyrosine kinase 3 ligand (FLT3L) pathways, together with interleukin-7 (IL-7) signalling, as declining with age. Delivery of mRNAs encoding Delta-like ligand 1 (DLL1), FLT3L and IL-7 to hepatocytes expanded common lymphoid progenitors, boosted de novo thymopoiesis without affecting haematopoietic stem cell (HSC) composition, and replenished T cells while enhancing dendritic cell abundance and function. Treatment with these mRNAs improved peptide vaccine responses and restored antitumour immunity in aged mice by increasing tumour-specific CD8+ infiltration and clonal diversity and synergizing with immune checkpoint blockade. These effects were reversible after dosing ceased and did not breach self-tolerance, in contrast to the inflammatory and autoimmune liabilities of recombinant cytokine treatments6,7. These findings underscore the promise of mRNA-based strategies for systemic immune modulation and highlight the potential of interventions aimed at preserving immune resilience in ageing populations. Using lipid nanoparticle delivery of mRNAs to the liver in aged mice, T cell function and declining immune cues can be restored."

 The human gut microbiome is composed of a highly diverse consortia of species that are continually evolving within and across hosts1,2. The ability to identify adaptations common to many human gut microbiomes would show not only shared selection pressures across hosts but also key drivers of functional differentiation of the microbiome that may affect community structure and host traits. However, the extent to which adaptations have spread across human gut microbiomes is relatively unknown. Here we develop a new selection scan statistic named the integrated linkage disequilibrium score (iLDS) that can detect sweeps of adaptive alleles spreading across host microbiomes by migration and horizontal gene transfer. Specifically, iLDS leverages signals of hitchhiking of deleterious variants with a beneficial variant. Application of the statistic to around 30 of the most prevalent commensal gut species from 24 human populations around the world showed more than 300 selective sweeps across species. We find an enrichment for selective sweeps at loci involved in carbohydrate metabolism, indicative of adaptation to host diet, and we find that the targets of selection differ significantly between industrialized populations and non-industrialized populations. One of these sweeps is at a locus known to be involved in the metabolism of maltodextrin—a synthetic starch that has recently become a widespread component of industrialized diets. In summary, our results indicate that recombination between strains fuels pervasive adaptive evolution among human gut commensal bacteria, and strongly implicate host diet and lifestyle as critical selection pressures. Development and application of the integrated linkage disequilibrium score (iLDS) reveals both selective pressures impacting the human gut microbiome and the mechanisms by which gut bacteria adapt to meet them."

 G-protein-coupled receptors act as guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and facilitate the activation of heterotrimeric G proteins by exchanging GDP for GTP1. This exchange function is not unidirectional2. Here we demonstrate that an agonist can show selective affinity for an active state that prefers the release of GTP. Specifically, for the mu opioid receptor, we show that several agonists have state-selective affinities for promoting GTP release versus GTP binding. We identify two agonists that show a marked preference for promoting release. In mice, marginally efficacious doses of the release-preferring agonist enhance and prolong the antinociceptive effects of morphine and fentanyl without enhancing the respiratory and cardiac effects of fentanyl. Although these observations are limited to simple measures of thermal nociception, they may point to a way to bifurcate physiological responses to such agonists. We propose that the active-state selectivity of an agonist may determine the preferred direction of the receptor GEF function, which may affect the kinetics and selectivity of the engagement of the receptor with downstream effectors; this may ultimately present a means to disentangle multifaceted drug-induced physiological responses. Mu opioid receptor agonists with a preference for the non-GTP-bound state of the G protein promote GTP release, thereby potentiating antinociceptive effects of drugs such as morphine and fentanyl without also increasing their respiratory or cardiac effects."

 Ising machines offer a compelling approach to addressing NP-hard problems1, but physical realizations that are simultaneously scalable, reconfigurable, fast and stable remain elusive. Quantum annealers, such as D-Wave’s cryogenic hardware, target combinatorial optimization tasks, but quadratic scaling of qubit requirements with problem size limits their scalability on dense graphs2. Here we introduce a programmable, stable, room-temperature optoelectronic oscillator (OEO)-based Ising machine with linear scaling in spin representation. Inspired by Hopfield networks3, our architecture solves fully connected problems with up to 256 spins (65,536 couplings) and >41,000 spins (205,000+ couplings) if sparse. Our system makes use of cascaded thin-film lithium niobate (TFLN) modulators, a semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) and a digital signal processing (DSP) engine in a recurrent time-encoded loop, demonstrating potential >200 giga operations per second (GOPS) for spin coupling and nonlinearity. This platform achieves the largest spin configuration in an OEO-based photonic Ising machine, enabled by high intrinsic speed. We experimentally demonstrate best-in-class solution quality for max-cut problems of arbitrary graph topologies (2,000 and 20,000 spins) among photonic Ising machines and obtain ground-state solutions for number partitioning4 and lattice protein folding5—benchmarks previously unaddressed by photonic systems. Our system uses inherent noise from high baud rates to escape local minima and accelerate convergence. Finally, we show that embedding DSP—traditionally used in optical communications—within optical computation enhances convergence and solution quality, opening new frontiers in scalable, ultrafast computing for optimization, neuromorphic processing and analogue artificial intelligence.

 The dynamic three-dimensional (3D) organization of the human genome (the 4D nucleome) is linked to genome function. Here we describe efforts by the 4D Nucleome Project1 to map and analyse the 4D nucleome in widely used H1 human embryonic stem cells and immortalized fibroblasts (HFFc6). We produced and integrated diverse genomic datasets of the 4D nucleome, each contributing unique observations, which enabled us to assemble extensive catalogues of more than 140,000 looping interactions per cell type, to generate detailed classifications and annotations of chromosomal domain types and their subnuclear positions, and to obtain single-cell 3D models of the nuclear environment of all genes including their long-range interactions with distal elements. Through extensive benchmarking, we describe the unique strengths of different genomic assays for studying the 4D nucleome, providing guidelines for future studies. Three-dimensional models of population-based and individual cell-to-cell variation in genome structure showed connections between chromosome folding, nuclear organization, chromatin looping, gene transcription and DNA replication. Finally, we demonstrate the use of computational methods to predict genome folding from DNA sequence, which will facilitate the discovery of potential effects of genetic variants, including variants associated with disease, on genome structure and function.

 The science of metabolic profiling exploits chemical compound byproducts of metabolism called metabolites1 that explain internal biological functions, physiological health and disease, and provide evidence of external influences specific to an organism’s habitat. Here we assess palaeometabolomes from fossilized mammalian hard tissues as a molecular ecological strategy to provide evidence of an ancient organism’s relationship with its environment. From eastern, central and southern African Plio-Pleistocene localities of palaeoanthropological significance, we study six fossils from Olduvai Gorge, Tanzania, one from the Chiwondo Beds, Malawi, and one from Makapansgat, South Africa. We perform endogeneity assessments by analysing palaeometabolomes of palaeosols and the effects of owl digestion on rodent bones to enable prudent ecological inferences. Diagenesis is indicated by metabolites of collagenase-producing bacteria2, whereas the preservation of peptides including those of collagen are identified by proteomics. Endogenous metabolites document biological functions and exogenous metabolites render environmental details including soil characteristics and woody cover, and enable annual minimum and maximum rainfall and temperature reconstructions at Olduvai Gorge, supporting the freshwater woodland and grasslands of Olduvai Gorge Bed I3–5, and the dry woodlands and marsh of Olduvai Gorge Upper Bed II6. All sites denote wetter and/or warmer conditions than today. We infer that metabolites preserved in hard tissues derive from an extravasated vasculature serum filtrate that becomes entombed within developing mineralized matrices, and most probably survive palaeontological timeframes in the nanoscopic ‘pool’ of structural-bound water that occurs in hard tissue niches7. Metabolic and proteomic profiles derived from fossilized skeletal remains of animals enable inferences regarding physiological health and disease as well as diet to provide reconstructions of ancient soil, vegetation and palaeoclimate characteristics."

Allen,Astrocyte CCN1 stabilizes neural circuits in the adult brain,"Neural circuits in adult mouse visual cortex are stabilized by astrocytes, which secrete CCN1, resulting in reduced plasticity and increased maturation of multiple cell types. 
 Neural circuits in many brain regions are refined by experience. Sensory circuits support higher plasticity at younger ages during critical periods—times of circuit refinement and maturation—and limit plasticity in adulthood for circuit stability1,2. How astrocytes, a glial subtype, maintain these differing plasticity levels, and whether they stabilize the properties of sensory circuits in adulthood, remain largely unclear. Here we take a comprehensive approach to address these questions and establish astrocytes as key orchestrators of circuit stability. Combining a transcriptomic approach with ex vivo electrophysiology and in vivo imaging, we identify that astrocytes release CCN1 (refs. 3,4) to maintain synapse and circuit stability in the adult visual cortex. Overexpressing CCN1 in astrocytes during the critical period promotes the maturation of inhibitory neurons, limits ocular dominance plasticity and promotes oligodendrocyte differentiation and maturation. Conversely, knocking out astrocyte CCN1 in adults destabilizes binocular circuits and reduces myelination. This establishes CCN1 as an astrocyte-secreted factor that stabilizes neuronal circuits by coordinating the maturation state of multiple cell types, and demonstrates that the composition and properties of sensory circuits require ongoing maintenance in adulthood, and that these maintenance cues are provided by astrocytes. Neural circuits in adult mouse visual cortex are stabilized by astrocytes, which secrete CCN1, resulting in reduced plasticity and increased maturation of multiple cell types."

 Phosphorus atoms in silicon represent a promising platform for quantum computing, as their nuclear spins exhibit coherence times over seconds1,2 with high-fidelity readout and single-qubit control3. By placing several phosphorus atoms within a radius of a few nanometres, they couple by means of the hyperfine interaction to a single, shared electron. Such a nuclear spin register enables high-fidelity multi-qubit control4 and the execution of small-scale quantum algorithms5. An important requirement for scaling up is the ability to extend high-fidelity entanglement non-locally across several spin registers. Here we address this challenge with an 11-qubit atom processor composed of two multi-nuclear spin registers that are linked by means of electron exchange interaction. Through the advancement of calibration and control protocols, we achieve single-qubit and multi-qubit gates with all fidelities ranging from 99.10% to 99.99%. By entangling all combinations of local and non-local nuclear-spin pairs, we map out the performance of the processor and achieve state-of-the-art Bell-state fidelities of up to 99.5%. We then generate Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) states with an increasing number of qubits and show entanglement of up to eight nuclear spins. By establishing high-fidelity operation across interconnected nuclear spin registers, we realize a key milestone towards fault-tolerant quantum computation with atom processors.

 Hydrogen (H2) will play a part in decarbonizing the global energy system1. However, hydrogen interacts with methane, ozone, and stratospheric water vapour, leading to an indirect 100-year global warming potential of 11 ± 4 (refs. 2–5). This raises concerns about the climate consequences of increasing H2 use under future hydrogen economies3,5. A comprehensive accounting of H2 sources and sinks is essential for assessing changes and mitigating environmental risks. Here we analyse trends in global H2 sources and sinks from 1990 to 2020 and construct a comprehensive budget for the decade 2010–2020. H2 sources increased from 1990 to 2020, primarily because of the oxidation of methane and anthropogenic non-methane volatile organic compounds, biogenic nitrogen fixation, and leakage from H2 production. Sinks also increased in response to rising atmospheric H2. Estimated global H2 sources and sinks averaged 69.9 ± 9.4 Tg yr−1 and 68.4 ± 18.1 Tg yr−1, respectively, for 2010–2020. Regionally, Africa and South America contained the largest sources and sinks of H2, whereas East Asia and North America contributed the most H2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion. We estimate that rising atmospheric H2 between 2010 and 2020 contributed to an increase in global surface air temperature (GSAT) of 0.02 ± 0.006 °C. GSAT impacts of changing atmospheric H2 in future marker Shared Socioeconomic Pathway scenarios are estimated to remain within 0.01–0.05 °C, depending on H2 usage, leakage rates and CH4 emissions that influence photochemical H2 production. Trends in global H2 sources and sinks are analysed from 1990 to 2020, and a comprehensive budget for the decade 2010–2020 is presented."

Even for the long-studied edge modes of quantum Hall phases1,2, forming at the boundaries of two-dimensional electron systems, the nature of such interaction-induced changes has been elusive. Despite advances made using local probes3–13, key experimental challenges persist: the lack of direct information about the internal structure of edge states on microscopic scales, and complications from edge disorder. Here we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate how correlations dictate the structures of edge channels on both magnetic and atomic length scales. For integer quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level, we show that interactions renormalize the edge velocity, dictate the spatial profile for co-propagating modes and induce unexpected edge valley polarization, which differs from the bulk. Although some of our findings can be understood by mean-field theory, others show breakdown of this picture, highlighting the roles of edge fluctuations and inter-channel couplings. We also extend our measurements to spatially resolve the edge state of fractional quantum Hall phases and detect spectroscopic signatures of interactions in this chiral Luttinger liquid. Our study establishes scanning tunnelling microscopy as a promising tool for exploring the edge physics of the rapidly expanding group of two-dimensional topological phases, including recently realized fractional Chern insulators. Scanning tunnelling microscopy is used to image pristine electrostatically defined quantum Hall edge states in graphene with high spatial resolution and demonstrate their interaction-driven restructuring."

 The prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease neuropathological changes (ADNCs), the leading cause of cognitive impairment, remains uncertain. Recent blood-based biomarkers enable scalable assessment of ADNCs1. Here we measured phosphorylated tau at threonine 217 in 11,486 plasma samples from a Norwegian population-based cohort of individuals over 57 years of age as a surrogate marker for ADNCs. The estimated prevalence of ADNCs increased with age, from less than 8% in people 58–69.9 years of age to 65.2% in those over 90 years of age. Among participants aged 70 years or older, 10% had preclinical Alzheimer’s disease, 10.4% had prodromal Alzheimer’s disease and 9.8% had Alzheimer’s disease dementia. Furthermore, among those 70 years of age or older, ADNCs were present in 60% of people with dementia, in 32.6% of those with mild cognitive impairment and in 23.5% of the cognitively unimpaired group. Our findings suggest a higher prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease dementia in older individuals and a lower prevalence of preclinical Alzheimer’s disease in younger groups than previously estimated2.

Lunine,Titan’s strong tidal dissipation precludes a subsurface ocean,"Reanalysis of radiometric data from Cassini indicates that Titan does not contain a subsurface ocean, as strong tidal dissipation observed in its gravity field is not consistent with the presence of a liquid layer. 
 The Cassini mission provided unprecedented insights into Saturn’s largest moon, Titan, from its atmosphere to the deep interior1. The moon’s large measured response to the tides exerted by Saturn was interpreted as evidence of the existence of a subsurface ocean2,3. This response, twice the value predicted in pre-Cassini studies, has escaped complete explanation. Here we show that the signature of tidal dissipation in Titan’s gravity field is not consistent with the presence of an ocean. Our results arise from the detection of this signature through a reanalysis of the radiometric data acquired by Cassini with improved techniques. We found that substantial energy is being dissipated in the interior (approximately 3–4 TW, corresponding to a tidal quality factor Q ≈ 5), consistent with recent studies of Titan’s rotational state4. Because the presence of a liquid layer reduces the tidal dissipation generated below it5, these new measurements preclude the existence of a subsurface ocean on Titan and are explained by a model in which dissipation is concentrated in a high-pressure ice layer close to its melting point. This model also reproduces Titan’s observed rotational state and static gravity field self-consistently, reconciling all available geophysical measurements. Efficient ice shell convection can prevent widespread melting and ocean formation, but a slushy high-pressure ice layer is consistent with expectations6, indicating that it probably hosts liquid water pockets. The forthcoming Dragonfly mission to Titan will provide a further test of whether a subsurface ocean exists. Reanalysis of radiometric data from Cassini indicates that Titan does not contain a subsurface ocean, as strong tidal dissipation observed in its gravity field is not consistent with the presence of a liquid layer."

 The development of complex multicellular human in vitro systems holds great promise for modelling disease and advancing drug discovery and tissue engineering1. In the liver, despite the identification of key signalling pathways involved in hepatic regeneration2,3, in vitro expansion of human hepatocytes directly from fresh patient tissue has not yet been achieved, limiting the possibility of modelling liver composite structures in vitro. Here we first developed human hepatocyte organoids (h-HepOrgs) from 28 different patients. Patient-derived hepatocyte organoids sustained long-term expansion of hepatocytes in vitro and maintained patient-specific gene expression and bile canaliculus features and function of the in vivo tissue. After transplantation, expanded h-HepOrgs rescued the phenotype of a mouse model of liver disease. By combining h-HepOrgs with portal mesenchyme and our previously published cholangiocyte organoids4–6, we generated patient-specific periportal liver assembloids that retain the histological arrangement, gene expression and cell interactions of periportal liver tissue, with cholangiocytes and mesenchyme embedded in the hepatocyte parenchyma. We leveraged this platform to model aspects of biliary fibrosis. Our human periportal liver assembloid system represents a novel in vitro platform to investigate human liver pathophysiology, accelerate drug development, enable early diagnosis and advance personalized medicine.

 The human reproductive tract is essential for species perpetuation and overall health. Its development involves complex processes of sex specification, tissue patterning and morphogenesis, the disruption of which can cause lifelong issues, including infertility1–5. Here we present an extensive single-cell and spatial multi-omic atlas of the human reproductive tract during prenatal development to provide insights beyond those that are possible with smaller-scale, organ-focused studies. We describe potential regulators of sexual dimorphism in reproductive organs and pinpoint previously unknown genes involved in Müllerian duct emergence and regression and urethral canalization of the penis. By combining histological features with gene expression and chromatin accessibility data, we define transcription factors and signalling events potentially involved in the regionalization of the Müllerian and Wolffian ducts. We also refine how the HOX code is established in distinct reproductive organs and reveal that the expression of thoracic HOX genes is increased in the rostral mesenchyme of the fallopian tube and epididymis. Our findings further indicate that epithelial regionalization of the fallopian tube and epididymis, which probably contribute to sperm maturation and capacitation, is established during development. By contrast, later events are necessary for regionalization of the uterocervical canal epithelium. Finally, on the basis of single-cell data and fetal-derived organoids, we show that the fetal uterine epithelium is vulnerable to oestrogen-mimicking endocrine disruptors. By mapping sex-specific reproductive tract regionalization and differentiation at the cellular level, our study provides valuable insights into causes and potential treatments of developmental reproductive disorders.

Burda,Lesion-remote astrocytes govern microglia-mediated white matter repair,"After spinal cord injury, lesion-remote astrocytes acquire heterogeneous, spatially restricted reactivity states that shape neuroinflammation, neural repair and neurological recovery. 
 Spared regions of the damaged central nervous system undergo dynamic remodelling and exhibit a remarkable potential for therapeutic exploitation1. Lesion-remote astrocytes (LRAs), which interact with viable neurons and glia, undergo reactive transformations whose molecular and functional properties are poorly understood2. Here, using multiple transcriptional profiling methods, we investigated LRAs from spared regions of mouse spinal cord following traumatic spinal cord injury. We show that LRAs acquire a spectrum of molecularly distinct, neuroanatomically restricted reactivity states that evolve after spinal cord injury. We identify transcriptionally unique reactive LRAs in degenerating white matter that direct the specification and function of local microglia that clear lipid-rich myelin debris to promote tissue repair. Fuelling this LRA functional adaptation is the secreted matricellular protein CCN1. Loss of astrocyte-derived CCN1 results in excessive, aberrant activation of local microglia, characterized by abnormal molecular specification, impaired debris processing reflected by the intracellular accumulation of myelin and axon debris, and dysregulated lipid metabolism with distinctive attenuation in lipid droplet accumulation. Mechanistically, we find that CCN1 binds microglial SDC4 to augment lipid storage, linking this signalling axis to a vital repair-associated lipid buffering response in debris-clearing microglia. Accordingly, microglial deficits resulting from astrocyte CCN1 depletion culminate in blunted clearance of white matter debris and impaired neurological recovery from spinal cord injury. Ccn1-expressing white matter astrocytes are induced by local myelin damage and are generated in diverse demyelinating disorders in mice and humans, pointing to their fundamental, evolutionarily conserved role in white matter repair. Our findings show that context-specific cues shape regionally distinct LRA reactivity states with functional adaptations that orchestrate multicellular processes underlying neural repair and influence disease outcome. After spinal cord injury, lesion-remote astrocytes acquire heterogeneous, spatially restricted reactivity states that shape neuroinflammation, neural repair and neurological recovery."

 The apparent invariance of the strong nuclear force under combined charge conjugation and parity (CP) remains an open question in modern physics1,2. Precision experiments with heavy atoms and molecules can provide stringent constraints on CP violation via searches for effects due to permanent electric dipole moments and other CP-odd properties in leptons, hadrons and nuclei3. Radioactive molecules have been proposed as highly sensitive probes for such searches4, but experiments with most such molecules have so far been beyond technical reach. Here we report the production and spectroscopic study of a gas-phase actinium molecule, 227AcF. We observe the predicted strongest electronic transition from the ground state, which is necessary for efficient readout in searches of symmetry-violating interactions. Furthermore, we perform electronic- and nuclear-structure calculations for 227AcF to determine its sensitivity to various CP-violating parameters, and find that a realistic, near-term experiment with a precision of 1 mHz would improve current constraints on the CP-violating parameter hyperspace by 3 orders of magnitude. Our results thus highlight the potential of 227AcF for exceptionally sensitive searches of CP violation.

 The growing demand for advanced materials, miniaturized devices and integrated microsystems calls for the reliable fabrication of complex, multiscale, three-dimensional (3D) architectures, a need increasingly addressed through light-based and laser-based processes. However, owing to the field-of-view (FOV) limitations of conventional imaging optics, existing 3D laser nanofabrication techniques face fundamental challenges in throughput, proximity error and stitching defects on the path to scaling. Here we present a scalable 3D nanofabrication platform that uses a metalens-generated focal spot array to parallelize two-photon lithography (TPL)1 beyond centimetre-scale write field areas. Metalenses are ideally suited for producing submicron-scale focal spots for high-throughput nanolithography, as they uniquely feature large numerical apertures (NAs), immersion media compatibility and large-scale manufacturability. We experimentally demonstrate a printing system that uses a 12-cm2 metalens array to produce more than 120,000 cooperative focal spots, corresponding to a throughput exceeding 108 voxels s−1. By programmatically patterning the focal spot array using a spatial light modulator (SLM), an adaptive parallel printing strategy is developed for precise greyscale linewidth modulation and choreographed printing of semiperiodic and fully aperiodic 3D geometries. We demonstrate parallel printing of replicated microstructures (>50 M microparticles per day), centimetre-scale 3D architectures with feature sizes down to 113 nm, and photonic and mechanical metamaterials. This work demonstrates the potential of 3D nanolithography towards wafer-scale production, showing how TPL could be used at scale for applications in microelectronics2, biomedicine3, quantum technology4 and high-energy laser targets5,6.

This study presents the cryo-EM structure of the mCAT1/frRBD complex, revealing how mCAT1’s structure determines viral tropism and host specificity. 
 Cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1) transports cationic amino acids and plays pivotal roles in cancer proliferation, immune modulation, and nitric oxide metabolism. It also serves as the specific cellular receptor for certain murine leukemia viruses. Here, we report the cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure of mammalian CAT1 in complex with its substrate ornithine and the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of Friend murine leukemia virus (FrMLV). CAT1 specifically recognizes the side-chain amino group of ornithine via residue S347 on transmembrane helix 8 (TM8), capturing the transporter in an inward-facing occluded conformation. Notably, the FrMLV RBD (frRBD) primarily engages the third extracellular loop (ECL3) of CAT1—a region marked by substantial species-specific variation that likely governs cross-species viral tropism. Together, our structural and biochemical results elucidate the molecular mechanism of substrate recognition and transport by mCAT1, and unveil the molecular basis for FrMLV receptor specificity. These findings provide a valuable framework for structure-based drug design targeting CAT1 in cancer and infectious diseases.

 Detection of somatic mutations in cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is challenging due to low variant allele frequencies and extensive DNA degradation. Here we develop a benchmarking strategy using longitudinal patient-matched cfDNA samples from individuals with colorectal and breast cancer. Samples with high and ultra-low levels of tumor-derived DNA are combined into controlled dilution series that preserve the properties of authentic cell-free DNA, including each patient’s germline and blood-cell mutation backgrounds. Using deep whole-genome (150x) and exome (2,000x) sequencing, we define a reference set of ~37,000 single nucleotide variants and ~58,000 indels to benchmark nine somatic variant callers across varying ctDNA levels and sequencing depths. We also explore machine learning–based tuning of individual callers and identify features that improve accuracy in cfDNA. This benchmarking resource clarifies the detection limits of current approaches and provides practical guidance for selecting somatic variant calling methods in liquid biopsy applications.

 A major concern of COVID-19 is immune escape. While T cells are implicated in protection against severe disease, direct evaluation of their capacity to specifically target SARS-CoV-2 variants remains limited. We aim to narrow this gap by profiling the ability of CD8+ T cells to recognize SARS-CoV-2 mutations after vaccination and observe a high degree of phenotype and repertoire diversity. To better understand the breadth of antigen repertoire coverage, we interrogate the ability of SARS-CoV-2 specific TCRs to bind all point mutations of the immunodominant HLA-A2:S269-277 epitope. While mutation space coverage is surprisingly vast, specific substitutions are not recognized by the vaccine-elicited repertoire. Structural analyses reveal a TCR sequence-based antigen recognition limitation intrinsic to vaccination. Further investigation reveals that this repertoire ‘hole’ is not present in the naive repertoire, suggesting future immune escape through these potential escape mutations could be relieved by modifications to vaccines. It remains elusive whether the T cell repertoire will cover all point mutations of a major epitope.

 Multivalent metal oxides are promising thermochemical materials (TCMs) for energy storage and conversion owing to their high energy density, air compatibility, and high-temperature stability. Co3O4 serves as a model system for examining particle-size- and structure-dependent redox behavior. While particle size and porosity are known to affect performance, their interplay and the kinetics of pore formation during cycling remain unclear. Here we show the chemical and 3D morphological evolution of Co3O4 micro- and nanoparticles during redox cycles at 800–900 °C using thermal analysis, in-situ synchrotron transmission X-ray microscopy (TXM), and scanning electron microscopy. Thermal analysis shows that nanoparticles re-oxidize more rapidly than microparticles at 800 °C. In-situ nanotomography and chemical imaging reveals that nanoparticles undergo redox conversion without forming internal pores, whereas microparticles develop isolated porosity during reduction. These pores persist through re-oxidation, correlating to a lower conversion rate in subsequent cycles. Our results demonstrate distinct degradation kinetics in Co3O4 micro- and nanoparticles, underscoring the critical role of particle size and porosity in redox performance and informing strategies to enhance the long-term efficiency of metal oxide TCMs. Using operando synchrotron X-ray imaging, the study reveals 3D morphological and chemical changes of thermochemical particles during redox cycles, uncovering degradation mechanisms and insights for improved thermal energy materials."

Here, the authors address non-Hermitian features of PTCs within a purely Hermitian Hamiltonian description, bridging classical and quantum approaches. 
 The Boson peak (BP), an excess of vibrational density of states, is ubiquitous for amorphous materials and is believed to hold the key to understanding the dynamics of glass and glass transition. Previous studies have established an energy scale for the BP, which is ~ 1-10 meV or ~ THz in frequency. However, so far, little is known about the momentum dependence or spatial correlation of the BP. Here, we report the observation of the BP in model Zr-Cu-Al metallic glasses over a wide range of momentum transfer, using inelastic neutron scattering, heat capacity, Raman scattering measurements, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The BP energy is largely dispersionless; however, the BP intensity is found to scale with the static structure factor. Additional MD simulations with a generic Lennard-Jones potential confirm the same. Based on these results, an analytical expression for the dynamic structure factor is formulated for the BP excitation. Further analysis of the simulated disordered structures suggests that the BP is related to local structure fluctuations (e.g., in shear strain). Our results offer insights into the nature of the BP and provide guidance for the development of theories of amorphous materials.

Here, the authors introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model that embeds robustness directly into the agent decision-making mechanisms through free energy minimization. 
 Despite their groundbreaking performance, autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environmental conditions become inconsistent, with minor mismatches leading to undesirable behaviors or even catastrophic failures. Robustness towards these training-environment ambiguities is a core requirement for intelligent agents and its fulfillment is a long-standing challenge towards their real-world deployments. Here, we introduce a Distributionally Robust Free Energy model (DR-FREE) that instills this core property by design. Combining a robust extension of the free energy principle with a resolution engine, DR-FREE wires robustness into the agent decision-making mechanisms. Across benchmark experiments, DR-FREE enables the agents to complete the task even when, in contrast, state-of-the-art models fail. This milestone may inspire both deployments in multi-agent settings and, at a perhaps deeper level, the quest for an explanation of how natural agents – with little or no training – survive in capricious environments. Autonomous agents can misbehave when training and environment conditions become inconsistent.

This study identifies different neutrophil subtypes involved in metastasis, highlighting therapeutic potential of neutrophil subset targeting to inhibit tumor progression. 
 Liver metastasis is a primary cause of death in colorectal cancer, yet the role of immune cells called neutrophils in this process remains complex. In this study, we identify three distinct neutrophil subtypes: anti-tumor high-density neutrophils, pro-tumor mature low-density neutrophils, and immature low-density neutrophils. Here we show that tumor-derived GM-CSF converts anti-tumor neutrophils into a pro-tumor state via the AKT–NF-κB–NFAT5 signaling axis. These activated neutrophils, when further stimulated by CXCR2 ligands, release web-like structures known as neutrophil extracellular traps which promote cancer spread by enhancing cancer cell growth, suppressing immune responses, and preparing the liver for metastasis. Importantly, we demonstrate that using antibodies depleting neutrophils or drugs inhibiting their pro-tumor activity effectively reduces liver metastasis in mice. Our work defines specific neutrophil subsets as key drivers of cancer progression and highlights their therapeutic potential in preventing metastatic spread.

Here, the authors demonstrate a phase retrieval method using multiple tilted HRTEM focal series, achieving 1.6 Å resolution with improved dose efficiency and elemental sensitivity. 
 Electron cryo-tomography (cryo-ET) enables 3D imaging of complex, radiation-sensitive structures with molecular detail. However, image contrast from the interference of scattered electrons is nonlinear with atomic density and multiple scattering further complicates interpretation. These effects degrade resolution, particularly in conventional reconstruction algorithms, which assume linearity. Particle averaging can reduce such issues but is unsuitable for heterogeneous or dynamic samples ubiquitous in biology, chemistry, and materials sciences. Here, we develop a phase retrieval-based cryo-ET method, PhaseT3M. We experimentally demonstrate its application to an approximately 7 nm Co3O4 nanoparticle on an approximately 30 nm carbon substrate, achieving a maximum resolution of 1.6 Å, surpassing conventional limits using standard cryo-TEM equipment. PhaseT3M uses a multislice model for multiple scattering and Bayesian optimization for alignment and computational aberration correction, with a positivity constraint to recover ‘missing wedge’ information. Applied directly to biological particles, it enhances reconstruction quality and reduces artifacts, establishing a standard for routine 3D imaging with phase contrast.

 The Chang’E-6 (CE-6) mission’s first lunar farside samples return advances understanding of lunar evolution. This achievement highlights the necessity of rapid landing-trajectory reconstruction and precise landing-site characterization for mission execution. We present an intelligent vision-guided framework for lunar exploration, demonstrating that high-fidelity trajectory reconstruction can simultaneously enhance landing site localization accuracy and geological analysis precision. Our approach integrates: high-precision trajectory reconstruction from descent imagery, rapid localization utilizing deep learning-enhanced landmark matching achieving 0.90 m landing-site accuracy for Chang’E-6, and physically constrained geological analysis with visual rectification. By correcting camera distortions via pose parameters, we improve crater morphometry and surface age dating through orthorectified CSFD measurements. Our results reveal late-stage volcanism ( ~ 855 Ma) in Apollo crater ejecta, challenging early farside magmatic cessation models.

 Deep-sea sediments enriched in rare earth elements represent important potential resources and paleoceanographic archives. The transfer of these elements from marine particles (e.g., Fe-Mn (oxyhydr)oxides or organic matter) to phosphate phases is essential for their enrichment during early diagenesis. However, the biogeochemical processes driving this transfer remain unresolved. Here, we investigate how microbial reductive diagenesis influences rare earth element enrichment in deep-sea sediments of the northwestern Pacific. By integrating geochemical, magnetic, and microscopic analyses of iron biogeochemical cycling and its signature mineral, biogenic magnetite, we demonstrate that microbial reduction drives the post-depositional mineralization of sinking marine particles. This process releases rare earth elements into porewater, thereby promoting their uptake into bioapatite or authigenic apatite. This mechanism was likely enhanced during past global cooling events that increased ocean productivity. Our findings provide valuable insights for tracing microbial contributions to deep-sea rare earth element enrichment and for investigating their underlying drivers.

 Excessive anthropogenic phosphorus inputs create nutrient surpluses along the terrestrial-aquatic continuum, triggering worldwide water quality challenges. River damming enhances phosphorus retention within river networks and redistributes it among reservoirs, rivers, and coastal oceans. However, the role of reservoirs as phosphorus sinks and their effect on phosphorus export to estuaries remain poorly quantified. We developed a coupled terrestrial-aquatic model to trace phosphorus fate in the highly dammed and fertilized Yangtze River Basin from 1980 to 2018. Our results show that cumulative dam-driven phosphorus retention reached $${4.7}_{3.7}^{5.5}$$ teragrams of phosphorus (median and range), exceeding the cumulative rise in phosphorus loading ($${2.1}_{1.3}^{2.9}$$ teragrams of phosphorus), thereby reversing the anticipated rise in phosphorus export to the estuary. Notably, 40% of dam-induced retention occurred during 2011–2018, despite fertilizer use plateauing around 2010. This strengthened inland water phosphorus sink arises not only from increased damming but also from the continuous release of previously stored phosphorus in terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting the key role of legacy effects in controlling the phosphorus temporal dynamics.

A comprehensive understanding of air temperature’s effects on river pollution is imperative, particularly given rising water scarcity and the increasingly frequent extreme temperature events in China. Here, we employ the fixed effects model to estimate the effects of air temperature on river water quality and elucidate inverted U-shaped responses through 276 Chinese cities from 2014-2020. Our results demonstrate that both single-day high temperatures (>37 °C) and heatwaves (four consecutive days above 35 °C) significantly increase river permanganate index (CODMn) concentration, worsening organic pollution. Additionally, these extreme temperature events contribute over 67% and 10% to quality-based water scarcity, presenting considerable challenges to water withdrawals in cities. Our findings necessitate incorporating temperature-related considerations into contemporary and prospective river governance, contributing to the development of targeted adaptation strategies and enhancing water resource management. Both single-day high temperatures and heatwaves significantly increase river permanganate index, worsening organic compound pollution, and contribute to quality-based water scarcity, according to an analysis of air temperature on river water quality in 276 Chinese cities from 2014- 2020."

 Tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite suites, dominating Earth’s early continental crust, likely formed by partial melting of hydrated metabasalt, but the specific conditions and mechanisms remain poorly constrained. Here, we conduct thermodynamic-geochemical modeling to systematically compare the roles that pressure, bulk H2O content, and source rock composition play in shaping these ancient rocks. Accordingly, we assess their optimal forming conditions, which are further validated by magmatic H2O contents retrieved from the apatite and zircon crystals of tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite suites. Our results highlight that pressure is the first-order factor controlling the formation and compositional diversity of these rock suites. Those with “high-pressure” geochemical characteristics are derived from fluid-fluxed melting at 14 – 16 kbar, a process readily explained by subduction rather than intraplate geodynamic regime. Furthermore, the temporal and spatial distributions of “high-pressure” variants, coupled with those of arc-like basalts, suggest subduction that likely initiated as a local phenomenon and transitioned to a global-scale process by 3.0 Ga. Pressure plays a primary role in controlling the formation and compositional diversity of tonalite-trondhjemite-granodiorite suites, with “high-pressure” variants derived from fluid-fluxed melting during subduction, recording the onset of global subduction at ~3.0 Ga, according to thermodynamic-geochemical modeling and mineral hygrometry analysis."

 During the 2023-24 El Niño, the July 2023–June 2024 average global mean surface temperature peaked at 1.58 °C above pre-industrial levels, associated with a record 0.36 °C year-over-year rise. Here we use statistical models and a Green’s Function method to explore the causes for this rise. We show that sea surface temperature accounts for ~92% of the interannual warming, highlighting the critical role of El Niño diversity. Unlike typical El Niños, dual tropical Pacific warming centers in 2023-24 and an eastward-extended North Atlantic jet stream synergistically amplified sea surface temperatures across tropical basins, accelerating the pace of global warming. From an energy balance perspective, ocean heat content accumulated during the preceding La Niña and a continuous increase in absorbed shortwave radiation over the ocean drove sea surface temperature rise. Accelerated warming may push the climate system closer to critical tipping points, emphasizing the need for enhanced monitoring, mitigation, and adaptation strategies.

 Vegetation structure and landscape openness are key ecological factors influencing human behavioural and cultural adaptation strategies. However, there is ongoing debate and lack of quantitative assessment about which vegetation landscape and openness levels were more conducive to hominin dispersal during the early Pleistocene. Here, we selected the early Pleistocene Majuangou archaeological site in China, which is the earliest site in the Nihewan Basin with reliable stratigraphic chronology and abundant archaeological materials, as the research object. We conducted pollen analysis across eight artefact layers and the natural sediments (1.75–1.29 Ma), and carried out the first quantitative reconstruction of vegetation openness. The results demonstrate that vegetation openness in the artefact layers was predominantly between 60% and 90%, while layers with vegetation openness below 50% or above 90% had either no or very few artefacts. The global comparison revealed that hominins’ preference for relatively open habitats was a consistent global pattern, challenging the view that relatively closed forest vegetation landscapes were more conducive to their dispersal. Our findings suggest that enhanced resource abundance, accessibility and mobility in these environments facilitated both hominin dispersal and cultural development, highlighting the pivotal role of relatively open vegetation landscapes in shaping hominin evolution. Relatively open vegetation landscapes during the early Pleistocene facilitated hominins’ evolution, with resource abundance, accessibility, and mobility playing crucial roles, according to pollen analysis and quantitative reconstruction of vegetation openness."

 Megathrust faults at subduction zones slip at a broad spectrum of rates from slow creep (centimeters per year) to dynamic rupture (meters per second) with large excess fluid pressures implicated as a control on nucleation style. We report friction measurements on oceanic basalt gouges (IODP Expedition 368X) at elevated temperatures (150°C−450°C), stresses (150 MPa) and large fluid overpressures (30-120 MPa) to represent conditions along the descending slab and to link observed rheology to microtextural evolution. With reducing effective stress, slip instabilities are first manifest as slow-slip and evolve through dynamic stick-slip as a result of reduced shear zone width. This transition in rupture style is driven by an increase in effective fault stiffness k’c and decrease in nucleation length L. Increased intergranular pressure dissolution at elevated effective stress mediates the shear localization width, controls the dynamics of strain localization, and leaves a structurally discernable fingerprint. Our results imply that effective stress-controlled mass transfer, together with strain localization, dictates the styles of instability nucleation manifest as slow earthquakes rationally evolving into dynamic megathrust ruptures. Evolution of slow slip to dynamic rupture on seabed megathrusts in basalt can be explained by strain localization and a transition to strain weakening behaviour encoded as a microtextural signature in triaxial shear experiments on oceanic basalt gouge."

However, that conclusion rests largely on cursory analysis of a small number of tide‐gauge records that are known to be unrepresentative of large‐scale RSL behavior. Here I analyze all long active tide‐gauge RSL data records on the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) coast to make a comprehensive estimate of spatially averaged RSL changes over the CONUS (CONUS RSL) during the past 125 years. I find that long‐term rates of CONUS RSL rise doubled in the past century, from about 1.7 mm yr−1 ${\text{yr}}^{-1}$ in 1900 to roughly 4.3 mm yr−1 ${\text{yr}}^{-1}$ in 2024, and that recent rates are higher than the longterm historical mean rate since 1900, which is approximately 3.0 mm yr−1 ${\text{yr}}^{-1}$. That is, CONUS tide gauges give obvious evidence of RSL acceleration, which is likely related to ongoing climate change."

Here we show an experimentally deformed olivine sample has a substantial population (17%) of b dislocations. Electron Backscatter Diffraction maps of crystal orientations provided information on dislocations from the orientation gradients. Maps show the b dislocations form subgrain walls like those formed by other dislocation types and are interpreted to form similarly by glide and climb, so b dislocations are mobile. To confirm our approach, we used Electron Backscatter Diffraction maps to select an area for Transmission Electron Microscopy imaging, down to an atomic scale image of a b dislocation. Our sample was deformed within range of subduction zone conditions; our approach can be used to investigate the scale and conditions of b slip in the mantle more widely."

Yet, such reactions are often considered self‐limiting due to passivation and reduced permeability if volume expansion occurs. This study investigates hydrogen generation during a flow‐through experiment on fractured iron‐rich cores packed with proppants, simulating a stimulated subsurface environment. Hydrogen generation initially declined over time. Introducing a thermochemical fluid to accelerate the reaction via thermal enhancement did not yield measurable hydrogen gains. Subsequent acid treatment for 2 hr led to a 30‐fold increase in hydrogen generation, which was sustained for 144 hr before the onset of a decline. Post‐acidizing hydrogen generation remained larger than pre‐acidizing hydrogen. Post‐experiment characterizations confirmed the development of preferential flow paths, mineral precipitation along fracture surfaces, and fluid‐induced surface alteration. These results demonstrate that periodic chemical stimulation can significantly enhance and prolong hydrogen generation by reactivating mineral‐fluid interfaces."

Humps in heating curves below the Curie temperature of magnetite are observed frequently. We present κ‐T curves with hump features in magnetite‐bearing flood basalt samples. Heating‐cooling experiments combined with theoretical principles suggest that these humps reflect primarily the transition from the stable single domain (SSD) to the superparamagnetic (SP) state, with possible contributions from maghemite decomposition and stress release. Scanning electron microscopy confirms magnetite intergrowths with <100 nm size, which supports the presence of SSD‐SP domain states and the diversity of hump shapes. Changes in magnetic interactions, internal stress distribution, and internal subdivision due to maghemitization likely contribute to different hump shapes in heating and cooling curves. The findings indicate that humps provide a diagnostic feature associated with thermal relaxation in fine magnetite in diverse lithologies and suggest caution in interpreting κ‐T decreases at intermediate temperatures solely by maghemite decomposition."

Large discrepancies in the seasonal cycle of H2O net fluxes at the tropopause between reanalyses and observations are also identified.

Over arid/semi‐arid regions like Oceania, soil moisture from TC precipitation is desiccated within a year, that is, the absence of TCs triggers severe droughts while soil moisture is not completely dried out even without TC precipitation over humid regions like East Asia.

In this study, we first assess the ENSO‐rainfall relationship for 10 single model initial‐condition large ensembles (LEs) over the Murray‐Darling Basin. We then apply a novel Fraction of Attributable Risk framework to quantify the projected rainfall risk in this region, specifically to the five LEs that have the same ENSO‐rainfall relationship as observations. Despite no prominent change in El Niño related rainfall amount or its variability, rainfall variability increases during La Niña and neutral phases. Additionally, three out of five LEs project an increase in rainfall risk during La Niña events, with both greater variability and higher amounts of rainfall, suggesting that the La Niña‐driven rainfall impacts may worsen under a warming climate."

Results demonstrate that both aerosol liquid water content (ALWC) and aerosol surface area are two primary factors governing the formation of OA and pON. Specifically, OA formation was predominantly driven by ALWC that is associated with aqueous‐phase processes or gas‐liquid partitioning, particularly during severe pollution episodes. pON formation was constrained by aerosol surface area, indicating the vital contribution of gas‐to‐particle partitioning from low volatility vapors or interface processes of precursors.

The application to the 2010–2023 data set resulted in a catalog of 362, largely uncatalogued, Ms 2–3, seismic events, associated with Thwaites and Pine Island Glaciers. The correlation between the occurrence frequency of Thwaites events and the episodic speed‐ups of its frontal ice tongue between 2018 and 2020 suggests a capsizing glacial earthquake nature. Pine Island Glacier events near the grounding line remain to be investigated. This study demonstrated the prevalence of glacial earthquakes in Antarctica, with characteristics distinct from those of their Greenland counterparts, warranting further investigation."

However, the relation between such distribution and the leading edge of tailward magnetic reconnection jets, also known as anti‐dipolarization fronts (ADFs), is still unclear. Here, by utilizing high‐resolution data of the Magnetospheric Multiscale (MMS) mission, we provide the first observation of electron rolling pin distribution behind ADF. Such distribution of Maxwellian electrons appears in 1.3–5 keV and is modulated by firehose fluctuations: electron fluxes are high at wave troughs (|B|‐minima) and are low at wave crests. The results of Liouville mapping and the electron loss cone angles are consistent with the spacecraft observations respectively, indicating such distribution is formed by the combination of global‐scale Fermi acceleration and local‐scale electron trapping. These findings highlight the importance of ADFs in magnetospheric convection."

For the first time, the evolving process of storm surges has been observed in 2D through SWOT satellite data, providing a unique spatial perspective on these local extreme events. To validate satellite‐derived sea level measurements, we compared SWOT observations with SCHISM hydrodynamical model and tide gauge records from the Baltic, North Sea, and Gulf of Mexico, spanning micro‐to macro‐tidal environments. ERA5 wind and pressure fields were used to verify atmospheric conditions driving surge events. Excellent agreement between SWOT, in situ, and SCHISM model data was observed. These findings underscore SWOT's transformative potential for advancing coastal hazard monitoring, filling observational gaps, tracking cyclone‐driven sea level effects and enhance our understanding of how these events influence coastal dynamics."

While their composition is unknown, subsurface sulfur could be responsible for their formation. Mercury's porous surface favors the subsurface diffusion of returning exospheric atoms. With time, diffusing atoms could form reservoirs in Mercury's subsurface. We use a 3‐D Exospheric Global Model (EGM) including subsurface diffusion to study the evolution of sulfur and sodium in Mercury's subsurface. We identify similar spatial distributions of the sulfur reservoir and of the hollows, but no relationship in the case of sodium. EGM predicts that the longitudinal distribution of hollows correlates with the peak subsurface S column density, ∼60° west of each “hot longitude.” Deeper reservoirs at Mercury's hot poles are predicted, potentially explaining the larger hollows found in these regions. The subsurface diffusion could continuously replenish the sulfur reservoir that could be responsible for the formation of hollows."

Many studies have examined its long‐term trend, but whether its variability has changed is less clear. Using observations and reanalysis data, we observe an intensified interannual variability of the Kara Sea SIG during boreal late winter (December–March) since 2004/2005. This arises from the retreat of active ice production zones in response to the strengthened modulation of the westward‐shifted North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). Using a sea ice concentration budget, we quantitatively partition the NAO's contribution to total SIG variability post‐2004 (∼63.3%), revealing comparably dominant roles of thermodynamic and dynamic processes. During this period, the negative NAO‐associated surface winds concurrently cool sea surface and export sea ice from the Kara Sea, thereby injecting freshwater into the lower latitudes.

However, recent studies have suggested that the lithospheric mantle may be prone to removal, implying that it may be denser than the asthenosphere. To address these suggestions, we use a global data set of mantle xenoliths to estimate the density structure of the cratonic lithospheric mantle (CLM), which we then compare with the density of the asthenospheric mantle at equivalent depths. Most of the CLM is either neutrally buoyant or slightly positively buoyant relative to the asthenosphere. The exception is where pyroxenite has accumulated due to melt infiltration. For these pyroxenites to remain within the CLM over geologically significant timescales they must be relatively small, that is, ≤1–20 km in size for a CLM viscosity of 1021–1023 Pa·s. Our results suggest that the majority of cratonic lithospheric roots are long‐lived due to their neutral‐to‐positive buoyancy."

Energy conservation enforces a negative correlation between the climate feedback and historical forcing for a given change in global‐mean temperature. Here, we examine the negative correlation between the radiative forcing due to aerosol‐cloud interactions and the shortwave cloud feedback to warming that appears in a perturbed parameter ensemble (PPE). The PPE is not tuned to match the historical record, yet a negative correlation emerges over the extratropics due to the combined effects of liquid cloud precipitation efficiency and radiative saturation in the shortwave. Using an energy balance model, we argue that these processes combine to push Earth System Models to yield a temperature record in keeping with observations, but also limit our ability to constrain future warming posterior with the temperature record."

Multiple reanalyses indicate that regional quasi‐biweekly rainfall variability increased by 12%–44% in the recent two decades relative to the earlier two. This intensification is driven mainly by dynamical changes in vertical velocity perturbations, while thermodynamic increases in mean moisture play a secondary role. The strong dynamical influence also accounts for much of the spread in historical simulations from CMIP6 and CESM2‐LENS. Only when thermodynamic moistening outweighs this dynamical uncertainty do models consistently project stronger quasi‐biweekly variability under future scenarios.

Extreme heatwaves, where both daily maximum and minimum heat indices exceed the 95th percentile, are now more frequent, prolonged, and intense, with events reaching maximum “feel‐like” temperatures above 115°F (∼46°C).

These biases are highly sensitive to the region and/or season of interest, with commonalities in the east Pacific and Atlantic Ocean basins, possibly due to their similar observed climatological northern hemisphere intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). However, the colloquial name “double ITCZ bias” comes from a time and/or zonal mean, and may be missing important information about errors at smaller time and space scales. In this study, we explore daily characteristics of the ITCZ in observations, reanalyses, and 25 Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 6 (CMIP6) models over the east Pacific Ocean. We devise and apply an algorithm that determines a region's dominant daily ITCZ configuration, its “ITCZ state,” based on the daily mean precipitation field. The five ITCZ states include: northern hemisphere (nITCZ), southern hemisphere (sITCZ), double (dITCZ), equatorial (eITCZ), and absent (aITCZ). We find that nearly all CMIP6 models gravely underestimate nITCZs and overestimate sITCZs during January through May, in contrast with what “double ITCZ bias” suggests. Surprisingly, all reanalyses also underestimate nITCZs and overestimate eITCZs. Errors in ITCZ state interannual variability are consistent with mean errors in reanalyses, while sITCZ interannual variability is far too low relative to the mean in most CMIP6 models. Lastly, all reanalyses and CMIP6 models overestimate precipitation rates in the southern hemisphere ITCZ band for dITCZs and sITCZs, suggestive of errors with atmospheric origins."

However, quantitative observational analysis of different entrainment‐mixing mechanisms between cumulus cores and edges remains lacking. This study provides the quantitative analysis of such mechanisms in cumulus cores versus edges using aircraft observations from the Rain in Cumulus Over the Ocean project. Results show that cores have larger liquid water content, larger cloud droplets, and smaller entrained droplet‐free air parcels, consequently yielding a larger homogeneous mixing degree (ψ) and a smaller Damköhler number (Da ${D}_{\mathrm{a}}$, the ratio of mixing time scale to droplet evaporation time scale). ψ is 0.13 higher and Da ${D}_{\mathrm{a}}$ is 3.3 lower in the cores compared to the edges. Furthermore, core‐edge differences in ψ are analyzed under varying environmental and cloud conditions. Smaller cloud width, weaker in‐cloud vertical velocity, lower environmental relative humidity, and lower aerosol concentration all reduce ψ and enhance the core‐edge ψ contrast.

Understanding how iodine responds to climatic shifts is crucial for predicting future atmospheric composition. Here, we present high‐resolution iodine fluxes in the EGRIP (East GReenland Ice Core Project) ice core in central Greenland spanning the last 15.7 kyr. By integrating these data with complementary proxies from other ice and marine sediment cores, we explore both the temporal and spatial patterns of iodine deposition across the Greenland ice sheet. We find lower iodine fluxes at EGRIP compared to RECAP and NEEM ice cores over the last 15.7 kyr, explained by the lower efficiency of iodine transport to the interior of the ice sheet. Our results show that during the cold periods of the Last Glacial Termination (15.7–11.7 kyr before present), iodine fluxes at EGRIP were higher than during the Holocene, likely due to enhanced long‐range transport of iodine adsorbed onto dust and sea‐salt aerosols under stronger glacial wind regimes. In contrast, during the Holocene, the sources and transport pathways of iodine shifted to marine sources. We infer that iodine was increasingly emitted from the expanded seasonal sea ice area and biologically active subpolar North Atlantic waters, though overall fluxes at EGRIP were lower than during the glacial period, reflecting the reduction in long‐range transport. After rising until 5 kyr before present, iodine fluxes declined throughout the Neoglacial, in concomitance with regional cooling, increased sea ice extent, and reduced ocean productivity."

However, mechanisms driving the changes in spatial structure remain unexplored. Here we examine changes in the spatial structure of observed summer MCSs over East Asia from 2000 to 2021, and find that the spatial structure of MCSs defined by hourly precipitation fields has become sharper, dominated by enhancement in heavy precipitation grid cells. The MCS‐maximum precipitation intensity increases at a rate of 16.7% decade−1, contributed roughly equally by both the overall increase in MCS precipitation rates and the rising spatial sharpness. The observed sharper spatial structure arises from an enhanced moisture–convection feedback. Climate change during 2000–2021 intensifies synoptic moist static energy (MSE) forcing which stimulates enhanced shallow convection about 9 hr before MCS initiation. This enhanced shallow convection redistributes water vapor and ascents into heavy precipitation grid cells, thus sharpening MCS. Following MCS formation, intensified deep convection reinforces the mechanism, leading to a more pronounced sharpening of the MCS structure. The “stronger MSE and sharper MCS” mechanism identified here is tied to enhanced moisture–convection feedback, in which the increased convective latent heating peaks around 600 hPa before and during MCS life, and enhanced stratiform latent heating peaks around 400 hPa primarily during the development and maturation phases of MCS."

Tsuchiya,Rapid Recharge and Descent of Thundercloud Core Producing Gamma‐Ray Glow,"We report two gamma‐ray glows observed on 22 December 2023, during a winter thunderstorm in Japan, using an array of four radiation detectors. The first glow, detected by one sensor, was quenched by a lightning discharge. The second glow appeared 2–3 min later and was tracked by three other detectors. Radar observations suggest both glows originated from the same thundercloud cell. However, the detection timing of the second glow was inconsistent with simple thundercloud movement, indicating temporal variations in intrinsic glow brightness. A three‐dimensional lightning mapping observation suggests that a discharge activity depleted the electric field that generated the first glow and that the electric field having produced the second glow has been rapidly recovered. In addition, the radar observations also detected a descent of the thundercloud core between the two glows, which may have developed an electrified region and the second glow enough to be observed by the detectors. Tracking gamma‐ray glows is crucial for understanding electrified regions in thunderclouds and associated gamma‐ray glows."

Kohma;K. Sato;D. C. Fritts;T. S. Lund,Horseshoe‐Shaped Vortices Accompanied With Breaking of Upward Propagating Gravity Waves and Their Relation to Mean‐Flow Acceleration,"Breaking gravity waves (GWs) are a major source of turbulence and momentum deposition in the middle atmosphere. In spite of the importance of this phenomenon, the small‐scale vortex structures associated with wave breaking remain poorly documented under realistic conditions. We perform a three‐dimensional compressible simulation of orographic GWs observed above Syowa Station, Antarctica, using 125 m horizontal grid spacing from the ground to the mesosphere. In the 75–80 km region upward‐propagating waves break and exhibit numerous horseshoe‐shaped vortices whose bends extend obliquely downward. By examining the time evolution of a representative horseshoe‐shaped vortex, we identify the mechanism responsible for the downward elongation of the vortex tube: (a) horizontal vorticity aligned with the GW phase lines is amplified as the wave approaches the overturning condition; (b) a convectively driven downward flow displaces the vortex tube downward, creating the initial horseshoe shape; (c) vertical shear associated with the GW tilts and stretches the tube, reinforcing the downward flow. The direction of the initial vortex tube is determined largely by the baroclinic effect of the GW. The present study also addresses the relationship between the vortex tube structure and the mean flow acceleration (0.3–0.4 m s−1 min−1). The vortex tube deformation associated with wave breaking can be interpreted as a manifestation of the irreversible cascade that transfers the GW momentum to the mean flow."

India is already experiencing more frequent extreme weather events, underscoring the urgency of assessing how such events may evolve with continued warming. This study uses high‐resolution, statistically downscaled, and bias‐corrected CMIP6 climate projections from 30 different models to assess the future compound extremes such as Cold‐Dry (CD), Cold‐Wet (CW), Warm‐Dry (WD), and Warm‐Wet (WW) under 1.5°C and 2.0°C global warming levels for two future climate scenarios (SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5) during the pre‐monsoon season (March‐June). The projections indicate that cold‐related extremes (CD, CW) will become rare while warm‐related extremes (WD, WW) will increase significantly across India, with the largest changes emerging by the mid‐21st century across the West Central India (WCI), North East India (NEI), and Central North East India (CNEI). The occurrence of WD events has approximately doubled while WW events have increased nearly threefold across India during this season. Temperature increases, reinforced by land‐atmosphere coupling and thermodynamic constraints such as higher vapor pressure deficit and greater moisture holding capacity, intensify wet and dry extremes, while circulation‐driven precipitation changes play a lesser role. Population exposure to WD and WW events is projected to rise sharply, particularly in densely populated and climate‐sensitive regions. These findings highlight the need for targeted, region‐specific adaptation planning and risk‐informed decision‐making to manage the escalating risks from compound extremes in a warming climate."

Although advancements in computer‐controlled technologies have significantly improved analytical throughput (>1,000 particles/hour), the analysis of particulate matter (PM) samples still faces two fundamental challenges: first, determining how many particles need to be analyzed (i.e., the analysis threshold) to ensure statistical representativeness and second, quantifying the data uncertainty caused by the limited number of particles analyzed. Herein, we established an innovative framework addressing both challenges: a multicriteria analysis threshold evaluation system was developed to determine analysis thresholds, and a cyclic overlapping block bootstrap (COBB) method was proposed to quantify data uncertainty arising from finite particle counts. Analysis of 38 PM samples (479,200 particles) encompassing diverse emission sources, urban environments, and seasonal variations revealed that sample complexity dictated analysis thresholds. Environmental samples required higher thresholds (approximately 4,300 particles for active sampling and 5,000 for passive sampling) than source samples (approximately 3,600 particles) primarily due to their more complex composition. COBB analysis demonstrated an inverse correlation between component abundance and relative uncertainty. Notably, trace components (abundance <1.0%) exhibited persistently high uncertainty even with 2,000‐particle analyses. This framework establishes systematic methodologies spanning standardized SEM data acquisition to uncertainty quantification, substantially enhancing the scientific rigor, and cross‐study comparability of SEM‐based atmospheric PM research."

Due to their active participation in global supply chains, these emerging economies generate large amounts of methane emissions to supply the required products to the global economy. While existing research has investigated the displacement of methane emissions between nations via interregional trade, the geospatial details of global methane footprint in emerging economies, which are crucial for pinpointing location‐specific mitigation strategies, remain unknown. This study addressed this gap by connecting high‐resolution methane emission maps from Emissions Database for Global Atmospheric Research with the Exiobase muti‐regional input‐output trade database, and generated spatially explicit hotspot maps of global methane footprint in emerging economies from 1995 to 2021. Results revealed that the methane footprint of global consumption in emerging economies is primarily concentrated in resource‐rich, agriculture‐intensive, and well‐connected areas, with major regions contributing to 70% of total methane emissions in emerging economies. The displacement of methane emissions from economically‐developed regions to emerging economies has consistently increased from 1995 to 2021, with the European Union, the United States, and the Rest of the World Europe collectively accounting for 70% of global methane emissions in 2021. Evolution trends and policy implications were presented for main sectoral agents including Fuel exploitation, Enteric fermentation, and Agricultural soil. The outcomes of this study can contribute to identifying emission hotspots in emerging economies and informing international cooperation efforts aimed at reducing methane emissions."

UGSs affect air quality through multiple pathways, some of which were generally missing in existing literature. Here we assess the impacts of UGSs on regional climate and air quality in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) with a more comprehensive framework. We consider the impacts of BVOCs emissions, dry deposition, radiative effects of produced aerosols, and transpiration effects. UGSs tend to elevate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) concentrations by 5.11 μg/m3, dominated by evapotranspiration (4.62 μg/m3) that lowers mixing height and offset by additional dry deposition surfaces (−1.24 μg/m3). Although emitted BVOCs enhance ozone, evapotranspiration and dry deposition counterbalance the adverse effect by ∼87%. When considering the aerosol radiative effect, our findings indicate that both BVOC emissions and evapotranspiration contribute to mitigating the urban heat island effect between 14:00 and 16:00. Our results suggest that the air quality degradation will not be serious for cities with low aerosol concentrations if vegetations with less VOCs are planned. Additionally, UGSs can further help to alleviate urban warming."

Wildfire smoke detrimentally impacts human health, and evidence has shown that wildfire fine particulate matter (PM2.5) might be more harmful than other sources of PM2.5 for respiratory conditions. Epidemiological research on health effects of wildfire smoke has mainly focused on PM2.5 and there is limited evidence on the impacts of particulate matter less than or equal to 10 μm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10) and O3. PM2.5, PM10, and O3 might have differential effects on human health based on the source of emissions (smoke vs. non‐smoke air pollution). Here, we first quantified the contribution of wildfires to PM10 and O3 concentrations in California, USA for years 2006–2019, using a statistical modeling framework. R2 for our PM10 predictive model ranged between 0.68 and 0.78 for prediction using testing and all monitoring sites involved, respectively. Similarly, R2 values for our ozone predictive model ranged between 0.78 (hold‐out sites) and 0.89 (all sites). Second, we quantified the short‐term impacts of wildfire‐specific PM10 and O3 concentrations, along with wildfire‐specific PM2.5, on hospital admissions for respiratory and cardiovascular illnesses during three different time periods and at various spatial extents (all California ZIP codes and regional analyses). We found heterogeneous effects of wildfire smoke pollutants on different health outcomes and across different regions and periods considered in our study."

 The peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase 2 (PTRH2, Bit-1, BIT1) gene plays a pro-survival role during development with loss of function gene mutations causing congenital infantile multisystem disease (IMNEPD). In wild-type female mice hearts, Ptrh2 protein levels significantly increase during pregnancy and decrease postpartum, demonstrating a protective role in response to pregnancy-initiated cardiac stresses. Peripartum cardiomyopathy (PPCM) is due to dysregulated protective signaling in the pregnant heart. The genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying PPCM remain poorly defined with no specific therapies. Here, we engineered a cardiac-specific Ptrh2 knockout (Ptrh2-CKO) mouse and show these maternal mice develop left ventricular systolic dysfunction, exhibit high rates of postpartum heart failure, and model key features of human PPCM. Infusion of a caspase 3-specific inhibitor attenuated the PPCM phenotype. Collectively, our findings demonstrate Ptrh2 is a negative regulator of pregnancy-induced cardiac stresses by activating pro-survival signals and blocking apoptotic signals, suggesting Ptrh2 may be a therapeutic target for the treatment of PPCM.

 Ecologists have long debated the universality of the energetic equivalence rule, which posits that population energy use should be invariant with average body size due to negative size–density scaling. We explore size–density and size–energy use scaling across 183 geographically–distributed soil invertebrate food webs (comprising 55,054 individual soil invertebrates) to investigate the universality of these fundamental energetic equivalence rule assumptions across trophic levels and varying food web structure. Additionally, we compare two measures of energy use to investigate size–energy use relationships: population metabolism and energy fluxes. We find that size–density scaling does not support energetic equivalence in soil communities. Furthermore, evidence of energetic equivalence is dependent on the estimate of energy use applied, the trophic level of consumers, and food web properties. Our study demonstrates a need to integrate food web energetics and trophic structure to better understand how energetic constraints shape the body size structure of terrestrial ecosystems.

 Probiotic-based biotherapy for colorectal cancer (CRC) faces significant challenges due to poor tumor-targeting and limited bioactivities within the complex tumor microenvironment. This study shows that Lactobacillus reuteri (L. reuteri)’s inherent bioactivities, including proliferation, metabolism, and colorectal colonization, can be enhanced by manganese, prompting the fabrication of a manganese-engineered strain (MnLR). Oral administration of MnLR with its metabolic substrate-glycerol (MnLR/Gly) promotes the enrichment of L. reuteri and its antitumor metabolites within colon tumors. Across multiple preclinical colon tumor models, MnLR/Gly alone achieves a 95.6% inhibition of orthotopic tumor growth, liver metastases reduction by 62.1%, and confers durable protection, with 75% of prophylactically treated mice remaining long-term tumor-free and 62.5% resisting tumor rechallenge. Mechanistically, MnLR/Gly induces both intratumoral and peripheral dendritic cell maturation, M1 macrophage polarization, and effector T-cell responses. In orthotopic CRC rabbit models, GlyMnLR enteric capsules demonstrate significant antitumor efficacy comparable to standard chemotherapy while exhibiting favorable safety.

 The gut microbiome is crucial in regulating overall physiology and communicates with the host through various microbial-derived metabolites, including secondary bile acids (BAs). However, mechanisms underlying the gut microbiome-BA crosstalk (gMxB) are still poorly understood. Here, we assess the postprandial cecal microbiome, BA levels, and colon transcriptome of male BXD mice fed with a chow or high-fat diet, and find that genetic and dietary factors shift microbiome composition and affect gMxB. Four diet-dependent co-mapping genetic loci associated with gMxB, including the interaction between Turicibacter sanguinis - plasma cholic acid, are identified using systems genetics approaches. By integrating human MiBioGen database, we prioritize PTGR1 and PTPRD as candidate genes potentially regulating identified gMxB. The human relevance of these candidates on metabolic health is investigated using data from the UK biobank, FinnGen, and million veteran program databases. Overall, this study illustrates potential modulators regulating gMxB and provides insights into gut microbiome-host communication.

Protective antibodies that block KRM1 binding were identified, offering a path for therapeutic development. 
 Coxsackievirus A6 (CVA6), a major cause of hand, foot, and mouth disease, lacks approved vaccines or drugs. KRM1 is its only known receptor, but its precise role remains unclear. This study investigates CVA6’s entry mechanism and antibody neutralization. Cryo-EM shows CVA6 clinical strain HeB primarily exists as mature virions. KRM1 binding within the canyon triggers conversion to uncoating intermediate, defining KRM1 as an uncoating receptor for CVA6. However, KRM1 knockout reduces CVA6 infectivity without affecting attachment. Conversely, disrupting heparan sulfate proteoglycan (HSPG) impairs both viral attachment and infectivity, and CVA6 virions bind heparin directly. These results support a two-receptor entry model for CVA6: HSPG mediates viral attachment, while KRM1 induces uncoating. Additionally, we develop two CVA6-specific protective antibodies (1F4 and 3H7), targeting a new antigenic site near the three-fold axis of the viral capsid. These antibodies sterically block KRM1 binding and function post-attachment, consistent with KRM1’s role. The findings elucidate CVA6 entry and offer a basis for antibody interventions. This study defines a two-receptor entry mechanism for coxsackievirus A6: heparan sulfate for initial attachment and KRM1 for uncoating.

Here, the authors show that metastatic breast cancer cells use lactate for mitochondrial oxidation via the CD147/MCT1/LDHB complex to sustain stemness and promote metastasis. 
 Metastatic cancer cells, originating from cancer stem cells with metastatic capacity, utilize nutrient flexibility to navigate the challenges of the metastatic cascade. However, the nutrient required to maintain the stemness potentials of metastatic cancer cells remains unclear. Here, we reveal that metastatic breast cancer cells sustain stemness and initiate metastasis upon detachment by taking up and oxidizing lactate. In detached metastasizing breast cancer cells, lactate is incorporated into the tricarboxylic acid cycle, boosting oxidative phosphorylation, and promoting the stemness potentials via α-KG-DNMT3B-mediated SOX2 hypomethylation. Moreover, lactate is taken up and oxidized in mitochondria by the CD147/MCT1/LDHB complex, which correlates with stemness potentials and tumor metastasis in patients with breast cancer. An intracellularly expressed single-chain variable fragment targeting mitochondrial CD147 (mito-CD147 scFv) effectively disrupts the mitochondrial CD147/MCT1/LDHB complex, inhibits lactate-induced stemness potential, depletes circulating breast cancer cells, and reduces metastatic burden, suggesting promising clinical applications in reducing lactate-fueled metastasis.

 Neonicotinoid insecticides (NNs), widely deployed in agriculture, are now recognized as pervasive environmental contaminants. This study reveals that the photochemical degradation of nitenpyram (NPM), a prominent NN, in the aqueous phase generates substantial fluxes of gaseous reactive nitrogen species, including nitrous acid (HONO) and nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2). Reaction pathways, elucidated through aqueous and gas-phase product analysis and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, demonstrate that HONO, NO2, and NO arise directly from the excited triplet state of NPM. Global modeling, parameterized by laboratory-derived kinetics, estimates annual emissions of 71.2 Gg N yr−1 (NOx) and 40.7 Gg N yr−1 (HONO) from NPM photodegradation. These emissions elevate boundary-layer concentrations of HONO, ozone (O3), and OH by 0.54%, 0.11%, and 0.20%, respectively, globally.

This study reveals a distinct post-2000 surge in summer extreme precipitation over the TP, characterized primarily by a sharp increase in event frequency, with the northwestern TP emerging as the predominant hotspot. We attribute this amplification to enhanced moisture convergence, dynamically modulated by an anomalous anticyclone to the east of the northwestern TP. Mechanistically, this key anticyclonic anomaly constitutes a pivotal node in an atmospheric wave train anchored by concurrent North Atlantic sea surface warming and Arctic sea ice loss.

 Maize residue, the remaining biomass after crop harvest, represents the largest soil carbon input in agricultural lands. Residue affects crop yields and sustainability through its impact on soil carbon-nutrient-water processes. Here, we address the lack of spatial and temporal knowledge by synthesizing field experiments with public surveys to estimate maize residue quantity and quality at the county level in the US Corn Belt. We found that maize residue carbon input has increased by 46% from 1980 to 2020, with today’s gross production worth $14.3 billion in carbon markets. The increase was caused by increased maize productivity (77%) and area expansion (23%). While more residue production is desirable for soil carbon sequestration, large residue amounts challenge the implementation of conservation practices such as low-intensity tillage and cover crops. The historical increase in maize residue amount is large and variable across the landscape. Our study provides actionable data for re-assessing residue management practices to optimize productivity and sustainability, especially in high-yielding areas.

Natural Capital Accounting is increasingly promoted for decision-making but overlooks First Nations’ values, limiting its potential.

We recommend establishing an international working group under the auspices of the United Nations to include recognition of these values in accounting and how this recognition can inform decision-making.

 Understanding the response of biofilms to climatic conditions and their effects on cultural heritage sites is crucial for developing effective conservation strategies. Previous studies have primarily focused on microbial community responses to environmental factors, and little is known about how climatic conditions influence biofilm-induced deterioration and protection. Here we analyzed genomic data from stone heritage sites in East and South Asia and found that biofilm roles shifted from causing deterioration to offering protection along the transition from temperate to tropical climates. This shift was likely regulated by climate-driven variations in functional genes associated with dissimilatory nitrate reduction (napAB, narGHI, nrfAH, and nirBD) and assimilatory sulfate reduction (cysJI and sir). The expression of genes related to these pathways inhibits the accumulation of soluble salts and biogenic acids, leading to protective effects. This study elucidates the dynamic role of microbes in cultural heritage conservation and lays the foundation for sustainable preservation strategies.

 The chalcophile element fertility of arc magmas that modulates the enrichment of gold in porphyry copper deposits is negatively correlated with magma differentiation depth, which was attributed to sulfide saturation during magmatic evolution. However, the role of magma source processes remains to be evaluated. Here, we investigate the platinum-group element and copper systematics of a suite of oceanic slab-derived adakitic dikes from West Junggar, NW China. Geochemical and petrographic evidence suggests the adakitic magmas underwent sulfide segregation, but invokes a source control on the chalcophile element variations. Modeling indicates that adakitic melts were initially depleted in copper and palladium, and have gained palladium via interaction with peridotite. Our results demonstrate that source processes can greatly affect the initial chalcophile element fertility of arc magmas. High-degree mantle melting, combined with late sulfide saturation, produces ore-forming magmas with high chalcophile element fertility, favoring the gold-rich porphyry copper mineralization under thin arcs.

 Ammonia (NH3) emissions from agricultural lands represent a major environmental concern, with current emission models heavily relying on inherent soil pH as a key determinant based on chemical equilibrium principles. Here, analyzing 1792 field measurements across global croplands, we demonstrate that soils with inherently higher pH generally have lower NH3 emissions. We identify enhanced nitrification as the key mechanism, where higher pH promotes rapid NH3 oxidation, thereby reducing substrate availability for NH3 volatilization. This biological process can reduce NH3 emissions by 11% per unit increase in inherent soil pH. In paddy rice, nitrification is inhibited due to the flooded environment, leading to higher emission factors (EF) than upland crops, with EF positively correlating with pH above approximately 7.5. Our findings highlight that current emission inventories may substantially misestimate NH3 emissions by oversimplifying pH effects and overlooking biological processes.

 Global land cover mapping is essential for environmental monitoring and earth system modeling, but the high production costs lead to considerable carbon dioxide emissions that are rarely considered. We develop a carbon dioxide emission method for land cover mapping, which takes into account both direct and indirect carbon dioxide emissions associated with the mapping process. The results show that completing annual global land cover mapping at a 30 m resolution generate an estimated 6,880.7 to 10,126.6 tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions. Based on mapping information extracted from publications published between 2014 and 2024, the cumulative emissions from land cover mapping during this period were approximately 3.89 million tonnes. Projections indicate that by 2050, annual emissions could exceed 184.09 million tonnes. To address the carbon effect, we propose three emission reduction strategies: artificial intelligence-assisted collaborative sample labeling, pre-training models with unlabeled data, and model compression techniques, achieving up to a 35% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. Our results reveal the potential for carbon dioxide emission reduction in land cover mapping, providing a pathway toward sustainable, low-carbon mapping frameworks.

 Regional thermochronology provides an important record of crustal exhumation through deep time. However, untangling the myriad of geodynamic, tectonic, climatic and surface processes responsible for long-term upper crustal cooling is often hindered by thermochronology data being conventionally interpreted in a static geographic framework. Here, we present a workflow for interpreting thermochronology data and thermal history models via integration with numerical plate tectonic, mantle convection, and paleoclimate reconstructions. Using a compilation of inverse thermal history models from Central Asia, based on fission-track and (U-Th)/He data, we demonstrate the power of placing thermochronology data in their paleogeographic context to untangle the geodynamic, tectonic and climate drivers of exhumation. This shows that the diachronous Mesozoic-to-recent (230-0 Ma) exhumation history of Central Asia was primarily controlled by reactivation of pre-Mesozoic crustal-scale shear zones in response to plate kinematics and Tethyan subduction dynamics, while dynamic topography and changes in paleoprecipitation played relatively insignificant roles.

 Detecting C4 plants consumption is central to investigating animal ecology, agriculture, dietary transitions, and socio-environmental adaptations, and can be done using carbon isotope analysis. The conventional δ¹³C threshold used to identify C4 plant intake does not consider substantial ecological variability across Europe. By analyzing over 4,000 δ13C values from archaeological C3 and C4 grains, we present a European-wide C3 grain δ13C baseline and establish adjusted δ13C threshold estimations for C4 consumption from the site to the ecozone scale using multicomponent environmental models and ecozone cluster analysis. We show that a fixed threshold lead to under- or overestimation of C4 plant consumption, particularly in northern/humid and southern/arid regions, where the threshold needs to be revised downwards or upwards by up to 2‰. This refined framework offers a more accurate baseline for interpreting human and animal diet and enhances our understanding of the spread, adoption and consumption of C4 crops across Europe.

To contribute effectively to climate mitigation, markets must deliver credits that meet international standards guaranteeing credits are additional, conservative, and equivalent to at least 1 ton of CO2. Yet protocols for quantifying credits make different assumptions, raising questions about whether protocols meet the ‘equivalency standard’. We test for equivalency using a common dataset of 4988 US Midwestern corn-soybean fields, representing a carbon market project, to estimate credit issuances for adoption of no-till plus cover cropping practices. We find issuances, across the three major protocols being used for US croplands, differing for this common project by up to ∼130 000 credits per year. Our ‘Protocol Intercomparison Project’ reveals how quantitative evaluations can identify assumptions generating marked differences in crediting, thereby guiding research that informs protocol revisions to build confidence in mitigation and demonstrating paths forward for protocol harmonization efforts."

These values are based on expert judgment, and a rigorous model-based confirmation of these boundary values is lacking in literature. In this paper, we address this important research gap using idealized climate model simulations. We analyze the response of the South Asian summer monsoon precipitation when the regional mean AOD is increased from the modeled present-day value of 0.14 to the proposed planetary boundary values of 0.25 and 0.5. Our simulations confirm that a regional AOD of 0.25 could indeed lead to drought conditions (>10% mean precipitation reduction) in India, while an AOD of 0.5 reduces Indian summer monsoon precipitation by about 19%. The reduction in the summer monsoon precipitation is driven by both fast adjustments (rapid adjustment of the atmosphere to aerosol radiative forcing) and slow responses (responses to changes in sea surface temperature). The rapid adjustment to anthropogenic aerosols, predominantly sulfates, involves enhanced atmospheric stability, subsidence, and suppressed cloud formation and precipitation. The slow response involves zonal surface temperature gradients between the North Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean leading to changes in the Walker circulation, anomalous subsidence over SA, and a decrease in monsoon precipitation. Enhanced aerosol loading over SA reduces monsoon precipitation, regardless of aerosol composition, though the magnitude of reduction depends on whether the aerosols are primarily reflective or absorbing. Our findings confirm the risk of major disruptions to regional hydrology in SA when regional aerosol loading exceeds the boundary values. Future studies should assess the robustness of our results using other climate models and for other monsoon regions."

Yet, simulating unprecedented events, i.e. events which are more extreme than observed in historical datasets, remains challenging. To some extent, anticipating such events is possible by accounting for the full range of climate variability. Using a 525-year synthetic dataset from a seasonal reforecast archive, this study uncovers potential unprecedented storm surge events for European and Mediterranean coastlines, focussing on their magnitude, spatial extent and seasonality. We identify Germany, the Netherlands and western UK as hotspot regions that could experience unprecedented storm surge levels that are more than half a meter higher than historical events. Spatially unprecedented extreme peak surges, affecting more provinces within a 3 d time window than previously recorded, may impact up to 49% of the provinces, with simultaneous effects in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic regions. Additionally, countries including the Netherlands, Germany and the UK may experience at least one temporally unprecedented surge during the summer months. Understanding these different dimensions of unprecedented events represents a significant advance in our knowledge of coastal flood risk in Europe and supports improved coastal flood risk management decisions, including enhanced flood defence standards, disaster risk management and planning of coastal operations."

This study examines two grid-integration strategies: supplier-managed charging (SMC), which gives utilities control over charging timing, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G), which transforms BEVs into distributed energy storage resources. Using a discrete choice experiment with 1,356 current BEV owners, we quantify how program attributes influence enrollment decisions. Using multinomial logit models, results suggest that SMC participants predominantly value operational flexibility and recurring payments while V2G participants prefer monetary incentives, indicating a willingness to provide grid services for compensation. Through simulation analysis, we identify program ‘attribute equivalencies’ that quantify changes needed in attributes to achieve equivalent enrollment levels. These findings can be used in the design of market mechanisms and policy frameworks that accelerate BEV integration into future energy systems."

As a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, drought is characterized through various indices—meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological- each capturing different aspects of the phenomenon. This diversity has led to growing demand for integrated drought monitoring tools that offer a more holistic understanding of drought conditions. Traditionally, newly developed composite drought indices are assessed through the comparison with existing indices. However, this model-by-model validation approach does not necessarily reflect real-world accuracy or relevance. Therefore, a paradigm shift is needed—from comparative validation among indices to impact-oriented evaluation—emphasizing the capacity of drought indices to capture actual societal and environmental consequences. In this study, we propose a novel drought index derived from deep learning, evaluated through an impact-oriented lens using drought-induced economic losses as the primary performance metric. The index is computed using advanced deep learning techniques and a range of drought-related variables. To enhance model accuracy and robustness, we employ different self-supervised learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, artificial neural networks, and variational autoencoders. The analysis utilizes ERA5 reanalysis data (1989–2024) for Italy, integrated with economic loss records from the EM-DAT database. Each model’s performance is assessed based on its ability to estimate potential economic losses caused by drought. The proposed framework allows users to select the most suitable index based on a guided analysis, balancing data collection effort and predictive reliability."

Although it has successfully supported Denmark’s national strategies for over a decade and is drawing attention in other EU countries, several methodological limitations hinder its broader applicability. This letter identifies five such limitations and proposes corresponding updates to enhance the indicator’s scientific robustness and scalability across the EU: (1) consistent hazard assessment across compartments, (2) precautionary treatment of missing data, (3) updated hazard metric selection, (4) harmonised normalisation procedures and (5) a statistically grounded weighting protocol. These methodological updates aim to establish a harmonised PLI suitable for EU-wide policy applications, such as fiscal instruments (e.g. differentiated taxation based on hazard levels) and pesticide risk assessments."

However, all previous assessments on global-scale heat exposure focused on the daily scale, limiting accurate estimation of heat duration and the related extent of spatial disparity of population heat exposure. Here, based on high-spatial-resolution hourly temperature and age-group population datasets, we unveil the global hourly population exposure to extreme heat in the last decades. The results show that extreme heat (≥46 °C) hours per heat day have increased by 0.4 h between 1979 and 2023. As the number of heat hours and population have increased, surface air temperature-based extreme heat exposure increased by about 60% (from 3.7 × 1011 person-hours to 5.9 × 1011 person-hours), and universal thermal climate index (UTCI)-based extreme heat exposure increased by about 70% (from 1.5 × 1012 person-hours to 2.6 × 1012 person-hours) between 2000 and 2020. There is a large disparity between the hourly and daily extreme heat exposures, stemming from the change in the number of heat hours per heat day. The most pronounced discrepancy is in UTCI-based very strong heat exposure, with an average disparity equivalent to 2.6 × 1010 person-days. Moreover, global hourly population heat exposure exhibits a distinct inverted-pyramidal structure with increase in age. This is attributed to young people exposed to heat stress outnumbering the elderly, and disproportionately more young people residing in hotter regions. For heat exposure of all age groups, the population effect and interaction effect are dominant factors for the increased heat exposure in tropical regions, while the warming effect primarily drives that in temperate zones. Our study highlights the need for and urgency of health risk assessment based on hourly heat exposure."

While shaming has been studied and applied as a regulatory and governance tool in other contexts, only a small but growing body of scholarship has begun to examine its potential in the climate arena. Drawing on multidisciplinary research from the social sciences, the humanities, and law, we review and map the main strands of this emerging literature to show the diverse forms and potential of shaming mechanisms, actors, and messages in the climate domain. Based on this analysis, we identify several gaps in the literature and practice of climate shaming, including explicit regulatory shaming, intergovernmental shaming, shaming of regulators by civil-society actors, and regulatory shaming of industry leaders. We propose expanding the conceptual framework of climate shaming to encompass these neglected dimensions, with the aim of encouraging further research as well as policy and governance experimentation in this evolving field."

We conducted a rapid systematic review (search up to: February 2024) of primary studies reporting on the health impacts of climate change exposure pathways (hazards; health risks; solutions and responses) for populations at-risk of experiencing health inequalities, identified using the Core20PLUS framework (people experiencing the greatest deprivation; people from protected characteristics groups related to ethnicity, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, and religion or belief; people from inclusion health groups). Of the 20 014 records identified, 24 were included. Of these, 20 reported on people experiencing the greatest deprivation, with some evidence that increase in ambient temperature, extreme cold, and extreme heat had similar impacts on mortality in the most and least deprived areas. No conclusions could be drawn for this population group for other outcomes or exposures due to the limited number of studies identified and their methodological quality. In people experiencing homelessness, 2 studies reported that increase in ambient temperature was associated with adverse health impacts but the disproportionate impact on this population group was not assessed. No conclusions could be drawn for ethnic minority groups or people with drug and/or alcohol dependence due to the limited evidence identified. No studies were identified for the remaining population groups.

Here, integrating high-frequency eddy covariance (EC) data from 140 global flux tower sites (872 site-years) with detailed process-based modeling, we examine ecosystem responses during and immediately after heatwaves. We show that heatwaves caused a −40% (range [−29%, −128%]) reduction in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) compared to pre-heatwave values, with this reduction persisting over the following two weeks (−38% range [+3%, −154%]). We attributed NEP decreases to photosynthesis decreases more than to ecosystem respiration (RE) increases. Forest sites had greater NEP decreases during heatwaves than non-forest sites, but remained carbon sinks afterwards, indicating resilience. Our modeling analysis of extreme heatwaves at selected EC sites shows that decreased photosynthesis, increased maintenance respiration, and decreased plant non-structural carbon reserves during heatwaves drive carbon cycle changes that persist for weeks. Consistent with phenocam observations, we modeled a reduction in leaf area index caused by reduced non-structural carbon reserves, leading to early leaf senescence and longer-term impacts. Ongoing increases in heatwaves are therefore likely to reduce NEP across a range of ecosystems, exacerbating carbon cycle feedback."

However, quantifying and understanding spread in model projections, along with building a picture of different possible climate futures across variables, is critical for meeting decision-makers’ needs. Here we explore projected ensemble ranges in mean and extreme temperature and precipitation metrics and their relationships using simulations from the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. The range is characterised by ensemble minimums and maximums, along with intermediate percentiles, and heatmaps display the contribution of individual models to the overall global pattern of changes at these points in the range. Furthermore, we examine if the framing of changes, both in terms of a future time slice (2070–2099) and a future global warming level (GWL) of 3 K, relative to a historical period (1850–1900), affects interpretation of results. The 2070–2099 time slice exhibits known patterns of change such as Arctic warming, and drying and wetting regions, exacerbated according to the ensemble percentile considered. For extreme temperature metrics, while 25th, median, and 75th percentile changes are relatively evenly contributed to by all models, ensemble-minimum and -maximum changes are instead dominated by only one or two models. In particular, the CanESM5 dominates ensemble-maximum changes by over 40%. Furthermore, the NorESM2-LM dominates ensemble-minimum changes for the coldest night of the year (64%) and contributes largely (23%) to ensemble-maximum changes for the warmest day of the year—which are opposite ends of the most extreme measures we consider. Moreover, for the 3 K GWL, the CanESM5 domination ceases yet the NorESM2-LM domination persists. This has implications for the expression of ensemble ranges in multi-model projections, depending on the framing of the future period, and for the interpretation of what constitutes an outlier model. Thus, we encourage multi-model studies to understand and communicate ensemble spread in their climate projections."

Yet we still lack a good understanding of how these extremes will be distributed across the world’s agricultural lands—particularly across small versus large croplands and pasturelands. In this study, we assess their exposure to extreme weather in a warming world. In a world that is 2 °C warmer than today, 25% (11 million km2) of present-day agricultural lands will face over two months of extreme heat, up from 16% today (7 million km2), and another ∼2% (5 million km2) will be exposed to a combination of two or more extremes, up from 10% (4 million km2). The total area exposed to prolonged dry conditions and extreme precipitation will remain unchanged (less than 1% or 5 million km2, with increases in some regions balanced by decreases elsewhere), while ∼2% less area (2 million km2), down from 7% (3 million km2), will experience a month of frost. Future exposure to extreme weather varies by land use type. Pasturelands will experience prolonged exposure to heat stress, whereas croplands will be exposed to higher excessive rains and heat stress combined. Spatial correlations between farm size and geography indicate potential differences in exposure. Exposure to extreme precipitation and heat stress is highest in small (1–2 ha) and medium (2–4 ha) cropland and pastureland, respectively.

This study identified for the first time a strong relationship between DAB and the spatial extent of fire-conducive weather conditions, especially measured by fuel aridity, in Canadian forests. Observations between 2001 and 2023 used to develop the DAB prediction models showed about 126 active burning days per year and an average DAB of 20 788.93 ha nationally, with about two-thirds of these active burning days occurring in summer. The central boreal forests in Canada experienced both more active burning days and higher DAB, while the more extreme DAB occurred in the eastern region. Of the predicted DAB in Canadian forests between 1940 and 2023 using the developed DAB models, 62 d showed a significant increasing trend, averaging about 60.14 ha per year nationally. Such increases were found mainly in the central region, in summer, and between 2000 and 2023. Daily fire activity has also become more concentrated within the fire season, particularly in the eastern region. From 1940 to 2023, the lengths of the periods covering 50% and 90% of annual area burned decreased by 0.12 d and 0.25 d per year, respectively, across the country. Concurrently, extreme DAB events have become more extreme. Over the 84 year period, summer maximum DAB increased by 133.61 ha, number of extreme burning days (days with DAB exceeding the 84 year mean by one standard deviation) increased by 0.36 d, and proportion of area burned within these extreme days increased by 0.33% annually in Canadian forests."

In this study, we applied an ensemble modeling framework integrating 12 algorithms to assess the potential suitable habitats and centroid shifts of 10 Larix species across the Northern Hemisphere under current and future climate scenarios. Model performance was high (true skill statistic, receiver operating characteristic, and Kappa all >0.9). Temperature, precipitation, and elevation were identified as the primary environmental drivers shaping species distributions. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in future habitat shifts: some species (e.g. Larix decidua, Larix sibirica, Larix lyallii) are projected to undergo significant habitat contractions, while others (e.g. Larix potaninii, Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii) may experience expansions. For most species, distribution centroids are expected to shift northeastward or northwestward, with more pronounced shifts under high-emission scenarios. These findings reveal the complex response patterns of Larix species to climate change and provide scientific insights for cross-regional forest conservation and adaptive management. We recommend prioritizing conservation of species projected to undergo substantial habitat contraction and safeguarding climate refugia to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functioning."

Suppression however remains the budget priority. We design a survey to measure the U.S. public’s preferences for investing public resources to federal wildfire prevention activities. We consider absolute investment as well as investment relative to suppression. Results indicate the public prefers much greater investment in prevention than federally appropriated levels. While people correctly identify the misalignment, they underestimate the extent of the difference between public and agency priorities. We also examine individual actions to reduce the risk of future wildfires. We explore people’s willingness to voluntarily join a local risk-reduction program to reduce community wildfire risk. We find that a large segment of respondents are not only willing to join but support a mandatory requirement for peers to join. Support for government and local prevention is robust across locations, though wildfire risk and exposure matter at the margin. Overall, results indicate that public priorities better align with the expert advice than current practices by wildfire management."

Using high-resolution weather simulations of past supercell storms under warmer and less polluted conditions, we found that storms may become more intense, with heavier rainfall and larger hailstones. These changes suggest an increased risk of damage in the future. Our findings help improve understanding of how extreme storms may evolve in a changing climate. 
 Germany is heading toward a future with warmer temperatures due to climate change, and potentially cleaner air from electrification and stricter emission regulations. But how will these evolving environmental conditions affect severe convective storms? This study addresses this question by simulating three supercell events in high resolution using the ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) model. The events observed during the Swabian MOSES field campaigns in 2021 and 2023 are analysed using the pseudo-global warming approach to assess their evolution in a warmer climate. The effects of aerosols on clouds and precipitation were considered using a two-moment microphysics scheme in four temperature rise scenarios, providing detailed insights into the underlying microphysical mechanisms. The results indicate that higher temperatures generally enhance convection, resulting in more intense convective cells, increased precipitation amounts, and more extreme rainfall and hail events. Additionally, warmer conditions increase the likelihood of supercell formation and more intense mesocyclones. In some cases, precipitation increases exceed 7 % K−1, indicating super-Clausius–Clapeyron scaling and suggesting that additional dynamical and microphysical processes amplify rainfall beyond thermodynamic expectations. An important finding is that hailstones grow larger under lower cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations, and the area affected by large hail expands by up to 400 %, indicating growing severity and reach of hail events. In addition, lower CCN concentrations are associated with a reduced cold-to-warm rain formation ratio and decreased precipitation efficiency. These aerosol-related effects appear largely independent of temperature, showing consistent patterns across all simulated warming scenarios. These findings indicate the intensity of severe weather events, such as convective storms and flash floods, may increase in a future climate."

We found that low boundary layers in winter trap pollutants like nitrate and primary particles, while higher layers in summer help form secondary pollutants like sulfate and organic aerosols. These findings show that boundary layer dynamics are key to understanding and managing seasonal air pollution. 
 Understanding the seasonal behavior of fine particles (PM2.5) and its chemical components is critical for improving air quality in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), a densely populated and polluted region in China. While previous studies have addressed PM2.5 mass trends, the role of planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) in modulating chemical composition remains insufficiently explored. This study investigates seasonal variations and PBLH effects on PM2.5 chemical components based on year-round field measurements (December 2020–November 2021) at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology. Annual mean PM2.5 mass concentration is 30.0±18.5µgm-3, with winter peaks (48.3 µg m−3) and summer lows (20.4 µg m−3). Organic aerosol dominates PM2.5, followed by sulfate in warmer seasons and nitrate in winter. Stable meteorological conditions promote the accumulation of primary aerosols and nitrate. The accumulation of SOA and sulfate remains substantial under elevated PBLH conditions, owing to strong photochemical production, rendering them relatively insensitive to PBLH variations. In contrast, during cold and humid winters, shallow PBLH promotes nitrate buildup, which subsequently suppresses boundary layer development, forming positive feedback that accelerates nitrate concentration growth. Source apportionment reveals that the contrasting seasonal sources, shaped by both local chemistry and regional transport, emphasize the need for seasonally adaptive and region-specific emission control measures."

Connolly;Paul R. Field;Declan L. Finney;Alan M. Blyth,Influence of secondary ice formation on tropical deep convective clouds simulated by the Unified Model,"We investigated how extra ice particles form inside tropical storm clouds and how they affect rainfall and sunlight reflection. By using a weather model, we found that these extra ice particles can change how clouds grow, reduce heat escaping to space, and slightly shift where rain falls. This helps improve how weather and climate models predict tropical storms. 
 Secondary ice production (SIP) plays an important role in tropical deep convection. This study implements multiple SIP mechanisms, including droplet fragmentation and ice–ice collisional breakup, into the CASIM microphysics scheme of the UK Met Office Unified Model, and evaluates their impacts through a real-case simulation of a Hector thunderstorm. SIP enhances ice number concentration in upper cloud layers, with values up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than the no-SIP case, particularly above −10 °C. Ice water content (IWC) increases by a factor of 3–5 in the anvil region, contributing to more extensive upper-level cloud coverage. These microphysical changes reduce outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) by ∼ 3.2 W m−2 (1.3 %) and increase outgoing shortwave radiation (OSR) by ∼ 4.5 W m−2 (1.8 %) over a 6 h analysis period and a 110 km × 110 km domain. SIP modifies precipitation spatially, yielding a more localized, compact rainfall pattern near the convective core, while reducing domain-averaged precipitation by ∼ 8 %. Peak rainfall rates remain only slightly affected, consistent with the minor changes (< 1 m s−1) in maximum updraft velocity. Among the tested mechanisms, ice–ice collisional breakup shows negligible impact on simulated ice concentration, consistent with limited graupel-involved collision energetics under warm profiles. Ensemble experiments confirm that these effects are robust and exceed the influence of meteorological variability. These results highlight the importance of representing SIP processes in cloud-resolving models of tropical convection and accounting for their environmental dependence."

These findings enhance our understanding of vertical and dynamical-photochemical coupling in the middle and upper atmosphere, which also offer valuable implications for the upper atmospheric sounding and modeling. 
 Based on the specified dynamics simulation of Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with ionosphere/thermosphere extension (SD-WACCM-X), the composite response of polar hydroxyl radical (OH) layer in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) to the Arctic sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events with elevated stratopause (ES) during 2004–2023 is investigated. A total of ten ES-SSW events are systematically analyzed. Before the onset of ES-SSW events, the OH concentration climatologically peaks at ∼ 7.4 ppbv near 82.4 km. During the stratospheric warming phase, relative to the climatology, the peak height of OH layer undergoes a distinct upward displacement reaching ∼ 85.9 km accompanied by a reduction in the OH concentration to ∼ 2.9 ppbv. This shift is closely linked to an ∼ 11 % and ∼ 90.8 % reduction in mesospheric temperature and atomic oxygen, respectively, due to enhanced upward residual circulation. During the elevated stratopause phase, the peak height of OH layer experiences a pronounced downward shift to ∼ 80.6 km with a maximum in OH concentration to ∼ 6.8 ppbv. This phase is characterized by ∼ 3.7 % and ∼ 137.3 % enhancements in mesospheric temperature and atomic oxygen concentrations, respectively, which is driven by intensified downward residual circulation. Further analysis suggests that OH concentration variations are positively correlated to mesospheric temperature anomalies and atomic oxygen redistribution induced by vertical transport, which is attributed to the significant influence of ES-SSW on gravity wave drag (GWs) in the mesosphere."

Toon,Injection near the stratopause mitigates the stratospheric side effects of sulfur-based climate intervention,"Injecting sulfur dioxide at 50 km – near the stratopause – offers a far safer and more effective climate intervention than conventional 25 km injection. Rapid downward–poleward transport distributes aerosols across 20–30 km, halving tropical stratospheric warming, reducing ozone recovery delays from decades to about 5 years, and enhancing global and polar cooling by over 20 %, while better preserving Arctic sea ice. 
 Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) using sulfur has been proposed to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight back to space. A commonly proposed SAI, with sulfur dioxide injection rate of 10 Tg yr−1 at 25 km, accumulates aerosols in the tropical lower stratosphere, causing a 6 K warming of the tropical lower stratosphere that impact the entry value of stratospheric water vapor and jet positions. This approach could also delay October Antarctic total column ozone (TCO) recovery to 1980s values by 25–55 years. We propose a novel SAI approach of injecting sulfur at 50 km (SAI50) that substantially reduces these negative impacts. In SAI50, the mean meridional overturning circulation near the stratopause rapidly transports gaseous SO2 to mid-high latitudes, preventing sulfate aerosol accumulation in the tropical lower stratosphere. This approach reduces tropical stratospheric warming to 3 K and shortens the Antarctic ozone recovery delay to 5 years. Furthermore, SAI50 demonstrates greater cooling efficiency, enhancing global and polar surface cooling by 22 % and 40 % respectively. Consequently, SAI50 preserves 20 % more Arctic September sea ice compared to lower-altitude SAI. These findings suggest that SAI50 could offer a more effective and less disruptive approach to climate intervention."

Our results show that the pattern of mixing seen from aircraft measurements may not reflect the true mixing process happening inside clouds. This result suggests that care is needed when using aircraft data to study the cloud mixing process and that new ways of observing clouds could offer clearer insights. 
 Recent aircraft measurements in stratocumulus clouds suggest that entrainment mixing is inhomogeneous (IM) near cloud top and homogeneous (HM) within the cloud. However, this proposed height-dependence of mixing transition is uncertain because of artifacts involved in the aircraft measurements. In this study, we use the Explicit Mixing Parcel Model to simulate mixing scenarios in stratocumulus clouds and reconstruct the virtual aircraft measurements to investigate the mixing signature. Results show that, from the aircraft-measurement perspective, the mixing signature always exhibits IM characteristic near cloud top and HM characteristic within cloud, independent of the types of the local entrainment-mixing process. The appearance of the vertical IM-to-HM transition is essentially a collective behavior of multiple parcels sampled at the same height, experiencing distinct entrainment-mixing-evaporation histories. This bulk view of mixing process, which is widely used for aircraft measurements, could lead to misinterpretations of the true mixing mechanism occurring in clouds. Our result underscores the limitations of using aircraft measurements to identify the entrainment-mixing mechanism at the process level."

To address this, we created Peat-DBase – a standardized global database of peat depth measurements with > 200 000 measurements worldwide, showing median depths of 130 cm. Peat-DBase avoids overlapping data compilation efforts while identifying critical observational gaps. 
 Peatlands are globally important carbon stores that face increasing threats from human activities and climate change impacts. Comprehensive peatland data are essential for understanding ecosystem responses to these stressors and mapping their past and current characteristics. Current peatland datasets remain limited due to poor representation in global soil mapping initiatives and the absence of a recognized, coordinated central repository for peat depth data. Existing compilations often contain errors, duplicates, and outdated observations, requiring researchers to repeatedly gather and harmonize data on a study-by-study basis. To address these challenges, we present Peat-DBase version 1.0 – a harmonized, quality-controlled global compilation of basal peat depth measurements.Version 1.0 of Peat-DBase comprises 204 902 peat depth measurements from 29 sources spanning 54.933° S to 82.217° N, with a significant proportion of measurements in Atlantic Canada and Scotland due to the inclusion of two particularly large datasets focused on those regions. We supplement the peat study measurements with 94 615 non-peat soil measurements to ensure comprehensive coverage consistent with the relatively low spatial coverage of peatlands globally. Despite the uneven distribution of peat depth measurements, Peat-DBase contains reasonable coverage of the major global peatland complexes in temperate and boreal North America and Europe, portions of Russia, the Amazon and Congo basins, and the Malay Archipelago, though gaps remain in the lower Amazon Basin, Eastern Indonesia, and Eastern Russia. From the current data, peat depths have a median value of 130 cm (IQR: 60–240), although this is influenced by a predominance of measurements in the North Atlantic regions. Peat-DBase's deepest measurement is 2223 cm.While sampling biases and measurement uncertainties exist, Peat-DBase provides an essential foundation for global peatland research. Peat-DBase is under active development and future versions will incorporate additional datasets, information on current peatland status, and improved positional uncertainty quantification. Peat-DBase eliminates the need for overlapping data compilation efforts while identifying critical observational gaps for future research.

We describe the available data, discuss gaps, and propose improved metadata schemes to expand the MADLIB collection and support sensor and algorithm development. 
 Marine debris is a ubiquitous and growing threat to environmental and human health. Efforts to monitor and mitigate marine debris pollution face many challenges. The absence of standardized methodologies is a primary limitation for monitoring capabilities due to the complex and diverse physical and chemical properties of marine debris. Variabilities include object size, apparent color, polymer type, weathering, and aqueous state. Despite the challenges in object characteristics, advances in remote sensing methods show promise for detecting marine debris across local to global scales. Algorithms are needed to link remotely sensed observations with relevant characteristics of marine debris to fully realize this potential. Although more optical measurements of marine debris reflectance are becoming available for algorithm development, inconsistencies in data curation remains an obstacle. Variations in data processing and inconsistent metadata hinder efforts to develop robust, generalizable algorithms for marine debris detection. To address this, we present the well-curated MArine Debris hyperspectral reference Library collection (MADLib) containing 24 889 reflectance spectra from 3032 samples.

Consistent methods were applied for data standardization, quality assurance, and integration. We also propose a robust protocol for generating metadata tailored to marine debris and ocean color remote sensing applications. MADLib possesses spectra of a wide range of marine debris materials including different polymer types, color, size, weathering, and aqueous states. Here, we analyze the metadata associated with the spectra to identify sampling gaps and propose considerations for future work.

We propose a Local Training Data Point Density (LPD) approach that considers how well a model's environment is represented by training data. This method provides a valuable tool for evaluating model applicability and uncertainties, crucial for broader scientific and practical applications. 
 Machine learning is frequently used in environmental and earth sciences to produce spatial or spatio-temporal predictions of environmental variables based on limited field samples – increasingly even on a global scale and far beyond the location of available training data. Since new geographic space often goes along with new environmental properties represented by the model's predictors, and since machine learning models do not perform well in extrapolation, this raises questions regarding the applicability of the trained models at the prediction locations.Methods to assess the area of applicability of spatial prediction models have been recently suggested and applied. These are typically based on distances in the predictor space between the prediction data and the nearest reference data point to represent the similarity to the training data. However, we assume that the density of the training data in the predictor space, i.e. how well an environment is represented in a model, is highly decisive for the prediction quality and complements the consideration of distances.We therefore suggest a local training data point density (LPD) approach. The LPD is a quantitative measure that indicates, for a new prediction location, how many similar reference data points have been included in the model training. Similarity here is defined by the dissimilarity threshold introduced by Meyer and Pebesma (2021), which is the maximum distance to a nearest training data point in the predictor space as observed during cross-validation. We assess the suitability of the approach in a simulation study and illustrate how the method can be used in real-world applications. The LPD is a post hoc measure of training data density in predictor space, used to support uncertainty assessment of predictions independently of the model's structure.The simulation study indicated a positive relationship between LPD and prediction performance and highlights the value of the approach compared to the consideration of the distance to a nearest data point only. We therefore suggest the calculation of the LPD to support the assessment of prediction uncertainties."

Our software MovingBoundaryMinerals.jl calculates compositional profiles in diffusion couples by simulating diffusion-growth processes for geometries with planar/cylindrical/spherical symmetries. Our software has been tested versus various benchmark cases and is provided as an open access software package. This package allows the further use of diffusion/growth phenomena in the calculation of the thermal histories of rocks. 
 Diffusion and crystal growth are common processes in nature and can be observed in rocks that have experienced relatively high temperatures. Information about these processes is stored in the composition gradients of minerals. Diffusion can either occur within single crystals or across mineral interfaces. In the case of intercrystalline ion exchange, composition profiles across the interfaces are always discontinuous and may exhibit sharp compositional gradients. The compositional discontinuity and the associated gradients require an accurate treatment for the interface boundary condition. Here, we present a software package (MovingBoundaryMinerals.jl) that is openly available. In this package, we use an adaptive finite element method to describe the diffusion-couple equilibrium by taking into account the moving boundary separating the two phases. In addition, we utilize an adaptive grid approach to resolve the compositional gradients accurately at the interface region. This approach allows modelling a wide range of applications from mineral diffusion, simple ion exchange between diffusion couples, and diffusion-limited growth. The package has been tested versus variable available analytical solutions for diffusion and growth, and several benchmark cases are presented. Finally, our package can be used to model compositional gradients in growing/dissolving/diffusing crystals in the framework of diffusion chronometry and geospeedometry. This approach can provide thermal/time constraints in various geologic phenomena."

By simulating how sunlight bounces between structures and how heat transfers through materials, we accurately predicted temperatures on roofs, roads, and walls. The model successfully handled intricate city layouts thanks to GPU speed. By revealing which heat matters most, we aim to guide smarter city designs for a warming climate. 
 The escalating urban heat, driven by climate change and urbanization, poses significant threats to residents' health and urban climate resilience. The coupled radiative-convective-conductive heat transfer across complex urban geometries makes it challenging to identify the primary causes of urban heat and develop mitigation strategies. To address this challenge, we develop a GPU-accelerated Urban Surface Temperature model (GUST) through CUDA architecture. To simulate the complex radiative exchanges and coupled heat transfer processes, we adopt Monte Carlo method, leveraging GPUs to overcome its computational intensity while retaining its high accuracy. Radiative exchanges are resolved using a reverse ray tracing algorithm, while the conduction-radiation-convection mechanism is addressed through a random walking algorithm. The validation is carried out using the Scaled Outdoor Measurement of Urban Climate and Health (SOMUCH) experiment, which features a wide range of urban densities and offers high spatial and temporal resolution. This model exhibits notable accuracy in simulating urban surface temperatures and their temporal variations across different building densities. Analysis of the surface energy balance reveals that longwave radiative exchanges between urban surfaces significantly influence model accuracy, whereas convective heat transfer has a lesser impact. To demonstrate the applicability of GUST, it is employed to model transient surface temperature distributions at complex geometries on a neighborhood scale. Leveraging the high computational efficiency of GPU, the simulation traces 105 rays across 2.3×104 surface elements in each time step, ensuring both accuracy and high-resolution results for urban surface temperature modeling."

The model captures how orbital changes and carbon dioxide levels influence climate atmospheric dynamics, offering a detailed and efficient way to explore long-term processes. This tool provides new opportunities to investigate Earth's climate history and its implications for future changes. 
 We present a modelling framework to study the response of continental flux dynamics and ocean anoxia to astronomical forcing. The GEOCLIM model is coupled with a Gaussian Process-based climate emulator, designed to efficiently capture the global distribution of temperature and precipitation as simulated by the general circulation model HadCM3L. The emulator employs principal component analysis for dimensionality reduction. Compared to earlier approaches, our emulator features an additive kernel function that better captures the spatial complexity of ocean responses and accounts for ocean heat transport. This setup facilitates interactive coupling between CO2 levels through an iterative procedure involving GEOCLIM and the emulator, enabling systematic exploration of various orbital and pCO2 configurations. We demonstrate the model's capabilities with a Devonian case study, revealing an emergent relationship between high eccentricity periods and enhanced regolith development, though with limited impact on phosphorus fluxes to the ocean."

Tsimpidi,Incorporation of lumped IVOC emissions into the ORACLE  model (V1.1): a multi-product framework for assessing global  SOA formation from internal combustion engines,"We studied how pollution from cars and trucks contributes to tiny airborne particles that affect air quality and climate. These particles, called secondary organic aerosols, were often underestimated in global models. By improving how certain overlooked emissions from fuel use are represented in our model, we found that their impact is much larger than previously thought. Our results suggest that road traffic plays a far greater role in global air pollution than earlier estimates showed. 
 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is a major component of particulate matter but is often underpredicted in chemistry climate models. Recent advances in measuring and resolving the chemically complex structure of intermediate volatile organic compounds (IVOC) have shown that IVOCs, despite their high SOA yields, have long been underrepresented in models. These compounds are key precursors of SOA from emissions in the road transport sector and significantly influence SOA formation. Understanding vehicle emissions, their chemistry, and their SOA-forming potential is essential for accurately estimating their contributions to atmospheric SOA and global organic aerosol loads. To improve this understanding, we have updated the organic module ORACLE in the global chemistry climate model EMAC. The existing IVOC representation was based on scaled organic carbon (OC) emissions and a highly parameterized volatility basis set (VBS) which underestimated global IVOC emissions, particularly those from gasoline combustion, and oversimplified their chemistry. Here, we replaced this approach with a lumped species framework, in which experimental data for gasoline and diesel emissions were grouped into seven lumped species based on their chemical properties and hydroxylation potentials. These species were linked to adjusted emission inventories for regional diesel and gasoline consumption. A 10 year simulation with the updated ORACLE-IVOC model resulted in significant changes. The global atmospheric burden of road transport IVOC-derived SOA (SOA-iv) increased by 1 order of magnitude, from 0.014 to 0.13 Tg. The composition of road transport organic aerosol (OA) shifted, with SOA-iv contributing 2.5 to 13 times more than the primary organic aerosol (POA) and SOA derived from semi-volatile organic compounds combined. In the results using the previous model, this ratio was between 0.4 and 1.1. The geographical distribution of OA also changed. Regions rich in gasoline relative to diesel emissions experienced higher concentration increases, and remote areas experienced elevated concentrations due to more efficient long-range transport of the new lumped IVOC species. Overall, these changes led to a significant increase in the contribution of road transport to total anthropogenic SOA-iv from an average value of 3 % to 35 %."

Using an advanced ocean simulation model, it focuses on radionuclides released during the Fukushima accident and from planned wastewater discharges. The findings show that some radionuclides can travel across the Pacific within a few years and gradually spread to other ocean basins by mid-century, emphasizing potential long-term environmental impacts. 
 Nuclear energy plays an important role in global energy supply and mitigates greenhouse gas emissions. Potential environmental and human health risks are associated with the generated radioactive isotopes in the wastewater, especially the accidental release during natural disasters. However, the long-term transport and fate of these radionuclides remain uncertain. Here we employ a state-of-the-art ocean tracer model (MITgcm) to simulate the transport and fate of tritium, carbon-14, and seven other typical radionuclides in the twenty-first-century ocean. We use the discharge of radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, both during the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami and from the subsequent release of stored wastewater, as a case study. The model indicates that the Kuroshio and North Pacific Current will spread the radionuclides over the whole North Pacific basin after three years. The enduring transport of long-term discharge in the Pacific will expand to other ocean basins by 2050. Accumulation of particle-reactive radionuclides in the sediments will mostly be centered in the northwest Pacific till 2050. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of our modeling tool, which can be broadly applied to assess the transport and fate of other types of radionuclides and other nuclear discharges worldwide."

White,Contrasting Depth Dependencies of Plant Root Presence and Mass Across Biomes Underscore Prolific Root‐Regolith Interactions,"Root distributions are typically based on root mass per soil volume. This plant‐focused approach masks the biogeochemical influence of fine roots, which weigh little. We assert that centimeter‐scale root presence‐absence data from soil profiles provide a more soil‐focused approach for probing depth distributions of root‐regolith interfaces, where microsite‐scale processes drive whole‐ecosystem functioning. In 75 soil pits across the continental USA, Puerto Rico, and the Alps, we quantified fine and coarse root presence as deep as 2 m. In 70 of these pits we estimated root mass and created standardized metrics of both data sets to compare their depth distributions. We addressed whether: (a) depth distributions of root presence‐absence data differ from root mass data, thus implying different degrees of root‐regolith interactions with depth; and (b) if root presence or any depth‐dependent differences between these data sets vary predictably with environmental conditions. Presence of fine roots exhibited diverse depth‐dependent patterns; root mass generally declined with depth. In B and C horizons, standardized root presence was greater than standardized root mass; random forest analyses suggest these discrepancies are greater in B horizons with increasing mean annual precipitation and in C horizons with increasing mean annual temperature. Our work suggests that deep in the subsurface, biogeochemical and reactive transport processes result from more numerous root‐regolith interfaces than mass data suggest. We present a new paradigm for discerning patterns in depth distributions of root‐regolith interfaces across multiple biomes and land uses that promotes understanding of the roles of those interfaces in driving key critical zone processes."

These emissions are thought to align with a “wedge” of closed magnetic field lines extending to the high‐latitude boundary of the Earth's magnetosphere, where they are postulated to interact with the IMF through magnetic reconnection. Such an instance of “high‐latitude TPA wedge reconnection” is expected to open the Earth's magnetic field lines, but the event has never been verified by in situ observations. Here we report a detection of a high‐latitude TPA wedge reconnection site within one ion gyroradius distance on 18 March 2002, which manifests in the ionosphere as colocation of the TPA and a cusp spot. The result may explain previously reported cases of remotely detected “non‐lobe” high‐latitude magnetic reconnection, with implications for future understanding of TPAs and northward‐IMF global magnetospheric dynamics."

Using 42 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, we show that amplified equatorial Pacific warming induces a Gill‐type atmospheric response that suppresses precipitation across TAM by weakening ascent, explaining over half of the inter‐model spread in projected rainfall changes. The magnitude of projected TAM drying depends strongly on the simulated present‐day zonal sea surface temperature gradient over the tropical Pacific, but climate models systematically underestimate this gradient, likely leading to an underestimation of equatorial Pacific warming and TAM drying. An emergent constraint suggests a regional mean annual rainfall decline of 46 mm over TAM per 1 K of global warming, approximately 1.5 times the raw projection, with a 30% reduction in uncertainty. These findings highlight that drought‐related risks in the Amazon and American monsoon regions may become more severe than previously estimated."

Cape Darnley Polynya in East Antarctica, the most recently‐identified AABW formation site, remains poorly understood.

Wintertime DSW export from Cape Darnley—mean of 0.28×106 $0.28\times 1{0}^{6}$m3 s−1 (0.28 Sv)—is suppressed by basal melting of the Amery Ice Shelf, but enhanced by cold, saline preconditioning from Mackenzie Polynya. A doubling of Amery Ice Shelf melting reduces export to 0.26 Sv (7.0% decrease), while a shutdown of Mackenzie Polynya reduces DSW export to 0.18 Sv (a 36% decrease).

In the winter lower thermosphere, eastward forcing is dominant around z=120 km, consistent with equatorward circulation. Following previous studies, the vertical flux of the zonal momentum is examined for small‐scale waves with zonal scales smaller than 2,000 km through the depth of the middle atmosphere. Wave decomposition analysis reveals that eastward waves with a wide range of phase speeds are generated around the polar vortex height. This result differs from the conventional understanding in gravity wave parameterizations, which states that eastward waves slower than the strong mesospheric wind cannot propagate to higher altitudes. Quasi‐stationary and westward waves are also active in the mesosphere, some of which originate in the troposphere. However, these waves more often dissipate in the upper mesosphere at critical levels and easterly shear, which results in the dominance of eastward waves in the lower thermosphere. The horizontal and temporal variations of gravity wave activity in the lower thermosphere are associated with the structure of the mesospheric jet. These results suggest a possible method for diagnosing wave generation that could improve gravity wave parameterizations. In the summer hemisphere, westward forcing is expressed by the semidiurnal tide, as well as by filtered gravity waves. Thus, the driving mechanisms of the lower thermospheric circulation are the contribution of gravity waves, mainly generated in the mesosphere and selectively filtered in the upper mesosphere, and the semidiurnal tide."

Previous studies estimated the source energy of near‐surface explosions from remote observations using empirical yield‐scaling relations. However, these relations simplify the complexities of infrasound propagation. In order to reduce the variance in the predicted wave attenuation, massive numerical propagation simulations are carried out by exploring a wide range of realistic atmospheric scenarios. An analytical expression is proposed to model transmission losses at distances up to 4,000 km. This attenuation relation is validated using multi‐year near‐ and far‐field records of volcanic eruptions from Mount Etna, Italy, as a benchmark. An idealized explosive source model is combined with transmission loss and measured noise statistics to quantify the 90% probability detection threshold of the IMS network. This approach yields high‐resolution detection capability simulation results with limited computational resources. Simulations predict that explosions equivalent to ∼ ${\sim} $500 t of TNT equivalent would be detected by at least two stations at any time of the year, with the detection capability being best during the solstice periods. Due to the high spatio‐temporal variability of the winds in the ground‐to‐stratosphere levels, threshold variations can reach one order of magnitude from seasonal down to semi‐diurnal scales."

This study utilizes 31 global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and 33 CMIP5 models to evaluate the historical surface air temperature, sea level pressure, 500‐hPa geopotential height, 150‐hPa meridional and zonal wind, and polar vortex indices during cold winters. Our research quantifies the advancements of CMIP6 over CMIP5. Additionally, future changes in these variables under three different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), that is, SSP 1–2.6, SSP 2–4.5, and SSP 5–8.5, are projected based on 20 out of the 31 CMIP6 models. The results indicate that the multimodel ensemble means from both CMIP5 and CMIP6 effectively capture the main features of the observed Eurasian cold winters and their associated factors with good simulation agreement. The CMIP6 ensemble mean outperforms its CMIP5 counterpart, and both ensemble means (CMIP5 and CMIP6) perform better than individual CMIP6 models. Among CMIP6 models, 500‐hPa geopotential height achieves the highest simulation skill, whereas sea level pressure shows the lowest. Compared with same‐institute models from CMIP5, CMIP6 models show overall improvements with sea level pressure simulation being notably advanced. Under the three SSPs, the occurrence probability of cold winters is projected to decrease as the area and intensity indices of the polar vortex decline. Moreover, surface temperature anomalies are projected to exhibit a “warm Arctic and cold Eurasia” pattern, and the anticyclonic anomalies at 500 hPa and 150 hPa are projected to be centered at high latitudes."

Further, previous studies of even regional‐scale nuclear conflicts show that the smoke from large‐scale fires caused by such weapons could lead to global‐scale ozone loss. However, combustion studies show that urban fires release key ozone‐depleting substances that were not previously considered in nuclear war studies, particularly chlorine and bromine compounds. Recent wildfire studies have also shown that high solubility of hydrochloric acid in oxidized organic smoke particles can greatly enhance chlorine‐driven ozone loss. For the first time, here we simulate the impacts of a nuclear war on the ozone layer using a chemistry‐climate model that accounts for fire‐related halogen emissions as well as HCl solubility and heterogeneous chemistry in smoke particles. Our results show that a regional war scenario with 5 Tg of soot could result in a ∼40% reduction in the global ozone burden, nearly twice as much as previous studies. The calculated ozone losses exceed ∼80% over the Arctic, comparable to those observed when the Antarctic ozone hole was discovered and hence represent an Arctic ozone hole. Ozone losses also reach ∼50% over mid‐latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, including highly populated areas. The enhanced ozone loss compared to previous studies is attributable to combined non‐linear effects from the incorporation of halogen emissions and updated heterogeneous chemistry in smoke particles. Such ozone losses lead to a large increase in surface ultraviolet exposure, posing grave risks to humanity and ecosystems."

Marshall Shepherd;Rebecca Stearns;Michelle Ritchie,The Fifth Hurricane Hazard: A Case Study of Heat Risks Faced by Disaster Relief Workers After Hurricane Beryl's Landfall,"Hurricanes pose a wide range of health and safety threats, from wind and flooding to less recognized hazards such as heat stress. Although heat exposure has been documented after hurricanes, little research has examined how it affects disaster relief workers during recovery operations. This study evaluated the heat stress conditions faced by emergency response personnel deployed to southeastern Texas following Hurricane Beryl in July 2024, a period marked by prolonged power outages and extreme heat. Heat hazard scenarios were assessed for the Houston area using occupational exposure limits—the Recommended Alert Limit (RAL) and Recommended Exposure Limit—in combination with wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) data and factors like worker acclimatization status, work intensity, work/rest schedules, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Depending on the scenario, WBGT values exceeded critical safety thresholds throughout this period. For unacclimatized workers engaged in medium to very heavy labor with minimal rest, conditions exceeded the RAL between 74% and 100% of the time. Even heat acclimatized workers deployed outdoors would have faced considerable heat stress, especially during heavy work levels. The presence of restrictive PPE significantly increased heat stress, with all scenarios surpassing safety thresholds. These findings underscore the heightened vulnerability of disaster response personnel to heat‐related health risks in the aftermath of hurricanes. Acclimatization, workload, rest breaks, and PPE use are key factors influencing heat health risks. Tailored heat mitigation strategies are needed to safeguard workers operating in high‐pressure, resource‐limited environments where standard workplace safety practices may be difficult to implement."

 RNA splicing is fundamental to cellular function, yet systematic investigation of its complex regulation has been limited by existing methods. Here, we present SPLiCR-seq (SPLicing regulator identification through CRISPR screening), a high-throughput CRISPR screening platform that enables direct measurement of RNA splicing outcomes for pooled genetic perturbations, overcoming limitations of traditional fluorescence-based approaches. Applying SPLiCR-seq to investigate XBP1 splicing during the unfolded protein response (UPR), we conduct targeted and genome-wide screens across diverse cellular contexts, revealing both common and cell-type specific regulators. Notably, we identify GADD34 (PPP1R15A) as a novel modulator of IRE1α-XBP1 signaling, demonstrating that it directly interacts with IRE1α and functions independently of its canonical role in eIF2α dephosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of GADD34 using Sephin1 effectively suppressed XBP1 splicing and alleviated CAR-T cell exhaustion in an ex vivo model, leading to enhanced tumor-killing capacity across multiple cancer models. This work not only establishes a powerful new tool for systematically studying RNA splicing regulation but also uncovers a promising therapeutic strategy for improving CAR-T cell immunotherapy through modulation of the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway.

The current study offers insights into the structural and biochemical changes responsible for improving the fidelity and catalytic activity of a laboratory evolved TNA polymerase. 
 Directed evolution facilitates functional adaptations through stepwise changes in sequence that alter protein structure. While most campaigns yield solutions that maintain the framework of a rigid protein architecture, a few have produced enzymes with more notable structural differences. One example is a polymerase that was evolved to synthesize threose nucleic acid (TNA) with near-natural activity. Understanding how this enzyme arose provides a model for studying pathways that guide enzymes toward more productive regions of the fitness landscape. Here, we trace the evolutionary trajectory of an unnatural polymerase by solving crystal structures of key intermediates along the pathway and evaluating their biochemical activity. Contrary to the view that fidelity is a product of increased catalytic efficiency, we find that accuracy and catalysis are decoupled activities guided by separate ground-state and transition-state discrimination events. Together, these results offer a glimpse into the forces responsible for shaping the emergence of new enzyme functions. Engineering polymerases to synthesize alternative genetic polymers remains a challenging problem in synthetic biology. The current study offers insights into the structural and biochemical changes responsible for improving the fidelity and catalytic activity of a laboratory evolved TNA polymerase."

Here, the authors address non-Hermitian features of PTCs within a purely Hermitian Hamiltonian description, bridging classical and quantum approaches. 
 Photonic time crystals host a variety of intriguing phenomena, from wave amplification and mixing to exotic band structures, all stemming from the time-periodic modulation of optical properties. While these features have been well described classically, their quantum manifestation when coupled to an atomic electric dipole has remained elusive. Here, we introduce a quantum electrodynamical model of photonic time crystals that reveals a deeper connection between classical and quantum pictures: the classical momentum gap arises from a localization-delocalization quantum phase transition in a Floquet-photonic synthetic lattice. Leveraging an effective Hamiltonian perspective, we pinpoint the critical momenta and highlight how classical exponential field growth manifests itself as wave-packet acceleration in the quantum synthetic space. Remarkably, when a two-level atom is embedded in such a photonic time crystal, its Rabi oscillations undergo irreversible decay to a half-and-half mixed state—a previously unobserved phenomenon driven by photonic delocalization within the momentum gap, even with just a single frequency mode. Our findings establish photonic time crystals as versatile platforms for studying nonequilibrium quantum photonics and suggest new avenues for controlling light matter interactions through time domain engineering.

 Extreme temperatures and poor air quality contribute to premature mortality, increased hospital admissions and higher healthcare costs. As the majority of the world’s population lives in cities, understanding how urban vegetation mitigates temperature and pollution hazards is essential for designing strategies to enhance urban resilience and reduce mortality. However, estimating the health benefits of urban greening is challenging due to the non-linear physical, chemical, and biological processes involved. Here we use a coupled climate-chemistry model to assess the impact of different peri-urban tree planting scenarios on temperature- and pollution-related mortality and their associated costs over three Euro-Mediterranean cities. We find that peri-urban greening primarily allows to reduce mortality from non-optimal temperatures and, to a lesser extent, air pollution, with effectiveness depending on the selected trees species and local meteorological and chemical conditions. This study provides methodological insights to guide urban planners in leveraging nature-based solutions effectively while avoiding adverse health effects from poor tree selection.

 In 2023, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported over 110 million displaced individuals globally, many in regions facing extreme weather and violence. Here we examine how these crises interact to shape household mobility in Bangladesh. Using data linking local conflict events, natural hazards, and household characteristics from 2011 to 2018, we apply machine learning models to capture complex, non-linear relationships between these risks. We find that combining conflict and hazard information improves predictions of household mobility. While exposure to violence or disasters increases mobility, households with remittances are more likely to move, whereas those with loans often remain.

 Here, we combine scenario analysis with machine learning to assess the impact of China’s carbon neutrality policy on the reduction of toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as quantified by their toxic equivalency emissions (EBaPeq). Using long-term (2000–2023) energy consumption data and provincial projections to 2060, we show that national EBaPeq is expected to peak around 2027 due to policy impacts, and then fall by 45% by 2060. This peak timing proves robust to data uncertainties. However, a pronounced north-south divide persists: northern regions, constrained by coal-dependent energy systems and aluminum-smelting industries, will peak later, whereas central and southern China achieved their peaks before 2012. This regional imbalance in emission intensity per GDP may widen under certain growth pathways. We propose targeted policies—such as cross-regional technology transfer, differentiated transition roadmaps, and improved ecological compensation—to support more equitable and synergistic abatement of carbon and toxic pollutants.

 Precipitation variability in the Mediterranean Basin has traditionally been attributed to large-scale Atlantic climate modes, particularly the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, over key regions such as the Italian Peninsula, NAO-based interpretations often fall short in explaining observed hydroclimatic patterns. In this study, we combine deep learning reconstruction of historical precipitation records from 1950 to 2020 with the analysis of atmospheric teleconnection indices and air mass back-trajectory modelling. Using a dataset of more than eleven thousand rain gauge time series, we developed neural network models to produce a continuous and high-resolution precipitation dataset for Italy. Our results demonstrate that Mediterranean teleconnections, especially the Mediterranean Oscillation Index (MOI) and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO), exert a stronger and more consistent influence on precipitation compared to the NAO. Trajectory analysis using the HYSPLIT model reveals that the Western Mediterranean is the dominant moisture source for central and northern Italy, while the Ionian and Eastern Mediterranean regions become increasingly important in the southern part of the country. These findings underscore the central role of Mediterranean cyclogenesis in shaping regional precipitation dynamics and call for a reassessment of climate interpretation frameworks that have traditionally focused on Atlantic influences alone. Precipitation variability over Italy is shaped mainly by Mediterranean climate patterns rather than Atlantic influences, which underscores the role of Mediterranean cyclogenesis in regional rainfall dynamics, according to deep learning, teleconnection, and back-trajectory analyses."

We examined an eclogite‐garnet peridotite interface from the Chinese Continental Scientific Drilling Program in the Sulu orogen, representing the slab–mantle wedge boundary formed during continental subduction. Whole‐rock magnesium (Mg) isotopic and major‐trace element data, together with in situ mineral analyses, identify the presence of carbonic fluids characterized by notably light Mg isotopic compositions (−0.54 to −0.36‰) and elevated Ca, Mg, Sr, and rare earth elements contents. These fluids, generated by slab decarbonation during prograde metamorphism, mobilized carbon from the subducted crust and enriched the mantle wedge. Modeling indicates that continental subduction rivals oceanic systems in transporting carbon to mantle. However, the paucity of mantle‐derived magmatism limits carbon return, promoting long‐term retention of continental carbon in mantle and establishing continental subduction as a major sink in the global carbon budget."

Intense hiss emissions are frequently generated within dynamic plasmaspheric plumes through linear and nonlinear wave‐particle interactions. However, the contribution of plume hiss to the spatial distribution of hiss throughout the plasmasphere is not yet well quantified. In this study, we perform ray‐tracing simulations to investigate the global propagation of plume hiss under varying plume morphologies, including different widths and levels of density lumpiness. We find that most hiss power is confined near the local time sector of the plume. Narrower plumes with embedded density ducts significantly enhance earthward wave guidance into the plasmaspheric core, compared to wide, smooth plumes. Furthermore, a subset of rays guided azimuthally along the plasmapause can serve as seed waves for intense dayside hiss. Our results highlight the role of plume hiss in shaping the global‐scale distribution of hiss waves."

On interannual to decadal timescales, sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the North Pacific appear in phase with the traditional Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO), while in the tropics resemble El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The extratropical signal is the ENSO‐forced wave train in the troposphere correlating with a weaker stratospheric polar vortex. On multi‐decadal timescales (20–25 years), SST anomalies are stronger over the Kuroshio‐Oyashio Extension, and turbulent heat flux anomalies suggest a potential oceanic influence. The tropospheric teleconnection evolves differently through North America projecting onto the Pacific North American pattern, resulting in a stronger polar vortex.

However, the influence of the crustal fields on shaping the Martian dayside magnetosphere remains ambiguous. To explore this, an entirely induced magnetosphere and a hybrid magnetosphere are obtained from a Hall‐magnetohydrodynamic model without and with the consideration of the crustal fields under average solar wind conditions. Simulation results reveal that the presence of the crustal fields typically enhances and twists magnetic field and associated current within the Martian hybrid magnetosphere. Accordingly, the crustal fields significantly augment the intensity of motional and Hall electric fields, from which ions tend to acquire considerably additional energy for escape. These findings provide valuable insights into the structuring of the Martian hybrid magnetosphere under the impact of the crustal fields."

Here we show that this is less likely to be driven by solar wind kinetic power than previously thought. We determine that the solar wind kinetic power at Uranus has been increasing since the start of solar cycle 24 in 2009, while Uranus's thermospheric temperature has continued to decline. A comparison of the ascending phases of solar cycles 24 and 25 shows an increase in solar wind power of 15%, while Uranus's thermospheric temperature decreased by 18% in the same timeframe. If the solar wind was a driver of thermospheric temperature at Uranus it would be expected that Uranus would have reversed its declining temperature trend in recent years. We have also estimated that a decline in energy sourced from the solar wind would not be sufficient to change the thermospheric temperature by the level observed."

Another, non‐threshold process—Modification of the Electron Energy Spectrum (MOS)—occurs when subcritical fields energize ambient electrons, shifting their spectrum to higher energies and increasing bremsstrahlung probability. MOS becomes dominant at high energies, where the RREA flux rapidly decreases, explaining the persistent detections of gamma rays above 50–60 MeV. We simulate gamma‐ray yield over a wide range of Atmospheric Electric Field (AEF) to delineate MOS and RREA regimes and quantify spectral evolution with field strength. Experimental data from two Thunderstorm Ground Enhancements (TGEs) observed on 2 October 2024, are analyzed. By matching the exponential growth of measured count rates to modeled RREA yield, we derive the temporal evolution of the AEF during both TGEs, revealing the rate and magnitude of field strengthening that drive particle bursts and bridge the MOS–RREA transition in natural thunderstorms."

Public concerns have been raised in cases where a surge in felt or damaging earthquakes has occurred because of industrial activity. The effective mitigation of induced earthquakes remains a major challenge despite the employment of several strategies. Here, we demonstrate that introducing shear thickening fluid into fault zones could effectively stabilize fault slip and inhibit earthquakes due to the fluid's rate‐dependent viscosity. In rotary‐shear friction experiments, the gouge‐fluid mixtures result in more stable slip than pure gouge samples, which exhibit stick‐slip motion under the same conditions. Additionally, the critical slip distance increases exponentially with increasing velocities, challenging the prevailing view that it is velocity‐independent. Since longer critical slip distances tend to promote fault stability, our results suggest that shear thickening fluid could delay or dampen the earthquake nucleation process as slip velocity increases, by directly modifying fault frictional properties."

The values span three orders of magnitude, with the greatest variability in metamorphic and surface rocks that host both highly reduced (rich in carbon and sulfur) and oxidized materials. In contrast, exhumed lower‐crustal and mantle rocks display more uniform values of dO2. This distribution reflects not a progressive net planetary oxidation, but active redox partitioning, shaped by far‐from‐equilibrium biological chemistry, surface processes, and tectonic cycling. Unlike thermodynamic potentials such as μO2, the compositional variable dO2 directly constrains the redox structure of Earth's shallow lithospheric reservoirs.

This study investigated the concentrations, sources, and water solubility of three major redox‐active metals (Fe, Cu, Mn) in PM2.5 collected in urban Xi'an before and during the COVID‐19 pandemic restrictions. Results showed that Fe was the most abundant metal but exhibited low solubility (<10%), while Cu and Mn showed higher solubility, with average values exceeding 40% across all periods except the winter during the pandemic restrictions. Source apportionment indicated that dust was the important Fe source, whereas Cu and Mn mainly originated from traffic‐related and combustion emissions. During pandemic restrictions, total metal concentrations increased by 20%–35%, yet metal solubility significantly decreased, particularly in winter, coinciding with a significant rise in aerosol pH (from ∼3 to 5.38). Multiple linear regression analysis suggested that pH was the main factor affecting the variations of Cu and Mn solubility, while Fe solubility was more strongly associated with emission sources. Notably, the results suggest that combustion sources exhibited a dual role by directly emitting more soluble metal species and indirectly enhancing solubility via acid precursor emissions that lowered aerosol pH. These findings highlight that, beyond emission reductions, aerosol pH regulation is also critical for mitigating the bioavailability of toxic metals. Therefore, effective air quality management in urban environments should integrate source control with aerosol acidity regulation to reduce the bioavailability of PM2.5‐bound redox‐active metals."

The ratio Lx/Ly ${L}_{x}/{L}_{y}$ describes the anisotropy of the structures where Lx/Ly>1 ${L}_{x}/{L}_{y} > 1$ indicates structures elongated along the mean wind direction. This ratio is thought to vary with height above the surface and be controlled by surface roughness, shear, and stability, but almost all investigations in the literature consider only neutral atmospheric stability. The present work investigates spatial length scales of temperature fluctuations and uses a horizontally arrayed distributed fiber‐optic temperature sensor to construct 2D spatial correlation fields from which Lx ${L}_{x}$ and Ly ${L}_{y}$ are calculated in a desert surface layer with low roughness over a range of atmospheric stabilities. Time‐sequential thermography is used to calculate length scales of temperature fluctuations at the surface interface. Lx ${L}_{x}$ is generally found to increase with increasing boundary layer height, with increasing wind speed, and with decreasing instability, while Ly ${L}_{y}$ is more constant, both for the surface temperature and air temperature field. We find more isotropic turbulence at low wind speeds and more unstable atmospheric regimes and more anisotropic turbulence in (near‐)neutral atmospheric stabilities at higher wind speeds. The length scales at the surface are found to be larger than the near‐surface atmosphere and generally higher than values reported in the literature."

Here, we use the Lake, Ice, Snow, and Sediment Simulator within the Community Land Model to project the responses of global lake E $E$ to a warming climate under a high‐emissions scenario (RCP8.5) by the end of the 21st century. Simulations reveal a global mean increase of 13% in lake E $E$, with the largest absolute increases occurring in low‐ and mid‐latitude regions, driven by enhanced energy availability. In contrast, high‐latitude lakes exhibit the greatest relative increases due to reduced snow and ice cover, leading to lower albedo and higher solar absorption. By analyzing changes in long‐term mean and interannual variability, we identify regional hotspots of E $E$ sensitivity, which are concentrated in polar regions such as Greenland, Alaska, and Northern Europe. These hotspots do not always align with areas of the greatest absolute E $E$ increases, underscoring the need for lake‐specific assessments of climate vulnerability. Using the Geographical Detector Model, we show that vapor pressure deficit (VPD) is the dominant individual driver of hotspot patterns. Moreover, strong synergistic interactions among VPD, radiation and wind speed reveal that E $E$ responses are governed by the combined influence of radiative and atmospheric drivers, rather than by individual factors alone. Our findings highlight the importance of accounting for both surface energy balance changes and compound climate drivers when assessing the sensitivity of inland waters to global warming."

However, fully representing the mechanisms behind strong downdrafts and gusts in models remains difficult. We conducted short‐duration regional simulations using a nested downscaling approach with the Weather Research and Forecasting model including a cloud‐resolving innermost subregion at various grid spacings down to 200‐m. The model generated a strong gust event characterized by a pronounced, coherent downdraft that we used to study the forcing mechanisms. The 1‐km simulation underestimated the downdraft and 5‐km didn't represent it at all. In addition, the 1‐km simulated weaker downdrafts exhibited a vertical momentum budget different to that of the 200‐m simulation. The perturbation pressure vertical gradient and thermal buoyancy are the main contributors to the downdraft acceleration in the 200‐m simulation, with condensate loading playing a less significant role than other processes at mid and low levels. Coarser resolutions underestimate the role of perturbation pressure, resulting in a smaller contribution to downward acceleration compared to thermal buoyancy and condensate loading. This highlights the potential importance of the spatial distribution of downdraft forcing mechanisms as a key consideration for why coarser grid spacings may fail to adequately capture more realistic downdrafts. The findings presented here are relevant for risk assessment applications and parameterizations of downdrafts, demonstrating benefits of large‐eddy simulations (LES) for wind hazard analysis and highlighting the need for care when interpreting results from coarser models."

 Highly pathogenic avian influenza H5N1 poses an increasing public health risk, particularly following its spillover into dairy cows and associated human infections in the U.S. since March 2024. Here, we systematically identified critical PB2 mutations emerged during avian-to-cattle transmission and subsequent adaptation in cattle, notably PB2 M631L, which conferred pathogenicity in mice comparable to the well-characterized PB2 E627K mutation. Retrospective analysis reveals that PB2 631L also circulated in avian and human H5N1 strains during the 2013–2014 outbreaks in Cambodia and Vietnam. Additional adaptive mutations include established markers (E627K, Q591R, D701N), and novel variants (I647V, G685R, K736R). These mutations enhance polymerase activity by improving the utilization of both bovine and human ANP32A proteins, thereby increasing viral fitness and pathogenicity in mammals. The convergence of these adaptations highlights the elevated zoonotic risk of cattle-adapted H5N1 viruses and underscores the urgent need for heightened surveillance across avian and mammalian hosts.

 Lithium-ion battery (LIB) recycling is crucial for energy security, environmental sustainability, and economic viability, as the finite lifespan of LIBs results in a significant annual accumulation of spent units. However, effectively and precisely recovering valuable metal ions such as Li+, Mn2+, Ni2+ and Co2+ from complex LIB leaching solutions remains a major challenge. Here, we present a scalable electro-membrane crystallization-assisted general recycling (e-MCGR) technology for the selective and efficient recovery of those metal ions from LIB leaching solutions. By synergistically integrating electrochemical and electro-membrane technologies, our proposed technology incorporates four key configurations: selective membrane dual-stage distillation, bipolar membrane in-situ crystallization, membrane metal-complexing ex-situ crystallization, and membrane metal-extracting temporal crystallization. We systematically analyze the metal-ion transfer kinetics of electro-membranes (ion selectivity and permeation rates) and the performance of electro-membrane crystallization systems (recovery rates and product purity), alongside evaluating energy consumption, economic viability, and environmental benefits. Our optimized e-MCGR process achieves a recovery of 95.5% for Li+, 99.5% for Mn2+, 83.1% for Ni2+, and 87.3% for Co2+, yielding high product purities of 99.9% for Li2CO3, 99.9% for Mn3O4, 99.5% for Ni(OH)2 and 92.5% for Co(OH)2.

Here, authors report zinc oligoether salts as electrolyte additives to promote the formation of passivation layer on Zn metallic electrode and extend the lifetime of aqueous Zn-based batteries. 
 Aqueous zinc-metal batteries, which pair a water-based electrolyte with an earth-abundant metal, offer a sustainable energy storage platform. However, hydrogen evolution and dendrite growth during zinc plating limit stability and cycle life. Achieving durable performance requires a comprehensive approach that promotes forming a robust solid electrolyte interphase layer. Here, we introduce zinc oligoether carboxylates as tuneable dual-function electrolyte additives. The carboxylate group promotes the formation of a zinc sulphide-based interphase through the controlled decomposition of sulphate anions, while the oligoether chain suppresses water activity at the electrode surface, as revealed by spectroscopic and electrochemical microscopy analyses. By varying the chain length, we find that the longest compound, zinc (2-[2-[2-(2-methoxyethoxy)ethoxy]ethoxy]acetate)2, extends the lifetime of symmetric zinc cells from 200 to 1000 hours at a current density of 0.624 mA.cm-2 and a capacity of 2.5 mAh.cm-2. Furthermore, zinc–copper cells achieve 99.6% efficiency at 5 mA.cm-2 and 10 mAh.cm-2. This improvement also benefits zinc–manganese dioxide, extending from 30 to 200 cycles.

Consistent across cohorts and analyses, large relative risk increases are seen for inflammatory bowel conditions (e.g., K50 Crohn disease, crude hazard ratio 1.70 [1.63-1.77]) and eye diseases (e.g., H16 Keratitis, crude hazard ratio 1.71 [1.57-1.86]). We provide a dashboard to explore and browse the full range of results. A study using English electronic health records from millions of people with atopic eczema provides an evidence resource covering the full spectrum of associated comorbidity, providing a big picture overview as well as results for each individual outcome."

 First identified in late 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic, caused by the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus, rapidly escalated into a global health crisis. SARS-CoV-2 is a single-stranded RNA virus encased in a lipid envelope that houses key structural proteins, including the Spike glycoprotein, which mediates viral entry into host cells. Within Spike, the S2 subunit, and particularly its fusion domain, plays a critical role in merging viral and host membranes. To explore how receptor-driven Spike clustering influences this process, we investigated the self-assembly of S2 fusion peptides (FPs) and their interactions with biomimetic plasma membrane (PM) models composed of phospholipids, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol. Atomic force microscopy, laser direct infrared spectroscopy, neutron reflectometry, and grazing-incidence X-ray diffraction reveal that FPs form supramolecular assemblies that exclude cholesterol-rich nanodomains, increase membrane fluidity, and disrupt raft-like order associated with ACE2 binding. The appearance of spiral FP fibers supports a loaded-spring mechanism for membrane remodeling, offering a model for cooperative peptide-driven fusion, highlighting opportunities for antiviral and nanobiotechnological applications. This study shows how SARS-CoV-2 fusion peptides assemble and reshape membranes, revealing cooperative mechanisms that lower barriers to viral entry and offering principles for designing antiviral and membrane-responsive nanomaterials."

Trait anxiety thus alters sensory encoding from the earliest stages of cortical processing. 
 Sensory processing varies across individuals, with some traits—particularly sensory hypersensitivity to basic non-valenced stimuli—linked to emotional traits and psychiatric risk. Traditional accounts attribute this sensory–emotion linkage to limbic or prefrontal modulation, but empirical support is limited. Growing evidence suggests sensory cortex itself flexibly encodes value beyond labeled-line analysis. Across four high-density EEG experiments with multi-wave assessments, we identified reliable visual cortical hyperactivity in high trait anxiety. The effect emerged as early as 46 ms, localized to V1/V2, and was specific to the parvocellular pathway. It was reproducible across arousal states, stimulus valence, extended intervals, and paradigms, and evident for both simple (grating) and complex real-world images. Importantly, cortical excitation–inhibition balance (EEG aperiodic exponent/1/f slope) predicted parvocellular responses in low- but not high-anxiety individuals, implicating disrupted E/I modulation. Thus, trait anxiety alters early visual processing, aligning cortical computations with an individual’s intrinsic biological propensity from the outset. Here, the authors show people with high trait anxiety display stable, parvocellular-specific visual cortical hyperactivity linked to disrupted cortical excitation–inhibition modulation. Trait anxiety thus alters sensory encoding from the earliest stages of cortical processing."

 Current methods to generate haplotype-resolved assemblies for highly heterozygous genomes suffer from reference bias when relying on reference-based phasing or may generate imbalanced haplomes when relying on graph-based phasing. Here, we report PhaseGrass, an assembly, phasing and scaffolding workflow that is compatible with accurate or error-prone long reads, generating haplotype-resolved assemblies for highly heterozygous genomes. Requiring no parental data, PhaseGrass combines reference-based phasing with haplotype-specific k-mers to partition long reads or unitigs to corresponding haplotypes, thereby avoiding reference bias and uneven haplotype partitioning. Using PhaseGrass, we generated chromosome-level, haplotype-resolved assemblies for the highly heterozygous, allogamous grass species Lolium perenne L. and L. multiflorum Lam. We find that PhaseGrass can bin 20% more reads to haplotypes than WhatsHap and generated balanced haplomes compared to Hifiasm, which produced largely imbalanced haplomes for L. multiflorum due to abundant structural variations between haplotypes. PhaseGrass will facilitate routine generation of haplotype-resolved pangenomes for species with highly heterozygous genomes.

 Rivers are major pathways for terrigenous plastics to the ocean, yet the spatio-temporal variability of plastic flux remains poorly quantified. Here, we conducted annual field monitoring of plastic particle fluxes in the Yangtze River, accounting for both vertical and horizontal variations in plastic distribution within the estuary. Microplastics were ubiquitous but exhibited spatial and temporal heterogeneity. Microplastics abundance declined with increasing depth, and the central channel exhibited lower microplastic abundance compared to the left and right channels. Monthly trends were consistent across channels within the same water layer. Hydrological patterns primarily regulated microplastic occurrence, with microplastic abundance decreasing at higher flow rates, while particle size correlated positively with flow. We estimated an annual flux of 5.20×1015 microplastic particles, of which 74.6% were small particles, posing substantial ecological risks due to their high toxicity and ingestion potential.

The simulated S at the LGM is 1.97 ± 0.22 (1σ), 44 ± 16% greater than under future warming, primarily due to the influence of elevated continental ice sheets. Results reveal that the glacial air‐sea cooling contrast is negatively related to the magnitude of sea surface cooling, consistent with a simple moist static energy theory. This relationship can be used to constrain S, further suggesting a median LGM surface cooling of −5.6°C.

While recent studies have identified stratospheric pathways for improving SNAO prediction, the role of tropospheric wave dynamics remains unclear. Using a latest‐generation large‐ensemble seasonal forecasting system, we find that the model exhibits limited SNAO prediction skill and underestimates downstream climate impacts. These limitations are associated with deficiencies in circumglobal waveguide dynamics. Subsampling ensemble members that best capture circulation anomalies near circumglobal teleconnection centers or tropical/monsoon rainfall that forces the teleconnection is accompanied by significantly improved SNAO prediction. Furthermore, deficiencies in the model circumglobal waveguide, particularly over the Mediterranean and North Atlantic with underestimated background zonal winds and erroneous curvature, may disrupt wave propagation. Refining these dynamical features could improve teleconnection representation and SNAO prediction, aiding summer climate risk mitigation."

However, the recent atmospheric MCF decay suggests persistent emissions and/or declining OH (contradicting chemistry‐climate models projecting increasing or stable OH). The air‐sea exchange of MCF has been poorly constrained due to limited observations and simplified ocean representations. We simulate oceanic MCF fluxes using a modern ocean reanalysis and validate with depth‐resolved observations. Results suggest the ocean has shifted from a net sink to a net source around 2005, outgassing 0.5 Gg yr−1 in the 2010s (up to 30% of inferred MCF emissions).

Using large ensemble simulations, we find that approximately 71% of the recent strengthening is attributed to phase transitions in three key sea surface temperature (SST) gradients—tropical Western Pacific (TWP)‐Western North Pacific, TWP‐Tropical Eastern Pacific, and TWP‐Tropical Indian Ocean, indicating an internal variability mode linked to the inter‐basin SST gradient.

The corresponding correlation coefficients significantly increase and then decrease with the increase of proton rigidity.

Much of this was injected into the stratosphere, from where it was dispersed worldwide. The fallout of this bomb‐produced 36Cl has been measured as a function of time in an ice core from a high‐accumulation site in Antarctica. These measurements complement an earlier study in an Arctic ice core. A box model has been developed to describe simultaneously the data from both the two sites. Using an up‐to‐date catalog, the 36Cl production of the individual tests has been estimated and used as input to the box model. Production is dominated by high‐yield thermonuclear tests carried out on barges moored in the lagoons of the atolls in the 1950s. Exchange times of 3.7 years for gaseous exchange between stratosphere and troposphere and 4.2 years for gaseous exchange between the stratospheres of the two hemispheres are deduced. The 36Cl bomb pulse constitutes a global tracer with an input function that is well‐defined in space and time, and its exchange between stratosphere and troposphere is dominated by one‐way transport due to its rapid removal once in the troposphere. This latter behavior greatly simplifies the interpretation of the data in terms of an exchange time relative to the 14C bomb pulse. The stratosphere‐troposphere exchange time derived here from the bomb‐produced 36Cl offers an independent constraint on the flux of ozone between stratosphere and troposphere which agrees well with other more direct estimates."

Here, the authors show that contractile forces drive lysosomes to the cell edge, where they activate Rac1 and trigger leader cell emergence. 
 Collective cell migration during embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis requires the emergence of leader cells at the migration front. Despite their physiological relevance, the full mechanisms underlying the emergence of leader cells remain elusive. Here we report that leader cells display a peripheral accumulation of lysosomes in diverse model systems for wound healing, including cultured epithelial monolayer, mouse embryonic skin, and Drosophila embryos. This accumulation involves cellular contractile forces driving lysosomal transport along microtubules towards the leading edge. Indeed, we control leader cell emergence by manipulating lysosomal movement on microtubules. We further find that peripheral lysosomes associate with Rac1 molecules at the leading periphery, regulating local Rac1-activity, triggering actin polymerization and promoting lamellipodium formation. Taken together, we demonstrate that beyond their catabolic role, lysosomes act as an intracellular platform that links mechanical and biochemical signals to control the emergence of leader cells. During collective migration, only a few cells become leaders that guide tissue movement. Here, the authors show that contractile forces drive lysosomes to the cell edge, where they activate Rac1 and trigger leader cell emergence."

 What humans look at and do when freely viewing a scene is not well understood. We measure observer eye movements under different instructions while participants view a customized set of image pairs containing small visual alterations that greatly change scene interpretation (Winograd images). We show that free-viewing fixations resemble those of observers describing scenes but differ from those of observers counting or searching for objects. Fixations are more often directed toward people and objects whose removal most alters scene interpretation, rather than toward the most salient or meaningfully judged regions (meaning maps), or objects perceived to be grasped or gazed at. Small image changes that modify scene understanding (Winograd images), but not salience or meaning maps, alter fixation patterns. By instructing observers to describe scenes while fixating on objects either relevant or irrelevant to scene understanding, we demonstrate that free-viewing eye movements are functionally important for accurate scene comprehension.

 Mining is a major driver of deforestation, yet the full scale of its contribution to global natural forest loss and associated carbon emissions remains obscured by the incomplete inventories of mining activities. Here, we present a comprehensive global mining inventory, including 236,028 mining areas with an overall accuracy of 87.37% to quantify direct deforestation and the associated forest carbon emissions from mining activities between 2001 and 2023. Our results reveal that mining-induced deforestation is two to three times higher than previous estimates from existing datasets, accounting for 19,765 km2 of deforestation with associated emissions of 0.75 Pg CO2 over this period. Notably, over half (50.29%) of this deforestation is linked to unrecorded mining activities. These findings highlight the substantially underestimated role of mining, particularly informal and unrecorded activities, in driving global deforestation and climate change, underscoring the urgent need for improved monitoring and regulation of mining impacts on the environment across regions. The study provides a comprehensive inventory of global mining footprints, finding that mining causes higher deforestation than previously estimated, with half linked to unrecorded activities, and highlighting the underestimated environmental impacts."

Here, the authors use linked electronic health records from England and Wales to investigate the association between oral antibiotic use and survival in women with breast cancer. 
 The role of the gut microbiota in carcinogenesis is increasingly being acknowledged. Recent studies in multiple breast cancer mouse models have found that antibiotics, by altering the gut microbiota, can accelerate tumour growth. In humans, a recent cohort study restricted to triple negative breast cancer showed that breast cancer patients using a greater number of antibiotics had markedly worse survival. These studies have raised concerns about repeated antibiotic use in breast cancer patients. In this Registered Report, we investigated whether breast cancer patients using oral antibiotics had increased breast cancer-specific mortality. In population-based cohorts (n = 44,452), we did not observe a statistically significant association between antibiotic prescriptions after diagnosis and breast cancer-specific mortality (adjusted HR = 1.07 95% CI 0.87, 1.33) apart from prescriptions of 12 or more antibiotics (adjusted HR = 1.62 95% CI 1.31, 2.01). This association was weaker after adjustment for infections (adjusted HR = 1.44 95% 1.14, 1.81), when restricted to antibiotics within five years (adjusted HR = 1.33 95% 0.95, 1.84), and was similar for deaths from other causes (adjusted HR = 1.69 95% 1.19, 2.41). Frequent antibiotic users had higher cancer-specific mortality but the attenuation of associations in sensitivity analyses, and similar findings for other causes of death, suggest this increase may reflect residual confounding.

 Electrochemical dechlorination provides a sustainable method to treat chlorinated volatile organic compounds polluted water with producing value-added hydrocarbon. However, dechlorination of dichloromethane (CH2Cl2) generates *CH3 and *CH2Cl intermediates, which are highly unstable due to lack of efficient hyperconjugation from neighboring carbon sites. Herein, we report that cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPc) grafts onto sulfur-doped graphene toward efficient electrocatalysis of CH2Cl2 dechlorination at moderate potentials. It reveals that sulfoxide groups within graphene linked to Co sites by an axial coordination, resulting in an electron donation effect to decrease the barriers of elemental dechlorination step. While in situ electrochemically generates [Co1+Pc]⁻ species mediated the electron transfer from Co sites to CH2Cl2. The production rate of CH4 is significantly enhanced compares to the current level, and an additional case of producing C2H4 and C2H6 is achieved. For potential practical application, the electrochemical dechlorination of a diluted CH2Cl2 solution is validated in an electrofiltration module setup by an efficient flow-through mode.

Here, the authors show how pathogen-derived compounds regulate host EV production showcasing new insight into how animals anticipate and prepare themselves for infection. 
 In natural environments, animals encounter pathogen-derived chemicals long before infection occurs. How such anticipatory cues influence extracellular vesicle (EV) dynamics, which are central to immune regulation, intercellular communication, and stress responses, remains unknown. Using Caenorhabditis elegans, we show that pathogen-derived volatile and non-volatile compounds trigger distinct EV pathways through separate sensory and molecular mechanisms. Non-volatile secretome components, including the tripeptide Ile-Pro-Pro, activate immune-dependent EV production, whereas volatile metabolites elicit immunity-independent EV formation. Both responses require sensory input from ASK, ADL, and AWC neurons and converge on a neural circuit involving RMG, AIB, and AIA interneurons. GPCRs SRI-19, SRI-36/39, and SRR-6 mediate non-volatile responses, with SRR-6 acting in the intestine to regulate muscle EVs release. Notably, pre-exposure to pathogen volatiles enhances offspring survival during subsequent infection in an SRI-19–dependent manner, suggesting a predictive, intergenerational benefit of pathogen detection. In summary, our findings uncover that pathogen-derived chemical cues shape host EV production via specialized sensory circuits, revealing how animals anticipate infection and prime protective physiological responses.

Despite their importance, prior assessments of their effectiveness have yielded inconsistent results. The objective of this study is to systematically assess the effectiveness of HPPs in reducing heat-related mortality risk across Europe. We analysed daily mortality and mean temperature data from 102 locations in 14 European countries between 1990 and 2019. Using data from national experts, we identified the year of HPP implementation and categorised their development class. A three-stage analysis was conducted: (1) quasi-Poisson time series models were used to estimate location-specific warm-season exposure-response functions in 3 year subperiods; (2) mixed-effect meta-regression models with multilevel longitudinal structures were employed to quantify changes in pooled exposure-response functions due to HPP implementation, adjusted for long-term trends in heat-related mortality risks; and (3) the heat-related excess mortality due to HPP was calculated by comparing factual (with HPP) and counterfactual (without HPP) scenarios. Estimates are reported by country, region, and HPP class. HPP implementation was associated with a 25.2% [95% CI: 19.8% to 31.9%] reduction in excess deaths attributable to extreme heat, corresponding to 1.8 [95% CI: 1.3–2.4] avoided deaths annually per 100 000 inhabitants. This equates to an estimated 14 551 [95% CI: 10 118–19 072] total deaths avoided across all study locations following HPP implementation. No significant differences in HPP effectiveness were observed by European region or HPP class. Our findings provide robust evidence that HPPs substantially reduce heat-related mortality across Europe, accounting for temporal changes and geographical differences in risks. These results emphasise the importance of monitoring and evaluating HPPs to enhance adaptation to a warming climate."

 A three-month air quality measurement campaign was conducted in spring 2023 near a busy highway in Espoo, Finland. The measurement site featured a high (6.5 m) noise barrier built adjacent to the highway. Additionally, there was a gap in the noise barrier at the selected measurement site, providing an opportunity to study the air quality impacts of the noise barrier. Several air quality measurement devices were installed behind the noise barrier and in the gap at distances of 10, 20 and 40 m from the side of the highway. Additionally, 15 passive samplers were deployed to monitor NO2 concentrations across the study area, mobile measurements were conducted using the ATMo-Lab mobile laboratory on the highway, and concurrent flights with drones equipped with AQ monitors were performed along the highway.The effects of the noise barrier on PM10, PM2.5, lung deposited surface area (LDSA), particle number concentration (PNC), NO2, and black carbon (BC) were quantified based on the analysed measurement data. Furthermore, the measurements were compared with simulated pollutant concentrations from a local-scale Gaussian air quality model (Enfuser) with a nearby obstacle detection and concentration reduction method incorporated in the model to address the effects of the noise barrier in the study.The noise barrier was found to effectively reduce pollutant concentrations behind the barrier.

 Our study focuses on Bhutan, a highly mountainous country where government authorities are strengthening air pollution monitoring efforts. To support further analysis and the monitoring strategy, we present the first high-resolution air quality simulations with the chemistry transport model WRF-CHIMERE over the western region of Bhutan at a spatial resolution of roughly 1 km. Increasing the horizontal resolution of the model improves its performance and reduces potential errors caused by excessive spatial averaging of meteorological and emission data with high spatial variability. However, the air pollutant emissions must be improved at a fine scale with better proxy, particularly for industries where improvements are still required. For the first time, we propose high resolution maps of air pollution (concentrations and deposition fields). Our simulations confirm that Bhutan valleys also suffer from air pollution mainly due to PM2.5 (concentrations exceeding 20 µg m−3) dominated by carbonaceous species, largely above the World Health Organization guidelines. Wildfires and anthropogenic activities release large amount of carbonaceous species and can also impact the glaciers by atmospheric fallout. Wildfires can locally contribute to 20 % of the total PM2.5 concentrations over a 15 d period, and theoretically, black carbon can be transported up to the highest peaks.

This study presents a method to analyze this in real-time using two weather balloon measurements: ambient and in-plume conditions. Researchers launched 156 balloons during wildfire seasons in Spain, Chile, Greece, and the Netherlands. This methodology detects sudden changes in fire behavior by comparing ambient and in-plume data, ultimately enhancing research on fire-atmosphere interactions. 
 Firefighter entrapments occur when wildfires suddenly transition into extreme wildfire events (EWEs). These transitions are often caused by pyroconvective fire-atmosphere coupling, triggered by a combination of high fire intensity and atmospheric vertical thermodynamic structure. Pyroconvection indices calculated using coarse atmospheric modeling data crudely detect these dynamic transitions due to highly localized atmospheric processes and changes in atmospheric conditions caused by the fire. Consequently, fire managers may remain unaware that fire behavior intensification due to fire-atmosphere coupling is outdating the safety protocols in place. This study presents a new in-plume profiling methodology to improve the assessment of fire-atmosphere interaction dynamics in real-time. As proof of concept, we analyzed 173 successful sondes (148 in-plume) launched during the 2021–2025 fire seasons in Spain, Chile, Greece, and the Netherlands. As a strategy to measure the fire-atmosphere coupling, we propose simultaneously launching two radiosondes: one to measure ambient conditions and another to capture data within the plume updraft. Comparing these profiles, we measure in-situ and in-real time the modification of state variables by the fire-atmosphere interaction. These new observations and methodology improve our assessment of pyroconvection dynamics, demonstrating practical implications that support their use by incident management teams. It has the potential to enhance awareness of possible near-accidents and tactical failures during extreme pyroconvective wildfire events. Additionally, it offers a comprehensive observational dataset to improve pyroconvection nowcasting and advance research on fire-atmosphere interaction."

This minimizes the potential for exchange of these highly permeable gases between the ice core and the modern atmosphere.

Fluxes are calculated with multiple gas exchange schemes and wind products, then constrained to match independent regional to global annual mean fluxes estimates. We evaluate flux seasonal cycles and annual patterns against atmospheric O2 observations and quantify flux uncertainties from multiple sources. 
 We present estimates of the monthly open ocean air-sea O2 flux from 2004 to 2024 on a 1°×1° grid spanning 64.5°S to 79.5°N. The flux is computed using 4-dimensional ocean dissolved oxygen (DO) fields derived from Argo float and shipboard observations via machine learning algorithms (GOBAI-O2, Sharp et al., 2023). Flux uncertainties are quantified by generating a large ensemble of flux estimates, first propagating errors from the dissolved oxygen product, then computing fluxes across all combinations of three gas exchange parameterizations that account for bubble-mediated flux and three wind products. We apply DO adjustments to align our resolved global annual mean fluxes with those derived from scaling global ocean heat uptake and regional annual mean fluxes with those derived from ocean inversions. Our results show larger seasonal flux variations at high latitudes than at low latitudes, with clear differences between major ocean basins. Both adjusted and unadjusted annual mean flux estimates exhibit strong ocean O2 sinks at high latitudes, weak sources in the low-to-mid latitude subtropics, and weak sinks near the Equator. The annual mean adjustment significantly enhances ocean O2 uptake in the northern high latitudes and tropical regions while reducing outgassing in the northern subtropics. We evaluate our flux seasonal cycles and annual mean values by comparing forward transport simulations with atmospheric O2 observations from global airborne surveys and surface sampling stations. The simulations reproduce the observed mean seasonal cycles well, but some differences remain in the annual mean latitudinal gradients. We analyze fractional variance contributions from DO, wind, and gas exchange scheme uncertainties and their interactions at regional and hemispheric scales for both climatological monthly and annual mean fluxes. This dataset marks a major improvement over existing air-sea O2 flux products, as it includes the resolution of interannual variability in the flux seasonal cycle, the use of advanced machine learning-based DO fields that better represent complex spatial and temporal patterns, and robust uncertainty quantification across various scales."

This repository fills a key gap by enabling researchers to transparently archive and share the raw core image datasets and the visual interpretations of those images, rather than simply the summarized growth rate data, which on their own cannot be traced or precisely reproduced. CoralCache is designed to meet the data-sharing principles of findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability (FAIR). 
 As science fields enter the Big Data revolution, open-access repositories are essential for addressing larger-scale questions than are possible for single researchers by making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR). Furthermore, transparent data and code are increasingly important for reproducible research, especially for data types that inherently require subjective human interpretations. These ideas are applicable to coral sclerochronology, as the field has long been characterized by individual researchers collecting and analyzing coral skeletal cores from their study sites without substantial data sharing or archiving of the core images to meet FAIR principles. Here, we present CoralCache, a virtual coral core repository that not only archives image datasets (i.e., digitized X-rays and computed tomography scans), but also observer interpretations of the density banding patterns. CoralCache is linked to a graphical user interface, CoralCT, which together offer a way forward for coral growth rate analysis that is reproducible and collaborative. The data organization systems presented here could also be readily applied to related archives such as tree rings or bivalve shells."

The dataset provides a basis for identifying the same volcanic ash layers in different sediment deposits and to determine their stratigraphic and chronological relationships. Known ages of volcanic eruptions can be transferred among equivalent ash layers, which allows dating of sediments. Also ash dispersal and the volcanic history of a region can be studied. 
 Tephrostratigraphy and -chronology are powerful tools using volcanic ash (tephra) layers for establishing stratigraphic correlations and/or to obtain chronological information for different kinds of sedimentary archives. To develop tephrostratigraphic frameworks, which ideally document a most complete spatial and temporal record of regional volcanic activity, precise geochemical and chronological characterization of tephra layers is needed. Based on these frameworks, newly discovered tephra layers can be linked to retrieve stratigraphic and chronological information. Tephrostratigraphic frameworks exist or are under construction for various regions. However, for some regions of the world the potential of these methods is not exploited yet, although being influenced by long-term and frequent volcanism and tephra deposition. One of these regions is the Atacama Desert of northern Chile. There geochemical compositions of Pleistocene tephra layers (volcanic glass) were recently systematically investigated for their stratigraphy and chronology within the scope of the Collaborative Research Centre ‘Earth – Evolution at the Dry Limit’ (CRC 1211). These analyses were accompanied by the development of a tephra database called TephAta, which aims at providing a long-term basis for tephrostratigraphic and -chronological data of the Atacama Desert. TephAta allows digital documentation of the full variety of tephra-related datasets within one database and provides search functions to foster and simplify the continuous expansion of the regional framework following the FAIR (findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability) data principles. A first data compilation of 106 tephra samples origin from 91 tephra deposits is now available and will be continuously extended spatially and temporally. TephAta does not only provide a stratigraphic and dating tool for paleoenvironmental or mapping studies, but it also helps to explore the integrity of the explosive volcanic history of the region along with the associated volcanic hazard and risk assessment."

The dataset includes detailed measurements of debris-flow kinematic parameters (velocity, depth, and discharge), physical–mechanical properties (particle size, yield stress, and viscosity), seismic data, and hydrometeorological records (e.g., minute-by-minute rainfall and soil moisture). The dataset is publicly accessible via the National Cryosphere Desert Data Center (NCDC). 
 The study of mechanisms of debris-flow formation and movement is constrained by the lack of comprehensive and long-term field monitoring data. In 1961, the Dongchuan Debris Flow Observation and Research Station (DDFORS) was established in the highly active debris-flow catchment of Jiangjia Ravine to conduct continuous field observations of debris flows.  With the advancement of technology, more high-precision instruments have been employed to monitor the entire process of debris flows. This paper presents a unique and comprehensive dataset of debris-flow and hydrometeorological observations collected over a 64-year period (1961–2024) in Jiangjia Ravine, China. The dataset documents 17 001 surges for a total of 278 debris-flow events and encompasses detailed measurements of kinematic parameters of debris flow, including velocity, depth, and discharge, as well as physical–mechanical parameters, such as the particle size distribution of debris flow, yield stress, and viscosity of debris-flow slurry. It also incorporates the induced seismic data, providing insights into the dynamic characteristics of debris flows. Furthermore, it includes continuous records of rainfall at 1 min intervals, soil moisture, and suspended sediment concentrations at the catchment scale. This extensive dataset provides invaluable insights into the initiation, transportation, and deposition processes of debris flows. It can be utilized to analyze flow resistance and dynamic characteristics of debris flows, validate various computational models, investigate the effects of debris flows on channel morphology, and evaluate the impact of climate change on sediment transport within watersheds.

Keller;Marta Alerany Solé;Mario Acosta,Replicability in Earth System Models,"Can we be sure that different computing environments, that should not change the model climate, indeed leave the climate unaltered? In this article, we present a novel methodology that answers whether two model climates are statistically the same. Besides a new methodology, able to detect significant differences between two model climates 60 % more accurately than a similar recent state-of-the-art method, we also provide an analysis on what actually constitutes a different climate. 
 Climate simulations with Earth System Models (ESMs) constitute the basis of our knowledge about the projected climate change for the coming decades. They represent the major source of knowledge for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), and are an indispensable tool in confronting climate change. Yet, ESMs are imperfect and the climate system that they simulate is highly non-linear. Therefore, small errors in the numerical representation, initial states, and boundary conditions provided for future scenarios, quickly develop large uncertainties in the trajectories of their projected climates. To improve the confidence and minimize the uncertainty, future projections use large ensembles of simulations with the same model, and ensembles with multiple models. Using these two types of ensembles concurrently addresses two kinds of uncertainty in the simulations, (1) the limited spatiotemporal accuracy of the initial states, and (2) the uncertainty in the numerical representation of the climate system (model error). The uncertainty for the future development of the anthropogenic climate drivers is addressed by projecting different Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. Organizing multimodel ensembles to make confident statements about the future climate addressing different SSP scenarios is a tremendous collaborative effort. The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) addresses this challenge, with the participation of 33 modeling groups in 16 countries. As one among numerous challenges that such undertaking poses, we are addressing model replicability in this article. The anticipated number of simulated years in the 6th CMIP phase (CMIP6) accumulated to about 40 000 years. With typical values for the computational throughput of about 1 to 15 simulated years per day (SYPD), it is clear that the simulations needed to be distributed among different clusters to be completed within a reasonable amount of time. Model replicability addresses the question, whether the climate signal from different scientific scenarios generated by the same model, performed on different clusters, can be attributed exclusively to the differences in the scientific drivers. It has been shown, that even changing specific compiler flags, leads to significant changes in certain climatological fields. Model replicability holds, when the model climatologies derived from the same model under a different computing environment, are statistically indistinguishable. If replicability does not hold, we cannot be certain that differences in the model climate are exclusively attributed to differences in the scientific setups. In this article, we present a novel methodology to test replicability. We further establish an objective measure of what constitutes a different climate based on Cohen's effect size. We provide a thorough analysis of the performance of our methodology and show that we can improve the performance of a recent state-of-the-art method by 60 %. We further provide an estimate of the ensemble size that is required to prove replicability with confidence. We find that an effect size of d=0.2 can be used as a threshold for statistical indistinguishability. Our analysis, based on the Community Earth System Model 2 (CESM2) Large Ensemble Community Project (LENS2) 100-member ensemble, shows that with 50 members, we can resolve effect sizes of ∼0.3, and with ensembles of 20 members, we can still resolve effect sizes of ∼0.35. We further provide a robust methodology to objectively determine the required ensemble size, depending on the purpose and requirement of the replicability test."

Piglet Glacier, a major tributary of the PIIS, also experienced two deceleration periods between 2023 and 2025. The transitions from acceleration to deceleration and then to near‐steady flow coincided with substantial changes in mélange configuration.

We find that additional cooling was driven by increased continental exposure during long‐term marine regression associated with Pangea's assembly, which boosted global weatherability and increased albedo. Our results highlight that changes in continental exposure are critical for long‐term climate evolution, and that high‐resolution climate models are needed to understand these impacts."

Results show that an increase in vertical diffusivity κ associated with tidal mixing can enhance poleward MHT in most of the global ocean by strengthening the overturning circulations in the North Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Pacific Ocean (located in the Southern Hemisphere), and weakening it in the Southern Ocean. A mathematical fitting reveals that MHT follows a power‐law relationship with κ by a coefficient of about 0.1, that is, MHTpw ∝ κ0.1. This is the first time to quantify the relationship between tidal mixing strength and poleward MHT, shedding light on the influence of tides on global climate change."

While Arctic amplification is well‐established, the presence and drivers of Antarctic amplification remain contentious. Using Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) simulations, we demonstrate a robust emergence of Antarctic amplification under the 2°C goal of the Paris Agreement. Sensitivity experiments identify a pivotal role for sea surface temperature (SST) changes in mediating this anthropogenic response. Positive SST anomalies influence Antarctic temperature through dynamic and thermodynamic processes, exerting distinct and contrasting effects. Dynamic processes, characterized by intensification of the Southern Annular Mode (SAM), generally induce continental‐scale cooling. In contrast, thermodynamic processes, specially through enhanced sensible and latent heat fluxes, take precedence over the dynamic effect and drive widespread warming. In a warming climate, these thermodynamic processes are expected to intensify substantially, thereby amplifying the anthropogenic climate signal over Antarctica."

Mooring observations in the Halmahera Sea during September 2018 through October 2020 show a mean transport of 0.37–0.76 Sv through the Gebe Strait into the Indonesian seas. This estimate, together with mooring measurements in the Makassar Strait, the Maluku Channel, and the Jailolo Strait of the Halmahera Sea, suggests the total mean transport of the Indonesian Throughflow (ITF) to be 16.8 Sv ± 1.0 Sv (1 Sv = 106 m3 s−1), larger than the 15 Sv mean transport previously measured at the exit straits. Mooring data in the Maluku and Halmahera Seas, combined with Lagrangian tracking of the Makassar Strait throughflow using reanalysis velocity, show that 40% of the total ITF transport comes directly from the South Pacific Ocean. The above findings have revised the traditional concept that the ITF comes mainly from the North Pacific.

However, 11.17%–46.42% of active‐layer DOC is retained by mineral permafrost during vertical transport, forming an internal soil carbon sink. The sink selectively retains aromatic compounds, acting as a molecular “filter” that alters DOC composition and bioavailability. This internal retention complicates interpretations of active‐layer DOC transport dynamics and alters the chemistry of both thawed permafrost and exported DOC.

Forecast systems reproduce the tropospheric variability following SSWs found in reanalysis, including an increase of events followed by a poleward‐positioned jet during La Niña winters. Composite analysis reveals that SSWs increase the likelihood of an equatorward‐shifted jet and negative North Atlantic Oscillation compared to non‐SSW members during both ENSO phases, but La Niña masks this response due to their opposing influence on the North Atlantic mean state. This study highlights the importance of accounting for ENSO when predicting SSW impacts on the circulation and surface extremes on subseasonal timescales."

We consider the Asian‐Australian monsoon as a cold air intrusion from the winter hemisphere into the Maritime Continent and quantify the amount and flux of cold air by an isentropic analysis method. This approach enables a systematic assessment of the cold air transport along the monsoon routes and a consistent analysis of cold air intrusions associated with seasonally reversing monsoons. During the East Asian winter monsoon, cold air covers the western Maritime Continent and flows from the South China Sea throughout the Java Sea to the north of the Australian continent with high flux of cold air. Cold air enters the Maritime Continent partly from the southeast of the Philippine Islands and from the Timor Sea. During the Australian winter monsoon, cold air inflows from the Coral Sea through the sea between the Australian continent and New Guinea Island and accumulates in the southern Maritime Continent due to the topographic barriers of the islands. Cold air outflowing through the islands to the Java Sea and the Pacific Ocean induces cross‐equatorial flows. Cold air transport over the Coral Sea in August is approximately 1.7 times higher than that over the South China Sea in January.

The proposed one‐way nesting approach combines non‐uniform vertical grid refinement and a domain vertically embedded within the parent large‐eddy simulation (LES), in addition to the standard constant horizontal grid refinement. The transition and equilibration of flow solutions in sub‐meter nested LES domains are systematically analyzed for idealized forcing conditions across stability regimes, and spanning a broad range of parent/nest grid refinements in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Fine‐scale eddies emerge in the LES domains after a moderate fetch from the predominant inflow boundaries. In general, development fetches are delayed with increasing rx ${r}_{x}$ and distance from the surface, with cases where rx> ${r}_{x}\  > $ 10 exhibiting a more energetic quasi‐equilibrium state. Spatial evolution of resolved turbulence kinetic energy (TKE) and spectra reveal two mechanisms in the transition and equilibration process. An initial development of additional small scales and a slower TKE decrease associated with a reduction in the larger‐scale energy content via forward energy cascade. The specific transition mechanisms are found to be dependent on the rx ${r}_{x}$/rz ${r}_{z}$ ratio and are impacted by atmospheric stability. The proposed scale‐separation parameter, ϕnc ${\phi }_{nc}$, provides qualitative information about the required development fetch by combining the opposing effects of grid refinements and resolved turbulence levels in the parent domain. Larger ϕnc ${\phi }_{nc}$ values lead to an increased fetch, with ϕnc> ${\phi }_{nc}\  > $ 1.5 typically indicating TKE over prediction due to excessive scale separation between parent and nest and/or non‐convergence."

Nevertheless, socio‐economic developments are changing the oceans' biological characteristics, which could impact the magnitude and distribution of oceanic emissions in the future. In this work, we couple a machine learning (ML) framework to the Community Earth System Model (CESM) data of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and estimate the monthly sea surface concentrations of CHBr3 and CH2Br2 between 2015 and 2100, under different climate change scenarios. We use these estimates to run CESM version 2 (CESM2), with comprehensive halogen chemistry, and calculate present‐day global emissions of 269–271 Gg Br and 61–65 Gg Br for CHBr3 and CH2Br2, respectively, based on different scenarios. Furthermore, we project 14%–40% and 8%–23% increases for global mean emissions of CHBr3 and CH2Br2, respectively, by 2100; where more stringent scenarios lead to smaller enhancements. Regionally, there are uncertainties within the magnitudes and signs of the changes that depend on the climate scenarios considered. Nevertheless, the largest enhancements, under all scenarios, were predicted over the western tropical Pacific Ocean, tropical Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean. We attribute these changes primarily to biological parameters rather than physical parameters. These changes project a 0.47–1.13 ppt Br increase from the combined source gases (CHBr3 and CH2Br2) in the upper troposphere by 2100, which could impact the stratospheric ozone budget. Overall, this study highlights the far‐reaching influence of human activities on natural oceanic emissions and atmospheric chemistry."

However, existing estimates are typically derived from direct human activities, while the environmental indirect effects driven by both natural and anthropogenic factors are often overlooked. To date, no studies have explicitly differentiated between the direct and environmental indirect effects of interannual LUC. This omission may bias estimates of LUC‐induced carbon emissions and undermine the effectiveness of carbon reduction policies. Here, we proposed a novel accounting method that employed a process‐based dynamic vegetation model to quantify interannual LUC‐induced carbon fluxes (LUCF) in China from 1990 to 2020, further distinguishing them into direct (LUCF‐d) and environmental indirect fluxes (LUCF‐ind). The results indicate that China's overall LUCF from 1990 to 2020 functioned as a carbon source, with a trend shifting from a source in the 1990s to a sink in the past decade. Over the past 30 years, LUCF‐ind sequestered 1.39 ± 1.05 TgC yr−1, offsetting approximately 25% of the emissions from LUCF‐d. The South and Central regions are the primary areas for the trade‐off between LUCF‐d and LUCF‐ind, with indirect environmental effects reducing direct emissions by 13.3% and 13.7%, respectively. This study aims to enhance the effectiveness of national‐level land use carbon reduction policies by integrating environmental indirect effects and providing methodological references for other countries."

 The nascent polypeptide-associated complex (NAC) is a conserved ribosome-bound factor with essential yet incompletely understood roles in protein biogenesis1. Here, we show that NAC is a multifaceted regulator that coordinates translation elongation, cotranslational folding, and organelle targeting through distinct interactions with nascent polypeptides both inside and outside the ribosome exit tunnel. Using NAC-selective ribosome profiling in C. elegans, we identify thousands of sequence-specific NAC binding events across the nascent proteome, revealing broad cotranslational engagement with hydrophobic and helical motifs in cytosolic, nuclear, ER, and mitochondrial proteins. Unexpectedly, we discover an intra-tunnel sensing mode, where NAC engages ribosomes with extremely short nascent polypeptides inside the exit tunnel in a sequence-specific manner. Moreover, initial NAC interactions induce an early elongation slowdown that tunes ribosome flux and prevent ribosome collisions, linking NAC’s chaperone activity to kinetic control of translation. We propose NAC action protects aggregation-prone intermediates by shielding amphipathic helices, thus promoting cytonuclear folding. NAC also supports mitochondrial membrane protein biogenesis and ER targeting by early recognition of signal sequences and transmembrane domain. Our findings establish NAC as an early-acting, multifaceted orchestrator of cotranslational proteostasis, with distinct mechanisms of action on nascent chains depending on their sequence features and subcellular destinations."

 Distinct ligands for the same G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activate intracellular signaling partners to varying extents, but the molecular mechanisms driving these differences remain elusive. Hypothesizing that such differences in signaling efficacy may be captured structurally in intermediate states under non-equilibrium conditions, we implemented a time-resolved (TR) cryo-EM approach to visualize the GTP-induced activation of the Gαiβγ heterotrimer by the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) bound to three ligands displaying partial, full, or super-agonism on the receptor1. We resolved ensembles of conformational states along the G-protein activation pathway, including a previously unobserved intermediate state that enabled us to visualize receptor dynamics as a function of bound ligand. The results demonstrate ligand-dependent differences in state occupancy and conformational stability, with higher ligand efficacy correlating with increased dynamics of the receptor’s transmembrane (TM) helices 5 and 6. Furthermore, we identify key mechanistic differences in the GTP-induced activation of Gi compared to Gs that likely underlie their distinct activation kinetics. Corroborated by molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and single-molecule fluorescence assays, these findings provide a dynamic structural landscape of GPCR-G-protein interactions for ligands of different efficacy and suggest partial agonists may produce a ‘kinetic trap’ during G-protein activation."

 Warming is pushing Earthʼs system towards unfamiliar climate conditions, complicating predictions. Geological archives of past greenhouse climates provide essential tests for models under extreme forcing. We investigate how precipitation responded to extreme warmth during early Palaeogene global warming events (66–47.8 million years ago)—a period considered a possible analogue for worst-case future scenarios. Here we compile global palaeoclimate data and develop a multi-proxy approach that integrates sedimentary proxies—such as plant fossils, ancient soils and river deposits—providing constraints on global precipitation intermittency (seasonal and interannual variability) and intensity (rainfall rate). The data reveal wet or monsoonal polar regions and aridity punctuated by intense rainfall at mid- and low-latitude continental interiors. This hydroclimate shift occurred 3 million years before and persisted 7 million years after the Palaeocene–Eocene Thermal Maximum—the warmest period of the Cenozoic Era, suggesting that extreme warmth induces nonlinearities in the hydrological cycle’s sensitivity to temperature increase. Polar humidity and mid-latitude aridity further indicate a departure from the expected wet-gets-wetter and dry-gets-drier response. Shifts towards aridity were decoupled from mean annual precipitation and driven by seasonal and interannual precipitation distribution, such as shorter wet-season lengths and longer interannual rainfall recurrence intervals. This highlights the importance of considering precipitation intermittency and intensity, as similar shifts may occur under future warming despite differences in boundary conditions. Mid-latitude precipitation became less frequent but more intense through the early Palaeogene, reflecting a global hydroclimate response to extreme warming, according to a global multi-proxy reconstruction of precipitation characteristics."

 Immune exclusion is associated with adverse prognosis in tumors, and this phenomenon may be facilitated by a physical barrier constituted by the extracellular matrix (ECM). Hypoxia and acidity promote immune exclusion, however the detailed mechanism remains unclear. This study demonstrate that G-protein-coupled-receptor-4 (GPR4), as a proton sensor, induces immune exclusion in colon cancer by promoting collagen fiber alignment and deposition. Specifically, GPR4 facilitates collagen alignment via LOXL2 regulation and enhances collagen I by modulating TGF-β, both mediated by the JAK2/STAT3 pathway. We further validate our findings in a male animal model, observing that elevated GPR4 expression in colon cancer results in an immune-excluded microenvironment. Inhibition of the JAK2/STAT3 pathway and LOXL2 function effectively reverse immune exclusion and enhance immunotherapy efficacy. Collectively, our findings elucidate a mechanism of immune exclusion and propose a potential target for improving the therapeutic efficacy of immunotherapy through the remodeling of the tumor ECM.

 Electronic nematicity, the spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry, has emerged as a key instability in correlated quantum systems. CsTi3Bi5, a kagome metal of the AV3Sb5 (A = K, Rb, Cs) family, hosts rich unconventional electronic phases, yet the origin of its nematicity remains unsettled. Here, we combine polarization-dependent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with functional renormalization group calculations on a fully interacting ab initio model. We reveal an orbital-selective nematic deformation in the low-energy band structure and identify a finite angular momentum (d-wave) Pomeranchuk instability driven by electronic correlations in specific orbital channels and detuning from Van Hove singularities. Our results establish a direct link between orbital selectivity and symmetry-breaking instabilities in CsTi3Bi5, providing a microscopic framework for nematic order in kagome systems.

Here, the authors combine live-cell imaging and single-cell RNA sequencing to reveal a continuum of cell-cycle withdrawal. 
 Quiescence (reversible cell-cycle arrest) and senescence (irreversible arrest) are challenging to distinguish due to a lack of specific biomarkers, yet both arise simultaneously after chemotherapy. While senescence suppresses tumors by limiting proliferation and recruiting the immune system, quiescent cancer cells evade future therapies and may resume proliferation. Here, we pair time-lapse imaging of cell-cycle dynamics with single-cell RNA sequencing after etoposide treatment to differentiate these states, linking heterogeneous cell-cycle phenotypes to the transcriptomic landscape. We identify diverse senescent types (senotypes) and link them to two arrest pathways — a gradual path arising after a standard mitosis-to-G0 transition, and an alternative direct path driven by a mitotic slip. Using pseudotime trajectory analysis, we find that senescent phenotypes begin to manifest early and gradually along the first trajectory, even in shallow quiescent cells. These data support a model wherein, following chemotherapy, quiescence and senescence exist on a continuum of cell-cycle withdrawal at a transcriptome-wide level. Quiescent and senescent cells often arise side by side after stress, yet their molecular relationship remains unclear.

Here authors find that morphine-induced constipation is mediated by a neural circuit from the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus to the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, and subsequently to the small intestine in male mice. 
 Opioid-induced constipation is one of the most common and persistent side effect of opioid analgesics, yet the underlying neural mechanism(s) remain unclear. Here we show morphine-induced constipation is mediated by a neural circuit from glutamatergic neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of hypothalamus (PVNGlu) to acetylcholinergic neurons in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus (DMVAch), and subsequently to the small intestine in mice. Microendoscopic calcium imaging revealed morphine inhibits the PVNGlu→DMVAch→small intestine circuit, and this is accompanied by decreased small intestinal motility. Chemogenetic activation of this circuit, as well as pharmacological inhibition or knockdown of the μ-opioid receptor (MOR) in PVNGlu neurons alleviates morphine-induced constipation. Conversely, artificial inhibition of this circuit mimics morphine-induced constipation in naïve mice. Moreover, we show that morphine suppresses tonic NMDA receptor-mediated currents in DMVAch neurons. These findings reveal a brain-gut circuit underlying opioid-induced constipation and suggest potential therapeutic strategies to mitigate this debilitating side effect. Neural mechanisms mediating opioid-induced constipation are not fully understood.

 Surgical tasks in small tortuous lumens demand interventional instruments with controllable mechanical adaptability. However, current microcatheters lack a non-disruptive, integration-ready strategy for dynamic stiffness tuning—critical for meeting the divergent mechanical demands for compliant steering and stable advancement. Here, we present a microrobotic system based on a helix-shaped magnetic soft microrobot (Helixoft) that compatibly integrates with commercial microcatheters (down to 300 μm in diameter), enabling continuous stiffness tuning (up to 40-fold) and precise steering, both controlled magnetically, free of any other potentially harmful stimuli. Stiffness tuning and active steering are independently controlled via a decoupled control strategy by the helical motion and torque-driven bending of independent microrobot components. This stiffness and structure reconfiguration allow the integrated microcatheter to perform large-angle navigation, precision payload delivery, and localised tissue biopsy without unintended buckling or tissue damage. We validate the system in both ex-vivo oviduct biopsy and in-vivo drug delivery to the fourth-generation bronchi of live pigs.

 Global warming is intensifying compound humid-heat threats, yet long-term risk assessments accounting for urban‒rural disparities remain scarce. In this study, we develop a comprehensive risk assessment framework by integrating the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change risk approach with indicators from the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals related to humid-heat mitigation and adaptation. Applying this framework to China from 2001 to 2020, we find that sustainable development progress substantially reduces vulnerability, particularly in urban areas, leading to a decline in humid-heat risk. In contrast, rural areas show a slower vulnerability reduction compared to urban areas and show no statistically significant change in humid-heat risk, despite a narrowing urban-rural risk gap. Regional disparities in sustainable development are key drivers of risk heterogeneity in both urban and rural settings.

 In organic solar cells (OSCs), which represent a quintessential application system for organic conjugated films, the intrinsic light reflection of these films significantly influences the optical performance of the devices through the Fabry–Pérot micro-cavity effect. However, this phenomenon has not been comprehensively investigated. This study demonstrates that the film’s intrinsic reflection arises from the light-matter interaction, which is mainly governed by the polarizability of delocalized electron cloud and the orientation of the conjugated backbone. Furthermore, the multi-level interference within the OSC micro-cavity leads to a dependence of both the reflection properties and the short-circuit current density (JSC) on the active layer thickness. Based on these insights, a strategy for synergistic optimization of device performance through precise tailoring of optical constants and the micro-cavity structure is proposed. By systematically analyzing the intrinsic reflection behavior of organic conjugated films, this study enhances the understanding of the role reflection plays in the performance of photovoltaic devices and provides theoretical support for further optical optimization of organic photovoltaics.

 Many political jurisdictions have embraced climate policy strategies that emphasize large subsidies to deploy green technologies (‘carrots’) with the anticipation that more punitive policies (‘sticks’) may follow. However, little is known about how such policy sequencing affects future policies, emission reductions and costs. Using a multisector model for the USA, we examine carrot-first policies which mimic the increasingly popular interest in industrial policy and offer a way to model these real-world policy choices in energy-system models. We find that a carrot-first policy strategy still requires later use of similar-sized sticks when compared with a policy strategy that begins with sticks and achieves the same levels of long-term decarbonization. Policy carrots alone do not dramatically reduce future emissions. Only with policy sticks are there unambiguous signals to substantially shrink the size of incumbent fossil fuel industries.

 Higher temperatures are expected to impact globally on poverty and inequality, yet little cross-country analysis exists to quantify the effects. Here we analyse a panel dataset of subnational poverty in 130 countries covering the past decade and find that a 1 °C increase in temperature causes headcount poverty increases of 0.63–1.18 percentage points, using the daily poverty lines of US$2.15 (corresponding to 8.3% and 15.6% increases), and increases in the Gini inequality index of 1.3–1.9%. These poverty estimates equal a projected increase of global poor by 62.3–98.7 million people by 2030 compared with a scenario without climate change. Poorer countries—particularly those in Sub-Saharan Africa—are more vulnerable, as are countries with higher agriculture shares in the economy. Estimates at the subnational level are larger than those using the country-level data, indicating that aggregated analysis may underestimate climate change risks.

 Nanoporous carbon-based materials with precise molecular discrimination and scalable processability hold great promise for next-generation sustainable membranes in organic solvent nanofiltration, which is an energy-efficient alternative to traditional separation methods. However, simultaneously achieving both high selectivity and ultrafast solvent permeance remains substantially challenging due to difficulties in fabricating long-range ordered films and engineering microstructures with molecular-level precision.

Benefitting from the ordered one-dimensional through-channels bridged by rigid diacetylenic linkages, TPC–CPF membranes achieve precise molecular sieving with unprecedented permeance, surpassing state-of-the-art organic solvent nanofiltration membranes and exceeding commercial counterparts by two to three orders of magnitude at comparable molecular weight cutoffs. With robust mechanical, chemical and thermal stabilities under harsh solvents and high temperatures, TPC–CPF membranes enable more than 99% long-term recovery and reuse of homogeneous noble-metal catalysts under industrial conditions. Moreover, the pore-size tunability of TPC–CPF membranes facilitates efficient continuous and cascade separation of complex pharmaceutical mixtures, delivering 14–32 times higher separation efficiencies than commercial membranes.

 Single-atom catalysts (SACs) with high metal use and catalytic activity have been widely used in energy and biomedicine. However, the mass production of stable and homogeneous SACs still faces major challenges. Here we report a generalizable strategy for producing highly stable, low-cost SACs in a scalable and sustainable way. After screening 19,196 possible atom-active structures on the surface of NiTi substrate by combining quantum chemistry with machine learning, we synthesized 22 SACs in an area coverage up to 200 cm2 per preparation within 1 hour. The bimetallic CoV and PtCu SACs exhibit the highest biocatalytic activity, which is superior to that of natural enzymes and remains stable after 4 years. Moreover, these single-atom embedded NiTi vascular stents allow for the removal of excessive nitrides and oxides by continuous multi-enzyme catalysis, protecting them from vascular injury, with the corresponding vessel size being three times larger than that of the bare NiTi stent after 3 months of implantation, close to healthy vessels. This single-atom manufacturing strategy could be extended to other biomedical devices with high sustainability and bioactivity.

 The relative contributions of global cooling and tectonic forcing to the reorganization of the South Asian monsoon during the critical Late Miocene remain poorly constrained. By analyzing sedimentological and geochemical proxies from the Tanakpur-Sukhidang section in the Himalayan foreland basin, we reconstruct paleoclimatic conditions to infer South Asian monsoon variability during this period. The enrichment of LREEs, a flat HREEs pattern and a negative Eu anomaly, along with elemental ratios of La/Sc and Th/Co, suggest a persistent felsic source derived from the Himalaya since ~12 Ma. Clay mineral variations, particularly the shift in smectite content and smectite/(illite + chlorite) ratio, together with geochemical weathering indicators (CIA, WIP and Rb/Sr), document a relative increase in chemical weathering around 8 Ma. These mineralogical and geochemical transformations are synchronous with widespread indicators of South Asian monsoon weakening linked with change in exhumation rate of the Himalayan-Tibetan Plateau and Late Miocene global cooling. Where reduced physical erosion and enhanced sediment-water interaction under cooler and more seasonal conditions amplified chemical weathering feedbacks. Together, these processes reorganized regional hydrology and monsoon dynamics, underscoring the coupled influence of tectonics and global climate forcing in driving the Late Miocene weakening of the South Asian monsoon. However, the relative influence of climate versus tectonics still remains inherently very complex and higher resolution provenance data, thermochronology and climate model simulations will be crucial for fully understanding the mechanisms underlying the Late Miocene Change."

 Soil extracellular enzymes are critical drivers of carbon (C) and nutrient cycling in terrestrial ecosystems. However, the effects of phosphorus (P) additions on soil enzyme activities and stoichiometries, particularly under varying nitrogen (N) addition regimes worldwide, are not well comprehended. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis based on 155 field studies across various ecosystems (forests, croplands and grasslands), which shows that P enrichment conditions enhances C-acquiring enzymes but has no effect on the enzymatic C:N ratio. P addition alone reduces P-acquiring enzymes by 14% without affecting N-acquiring enzymes. In contrast, P combined with N addition boosts N-acquiring enzymes by 21% while leaving P-acquiring enzymes unchanged. Notably, the combined effect of P and N addition on microbial C limitation (assessed via vector length) and enzymatic stoichiometries is less pronounced than that of P addition alone. Key drivers of these responses include mean annual precipitation, soil microbial biomass, and its stoichiometries. These results suggest that N addition mitigates the stoichiometric imbalance and microbial C limitation induced by P addition, potentially promoting soil organic C accumulation. Our findings emphasize the critical need to account for such interactive effects in models predicting soil biogeochemical cycles under future changes in global exogenous N and P inputs. Phosphorus addition alone reduces phosphorus-acquiring enzyme activities by 14%, while phosphorus combined with nitrogen addition boosts nitrogen-acquiring enzyme activities by 21%, according to a meta-analysis based on 155 field studies across various ecosystems."

 Timeframe is a critical factor in understanding the impact of climate change on the evolution of microbial community structure and ecological memory. Here, we demonstrate how bacterial functions have left lasting imprints through their inherent gene-regulatory network traits under alternating wet and dry climatic conditions over loess-paleosol geological time scales. In the drier loess soil, Gammaproteobacteria possess symbiotic nitrogen-fixing genes that promote microbial structural and functional succession over the ten-thousand-year scale and support a nitrogen fixation-comammox-nitrate reduction cycle and nitrogen memory, according to analysis of samples in Luochuan, China. The unique and extreme conditions of the paleoclimate environment can be reflected in the microbial community composition. Nitrogen deficiency in drier loess soil has facilitated shifts in bacterial phyla community composition, driving the evolutionary functional pathways and strong legacy effects. Our findings highlighting the crucial role of specific traits of Gammaproteobacteria as driving forces for stabilizing microbial systems in arid soils.

 Denitrification, a major source of gaseous nitrogen emissions from agricultural soils, is influenced by management. Practices promoting belowground diversity are suggested to support sustainable agriculture, but how they modulate nitrogen losses via denitrification remains inconclusive. Here we sampled 106 cereal fields spanning a 3000 km North-South gradient across Europe and compiled 56 associated climatic, soil, microbial and management variables. We show that increased denitrification potential was associated with higher proportion of time with crop cover over the last ten years and was best predicted by microbial biomass and microbial functional guilds involved in nitrogen cycling, in particular denitrification. We also demonstrate that several diversification practices affect the variation in denitrification potential predictors, suggesting a trade-off between agricultural diversification and nitrogen losses via denitrification. However, increased crop diversity in rotations improved yield-scaled denitrification, highlighting the potential of this practice to minimize nitrogen losses while contributing to sustainable food production. Increased crop diversity in rotations reduces nitrogen losses relative to crop yield, making it an effective practice for sustainable farming, based on an analysis of 106 cereal fields across Europe and 56 climatic, soil, microbial, and management variables."

 The downward transport of organic particles produced by marine organisms is a key control on the ocean’s carbon storage. Measurements of particle attenuation through the water column have historically been used to infer the sequestration potential of the biological carbon pump. While often modelled using a simple power-law fit, this simplification may obscure important depth-dependent processes. Using data from biogeochemical-Argo floats in the Southern Ocean, here we show that splitting the water column into two distinct regimes captures depth-dependent variability in particle attenuation more effectively. Compared to the simple power-law fit the model reveals greater attenuation just below the productive layer, reducing particulate organic carbon flux into the mesopelagic (200 – 400 m) by 40 – 60%. Our findings suggest a more mechanistic representation of particle attenuation is needed to improve estimates of carbon transport and to reduce uncertainties in ocean-climate feedbacks and future climate projections.

 Triggering mechanisms are a fundamental aspect of landslide studies, as they directly influence both the characteristics of landslides and the environments in which they occur. Identifying the triggers of landslides is particularly important for understanding the morphological evolution of solid planetary surfaces in the Solar System. Ceres, the largest celestial object in the main asteroid belt, is rich in impact craters and exhibits numerous landslides. Published catalogues and available data on these surface features provide a unique opportunity to study the interactions between meteoroid impacts and mass movements. By analyzing the morphometric characteristics and absolute dating of eight landslides and their related impact craters, we have identified an evident cause-and-effect relationship between impact events and the initiation of landslides on Ceres. Evidence suggests that meteoroid impacts on Ceres can trigger landslides, according to morphometric and absolute dating analysis of landslides and impact craters."

 Tropical Indian Ocean warming has intensified under greenhouse forcing, yet its influence on North American terrestrial and agricultural productivity remains poorly understood. Here we show that summer tropical Indian Ocean warming is linked to widespread drying and reduced gross primary productivity across North America. Observations and model simulations reveal that tropical Indian Ocean-induced atmospheric heating excites stationary Rossby wave trains, which establish a high-pressure ridge over western North America and suppresses moisture transport into the continent. This leads to reduced precipitation and soil moisture, leading to 10-20% reductions in terrestrial productivity and crop yields. The relationship persists after excluding El Niño–Southern Oscillation years and is reproduced in multiple climate models, showing robust teleconnection processes. These results highlight a previously underappreciated pathway through which tropical Indian Ocean warming can weaken the North American land carbon sink under future climate change. Warming in the tropical Indian Ocean triggers stationary Rossby waves that create a high-pressure ridge over western North America, cutting off moisture transport and reducing precipitation, soil moisture, and crop yields, based on observational datasets, reanalysis products, and climate models."

 The Holocene temperature conundrum limits our understanding of the past climate-environment-human interaction. Here we reconstructed Holocene winter and growing-season temperatures based on the Pediastrum body size and assemblage from lakes in mid-latitude Asia. Winter temperatures exhibited a warm early Holocene in northeastern China, aligning with growing-season temperature, whereas the Altai Mountains experienced continuous warming trend during the Holocene. The temperature difference was supported by other seasonal/annual temperature records, which indicated that there was spatial heterogeneity rather than seasonal bias in Holocene temperature conundrum. Ice sheets were the main drivers of cold early Holocene, while the latent-heat transport driven by the monsoon contributed to the divergence of Holocene temperature evolution in northeastern China. Our results demonstrate that spatial heterogeneity is a major cause of the Holocene temperature conundrum, linked to the heat redistribution within the Earth system, highlighting the critical role of ocean-atmosphere interactions in shaping spatial patterns of Holocene temperature.

Using zebrafish (Danio rerio) as a model, we systematically evaluated the neurodevelopmental, behavioral, and molecular effects of 6PPD at environmentally relevant (5 μg/L) and sublethal (300 μg/L) concentrations. 6PPD exposure caused developmental abnormalities, including microphthalmia, exophthalmos, cardiac malformations, and hypopigmentation. Notably, benchmark dose (BMD) modeling identified the eye as a sensitive target, with microphthalmia likely impairing retinal development, photoreception, and circadian regulation. 6PPD increased neuronal apoptosis; impaired central nervous system and lateral line development; and, at high doses, reduced vitality, rhythmicity, and responsiveness. Corticotropin-releasing hormone receptor 1 (CRHR1), a synaptic receptor enhancing glutamatergic and suppressing GABAergic signaling, was identified as a potential target mediating neuronal hyperexcitability and hyperactivity at low doses. Consistently, behavioral tests confirmed a biphasic hormetic response: hyperactivity at low doses and hypoactivity at high doses. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis, immunohistochemical staining, and xenograft tumor assays revealed a close association between 6PPD exposure and gliomagenesis, suggesting its potential risk of inducing glioma. Overall, these findings provide the first integrated phenotypic, behavioral, and molecular evidence of 6PPD-induced neurotoxicity and highlight CRHR1-mediated hormetic responses as critical considerations for risk assessment."

Gore;April Z. Gu,Discovering Polyphosphate and Polyhydroxyalkanoate-Accumulating Organisms Across Ecosystems: Phenotype-Targeted Genotyping via FACS-Sequencing,"Intracellular biopolymers serve versatile functions, allowing microbes to adapt to fluctuating environmental conditions. The metabolic interdependence of dual biopolymers polyphosphate (polyP) and polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) is a defining feature of polyphosphate-accumulating organisms (PAOs), the key agents enabling enhanced biological phosphorus removal (EBPR). Beyond EBPR, PAOs accumulating both polyP and PHA (PHA–PAOs) in natural environments remain unexplored due to limited detection tools, despite hypothesized roles in nutrient cycling. This study presents a novel phenotype-targeted approach integrating triple-stained fluorescence-activated cell sorting with 16S rRNA gene sequencing (TriFlow-Seq) to detect, quantify, and phylogenetically characterize PHA–PAOs, validated by fluorescence imaging and single-cell Raman spectroscopy. TriFlow-Seq of EBPR samples confirmed known PAOs, including Candidatus Phosphoribacter, Tetrasphaera, and Ca. Accumulibacter, and revealed new candidate PHA–PAOs within the Rhodobacteraceae family. In maize rhizosphere, TriFlow-Seq led to the discovery of diverse PHA–PAOs, Pseudomonas, Halomonas, and Nannocystis. These genera participate in plant-growth-promoting functions including phosphate solubilization and phytohormone production, yet their simultaneous polyP and PHA accumulation has never been reported. Our findings revealed high PHA–PAO prevalence and distinct phylogenetic patterns associated with different maize genotypes, suggesting an overlooked role of biopolymer costorage in rhizosphere dynamics. This study establishes a pioneering approach to investigating PHA–PAO identities and roles across ecosystems."

Wong;Lauren Zink;Tomas Brodin,Are Behavioral Ecotoxicity Endpoints Relevant at the Population Level? Evidence-Based Insights for Environmental Protection,"A substantial body of evidence exists demonstrating that exposure to environmental contaminants can alter animal behavior. Moreover, methodological and technological advancements, as well as increasing standardization, mean that behavioral ecotoxicity studies are more rigorous and reliable than ever before. Despite this, behavioral data are still seldom used in the risk assessment and regulation of chemicals. This is partly due to a lack of clarity among some stakeholders about whether changes in behavior at the individual level result in population-level outcomes. To address this, we first consider the state of evidence within the field of behavioral ecotoxicology linking individual-level behavioral alterations with population-level consequences. We then assess the evidence from behavioral ecology and other neighboring fields that supports this link. Further, we evaluate whether some behavioral endpoints are more easily tied to population-level changes than others. In this regard, we propose combining insights from two complementary ecological frameworks─the functional trait framework and the limiting traits framework─to evaluate which behaviors should be prioritized in ecotoxicological research and regulatory efforts. We contend that the link between behavioral changes and population-level outcomes is evident, with behavioral endpoints representing a highly valuable yet so far underutilized line of evidence in applied environmental protection."

We examined potential FPV interactions with avian biodiversity, using previously modeled technical potential of FPV in the northeastern United States. We developed a vulnerability index based on avian species’: (i) morphological traits, (ii) level of conservation concern, and (iii) habitat requirements. Using eBird participatory science data, we assessed the risk of FPV to 291 species of birds occurring at FPV-suitable waterbodies based on their vulnerability index and estimated relative abundance at each location. The greatest risk of FPVs to birds was associated with waterbodies near the Atlantic coast and Great Lakes, and most (80%) of these high-risk waterbodies were smaller waterbodies. Because the avian risk at FPV-suitable waterbodies was not correlated with estimated energy generation, reducing risk to birds might not require energy trade-offs. Moreover, avoiding FPV installations at waterbodies predicted to pose high risk to birds is likely to return social and recreational benefits while minimizing risk of biofouling. Our analysis provides a framework for proactively evaluating risk, reducing potential adverse impacts of FPV to birds, and identifying cobenefits of sustainable FPV siting across waterscapes."

Conjugated nitrogen species (e.g., graphitic, pyridinic Ns) are well-known for enhancing the catalytic activity of carbon materials. However, the mechanistic role of nonconjugated nitrogen species (e.g., amine, amide) in persulfate activation remains unexplored due to their thermal instability during pyrolysis. In this study, we synthesized three-dimensional nitrogen-doped graphene aerogels (NGAs) enriched with nonconjugated nitrogen via hydrothermal assembly and systematically compared them with their pyrolytic counterparts. Hydrothermal NGAs exhibit abundant edge-located nonconjugated nitrogen species, which enhance surface hydrophilicity and accelerate mass transport to promote efficient nonradical activation of peroxydisulfate (PDS) through outer-sphere electron-transfer process (ETP). Upon pyrolysis, these nonconjugated functionalities are transformed into conjugated nitrogen embedded within the carbon lattice, improving conductivity and creating electron-rich domains that favor peroxymonosulfate (PMS) activation via inner-sphere ETP. Techno-environmental-economic assessment further demonstrated that the hydrothermal NGA/PDS system is significantly more cost-effective, requiring one-eighth the synthesis energy and only one-third the oxidant cost of PMS-based systems. This work highlights the underappreciated role of nonconjugated nitrogen in PS-AOPs and offers new insights to carbon catalysts for wastewater treatment."

Phage replication requires maintaining infectivity and finding the right host. Yet, there are limited data on phage persistence and transport in soil under field conditions. The potential presence of hosts enabling phage replication impedes the assessment of the mobility of autochthonous phages in soils. In lysimeters installed in forest and pasture topsoil, we elucidated the transport of the tailed marine Pseudoalteromonas phage HS2 in comparison to deuterium. Transport of infectious phages as well as numbers of tracer phage genomes and tracer capsid-bound genomes were quantified to account for phage retention and inactivation. Phages were transported up to 4 times faster than the simultaneously applied deuterium tracer, which was attributed to pore size exclusion. Retention in immobile regions and remobilization during precipitation caused pronounced tailing in tracer breakthroughs. High phage survival in pasture soil resulted in mass recoveries of infectious phages that were up to 6 times higher than those in forest soil. However, long-term observations showed that the infectivity was also preserved in forest soil, enabling event-driven remobilization. This remobilization underscores the importance of distinguishing between phage retention and inactivation, which is crucial for accurately predicting phage transport dynamics and their ecological impact in terrestrial environments."

Here, authors present a machine learning framework that resolves this mismatch, enabling the rational design of durable and stretchable zinc-ion batteries. 
 Aqueous zinc-ion batteries offer inherent safety and low cost, yet performance is limited by unstable zinc metal negative electrodes and dissolution-prone positive electrodes, causing dendrite growth, sluggish ion transport, and rapid capacity decay. Replacing both electrodes with intercalation hosts provides a solution, but progress is slowed by the lack of a universal principle for selecting kinetically compatible pairs. Most existing efforts optimize single components rather than addressing the electrodes’ kinetic mismatch governing full-cell stability. Here we show a machine-learning-assisted kinetic-matching framework that quantitatively evaluates ion-transport compatibility in intercalation-type zinc-ion batteries electrodes. By correlating interlayer spacing with Zn2+ diffusion behavior, the model introduces two descriptors predicting synchronized ion flux for rational electrode pairing. Using this framework, an optimized Zn3V3O8 | |NH4V4O10 system achieves a specific capacity of 310 mAh g-1 and retains over 12,000 cycles at 5 A g-1. The strategy further extends to deformable formats through conductive hydrogel architectures, enabling omnidirectionally stretchable, all-hydrogel zinc-ion batteries with an areal capacity of 1.2 mAh cm-2 and an energy density of 1070 μWh cm-2. These results provide a quantitative design route for next-generation zinc-ion batteries. Aqueous zinc-ion batteries are safe and affordable but limited by incompatible electrode kinetics.

 Oral antibiotics are a mainstay for treating bacterial infections, but unabsorbed portions can reach the caecum and colon, leading to gut dysbiosis. Herein, we engineer a biohybrid delivery system through the integration of milk extracellular vesicles with liposomes. The hybrid vesicles employ targeting mechanisms via neonatal Fc receptor and peptide transporter 1, facilitating antibiotic transport across the proximal small intestine. These vesicles exhibit superior drug encapsulation efficiency, stable release behavior, efficient mucus traversal, higher endocytosis, increased basolateral exocytosis, and improved oral absorption, achieving a 3.24-fold increase in oral bioavailability compared to free antibiotics. In lung bacterial infections and bacteremia models, hybrid vesicle-encapsulated cefdinir outperforms free antibiotics in eliminating infections. Notably, this approach also mitigates adverse effects on the intestinal microbiota, safeguarding the animals from dysbiosis-associated metabolic syndromes and opportunistic pathogen infections. This innovative hybrid vesicle system holds promise for the oral delivery of other drugs that suffer from limited absorption or cause gut dysbiosis. In this work, authors present a biohybrid delivery system aimed at overcoming low oral bioavailability and antibiotic-induced dysbiosis by enabling efficient antibiotic transport in the proximal small intestine."

Here, the authors achieve a high piezoionic flex-sensitivity by tuning hydrogel-ion interactions, and decoupling of multi-degree-of-freedom bending via a square prism-shaped fiber structure. 
 Accurate body motion capture is of great significance for biomechanical assessment and immersive virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) systems. Piezoionic flex-sensors, which mimic the ionic transport sensing mechanism of cutaneous mechanoreceptors, promises a self-powered approach for wearable body movements detection. However, their practical utility has been limited by low piezoionic flex-sensitivity (typically below 0.5 mV/degree) and unidirectional bending response, which restricts their ability to resolve complex multi-degree-of-freedom (multi-Dof) body motions. Here we report a soft, piezoionic and multi-Dof (SPIM) flex-sensor that overcomes these limitations. It ingeniously integrates zwitterionic dipole-ion interactions and size-induced steric hindrance effects to enable fast ion channels formation and amplified cation/anion transport imbalance, thus cooperatively contributing to a record-high piezoionic flex-sensitivity of 3.2 mV/degree. Theoretical simulations combining poroelastic mechanics and Poisson-Nernst-Planck model corroborated the synergistic enhancement. Furthermore, a unique architecture of square prism-shaped fiber with two pairs of symmetric nanomesh electrodes allows the SPIM flex-sensor to decouple multi-Dof joint flexion to distinguish complex body movements. We demonstrate a SPIM flex-sensor platform for metaverse applications, including a digital-twin of free-pose hand motions and complex yet intuitive VR control via single-joint dexterity equipped with a single compact sensor device.

 α-Synuclein (α-syn) fibrils accumulate in Parkinson’s disease, spreading between cells to template misfolding and drive neurodegeneration. α-Syn fibril entry into healthy neurons is a key step. Here, we comprehensively assessed the membrane proteome for α-syn fibril binding. We identified mGluR4 and NPDC1 as nigral surface proteins binding and internalizing α-syn fibrils. While striatal α-syn fibril injection led to nigral dopamine neuron loss in wild type mice, deletion of either Grm4 or Npdc1 provided protection of dopamine neurons. We observed mGluR4 and Npdc1 to form a complex regulating mGluR4 function. Cultured neurons lacking both Grm4 and Npdc1 fail to bind α-syn fibrils, to accumulate phosphorylated α-syn and to lose synapses. Transheterozygous Grm4, Npdc1 mice showed protection of nigral neurons from α-syn fibrils, demonstrating genetic interaction. For transgenic α-syn A53T mice, double Grm4, Npdc1 heterozygosity increased mouse survival, motor function and spinal motoneuron number. Thus, a cell surface mGluR4–NPDC1 complex participates in α-syn neurodegeneration. How α-synuclein interacts with the neuronal cell surface to contribute to disease pathology is not fully understood.

Here the authors show that calcium channel blocker use increases AAD risk, worsens disease progression in models and patients, and may impair post-repair outcomes, warranting caution in at-risk hypertension. 
 Aortic aneurysm and dissection (AAD) are life-threatening conditions without effective medications. Impaired contractility of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) is strongly linked to AAD, but the role of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), which directly inhibits VSMC contractility, in AAD remains unclear. Here we showed data from 501,878 initially AAD-free participants in UK Biobank. Over a median follow-up of 13.5 years, CCB users had higher AAD risk (HR = 1.31) than hypertensive patients not receiving antihypertensive treatment. In mouse models of AAD, CCBs significantly aggravated aortic stiffness and AAD development. For patients with type B aortic dissection who underwent endovascular repair, CCBs limited AAD regression compared with other antihypertensives. Moreover, silencing of protein kinase cGMP-dependent 1 (PRKG1) significantly mitigated CCB-aggravated AAD progression. These findings suggest that CCBs may increase AAD risk and post-stent surgery prognosis, highlighting the need for caution when prescribing CCBs to hypertensive patients at risk for AAD.

The effect could provide an experimental diagnostic for identifying the IVC state. 
 Electron transport driven by the phase coherence and interference of quantum many-body wavefunctions is a fascinating phenomenon with potential technological significance. Superconductivity, for example, enables dissipationless transport through macroscopic phase twisting, while charge-density waves show broadband noise and AC-DC interference once their phase is depinned. We identify an analogous phase-coherent dynamics in the intervalley-coherent (IVC) state frequently observed in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. We show that a static magnetic field drives an oscillating intervalley current, which produces an oscillating orbital magnetization and thereby a detectable AC Hall response. This mechanism is similar to the Josephson effect observed in superconductors but now happening in momentum space. In this analogy, the static magnetic field acts as the DC voltage, while the oscillating intervalley current is the AC Josephson current. We provide microscopic calculations of all the phase-number free-energy parameters in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, establishing this effect as an experimental signature of IVC order.

Here, the authors report polymer particles that change shape with polarised light, and therefore create flow patterns with unusual paths. 
 Colloidal particles at liquid interfaces experience long-ranged capillary interactions, whose magnitude and directionality depend on the particle shapes. When particle shapes are determined by fabrication or synthesis, the resulting shape-mediated interactions are predefined and often lead to the formation of persistent interfacial structures. Here, we introduce polymer particles at water-air interfaces whose shape and, therefore, interactions can be altered by illumination with polarized light. Specifically, we selectively trigger capillary self-assembly by anisotropically deforming the particles at the interface. Intriguingly, further deformation of already assembled particles induces sustained interfacial flows with velocities of up to 90 μm/s. Benefitting from polarization-defined deformation directions, we create flow-patterns that do not simply follow the illumination intensity pattern, such as shear flows along a single rectangular illumination stripe. We anticipate that this interplay between photo-deformation and capillary interactions of particles will enable various forms of mixing, manipulation, and assembly of soft matter at liquid interfaces.

In Australia’s Macquarie basin, environmentally minded management can ensure agricultural needs are met without sacrificing environmental outcomes. 
 Freshwater resources need to simultaneously support environmental and agricultural outcomes; this is a critical challenge under climate change. Many environmental and agricultural outcomes have contrasting requirements for water, leading to difficult trade-offs which should be supported by integrated assessments. Here we analysed the effect of climate change and climate variability on key ecological values and agricultural economic activity simultaneously in the Macquarie catchment in Australia and assessed the effect of plausible management adaptation options. Under severe climate change, ecological outcomes were rarely met while the impact on agricultural outcomes was less severe; annual cropping reliant on insecure water allocations was most vulnerable. Under moderate climate change, altering flow delivery patterns was as effective as altering the total licence volume of environmental water. Neither change adversely affected agricultural benefits. Thus, environmental water management can potentially influence environmental outcomes, while continuing to meet the needs of core agricultural activities.

 Accurate tree volume and structure are crucial for forest biomass estimation and ecosystem investigations. While terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) offers non-destructive pathways for the detailed three-dimensional tree reconstruction, current methods overestimate small branch volumes and often require tree segmentation and leaf–wood separation as a priori. This study introduces and validates RayExtract, a novel method for reconstructing woody volume from TLS data, utilising tools from the RayCloudTools library, to automate the extraction of tree structural metrics from point clouds. Our method incorporates two key morphological rules — Self-Similarity and Leonardo’s Rule — to aid branch radius and taper calculations. Likewise, it enables rapid and automated plot-scale reconstruction by integrating tree segmentation and woody structure modelling without requiring leaf point classification. In this study, RayExtract demonstrated high accuracy across four high-quality destructive harvest reference sets with concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) values ranging from 0.82 to 0.97 (n=124). To explore algorithm behaviours under different leaf conditions and point densities, we implement a framework using TLS simulation of highly realistic synthetic trees. Results from the simulation framework show consistent high accuracy of total woody volume, with CCC ranging from 0.97 to 0.98 (n=18) across four distinct scanning configurations. Fine-scale volumetric analysis revealed that incorporating simple morphological rules can effectively inform branch taper and reduce woody volume overestimation, particularly in smaller components. Furthermore, it identifies a limitation in volumetric accuracy in trees exhibiting significant taper in the lower stem. Analysis of RayExtract’s computational efficiency demonstrates that runtime and memory usage scale predictably with input data size, primarily driven by point count and the associated structural complexity within the point cloud, positioning the algorithm as well suited for large-scale applications. RayExtract represents a significant advancement in forest reconstruction, biomass estimation, and vegetation structural analysis. The method’s efficiency, accuracy, and robustness across varied forest conditions mark a substantial improvement in forest structural assessment techniques using laser scanning and have broad implications for improving regional biomass estimations, and contributing to the calibration and validation of broad-scale remote sensing observations."

 The long-term over-extraction of groundwater in the North China Plain (NCP) has resulted in permanent loss of groundwater storage, leading to geo-disasters, including surface subsidence, ground fissures, and seawater intrusion. Through integrating wide-area InSAR survey data with a mechanical model, this study reveals the detailed spatiotemporal dynamics of aquifer system deformation and groundwater storage loss (GWSL) across the entire plain. We used a Sentinel-1 A SAR dataset from 2017 to 2023, covering two ascending orbits (T40 and T142) with eight frames, along with time-series InSAR technology and a wide-area multi-track network adjustment model that incorporates spatial constraints. This allowed us to obtain seamless, millimeter-level accuracy time-series deformation sequences for the NCP. Three severe subsidence areas were identified, with the maximum vertical velocity exceeding −150 mm/year and the cumulative subsidence reaching up to 1 m. Thereafter, the time-series InSAR results and groundwater level data were modeled using cross-wavelet analysis to quantify the elastic recovery capacity of the Quaternary aquifer system in the NCP (with the elastic skeletal storage coefficient ₖₑSₖₑ ranging from 0.0002 to 0.021). This revealed significant differences in the aquifer response between the piedmont plain (mostly elastic deformation) and the flood plain (mostly plastic deformation). There was no elastic recovery in the subsidence funnel areas of the flood plain. Subsequently, InSAR observations were integrated with the volume strain model (InSAR-VSM) to construct a novel groundwater loss inversion model, yielding the first 2-km resolution dataset of GWSL for the NCP. The average annual groundwater loss from 2017 to 2023 was estimated to be −4.346 × 108 to −8.692 × 108 m3/yr. Finally, we systematically investigated the spatiotemporal variation patterns of land subsidence over the past 63 years in the NCP, under the combined influence of human activities (such as over-extraction of groundwater, the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWDP), and policies prohibiting groundwater extraction) and natural factors (such as extreme rainfall events and geological structures). The deformation shows a spatial migration characteristic from urban areas to agricultural land, with different deformation trends in the NCP. While urban deformation has stopped or reversed, agricultural areas continue to experience intensifying subsidence. This study characterizes the stress evolution features of the aquifer system at an ultra-high spatial resolution, providing crucial scientific support for adaptive groundwater management and the development of subsidence mitigation strategies in water-scarce sedimentary basins."

 In the era of embodied intelligence, wearable datasets for pedestrian navigation are essential. However, publicly available multisensory datasets tailored to such scenarios remain scarce. Traditional sensors such as RGB cameras and LiDAR often struggle to capture the fast and irregular dynamics of human motion. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale pedestrian-wearable dataset primarily recorded using event cameras. The dataset includes event camera, RGB cameras, LiDAR sensors, a tactical-grade IMU, and GNSS, covering a wide range of indoor and outdoor environments with diverse motion types and illumination conditions. High-precision ground truth is obtained using motion capture systems indoors and GNSS/IMU integration with bidirectional smoothing outdoors. The dataset is structured into 23 subsets categorized by motion dynamics and lighting, supporting the development and evaluation of robust localization and SLAM algorithms. Benchmarking with state-of-the-art frameworks reveals notable performance degradation under highly dynamic or low-light conditions, highlighting the dataset’s value for advancing pedestrian navigation and event-based perception.

 Climate conditions such as the dynamics of temperature and precipitation significantly influence agricultural production. Therefore, the climate-induced agricultural economic consequences cannot be neglected. This study employs machine learning models with time series climate data, a panel of state-by-year total factor productivity estimates (1960–2004) for 48 contiguous states of the United States (U.S.), and the yield data for corn and soybean (1960–2020) in the main producing states to quantify the potential climatic effects on U.S. agricultural productivity under different climate scenarios.

The negative climatic effects on productivity growth will offset the advancements of U.S. agricultural productivity after 5–25 years under various climate change scenarios assuming the same advancement rates as the past. The predictions of the impacts could advance our understanding of future productivity growth in U.S. agriculture under climate change. The analysis results could also shed light on policy planning to mitigate various effects and threats to food security due to the changing climate."

 For routine road maintenance, accurate and efficient crack detection holds significant research value and practical importance. With advances in computer vision, image processing-based crack detection has achieved promising results. However, in complex environments, factors such as illumination and weather introduce noise interference, especially in high-resolution crack images where fine fracture features show heightened complexity and diversity. This often leads to degraded detection accuracy in such challenging scenarios. To address this, we propose FE-SegNeXt, a convolutional neural network segmentation framework tailored for high-resolution crack detection in complex environments. The algorithm leverages distinct characteristics of high- and low-frequency features in crack images: average pooling separates these features, while a dedicated Frequency Collaborative Enhancement Module (FCEM) independently enhances high- and low-frequency components before fusing multi-band information. This design significantly improves the model’s ability to extract subtle cracks from high-resolution images under noisy conditions. Additionally, we introduce a Locally Enhanced Feed-Forward Network (LE-FFN) to amplify perception of weak crack signals in local regions, further refining fine-grained feature extraction. Experimental results on the public datasets Sun520, Rain365, and BJN260 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves F1-scores of 61.55%, 62.57%, and 60.31%, respectively, outperforming existing crack detection algorithms."

 Urban streets form the backbone of cities, and variations in street-junction spatial configuration provide valuable insights into urban form and function, both of which exhibit fractal and scaling characteristics in their structural and statistical properties. However, these patterns emerge from the interaction of multiple spatial processes operating at different scales, making it difficult to capture and compare their form-function relationships using single-scale analyses. To address this challenge, this study proposes a new α–β framework for multi-scale urban form comparison, grounded in fractal theory. Using a progressive clustering method, we construct scaling profiles for multiple cities, deriving the α (form) and β (function) parameters to systematically compare urban structures with differing morphologies and to identify urban clusters at their characteristic scales. This approach transforms the subjective perception of morphology into an actionable analytical tool, enabling integrated form-function assessment and overcoming the challenges of comparative studies from different urban systems. Overall, the proposed α–β framework effectively deconstructs urban complexity, as evidenced by its application to a comparative analysis of nine global metropolises."

 Global digital elevation models (DEMs) play a crucial role in modern scientific research and human activities. However, acquiring comprehensive elevation data at global scale remains challenging, particularly for oceanic regions, with the current open-access global open DEM resolution limited to 15 arc-seconds (approximately 450 m). In order to further improve the global DEM resolution, we propose an innovative Relay Residual Diffusion Probabilistic Model (RRDPM) for DEM super-resolution tasks based on diffusion model principles. Our model achieves distribution transformation between high- and low-resolution DEMs through tens of steps. Moreover, RRDPM introduces two types of inherently indivisible sampling equations, and we prove that each of them has different advantageous positions, and integrate these advantageous positions using a “relay race” approach. In addition, we discard the conventional downsampling-super-resolution paradigm, by utilizing paired datasets of global 15 arc-second and local 3 arc-second DEMs, so that our method can be trained and tested in real-world situations. The experimental results show that the RRDPM reduces the RMSE by 20.73 % and 22.77 % for land and seabed regions, respectively, and improves the PSNR by 2.23 dB and 2.34 dB, respectively, for the same areas, representing significant advancements in the current global DEM detail recovery.

 Accurately locating goafs is essential for assessing and mitigating surface instability risks, protecting infrastructure, and guiding urban planning and ecological restoration efforts. The Probability Integral Model (PIM), Improved PIM (IPIM), and Probability Density Function (PDF) models have demonstrated effectiveness in locating underground goafs. However, due to the specific assumptions underlying each model, their applicability is limited under different extraction conditions. To this end, a novel inversion framework, termed the Locating Goaf Method based on an Integrated Probability Model (LGM-IPM), is proposed to locate underground goafs under different extraction conditions using InSAR-derived deformation. First, an integrated probability model (IPM) is developed by systematically analyzing the applicability boundaries of the PIM, IPIM, and PDF models. The proposed model accurately characterizes the relationship between surface deformation and the geometric parameters of underground goafs under varying mining intensities. Subsequently, an Adaptive Mining-Affected Pixel identification algorithm (AMAPI) is developed based on the spatiotemporal characteristics of mining-induced deformation, enabling efficient input data reduction and significantly improving computational efficiency. The geometric parameters of the underground goafs are then estimated using the Genetic Algorithm-Particle Swarm Optimization (GA-PSO). These results from the Qianyingzi coal mine, China, demonstrate that the proposed LGM-IPM effectively estimates goaf parameters under different extraction conditions. The integrated AMAPI algorithm achieves a 91% reduction in computation time by effectively filtering out unaffected pixels. Moreover, the LGM-IPM model yields the highest precision, with an average relative error of 6.38%, representing improvements of 59.89% over LGM-PIM (15.90%) and 25.69% over LGM-IPIM (8.58%). These findings demonstrate that the proposed LGM-IPM framework provides a computationally efficient and more generalizable solution for InSAR-based goaf locating under different mining conditions."

 Soil moisture, a pivotal component of the hydrological cycle, exerts a profound influence on land surface exchange processes, but its spatial variability poses challenges for large-scale field observations, increasing reliance on satellite-based retrievals. However, spaceborne estimates face limitations due to model uncertainties and sensor-related constraints. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) offer promising alternatives to traditional methods by enabling data-driven estimation of soil moisture without strong physical assumptions. Thus, a critical review of emerging AI-based soil moisture retrieval methods with respect to their advantages and disadvantages is vital to ensure the best utilization of such tools for soil moisture sensing, especially with novel sensors and data constantly being generated.In this comprehensive review, we furnish the first structured overview of AI methods and their applications in soil moisture retrievals from remote sensing. AI is able to enhance soil moisture retrieval by learning complex (highly nonlinear) relationships between satellite observations and ground reference data, to support time series reconstruction by filling gaps in data sets, to estimate subsurface soil moisture conditions from surface signals and auxiliary inputs, to enable spatial scaling by translating soil moisture estimates across different resolutions using multi-resolution data, to predict temporal dynamics as a soil moisture forecast, and to contribute to broader assessments of the water cycle and beyond by integrating soil moisture with further hydrological variables.

 Cropland non-agriculturalization refers to the conversion of arable land into non-agricultural uses such as forests, residential areas, and construction sites. This phenomenon not only directly leads to the loss of cropland resources but also poses systemic threats to food security and agricultural sustainability. Accurate identification of cropland and non-cropland areas is crucial for detecting and addressing this issue. Although remote sensing and deep learning methods have shown promise in cropland segmentation, challenges persist in misidentification and omission errors, particularly with high-resolution remote sensing imagery. Traditional CNNs employ static convolution layers, while dynamic convolution studies demonstrate that adaptively weighting multiple convolutional kernels through attention mechanisms can enhance accuracy. However, existing dynamic convolution methods relying on Global Average Pooling (GAP) for attention weight allocation suffer from information loss, limiting segmentation precision. This paper proposes Frequency-Aware Dynamic Convolution (FADConv) and a Frequency Attention (FAT) module to address these limitations. Building upon the foundational structure of dynamic convolution, we designed FADConv by integrating 2D Discrete Cosine Transform (2D DCT) to capture frequency domain features and fuse them. The FAT module generates high-quality attention weights that replace the traditional GAP method, making the combination between dynamic convolution kernels more reasonable. Experiments on the GID and Hi-CNA datasets demonstrate that FADConv significantly improves segmentation accuracy with minimal computational overhead. For instance, ResNet18 with FADConv achieves 1.9% and 2.7% increases in F1-score and IoU for cropland segmentation on GID, with only 58.87M additional MAdds. Compared to other dynamic convolution approaches, FADConv exhibits superior performance in cropland segmentation tasks. The code is obtained from this link: https://github.com/er-go-proxy/FADConv."

 The advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly improved the perception and decision-making abilities of autonomous vehicles (AVs), yet real-time and accurate road marking detection remains difficult under faded markings, nighttime scenes and adverse road–weather conditions. This paper presents RoadGPT, a vision–language pipeline that couples a CLIP-based detector (RoadCLIP) with a planner-facing, LLM-generated advisory layer. The model is trained and evaluated on 3,696 road marking images covering 14 UK Highway Code classes, comprising 2,576 real images (69.7 %) from Google Street View and 1,120 text-to-image synthetic images (30.3 %) that broaden rare appearances and degraded conditions. We use 2,968 images for training (2,072 real, 896 virtual) and 728 images for testing (504 real, 224 virtual), keeping the same 70:30 real–virtual ratio in both splits. On this test set, RoadCLIP attains 98.5 % precision, 97.9 % recall and 98.2 % F1 for non-lane markings, while lane-marking subclasses reach up to 89.8 % F1. The advisory layer transforms recognised markings into structured driving prompts and is assessed via semantic similarity using Sentence-BERT (all-mpnet-base-v2) cosine scores against Highway Code-based references, achieving 89.3 % similarity, alongside an external LLM-as-judge rating of 4.68/5 for accuracy, completeness, and concise effectiveness. The full camera-to-advisory path runs in real time at 135 FPS (batch size 1, 224 × 224) on an RTX 4070 under a unified timing protocol. A remaining limitation is that visually similar lane-marking classes and extreme low-light scenes still reduce discriminability compared with symbol-like, non-lane markings."

 High resolution textures play a vital role in enhancing realism of urban digital twins, particularly in applications such as urban planning, energy analysis, and geospatial visualization. While textures can provide valuable surface-level details—such as material types (e.g., windows, green façades, bricks) and sunlight reflectance (albedo), these details are often missing in existing 3D city models. Existing 3D city models lack very high-resolution textures, limiting their realism and use cases. Manual texture mapping is labor-intensive and becomes impractical at city scale, often requiring days to weeks of effort. To address this gap, we present the CityJSON Texture Mapper, a Python-based software tool for the automated texture mapping of CityJSON 3D city models from oblique and nadir aerial imagery. The tool assumes that interior and exterior orientation parameters are available, ensuring spatial alignment between the 3D geometry and the images. Our approach introduces a novel image selection algorithm based on ray-tracing visibility analysis and integrates optimization techniques such as occlusion-aware texture mapping, texture atlassing, and optimization methods. Experimental results demonstrate the tool’s effectiveness in producing high-quality, visually enriched 3D models, significantly reducing the time and effort required for manual processing. Proposed optimization methods reduce the number of textures by 97%, the total texture size by 63%, and the CityJSON file size by 37% relative to the non-optimized model. Although this study focused on one urban area, the methodology is scalable to large city datasets and suitable for national-level applications involving thousands of buildings.

 As high-resolution road-surface imagery provides a dynamic digital twin of pavement conditions, accurate crack segmentation serves as a key step in constructing intelligent maintenance systems. However, most existing segmentation models assume uniform sampling conditions and rely on fixed parameters, limiting their generalization under diverse real-world environments. To address this challenge, we propose a Deep Orthogonal-Enhanced Generative Model (DORGM) for robust pavement crack segmentation. The proposed framework introduces two key innovations: (1) an orthogonal constraint module that enforces feature disentanglement in the latent space, separating condition-specific noise from intrinsic crack patterns to reduce interference; and (2) a soft-label routing mechanism that adaptively assigns samples to specialized pathways, capturing subtle distributional shifts through Bayesian clustering within a variational framework. These modules can be seamlessly integrated into existing segmentation architectures, improving adaptability without additional retraining. Experiments conducted on benchmark datasets including DeepCrack, CRACK500, CFD, and NHA12D show consistent improvements — approximately 5% increase in mIoU and mDice — over baselines such as PSPNet, DNLNet, PointRend, SegFormer, and VPD. By enforcing orthogonality in the latent space, DORGM effectively disentangles environmental variations (e.g., lighting or weather-induced noise) from core crack features, yielding stable and interpretable segmentation across heterogeneous data sources. This disentanglement further mitigates domain shifts that hinder digital twin applications, enabling more reliable integration of crack data with other urban layers such as traffic flow and structural health metrics."

 Landslide Susceptibility Analysis (LSA) is essential for effective geological hazard management, particularly in karst regions where complex terrain and dense vegetation present significant challenges. This study introduces an innovative LSA framework that integrates a low-InSAR deformation sampling strategy (BL-InSAR) to mitigate InSAR errors in surface deformation measurements over densely vegetated areas and reduce uncertainty in non-landslide sample selection. Focusing on Bijie District in Guizhou Province, a karst-dominated region, we incorporate karst hydrogeological data into the LSA process. Utilizing a C-Support Vector Machine (C-SVM) model, we analyze 14 factors, including karst hydrogeology, to generate four landslide susceptibility maps employing BL-InSAR and three conventional sampling methods. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) algorithm is applied to elucidate both global and local landslide mechanisms. Our findings identify karst hydrogeology, precipitation, lithology, and slope as key factors influencing landslide susceptibility, with high-risk areas concentrated in the northwest, central, and northeastern regions. The BL-InSAR method achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.8885, outperforming other methods by 2.69 %, 3.66 %, and 8.45 %, respectively. This framework enhances the interpretability of landslide susceptibility models by considering landslide creep dynamics through InSAR and integrating karst hydrogeological data. It offers a more effective approach to capturing and interpreting landslide risks in karst environments, thereby contributing to more reliable LSA in complex terrains."

 Accurate semantic information about Martian rocks from rover images is crucial for scientific investigation and safe rover navigation. Due to the high cost and difficulty of obtaining dense manual annotations in Martian rock imagery, existing studies have focused mostly on semi-supervised and transfer learning strategies. However, segmentation under extremely sparse annotation conditions has not yet been investigated sufficiently. To fill this gap, we proposed a weakly supervised learning (WSL) framework, namely, Scribble-guided Object Uncertainty-aware Learning (SOUL), for Martian rock segmentation using scribble annotations. SOUL comprises two key components: an Object-level Pseudo-label Generation (OPG) strategy to generate pseudo-labels with accurate boundary characterization and an Uncertainty-aware Prototype-guided (UAPG) loss to refine the noisy pseudo-labels. Specifically, OPG generates object-level pseudo-labels by integrating instance decomposition with the Segment Anything Model (SAM), scribble-guided label assignment, and similarity-based label propagation. UAPG estimates pixel-wise uncertainty via modeling prototype-based feature similarities, enabling confidence-aware optimization. Extensive experiments on the TWMARS, MarsData-V2, and MSLRock datasets demonstrated that SOUL effectively increased segmentation quality under sparse supervision, outperforming six recent benchmarks. Moreover, ablation studies illustrated that both OPG and UAPG are crucial for enhancing segmentation performance. Furthermore, SOUL narrows the gap between weak and semi-supervision and between weak and full supervision. Overall, SOUL has great potential to reduce manual annotation effort while retaining competitive accuracy. The source code and datasets are available at https://github.com/Tong-777777/SOUL."

 The middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River basin (MLRYR) are one of the main agricultural bases over East Asia, and the warm fronts induced extremes have profound impacts on the agricultural activity. Therefore, revealing the potential predictors for the warm front activity over the MLRYR is of significance. This study objectively identifies the warm fronts based on a commonly used thermal method for front detection. Results show that the warm front frequency (WFF) over the MLRYR exhibits a significant decreasing trend and strong interannual variability during 1979–2020. Further analysis indicates that the spring WFF over the MLRYR is associated with the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)-like sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies and Bering Sea ice anomalies in the preceding winter. The El Niño-like SST anomalies could persist from the preceding winter to the following spring and excite an anomalous anticyclone over the western North Pacific. The winter Bering Sea ice anomalies can also persist into the following spring and trigger a downstream-propagating wave train, leading to an anomalous cyclone over Mongolia. The aforementioned anomalous anticyclone and cyclone enhance the equivalent potential temperature gradient over the MLRYR, favoring more warm front activities over the region. Comparatively, the decreasing trend of Bering Sea ice anomalies could contribute to the decreasing trend of WFF over the MLRYR. Further multi-linear regression and leave-one-out validation analyses demonstrate that preceding winter ENSO and Bering Sea ice anomalies could have a synergistic impact on spring WFF over the MLRYR, potentially serving as predictors for the spring warm front activity over the region."

 Tornado has occurred frequently in the United States (US), with its seasonality and interannual variability tremendously discussed in previous studies. However, its long-term variabilities, including the interdecadal/multidecadal variabilities and the linear trend, have less been comprehensively discussed and quantified. In this study, we find that the tornado occurrence in the US shows salient interdecadal/decadal variabilities, in additional to the interannual variability. A modest positive linear trend is also present, qualitatively consistent with the thermodynamic influence of global oceanic warming (GOW) on convective available potential energy and low-level southerly winds. Two internal modes, namely the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO), influence the interdecadal variabilities of tornado occurrence. The IPO stimulates a stationary wave train, propagating from the Pacific to North America, resembles the Pacific-North America pattern yet on the decadal time scale, and affects local circulations and hence tornado occurrence. The AMO induces a local dipole of circulation anomalies, resembling the North Atlantic Oscillation pattern, which triggers a northwest-southeast dipole change of tornado occurrence with the northwest component stronger. Furthermore, we quantitatively estimate the relative importance of IPO, AMO and GOW on the tornado occurrence from 1950 to 2021 based on a multi-regression model. The result shows that the IPO and AMO jointly contribute about 32.6 % (19.9 %) of the decadal (total) variance while the GOW contribution is secondary."

 sDrought is a complex extreme climate event that typically originates from anomalous atmospheric precipitation and progressively propagates through hydrological, agricultural, and ecological systems, subsequently causing more severe impacts. Therefore, elucidating the propagation mechanisms among different types of droughts is crucial for enhancing drought early warning capabilities and achieving coordinated regulation across multiple systems. This study focuses on the Yellow River Basin (YRB) as the research area and, based on a multi-source dataset spanning 1982–2018, systematically investigates the propagation characteristics and spatiotemporal structure of meteorological drought to hydrological, agricultural, and ecological droughts from the perspective of drought events. This is achieved through the integrated application of run theory and an optimized drought migration model. The results indicate that in the YRB, the propagation time of droughts shows that hydrological drought occurs earlier than agricultural and ecological droughts. The drought propagation process in the YRB exhibits two typical patterns: a “high-frequency and fast-response” type and a “low-frequency and slow-response” type, corresponding respectively to regions with strong meteorological forcing and human activities. The three-dimensional spatiotemporal propagation pathways of typical years further reveal that meteorological droughts in the YRB occur frequently and expand rapidly.

Although extracellular electron transfer (EET) drives the electrical signal output of EAB sensors, its relationship with sensitivity is poorly understood. This raises two critical questions: (1) Do toxicants affect EET performance? (2) What is the relationship between EET performance and sensitivity. Herein, we employed a double-electrode-controlled electrochemical gating method (EGM) to evaluate the effects of different toxicants on EET performance across multiple biological scales, ranging from mixed- and purified-species biofilms to isolated OmcA proteins. Results indicated that five representative toxicants (0.02% formaldehyde, 5 mg/L NO2–, 5 mg/L tobramycin, 5 mg/L Cu2+, and 5 mg/L SDS) rarely impacted EET performance directly. On this basis, we probed the link between EET performance and sensitivity using riboflavin (RF) and anthraquinone-2,7-disulfonate (AQDS). After a 30 min toxicity exposure, the inhibition ratios were ranked as follows: AQDS-EABs > Control > RF-EABs. Although RF observably reduced the resistance, the high capacitance weakened the sensitivity. It is suggested that reducing resistance alone could not result in a higher sensitivity, and capacitance effects cannot be overlooked through modeling and electrochemical analysis. This study, therefore, proposes the time constant as a suitable metric for evaluating the relationship between the EET performance and sensitivity."

It provides the first observational evidence of bidirectional leader behavior in positive altitude‐triggered lightning and highlights the connection process's driving effect on leader initiation/development. In positive triggered lightning, the bidirectional leader system first emerged from the wire bottom with positive polarity, rapidly connected with the tower and generated an impulsive current wave initiating an upward negative leader from the wire top. The wire ends generated different E‐field distortions, but less significant than the different initiation thresholds of positive and negative leaders. Consequently, the positive leader always initiates first for both triggering cases, regardless of background E‐field direction and formation position. Wire end's E‐field distortion alone was insufficient to initiate negative leader. Besides slow charge accumulation from the opposite end's positive leader, impulsive current surge is another effective/indispensable abrupt driver."

Many studies use elastic homogeneous half‐space models to calculate vertical displacements from a specified earthquake slip distribution, neglecting complexities of 3D structure in subduction zone settings. Here, we use 3D ground motion simulations of potential Cascadia Subduction Zone earthquakes to investigate the impact of realistic 3D Earth structure on estimated vertical displacements. We show that offshore uplift increases when including 3D structure due to high fault slip in low‐rigidity accretionary wedge sediments and coastal subsidence decreases due to higher rigidity material at depth. These larger offshore uplifts cause increased tsunami maximum wave heights, and coastal subsidence at paleoseismic sites decreases on average by ∼17 cm, or ∼60%, which can have important implications for the amplitude and extent of slip in earthquake scenarios developed based on paleoseismic data constraints."

Despite loss, methylation partly recovers via H3K9me3 after fertilization, revealing partial intergenerational epigenetic inheritance. 
 Inter/transgenerational epigenetic inheritance is a crucial and controversial theory that could reshape the concept of genetics. To investigate this theory directly, we invent a system for targeted reprogramming of epigenetic memory in mouse sperm. Using this system, we erase DNA methylation at the differentially methylated region of the H19 gene (H19-DMR) in sperm, which causes Silver-Russell syndrome-like phenotypes in F1 offspring. Although DNA methylation is fully lost in the sperm, it is partially restored during pre-implantation development, suggesting the existence of epigenetic memory that instructs de novo DNA methylation. Importantly, targeted removal of histone modifications in zygotes reveals that tri-methylation at lysine 9 of histone H3 (H3K9me3), which is deposited shortly after fertilization, is required for the subsequent de novo DNA methylation at the H19-DMR. Thus, our study provides a robust germline editing tool, which reveals partial intergenerational inheritance and no transgenerational inheritance at the model locus. Furthermore, we identify H3K9me3 as a mediator for DNA methylation recovery also acting at imprinted loci. The authors develop a system to erase DNA methylation at H19-DMR in mouse sperm. Despite loss, methylation partly recovers via H3K9me3 after fertilization, revealing partial intergenerational epigenetic inheritance."

 E3 ubiquitin ligases are vital enzymes that define the ubiquitin code in cells. Beyond promoting protein degradation to maintain cellular health, they also mediate non-degradative processes like DNA repair, signaling, and immunity. Despite their therapeutic potential, a comprehensive framework for understanding the relationships among diverse E3 ligases is lacking. Here, we classify the “human E3 ligome”—an extensive set of catalytic human E3s—by integrating multi-layered data, including protein sequences, domain architectures, 3D structures, functions, and expression patterns. Our classification is based on a metric-learning paradigm and uses a weakly supervised hierarchical framework to capture authentic relationships across E3 families and subfamilies. It extends the categorization of E3s into RING, HECT, and RBR classes, including non-canonical mechanisms, successfully explains their functional segregation, distinguishes between multi-subunit complexes and standalone enzymes, and maps E3s to substrates and potential drug interactions. Our analysis provides a global view of E3 biology, opening strategies for drugging E3-substrate networks, including drug repurposing and designing specific E3 handles.

In 2021, a case-control study was conducted in China, involving 103 participants with hyperlipidemia and 419 healthy controls, to investigate the effects of PPCP exposure on hyperlipidemia risk and the mediating roles of thyroid hormones. Among the individual PPCP, 4-hydroxybenzophenone showed the strongest association with hyperlipidemia risk (OR: 1.52; 95% CI: 1.01, 2.28), followed by triclosan (OR: 1.38; 95% CI: 1.01, 1.89). Mixture exposure levels of PPCP above the 50th percentile were associated with an elevated risk of hyperlipidemia, with 2,4-dihydroxybenzophenone (BP-1) contributing most to the risk, followed by ethyl-protocatechuate. Significant mediating effects of free-triiodothyronine were observed in the relationships between triclosan, BP-1, and ΣPPCP exposure, and hyperlipidemia, with the mediated proportions of 12.19, 12.86, and 11.66%, respectively. These findings indicated that thyroid hormones played an important mediating role in the association and deserve more attention. Network toxicology models suggested that inhibiting lipolysis, promoting oxidative stress, and inflammatory responses may be potential biological mechanisms of PPCP-induced hyperlipidemia.

As soluble microbial products (SMP) and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) constitute important sources of DON in the water environment, understanding how their distinct compositional profiles influence DBP formation is critical for water safety assessment. This study systematically explored the chlorination reaction network of SMP and EPS, elucidating the structure and toxicological profiles of generated N-DBPs. The results showed that SMP, characterized by elevated aromaticity and humification, preferentially formed aromatic chlorinated DBPs (Cl-DBPs) through electrophilic aromatic substitution pathways. In contrast, EPS contained more labile protein with less ordered secondary structure, promoting N-DBP generation. Molecular network analysis showed that SMP primarily formed aromatic Cl-DBPs via lignin/tannin chlorination, whereas EPS generated more N-DBPs from proteins and lipids. Structural characterization via ultrahigh performance liquid chromatography–high resolution mass spectrometry proposed two predominant N-DBP classes: heterocyclic aromatic amines (high mammalian oral toxicity and developmental effects) and long-chain aliphatic amines (pronounced aquatic toxicity but minimal mammalian effects).

Here, we conducted an integrative AMR surveillance of meats and associated environments from three markets using culture-independent single-cell Raman spectroscopy for phenotypic profiling and metagenomics for genotypic analysis. We found that environments consistently harbored a higher abundance of metabolically active antibiotic-resistant bacteria than meats. By incorporation of phenotypic AMR (abundance and activity of antibiotic-resistant bacteria), genotypic AMR (percentage of high-risk antibiotic resistance genes), and transmission potential, a new risk assessment framework was established. The integrated assessment revealed that environments were critical AMR reservoirs with risk levels higher than or comparable to those in meats, underscoring the necessity of integrating multiple factors for accurate risk assessment. Moreover, source tracking analysis suggested reciprocal cross-contamination between the samples, which was further confirmed by 25 shared metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) hosting high-risk ARGs among samples.

A total of 28 PFASs were detected, including four ultrashort-chain and six emerging compounds. Industrial WWTP (I2) exhibited substantially elevated total PFAS levels (1596 μg/L) in wastewater compared to those of municipal/domestic WWTP. Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) is the dominant PFAS, with the highest concentration at 806 μg/L, contributing 22.3–92.8% for ∑PFAS. Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid is the dominant emerging PFAS with a concentration up to 379 μg/L, while sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzenesulfonate is the more frequently detected emerging PFAS. PFAS concentrations increase in most WWTPs after treatment but decrease in some WWTPs, especially M5 adding membrane bioreactor to the conventional treatment process.

However, environmental monitoring of building plumbing systems often targets a broad range of Legionella species, raising the question of whether monitoring should focus exclusively on L. pneumophila or include all Legionella species. This review examines the policy and public health implications of both strategies by assessing case attribution data for Legionnaires’ disease, the environmental prevalence of Legionella species, and the validity of using non-pneumophila counts as indicators for L. pneumophila. Although over 30 species can cause illness, L. pneumophila dominates culture-confirmed cases despite the frequent detection of L. non-pneumophila species in building plumbing and other known sources. Ecological differences between species, including growth temperatures and disinfection resistance, arguably limit the suitability of L. non-pneumophila species as reliable indicators for L. pneumophila. As a result, using all Legionella species counts to inform risk management may lead to excessive interventions without proportional public health benefits. We conclude that routine monitoring should prioritize L. pneumophila to ensure targeted, cost-effective, and health-relevant risk management. Broader monitoring may be warranted in high-risk settings or where local epidemiological data justify a more inclusive approach. These findings support risk-based regulatory frameworks that align monitoring targets with public health outcomes."

 The reversible interconversion between spiropyran and merocyanine constitutes one of the most intensively investigated photochromic systems, enabling diverse applications in stimuli-responsive materials and optical imaging. Here, we report pyridine-substituted merocyanines (PMCs) as a class of photochromic molecules. Upon visible light irradiation, these compounds undergo an uncommon photoinduced C-N bond formation to yield spiroindolizine (SIZ) structures, accompanied by the color fading. The SIZs can thermally revert to the colored PMC form. This photochromism is marked by rapid response, high photo-switching ratio, robust water compatibility, and fatigue resistance. Furthermore, we have synthesized quinoline-substituted merocyanines and found that they can be bidirectionally switched by 660 nm and 500 nm light to form SIZ and PMC structures.

 Nanoplastics (NPs) pose health concerns worldwide. However, robust quantitative data on their absorption, distribution, and excretion in mammals remain scarce. Here, we provide a comprehensive assessment of polystyrene (PS) NP biodistribution and elimination in rats using 14C-radiolabeling, the most accurate and quantitative method available. Pregnant rats were exposed to 14C-labeled 20 nm or 100 nm PS NPs (PS20 or PS100) via oral gavage, intratracheal aerosolization, or intravenous injection, and tissue distribution and excretion were determined by radioactivity measurements. We found that PS NPs were exclusively excreted through faeces, irrespective of the exposure routes, without urinary elimination. Both PS20 and PS100 crossed multiple biological barriers, yet only PS20 reached the brain. Maternal transfer of PS20 occurred through both placenta and milk, while PS100 transferred solely via milk. A physiologically based toxicokinetic model further simulated accumulation kinetics across tissues. This study establishes the most comprehensive and reliable quantitative profile of PS NP biodistribution in mammals to date, revealing distinct size-dependent translocation patterns that provide a robust foundation for evaluating their health impacts.

 Real or simulated microgravity induces a senescence-like modification of carotid artery in both human and animal observations, with the mechanisms not fully elucidated. Here, we aim to elucidate the role of sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 (SREBP1, encoded by Srebf1) mediated lipogenesis in the process. Pharmacological activation of SREBP1 directly triggers senescence-like transformation in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), while silencing Srebf1 exerts an opposite effect. Mechanistically, SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis upregulates acetyl-CoA pool to increase histone acetylation, modifying the chromatin accessibility which limiting recruitment of SRF/myocardin complexes to CArG boxes of contractile genes and opening the chromatin accessibility of aging genes. Srebf1 knockdown and local delivery of lentivirus or AAV-mediated VSMC specific expressing sh-Srebf1 significantly attenuates the senescence-like transformation of VSMC both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized feature of SREBP1-mediated lipogenesis in vascular biology and SM-induced carotid artery remodeling.

 The use of nucleic acid-based nanostructures as synthetic biological tools to interface with and regulate cell processes remains challenging. A major obstacle lies in nuclear delivery and retention within live eukaryotic cells. Here, we present a platform of single-stranded RNAs that can co-transcriptionally fold into defined nanostructures and assemble into rings, ribbons, and nanonet-like architectures. We validate the formation of these structures in vitro using atomic force microscopy. Then, we demonstrate the functional integration of fluorescent aptamers and RNA sensing capability within the single chain by co-folding with these structures. Notably, we show that the RNA nanonets can be co-transcriptionally produced and assembled directly inside the nucleus of live human cells. We use confocal live-cell imaging and transmission electron microscopy to reveal well-defined nanostructure patterns retained in the nucleus. Together, these results establish a genetically encoded, self-assembling RNA nanostructure system with programmable geometry and localization, providing a foundation for the development of RNA-based nanodevices to examine biological properties in live cells and tissues.

 This study aims to investigate the roles of gut microbiota and plasma metabolites in salt sensitivity (SS) of blood pressure (SSBP) and hypertension. A 23-day, multicenter, dietary salt intervention trial (the MetaSalt study) recruited 528 participants who underwent a baseline observation, low-salt, and high-salt interventions. SSBP was assessed and used as the primary outcome, and fecal shotgun metagenome and plasma targeted metabolome were measured. We found that high salt significantly altered 85 gut-microbial species (p < 9.42 × 10−5) and 70 metabolites (p < 2.26 × 10−4). Among them, the changes in 22 species and 8 metabolites were associated with SSBP (p < 0.05), and a gut microbiota-acylcarnitine network implicated in SSBP was identified, with a gut microbiota-derived metabolite, isovalerylcarnitine, as the core metabolite. Isovalerylcarnitine was also inversely associated with SSBP in the GenSalt study (p = 0.0102). Importantly, increased isovalerylcarnitine attenuated SS hypertension and improved endothelial function in rats, and was associated with reduced risk (ranging from 13% to 19%) of BP progression and incident hypertension in a prospective cohort (n = 3907, median follow-up = 5.5 years). This study demonstrated that the gut-acylcarnitine axis may play roles in the development of SS hypertension. Trial number: ChiCTR1900025171.

 Efficient dynamic vision requires capturing instantaneous changes and temporal context, yet existing image and event sensors rely on power-hungry digital processing. Here, we introduce an in-sensor dual-response architecture that concurrently generates analog event spikes and persistent memory tails. A prototype sensor integrates phosphor pairs with silicon photodiodes and transimpedance amplifiers to achieve microsecond- and millisecond-scale dual kinetics. Measurements during light-emitting diode replay reconstruct event frames that match software frame differences, while the slow channel behaves as a linear reservoir of motion history. A single memory frame fed to a convolutional neural network enables accurate classification of human actions (93.1%) and vehicle trajectories (98.0%), as well as speed estimation with errors of 2.15 km/h. Integration with a compressive optical neural network front end mapping 4900 inputs to 16 per frame yields 93.3% action classification accuracy. By eliminating analog-to-digital conversion and digital accumulation, this approach enables ultralow-latency, ultralow-power neuromorphic vision.

 Biodiversity Hotspots (Hotspots), harboring exceptionally rich small-ranged species, are critical for mitigating biodiversity loss. As priorities for terrestrial conservation, Hotspots increasingly face threats from agriculture, the largest anthropogenic disturbance impacting biodiversity. Yet, the spatial dynamics of agricultural expansion and its impacts on biodiversity, especially small-ranged vertebrates, remain poorly understood. Using site-level observations and satellite imagery, we found that agricultural pressures reduce species richness by 25.8%, total abundance by 12.4%, and rarefied species richness by 8.7% relative to primary vegetation within Hotspots. However, cropland area within Hotspots expanded 12% from 2000–2019, exceeding the global average of 9%. Fine-scale analysis identified 3,483 risk spots (cropland expansion and high small-ranged vertebrate richness, ~1741 Mha); ~1031 Mha of these areas fall outside Protected Areas, particularly in the Atlantic Forest, Indo-Burma, Western Ghats, Sri Lanka, and Sundaland. These results underscore the urgent need for targeted conservation actions to prevent biodiversity loss from agricultural expansion.

 The Mw 7.0 Dingri earthquake, the largest documented normal-faulting event in southern Tibet, struck within the NS-trending Dinggye-Xainza Rift system. Here we combine field observations, high resolution optical and synthetic aperture radar imagery and seismic waveforms to determine the three-dimensional coseismic deformation field, coseismic rupture processes and early postseismic deformation mechanisms of the event. We find that the rupture propagated unilaterally northward from the earthquake hypocenter, concurrently activating two graben-bounding faults. The main rupture was concentrated on the Dengmo Co fault causing a maximum subsidence of 3 m and a 25-km-long rupture trace at the surface. The first four-months postseismic deformation is dominated by shallow afterslip, which exhibits spatial overlap with the coseismic slip zone. Our observations provide important insights into the rupture kinematics and strain partitioning within the Dinggye-Xainza Rift, offering a valuable framework for understanding continental extensional tectonics and seismic cycle processes in similar southern Tibet grabens.

It integrates structural components and presents a fault classification by importance, amount of documentation and seismogenic potential. This last parameter is assessed by analysing the amount of observed seismicity near the faults, amount of surface deformation estimated from GNSS velocities, and the age of the last known rupture on the fault. 
 The South-East of France has been structured by numerous tectonic episodes resulting in a complex compound of crustal deformations. This fallouts in a large network of faults which have evolved throughout subsequent tectonic events. Nevertheless, the present-day tectonic deformation is slow and of debated origin, giving place to a low to moderate seismicity. This seismotectonic context is a challenge for seismic hazard analysis, specifically for the identification and characterisation of potentially active faults. In this study we present a fault-related data compilation, named South-East France Potentially Active Faults (SEFPAF, Mowbray et al., 2025, https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17235395), which integrates structural components from geological maps, previous neotectonic databases and fault-specific studies. Our objective is to provide a new, well documented, and modular fault database. Multiple structural representations per fault are presented, allowing the end-user to choose from the various parameter value options. With an end purpose of identifying the most relevant faults for seismic hazard assessment, we build a series of indices which allow fault prioritization: the Importance index (I), the Documentation index (D) and, the Seismogenic Potential index (SP). The first classifies faults into major, secondary and minor based on the source's description of the structure; the second analyses the quantity of information known for each fault; the last intends to decipher seismically active faults by integrating the age of the last documented rupture, the spatial correlation with seismic flux and, the spatial correlation with geodetic strain. SEFPAF may have various applications, amongst them we illustrate the first step towards the development of a fault model for seismic hazard analysis: we identify relevant faults to model by adjusting the index criteria and, propose idealized geometries for a set of 20 faults which can subsequently be used as composite seismogenic sources."

The data underwent rigorous, basin-adapted quality control to remove systematic biases, unifying four decades of fragmented data, delivering two complementary products: the aggregated original cruise data product and the bias-adjusted data synthesis product. 
 The Mediterranean Sea (MedSea) is highly sensitive to climate-driven changes in temperature, oxygen, and pH, among other variables. To better assess these long-term trends, we developed CARIMED (CARbon, tracers, and ancillary data In the MEDiterranean Sea), the first comprehensive, harmonised data synthesis product for the MedSea. CARIMED integrates hydrographic, inorganic carbon, transient tracer, and ancillary measurements from 46 research cruises spanning the period from 1976 to 2018, containing observations for the entire water column across all MedSea sub-basins. A substantial component of the data was retrieved from fragmented or locally archived historical records, thus consolidating previously inaccessible measurements. Following global synthesis approaches, CARIMED applies a quality-controlled, and bias-adjusted framework. A key adaptation was the secondary quality control (2QC) procedure, specifically tailored to the MedSea's unique hydrography, utilising sub-basin divisions and supplementary checks (including statistical consistency assessments) to resolve complex, often contradictory, inter-cruise offsets. This rigorous process minimised systematic biases, yielding a dataset with improved consistency, and highlights the urgent need for adapted standard operating procedures and reference materials to address the MedSea biogeochemical particularities. CARIMED delivers two complementary, freely available products: the aggregated original cruise data product (https://doi.org/10.20350/digitalCSIC/17785; García-Ibáñez et al., 2025) and the final bias-adjusted data synthesis product (https://doi.org/10.25921/cp5b-zq67; Álvarez et al., 2025). This essential resource establishes a new benchmark for assessing long-term biogeochemical trends, validating regional ocean models, and supporting climate-change mitigation and adaptation strategies in this rapidly changing semi-enclosed basin."

This study used a mouse model with gut dysbiosis induced by cefoperazone to explore As bioaccumulation, transformation, and excretion. By integrating absolute quantification methods, this study monitored the responses of gut microbiota, As biotransformation genes (ABGs), and gut metabolites in mice exposed to 1 and 10 mg/L As. Arsenic accumulation in the liver, spleen, heart, ileum, and blood was markedly decreased in gut dysbiosis mice exposed to 10 mg/L As. These mice also exhibited lower proportions of DMA(V) and As(V) in the liver compared with normal mice. A total of 17 ABGs were detected in the mouse gut, with a significant reduction in their absolute abundance in gut dysbiosis mice (e.g., arsC, arsH, and arsB genes). Consistently, gut dysbiosis mice had lower bacterial loads, particularly for Alloprevotella and Bacteroides, accompanied by the upregulation of “amino acids” and “fatty acid esters.” Association analysis predicted several specific bacteria carrying ABGs, exemplified by Bacteroides carrying the arsC gene. Our findings provided further insights into As metabolism mediated by gut microbiota, for better understanding As-induced toxicity and disease risk."

Although iron‐bound organic carbon (OC‐FeR) critically modulates permafrost carbon‐climate feedbacks, its decadal‐scale variability and response to this regime shift remain poorly constrained. Focusing on the East Siberian Arctic, a hotspot of land‐to‐ocean permafrost carbon transfer, we established critical linkages between marine sedimentary OC‐FeR burial records and terrestrial permafrost‐climate dynamics. Results revealed that coastal OC‐FeR reservoirs exhibited temporally‐distinct responses to permafrost thawing dynamics. During the pre‐2000s, the progressive decline in OC‐FeR coincided with watershed‐scale soil moisture redistribution driven by gradual active‐layer deepening, which preferentially retained OC‐FeR in permafrost, attenuating its land‐to‐ocean fluxes. Since 2000s, although abrupt thaw has rapidly mobilized OC, ∼19% of sedimentary OC remained stabilized as OC‐FeR, thus partially decoupling abrupt thaw from immediate permafrost carbon‐climate feedbacks. Therefore, this mineralogical buffering mechanism can attenuate the net climate impact of accelerating abrupt thaw across the Northern Hemisphere cryosphere."

Here, we show the importance of two‐dimensional flow induced by seasonal freeze‐thaw processes based on a validated numerical model. Under horizontally uniform boundary conditions, cryosuction and salt exclusion during freezing concentrate salts near the freezing front. During thawing, the recovery of permeability and presence of high salinity gradients promote gravitational instabilities, inducing convective fingering after thawing. This process facilitates downward salt transport, preventing long‐term salt accumulation in the shallow soil layer. Further quantitative analysis showed that deeper frost depths or lower water tables favor fingering formation. Based on these results, a new hypothesis regarding salt redistribution in seasonally frozen soils is proposed. It has important implications for understanding salinity dynamics and contaminant migration in cold‐region environments."

However, the carbon footprint of its energy (72% coal‐based) requirement is also equally alarming. Under such scenarios, the Farm Power Subsidy (FPS) policy for groundwater irrigation, one of India's costliest public support systems, needs a relook, keeping in view the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Although aimed at bridging social disparities, it is observed that FPS encourages simplification and intensification of the food production system, leading to inter‐state and district scale inequality in income. States implementing FPS, even if experiencing physical water scarcity, are growing water guzzling crops for economic benefits. Conversely, without adequate access to energy, states reeling from economic water scarcity are witnessing low farm incomes. India consumes about a quarter of the world's groundwater for irrigation, and also leads the energy use. Notably, since the mid‐2000s large‐scale implementation of the FPS policy, the CO2 emission (equivalent) has been rising by 5.77 million tons annually, now surpassing 100 million tons. These outcomes bear testimony to the globally accepted view that those least responsible for causing greenhouse gas emissions are the hardest hit. We suggest repurposing of agricultural policies, without compromising farmers' income, for efficient management of energy and water."

 Proteolysis targeting chimeric small molecules (PROTACs) offer a strategy for degrading disease-associated proteins or controlling engineered protein tags fused to therapeutic proteins, like chimeric antigen receptors (CARs). New approaches are needed that allow spatiotemporal control of PROTAC activity, restricting degrader activity to targeted cells. Photopharmacology offers a solution by enabling light-mediated spatial control of drug action. Here, we synthesize photocaged and photoswitchable PROTAC molecules and test their regulation of proteins tagged with E. coli dihydrofolate reductase (eDHFR) in tumor and CAR-T cells. Several of the molecules are derived from triazole-linked trimethoprim-PROTACs (TMP-TACtz), that degrade eDHFR fused proteins at picomolar concentrations, show degradation in cells with low cereblon E3 ligase levels, and have little off-target effects. The photocleavable compound, TMP-TAC-PC yields the best light-mediated regulation of CAR T cell cytotoxicity and cytokine secretion. This work introduces photocontrolled, tag-directed degraders for controlling protein expression in tumor cells and CAR T cells.

The results suggest dense deep magma oceans and show that iron-water reactions can greatly shrink and densify super-Earths. 
 Iron(Fe)-water reactions in a magma ocean can influence water storage and density of planets. These reactions can form Fe-O-H phases, whose density, melting, and electronic properties at planetary interior conditions are important for informing planetary models. Here, we study natural goethite (α-FeOOH) that is shock-compressed along its principal Hugoniot. Analysis of our velocity interferometer system for any reflector (VISAR) results extends the equation of state to over 800 GPa. X-ray diffraction and VISAR reflectivity results indicate the onset of melting occurs at ~95 GPa with complete melting by 166 GPa, which may be relevant to low seismic velocity anomalies observed above the core-mantle boundary. Analysis of X-ray emission spectroscopy results up to 285 GPa shows the spin crossover of Fe, with dominantly low spin Fe above ~265 GPa in the melt, supporting formation of dense basal magma oceans in terrestrial planets. Using our measured FeOOH densities, we model planetary interiors up to 10 Earth masses. Assuming FeOOH forms via iron-water reactions, the radius decreases by up to 28%, while the density increases by up to 165% compared to the unreacted case, providing an avenue to investigate water storage and evolution in super-Earths and sub-Neptunes.

 The dominant bacteria enriched in the Fusarium wilt plants’ rhizosphere are of increasing interest, as they adapt well to the diseased rhizosphere. However, general information about these bacteria is still lacking. Here, we perform a meta-analysis of Fusarium wilt plants rhizosphere and comprehensive studies to obtain information about the robust variation in the rhizosphere microbiome of Fusarium wilt plants. We demonstrate that Fusarium infection reproducibly changes the rhizosphere bacterial community composition. The rhizosphere microbiomes of Fusarium wilt plants are characterized by the enrichment of Flavobacterium, gene cassettes involved in antioxidant functions related to sulfur metabolism and the root secreted tocopherol acetate. We further isolate antagonistic Flavobacterium anhuiense from the diseased tomato rhizosphere, and reveal that the growth of F. anhuiense and the expression of genes related to carbohydrate metabolism in this strain are significantly stimulated by tocopherol acetate. Furthermore, the inhibitory effect of F. anhuiense against F. oxysporum and F. anhuiense population enhancement by tocopherol acetate are confirmed in planta. The robust variation in the rhizosphere microbiome elucidates key principles governing the general assembly mechanism of the microbiome in the Fusarium wilt plants’ rhizosphere.

Here, the authors use fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) knockout mice and an FGF7-loaded hydrogel to show that this factor can promote functional regeneration of tendon. 
 Tissue fibrosis is a major cause of organ dysfunction. Preventing fibrosis in tissue pathological condition remains a significant clinical challenge. Here we investigate the role of fibroblast growth factor 7 (FGF7) in mitigating fibrosis and promoting regeneration of load-bearing tendons. Fgf7 knockout mice exhibit impaired motor function and disordered matrix assembly in tendons. Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals an enrichment of a pro-fibrotic cell subpopulation in Fgf7-deficient tendons, which is also predominant in human tendinopathy. Using ProTracer technology, we find that FGF7 deficiency drives proliferating cells toward this pro-fibrotic lineage. Furthermore, we find that FGF7 promotes the tenogenic differentiation of tendon stem/progenitor cells while suppressing their fibrotic differentiation. Importantly, a hydrogel loaded with recombinant FGF7 effectively reduces fibrosis and significantly promotes functional tendon regeneration in vivo. These findings elucidate FGF7’s dual role in driving tenogenesis and inhibiting fibrosis, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy.

Here, the authors report a tandem electrolyzer that couples cathodic nitrate reduction with anodic ethanol oxidation to produce acetamide. 
 Electrochemical acetamide synthesis under ambient conditions offers a sustainable route for converting waste nitrate into valuable chemicals. Conventional methods, limited to standalone reduction or oxidation processes, typically achieve low Faradaic efficiencies (<40%) and yields (<0.2 mmol h⁻¹ cm⁻²). Here, we present a tandem reaction system coupling cathodic reduction and anodic oxidation in a full-cell electrolyzer to enhance acetamide production. At the cathode, nitrate is first reduced to nitrite, which subsequently oxidizes ethanol to acetaldehyde. This acetaldehyde reacts in situ with electrogenerated ammonia to form α-aminoethanol. The intermediate is then transported to the anode, where it undergoes oxidation to yield acetamide. The reaction pathway is confirmed through proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, revealing efficient acetamide synthesis with a yield of 7.2 ± 0.3 mmol h⁻¹ (0.45 ± 0.02 mmol h⁻¹ cm⁻²) at a cell voltage of 2.4 V. Furthermore, the strategy extends to other amides, such as formamide and butyramide, underscoring its versatility. Techno-economic analysis highlights the viability of this route, with estimated production costs competitive against conventional thermal processes.

This study introduces a resilient catalyst that drives highly selective hydrogen production from formic acid using low-grade heat. 
 Hydrogen extraction from liquid hydrogen carriers is a promising strategy to address hydrogen storage and transportation challenges for a hydrogen economy. We report a novel heterogeneous catalytic architecture, Ni(Mn)-O-P/GaN nanowires, for efficient, selective, and ultra-stable hydrogen evolution from formic acid (FA). The catalyst achieves a high activity of 29.92 mol H2·gcat−1·h−1 with nearly 100% selectivity and a high turnover frequency (TOF) of 31,019.2 h−1 at 150 °C. It exhibits exceptional stability over 4000 hours under fluctuated temperatures (55-75 °C) with a turnover numbers (TONs) of 5,023,060, integrable with low-grade industrial waste heat. In-situ characterizations, isotope experiments, and density functional theory calculations collectively reveal that the synergy between Ni(Mn)-O-P and GaN are favorable for the O-H dissociation of FA with an interesting H-exchange mechanism with H2O while inhibiting the undesired FA dehydration and coking formation. An industrial prototype test validates practical on-demand hydrogen production using waste heat.

Here, the authors demonstrate surface halogenation engineering that suppresses irreversible lithium loss, achieving 94.3% initial Coulombic efficiency and 72% capacity retention over 500 cycles at 25°C. 
 Silicon-based solid-state batteries are promising next-generation high-energy-density technologies. However, poor (electro)chemical compatibility between silicon negative electrodes and solid electrolytes (e.g., Li6PS5Cl) plus sluggish interfacial kinetics severely limits their reversibility and Coulombic efficiency. Here, we propose a surface halogenation strategy that transforms the native amorphous SiO2 passivation layer on silicon particles into a functional Al(Si)OCl composite surface via controlled reaction with AlCl3. This artificial interphase reconciles interfacial incompatibility and enables fast ionic/electronic transport, suppressing irreversible lithium loss. The optimized negative electrode achieves a high initial Coulombic efficiency of 94.3% in half-cells and 85.6% initial Coulombic efficiency (86.6% with pre-lithiation) in full cells paired with LiNi0.88Co0.09Mn0.03O2. Enhanced reversibility further delivers long-term cyclability. The optimized negative electrode delivers 86% capacity retention and 99.998% average Coulombic efficiency over 200 cycles. Even at high-loading ( > 10 mAh cm-2, and no adhesives/conductive carbon/electrolyte), it retains 72% capacity after 500 cycles. The full cells maintain 80% capacity after 200 cycles at 1 C, with an average Coulombic efficiency exceeding 99.95%. The versatility of this halogenation strategy underscores halide chemistry’s broad potential in advancing high-performance, reversible silicon-based solid-state batteries.

 Timely crop mapping is crucial for field management, policy formulation, phenological monitoring, and yield forecasting. However, acquiring sufficient labeled samples in the current year presents a formidable challenge for in-season mapping. Previously proposed solutions mainly include classifier transfer and sample transfer strategies. The classifier transfer strategy trains classifiers with historical samples associated with historical-year features and then transfers the trained historical sample classifiers (HSC) to classify remote sensing data in the current year; the sample transfer strategy generates trusted samples associated with current-year remote sensing features by predicting labels of the current-year sample based on some prior knowledge (e.g., crop rotation pattern) and then trains trusted sample classifiers (TSC) for current-year classification. However, the performance of the classifier-transfer strategy may degrade when there is large interannual feature variation, while the performance of the sample-transfer strategy depends on the reliability of the generated trusted samples. This study proposes a novel approach that integrates the above two strategies for in-season mapping through a sample weighting technique. Firstly, two sample sets, trusted samples and classified samples associated with current-year features, are generated by crop rotation prediction and HSC, respectively. Subsequently, based on an independent assumption between the rotational prediction errors and the current-year remote sensing features, the optimal weights of these two sample sets are derived based on the Bayesian principle. Finally, an optimal weighted sample classifier (OWSC) is trained using the weighted samples for in-season classification. To illustrate the robustness of the proposed OWSC, we compared it with different methods combined with various classification models across four regions with different interannual feature variation and crop rotation stability. Results demonstrated that OWSC maintained its advantages across various regions and different available lengths of historical crop-type sequences. Owing to its independence from specific classifiers, the proposed sample weighting method can be seamlessly applied to any classification model and thus continues to benefit from advances in classification algorithms. Additionally, sensitivity experiments regarding the uncertainty in trusted samples and historical crop-type sequences showed that OWSC performed stably across different scenarios. Therefore, OWSC provides a promising solution for in-season crop mapping without current-year samples."
