The GDP/capita pathways are modifications of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway SSP1 scenario, including one post-growth future for high-income countries and higher growth for all currently lower-income countries. Current inequality levels, together with the total national income from the GDP pathways, determine the inequality reductions required to eradicate poverty in individual countries; they are based on a methodology that specifies the relationship between poverty, inequality, and growth. Our pathways show rapid and sustained reductions in within-country inequality (Gini), even with high economic growth. The speed of redistribution is limited to the highest historically observed changes in inequality. We identify which countries face the greatest difficulties in meeting their poverty eradication targets and estimate the level of international transfers needed to fill the gap for those countries. Our findings reconfirm the importance of reducing within-country inequality in eradicating global poverty."

Despite China’s recent rise as major public finance provider for the electricity sector of the developing world and the related environmental impacts, there is limited knowledge of the extent and characteristics of non-Chinese participation in Chinese-funded projects. We apply complexity theory approaches and network modeling on a new dataset that links funding activities of developmental institutions (Chinese developmental institutions (CDIs), Western-backed multilateral development banks (MDBs)) and the involvement of companies in different roles (i.e., as direct investors, contractors, equipment suppliers, and other service providers) to power plants around the world at the unit-level (1999–2020). Previous literature suggests that CDI funded projects show preference to Chinese commercial partners, but we find more than 70% include non-Chinese participants. This also applies for fossil-fuel based technologies where we observe increasing shares of international actors that together account for nearly every third commercial linkage. However, involvement levels and interaction patterns not only differ by technologies (fossils, hydro, non-hydro renewable, nuclear) but also by the time period and types of commercial partners and we observe overall convergence between the CDI- and MDB-supported power plant networks over time. The decreasing involvement of Chinese companies in CDI-funded projects, across technologies, in favor of increasing Western involvement, has important implications for development and climate policy on which we elaborate. However, the failure of both MDB and CDI funding to promote domestic company involvement in the recipient countries may be the largest failing of both sets of agencies in the pursuit of development outcomes."

Although, many studies have assessed effects of infrastructure on the overall biodiversity, these were often restricted in scope, by assessing only a particular type of infrastructure, such as coastal defence structures, or by focusing solely on diversity metrics. Therefore, we still have little knowledge on the functional impacts of infrastructure, in general, on coastal habitats. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the functional composition of natural and artificial marine habitats. We analysed a total of 68 publications from 26 countries, with data collected between 1995–2019. We found up to 60% more habitat-forming algae on natural habitats than on infrastructure at most tidal heights, but no differences were found when looking at all species of macro-algal, i.e. including non-habitat-formers. In contrast, we found more habitat-forming filter feeders, such as oysters and mussels, on subtidal vertical and floating structures, such as pylons and pontoons, respectively, than on natural habitats. Differences on the abundance of grazers varied with tidal height and/or the type of infrastructure. For example, in the subtidal, grazers were significantly more abundant on natural boulders than on infrastructure, while at low tidal heights, we found significantly less grazers on artificial floating structures and on vertical structures than on natural habitats. With coastal development on the rise, these differences have significant implications for productivity, energy and nutrient flow in coastal systems. Our findings highlight the importance of adopting a functional approach to have a more holistic understanding on the environmental impacts associated to marine urbanisation and thus better inform management and restoration efforts."

However, the effects of evaporation on BBOA volatility and viscosity under different environmental conditions remain poorly understood. This study focuses on the molecular characterization of laboratory-generated BBOA proxies from wood pyrolysis emissions. The initial mixture, “pyrolysis oil (PO1)”, was progressively evaporated to produce more concentrated mixtures (PO1.33, PO2, and PO3) with volume reduction factors of 1.33, 2, and 3, respectively. Chemical speciation and volatility were investigated using temperature-programmed desorption combined with direct analysis in real-time ionization and high-resolution mass spectrometry (TPD-DART-HRMS). This novel approach quantified saturation vapor pressures and enthalpies of individual species, enabling the construction of volatility basis set distributions and the quantification of gas–particle partitioning. Viscosity estimates, validated by poke-flow experiments, showed a significant increase with evaporation, slowing particle-phase diffusion and extending equilibration times. These findings suggest that highly viscous tar ball particles in aged biomass burning emissions form as semivolatile components evaporate. The study highlights the importance of evaporation processes in shaping BBOA properties, underscoring the need to incorporate these factors into atmospheric models for better predictions of BBOA aging and its environmental impact."

This study explored the role of adiponectin receptor 1 (AdipoR1) in EHDPP-induced lipid metabolic disturbances. We examined EHDPP’s binding affinity and transcriptional impact on AdipoR1. AdipoR1 knockdown (AdipoR1kd) human liver cells and coculture experiments with AdipoR1 activator (AdipoRon) were used to investigate the effect and the mechanism. EHDPP disrupted triglyceride and phospholipid synthesis and altered corresponding gene expression, mirroring effects in AdipoR1kd cells but diminishing in EHDPP-treated AdipoR1kd cells. RNA sequencing revealed that EHDPP primarily disrupted oxidative phosphorylation and insulin signaling dependent on AdipoR1. Mechanistically, EHDPP interacted with AdipoR1 and reduced AdipoR1 protein levels at 10–7 mol/L or higher, weakening the activation of the calmodulin dependent protein kinase β (CaMKKβ)/AMPK/acetyl CoA carboxylase pathway. Furthermore, EHDPP pretreatment blocked the increase in Ca2+ flux and the corresponding kinase CaMKKβ, as well as liver kinase B1 (LKB1) activation induced by AdipoRon, which is necessary for AMPK activation. Collectively, these findings demonstrate that EHDPP-induced lipid imbalance is partially dependent on AdipoR1, expanding the understanding of environmental metabolic disruptors beyond nuclear receptors."

In the present study availability, accumulation, and transformation of C4- and C8-fluoroalkylsulfonamide (FASA)-based copolymers were assessed in laboratory-grown earthworms (Eisenia fetida, triplicate of exposure tests and control). Further, a field study on earthworms (18 pooled samples) in sludge-amended soil was conducted to assess the environmental impact of sludge-amended soil with regard to the FASA-based copolymers, together with the applied sludge (n = 3), and the field soils during the period (n = 4). In the laboratory study, the FASA-based copolymers were taken up by the earthworms in concentrations between 19 and 33 ng/g of dw for the C8- and between 767 and 1735 ng/g of dw for the C4-FASA-based copolymer. Higher biota soil accumulation factors (BAFs) were observed for the copolymer with a longer perfluorinated side-chain length (C8, average BAF value of 0.7) compared to the copolymer with a shorter side-chain length (C4, average BAF value of 0.02). Perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetates (FOSAAs) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA), including both branched and linear isomers, were detected after exposure to the C8-FASA-based copolymer. Two metabolites were detected in the earthworms exposed to the C4-FASA-based copolymer: perfluorobutanesulfonamide (FBSA) and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid (PFBS). Although the presence of other monomers or impurities in the copolymer formulation cannot be ruled out, the present laboratory study suggests that the FASA-based copolymers may be an indirect source of lower molecular weight PFAS in the environment through transformation. Elevated levels of C8-FASA-based copolymer were found in the field sludge-amended soil compared to nontreated soil (32 versus 11 ng/g d.w.), and higher concentrations of PFAS in earthworms living in sludge-amended soil compared to nontreated soil (566 versus 103 ng/g d.w.) were observed. These findings imply that the application of sludge is a potential pathway of PFAS to the environment."

It suggests that individual environmental exposures tend toward the average exposure in the study area when considering human mobility. However, the universality of the NEAP across various environmental exposures and the mechanisms underlying its occurrence remain unclear. Here, using a large human mobility data set of more than 27 000 individuals in the Chicago Metropolitan Area, we provide robust evidence of the existence of the NEAP in a range of individual environmental exposures, including green spaces, air pollution, healthy food environments, transit accessibility, and crime rates. We also unveil the social and spatial disparities in the NEAP’s influence on individual environmental exposure estimates. To further reveal the mechanisms behind the NEAP, we perform multiscenario analyses based on environmental variation and human mobility simulations. The results reveal that the NEAP is a statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean (RTM) under the constraints of spatial autocorrelation in environmental data. Increasing travel distances and out-of-home durations can intensify and promote the NEAP’s impact, particularly for highly dynamic environmental factors like air pollution. These findings illuminate the complex interplay between human mobility and environmental factors, guiding more effective public health interventions."

The chemical, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, and microscopic data demonstrated that the U(VI)-sorbed schwertmannite underwent a rapid reductive dissolution and solid-phase transformation to goethite, during which the surface-sorbed U(VI) was partly reduced and mostly repartitioned to monomeric U(VI)/U(IV) complexes by carboxyl and phosphoryl ligands on biomass or organic substances. Furthermore, the microbial data suggest that these processes were likely driven by the consecutive developments of fermentative and sulfate- and iron- reducing microbial communities. In contrast, the U(VI)-sorbed jarosite only stimulated the growth of some fermentative communities and underwent very limited reductive dissolution and thus, remaining in its initial state with no detectable mineralogical transformation and solid-phase U reduction/repartitioning. Accordingly, these two biotic incubations did not induce increased risk of U reliberation to the aqueous phase. These findings have important implications for understanding the interactions of schwertmannite/jarosite with microbial communities and colinked behavior and fate of U following the establishment of reducing conditions in various acidic and U-rich settings."

Here, we investigated the effects of 50, 500, and 5000 μg/kg/d of PTC on glycolipid metabolism in mice following 8 weeks of administration via drinking water, with specific attention on brown adipose tissue (BAT) and white adipose tissue (WAT) in addition to the liver. We found that along with the increased serum triglyceride level in the 5000 μg/kg/d group, small fatty vacuoles occurred in livers in all treatment groups, indicating lipid accumulation. No change in WAT was observed, but PTC caused BAT whitening, characterized by adipocyte hypertrophy, more unilocular adipocytes with enlarged lipid droplets, reduced UCP1 levels, and down-regulated Doi2 expression, and even the dose of 50 μg/kg/d was effective. Transcriptomic analysis revealed immune inhibition and circadian rhythm disturbance in BAT from the 5000 μg/kg/d group, which are in agreement with BAT whitening and inactivation. On employing the C3H10T1/2 cells in vitro, we found that PTC treatment concentration-dependently promoted lipid accumulation in brown adipocytes, along with altered expression of thermogenesis-related and circadian genes. Taken together, our study shows that low doses of PTC caused BAT whitening, calling for much attention to the new target by pollutants."

In a prior study, we introduced a novel method, combining electrical impedance spectroscopy with dynamic mechanical analysis, to quantify single-layer homogeneous membrane compaction up to 12.5 psi. Now we extend the method’s capabilities to quantify real-time compaction of multilayer heterogeneous nanofiltration and reverse osmosis (RO) membranes up to 330 psi. Our findings demonstrate that membrane compaction does not solely occur in the support/backing layer. The air pockets between the polysulfone support and the polyester backing layers, which were not discussed previously, account for up to 18% and 14% of total membrane compaction for the nanofiltration and RO membranes. For the nanofiltration membrane, the majority of compaction (up to 45%) occurs in the void spaces of the backing layer, while for the RO membrane, the majority of compaction (up to 40%) occurs in the solid material of the backing layer. We also confirm, with experimental results, the importance of using compressive testing instead of tensile testing to accurately characterize compaction. Membrane fatigue is characterized by experimental trends including: increasing irrevocable compaction, increasing creep/instantaneous compaction ratios, and increasing strains in hysteresis experiments."

However, the partitioning of fluvial inorganic carbon (IC) between downstream transport and atmospheric evasion remains uncertain due to intricate hydrodynamic and biogeochemical processes. Inspired by Budyko's hydrological work, this study introduces a dimensionless framework to identify critical factors in fluvial IC partitioning: the IC fraction in equilibrium with the atmosphere and the ratio of advection to evasion timescales. River catchment analyses and modeling reveal that the equilibrium ratio determines the fraction of IC stably transported downstream. The hydrodynamic‐driven timescale ratio determines the fate of out‐of‐equilibrium IC, with low‐order streams favoring atmospheric evasion and higher‐order streams promoting downstream transport. This framework provides a simple yet robust approach to predicting river carbon dynamics, with implications for land‐to‐ocean transport, fluvial emissions, and climate mitigation strategies such as enhanced weathering."

To address this, we analyze ocean surface gravity waves (OSWs) from 15 to 40 mHz, which are decoupled from the Lamb wave due to their slower phase velocities. Modeling these OSWs, we infer that the excitation started at 4:00 UTC with an amplitude of 1010 $1{0}^{10}$ N and lasted for 5 hr, followed by a sub‐event at 8:40 UTC. The observations suggest an initial blowout of seawater above the summit and a subsequent outflow that excited a tsunami below 5 mHz.

Recently, a new type of magnetic reconnection, electron‐only reconnection without the coupling of ions, has been observed in various plasma environments. Standard reconnection typically has a reconnection outflow velocity of about one Alfvén speed. According to the scaling analysis, the electron outflow velocity is expected to be about one electron Alfvén speed in electron‐only reconnection. However, observations and simulations both find that the electron outflows are much slower than the electron Alfvén speed. In this letter, by performing two‐dimensional particle‐in‐cell simulations, we show that this is because ions play a role in electron‐only reconnection. The ions move slower than the electrons in the outflow direction, and such charge separation forms an in‐plane Hall electric field, which prevents the electrons from being accelerated to the electron Alfvén speed in electron‐only reconnection."

Tsurf drives higher productivity of tundra plant individuals but leads to less productive individuals in the boreal forest, although with compensatory changes (almost 68%) in vegetation structure.

Here we examine the effects of CO2 concentrations on the biomass δ15N signatures of the diazotrophs Trichodesmium erythraeum and Crocosphaera watsonii, which utilize Mo‐Fe nitrogenase (the most common form of the enzyme). Our results show that these organisms produce biomass with δ15N values up to ∼3‰ lower under both decreased and elevated CO2 concentrations compared to modern levels (∼380 μatm). These deviations from modern CO2 levels reduce nitrogenase enzyme efficiency, leading to increased organismal isotopic fractionation during N2 fixation. This study offers an alternative explanation for the observed fluctuations in geological δ15N records and provides new insights into the past nitrogen cycle on Earth."

We find that mangroves are migrating seaward at a rate of 18% ± 12% m/yr, which can offset landward mangroves loss, 67% of which caused by land use conversion. The fact that mangroves are expanding seaward with accretion rates exceeding SLR suggests that climate change has not yet triggered substantial loss in deltaic mangrove forests. Assuming that present environmental conditions do not change and that sediment and organic deposition in the deltaic topsets match SLR rates, we project that 90% of deltaic mangrove forests may start to retreat after 132–194 years.

We generate velocity and strain rate fields over the southeastern Tibetan Plateau, utilizing Sentinel‐1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data spanning 2014–2023. We derive slip rates using block modeling and by inverting strain rates. Our results show a partitioning between localized strain on faults and distributed deformation. The direct inversion of strain rates matches the geodetic data best when incorporating distributed moment sources, accounting for a similar proportion to on‐fault sources. The direct strain methodology also aligns best with the independent geological slip rates, especially near fault tips.

Previous modeling studies have typically included fluxes from melting glacial ice only as a surface forcing of the ocean or as an offline addition to the sea surface height fields produced by climate models. However, observational estimates suggest that the majority of the meltwater from the Antarctic Ice Sheet actually enters the ocean at depth through ice shelf basal melt. Here we use simulations with an ocean general circulation model in an idealized configuration. The results show that the simulated global sea level change pattern is sensitive to the depth at which Antarctic meltwater enters the ocean. Further analysis suggests that the response is dictated primarily by the steric response to the depth of the meltwater flux."

This study spans a 2‐month period during the wet seasons of 2014 and 2015. We observe a strong correlation between the MCS track density and accumulated precipitation in the Amazon basin. Key factors contributing to precipitation, such as MCS properties (number, size, rainfall intensity, and movement), are thoroughly examined. Our analysis reveals that while the overall model produces fewer MCSs with smaller mean sizes compared to observations, it tends to overpredict total precipitation due to excessive rainfall intensity for heavy rainfall events (≥10 mm hr−1). These biases in simulated MCS properties could vary with the constraints on the convective background environment. Moreover, while the wet bias from heavy (convective) rainfall outweighs the dry bias in light (stratiform) rainfall, the latter can be crucial, particularly when MCS cloud cover is significantly underestimated. A case study for 1 April 2014 highlights the influence of environmental conditions on the MCS lifecycle and identifies an unrealistic model representation in both stratiform and convective precipitation features."

By taking advantage of the high spatio‐temporal resolution of an X‐band dual‐polarized multiparameter phased array radar, this paper employs negative KDP signatures to investigate the variation of electric fields in an isolated thunderstorm within its evolution, and the relationship between the negative KDP signatures and intracloud (IC) lightning activity. The results show that the radar‐inferred strong electric fields distributed in a region of about 8.5–10 km during the developing stage, then extended from about 10 km to the cloud top during the mature stage, with an increasing IC lightning flash rate before the end of the mature stage. Subsequently, the electric fields weakened associated with a large amount of IC lightning discharges. The qualitative analysis results indicate that the evolution of the radar‐inferred electric fields associated with the upper charge regions is consistent with the electrification process in the isolated thunderstorm, inferred by the IC lighting activity. In addition, there is a tendency for the increased IC lightning rate as the decrease in average composite KDP in the middle and upper layers of the thunderstorm, with a time lag of about 5.5 min between the minimum average composite KDP and the peak IC lightning rate, while a good correlation between the negative KDP volume and the IC lightning flash rate at a lag of approximately 9 min."

Kirschbaum,Landslide Hazard Is Projected to Increase Across High Mountain Asia,"High Mountain Asia has long been known as a hotspot for landslide risk, and studies have suggested that landslide hazard is likely to increase in this region over the coming decades. Extreme precipitation may become more frequent, with a nonlinear response relative to increasing global temperatures. However, these changes are geographically varied. This article maps probable changes to landslide hazard, as shown by a landslide hazard indicator (LHI) derived from downscaled precipitation and temperature. In order to capture the nonlinear response of slopes to extreme precipitation, a simple machine‐learning model was trained on a database of landslides across High Mountain Asia to develop a regional LHI. This model was applied to statistically downscaled data from the 30 members of the Seamless System for Prediction and Earth System Research large ensembles to produce a range of possible outcomes under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways 2‐4.5 and 5‐8.5. The LHI reveals that landslide hazard will increase in most parts of High Mountain Asia. Absolute increases will be highest in already hazardous areas such as the Central Himalaya, but relative change is greatest on the Tibetan Plateau. Even in regions where landslide hazard declines by year 2100, it will increase prior to the mid‐century mark. However, the seasonal cycle of landslide occurrence will not change greatly across High Mountain Asia. Although substantial uncertainty remains in these projections, the overall direction of change seems reliable. These findings highlight the importance of continued analysis to inform disaster risk reduction strategies for stakeholders across High Mountain Asia."

However, plants have the capacity to acclimate to rising temperatures by adjusting Topt, thereby maintaining or even enhancing photosynthesis and carbon uptake. Despite this, it remains unclear how Topt of vegetation activity changes over time and to what extent global vegetation can acclimate to current temperature changes. In this study, we evaluated the temporal trends of Topt of vegetation activity and the thermal acclimation magnitudes globally using three remote‐sensed vegetation indices and eddy‐covariance observations of gross primary productivity from 1982 to 2020. We found that the global Topt of vegetation activity has increased at an average rate of 0.63°C per decade over the past four decades. The increase in Topt closely tracked the rise in annual maximum daily mean temperature (Tmax), indicating that thermal acclimation has occurred widely across the globe. Globally, we found an average thermal acclimation magnitude of 0.38°C per 1°C increase in Tmax. Notably, polar and continental regions exhibited the highest thermal acclimation magnitudes, while arid areas showed the lowest. Additionally, the thermal acclimation magnitude was positively affected by interannual temperature variability and negatively affected by soil moisture and vapor pressure deficits. Our findings indicate that terrestrial ecosystems have acclimated to current climate warming trends with varying degrees, suggesting a greater potential for land carbon uptake. Moreover, these results highlight the necessity for earth system models to integrate the thermal acclimation of Topt to better forecast the global carbon cycle."

However, the inherent limitations of this remote sensing technique make it difficult to assess rivers unless ambient conditions are cloud‐free, devoid of steep terrain and the rivers are at least 60 m wide. To address these challenges that limit the spatiotemporal continuity of satellite‐based hydro‐thermal data, we harnessed the extensive coverage from the Landsat missions' thermal infrared sensors and data‐driven techniques to estimate surface water temperature of rivers. Out of the tested data‐driven techniques, we selected the Random Forest Regressor as our prime non‐linear approach for estimation of surface water temperature in rivers. Using the selected technique, proposed as THORR (Thermal History of Regulated Rivers), we successfully reconstructed a multi‐decadal, continuous spatiotemporal surface water temperature record for regulated rivers in the Columbia River Basin. Using 42 years of data, the surface water temperature could be predicted on average with 0.71° C of absolute error regardless of the dam's potential thermal influence in the downstream reaches. The reconstructed hydro‐thermal behavior generated from THORR revealed a long‐term downstream warming trend along the Columbia River. The open‐source THORR tool can be extended to any river system around the world that is not gauged with in‐situ temperature measurements for the reconstruction of hydro‐thermal behavior."

 The lower limb of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation is an important feature of Earth’s climate system as it returns recently ventilated water to the deep ocean and is a major sink for anthropogenic carbon. The Deep Western Boundary Current—the primary component of the lower limb—flows southwards along the eastern flank of Greenland transporting dense water formed in the Nordic seas. Since 2014, the Deep Western Boundary Current has been continuously monitored at this location from a mooring array to observe the current’s velocity and hydrographic structure close to its source. Here we find that the Deep Western Boundary Current transport has decreased by 26% over the first six years of observations, due to (1) a thinning of the traditionally defined Deep Western Boundary Current layer (σθ > 27.8 kg m−3) from a known freshening signal propagating through the subpolar region (56%), and (2) weakening velocities (44%). Despite this decrease, the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation has remained relatively steady over the same period. Ultimately, this difference is due to the methods used to define these two circulations. Finding such notably different trends for two seemingly dependent circulations raises the question of how to best define these transports. The amount of water transported southwards by the Deep Western Boundary Current shows a 26% decline since 2014 in mooring array monitoring data, despite the strength of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation remaining stable."

 Anoxygenic phototrophic Fe(II) oxidizers (photoferrotrophs) are thought to have thrived in Earth’s ancient ferruginous oceans and played a primary role in the precipitation of Archaean and Palaeoproterozoic (3.8–1.85-billion-year-old) banded iron formations (BIFs). The end of BIF deposition by photoferrotrophs has been interpreted as the result of a deepening of water-column oxygenation below the photic zone, concomitant with the proliferation of cyanobacteria. However, photoferrotrophs may have experienced competition from other anaerobic Fe(II)-oxidizing microorganisms, altering the formation mechanism of BIFs. Here we utilize microbial incubations to show that nitrate-reducing Fe(II) oxidizers metabolically outcompete photoferrotrophs for dissolved Fe(II). Moreover, both experiments and numerical modelling show that the nitrate-reducing Fe(II) oxidizers inhibit photoferrotrophy via the production of toxic intermediates. Four different photoferrotrophs, representing both green sulfur and purple non-sulfur bacteria, are susceptible to this toxic effect despite having genomic capabilities for nitric oxide detoxification. Indeed, despite nitric oxide detoxification mechanisms being ubiquitous in some groups of phototrophs at the genomic level (for example, Chlorobi and Cyanobacteria) it is likely that they would still be affected. We suggest that the production of reactive nitrogen species during nitrate-reducing Fe(II) oxidation in ferruginous environments may have inhibited the activity of photoferrotrophs in the ancient oceans and thus impeded their role in the precipitation of BIFs.

 The Pacific Walker circulation and the closely connected El Niño/Southern Oscillation influence the climate and weather of the tropical Indo-Pacific region. They specifically exert a strong control on the regional occurrence of weather extremes, such as heatwaves, heavy precipitation and prolonged dry spells, which are becoming increasingly frequent and severe. However, climate models struggle to accurately simulate large-scale circulation changes in the tropics and thus their consequences for regional weather and future climate. Here we use high-resolution ERA5 reanalysis data from 1940 to 2022 to study the occurrence trends of weather patterns in the tropical Indo-Pacific region. We find that new large-scale synoptic situations that were rarely present before the 1990s have emerged in the Indo-Pacific, while some others that were prominent have disappeared. Those new synoptic situations are associated with an unusual proportion of heatwaves and extreme precipitation in the region. These weather patterns are physically consistent with a trend towards a stronger Pacific Walker circulation, wetter and warmer conditions in Southeast Asia and drier conditions in the equatorial Pacific. These changes cannot be fully explained by El Niño/Southern Oscillation and other relevant modes of interannual variability, and other factors such as global warming, aerosol forcing, external forcing mechanisms and nonlinear mode interactions may be contributing.

 The Antarctic Peninsula has experienced considerable anthropogenic warming in recent decades.

Analysis of Landsat archives (1986–2021) using a Google Earth Engine cloud-processing workflow suggest widespread greening across the Antarctic Peninsula.

Here, the authors discover that SNHG26 interacts with ILF2, redirecting it from inflammatory genomic loci to the LAMB3 locus, thereby promoting wound healing. 
 The cell transition from an inflammatory phase to a subsequent proliferative phase is crucial for wound healing, yet the driving mechanism remains unclear. By profiling lncRNA expression changes during human skin wound healing and screening lncRNA functions, we identify SNHG26 as a pivotal regulator in keratinocyte progenitors underpinning this phase transition. Snhg26-deficient mice exhibit impaired wound repair characterized by delayed re-epithelization accompanied by exacerbated inflammation. Single-cell transcriptome analysis combined with gain-of-function and loss-of-function of SNHG26 in vitro and ex vivo reveals its specific role in facilitating inflammatory-to-proliferative state transition of keratinocyte progenitors. A mechanistic study unravels that SNHG26 interacts with and relocates the transcription factor ILF2 from inflammatory genomic loci, such as JUN, IL6, IL8, and CCL20, to the genomic locus of LAMB3. Collectively, our findings suggest that lncRNAs play cardinal roles in expediting tissue repair and regeneration and may constitute an invaluable reservoir of therapeutic targets in reparative medicine.

Here, the authors show that the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor ONECUT3 controls the differentiation of hypothalamic neurons through NAV2. 
 Acquisition of specialized cellular features is controlled by the ordered expression of transcription factors (TFs) along differentiation trajectories. Here, we find a member of the Onecut TF family, ONECUT3, expressed in postmitotic neurons that leave their Ascl1+/Onecut1/2+ proliferative domain in the vertebrate hypothalamus to instruct neuronal differentiation. We combined single-cell RNA-seq and gain-of-function experiments for gene network reconstruction to show that ONECUT3 affects the polarization and morphogenesis of both hypothalamic GABA-derived dopamine and thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH)+ glutamate neurons through neuron navigator-2 (NAV2). In vivo, siRNA-mediated knockdown of ONECUT3 in neonatal mice reduced NAV2 mRNA, as well as neurite complexity in Onecut3-containing neurons, while genetic deletion of Onecut3/ceh-48 in C. elegans impaired neurocircuit wiring, and sensory discrimination-based behaviors. Thus, ONECUT3, conserved across neuronal subtypes and many species, underpins the polarization and morphological plasticity of phenotypically distinct neurons that descend from a common pool of Ascl1+ progenitors in the hypothalamus. Neuronal maturation is controlled by an ordered expression of TFs during development. Here, the authors show that the evolutionarily conserved transcription factor ONECUT3 controls the differentiation of hypothalamic neurons through NAV2."

 Molecular ferroelectrics have made breakthrough progress in intrinsic piezoelectric response that can be on par with advanced inorganic piezoelectric ceramics. However, their successful applications in high-density energy harvesting and self-powered flexible devices have been great challenge, owing to the low elastic moduli, intrinsically brittle, and fracture proneness of such material systems under mechanical loading. Here, we have developed a flexible porous composite piezoelectric material by using soft thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) and molecular ferroelectric materials. Benefiting from the porous structure of TPU, the flexible piezoelectric composites enable effectively large doping ratio (50%) of [Me3NCH2Cl]CdCl3 (TMCM-CdCl3) and highly efficient stress absorption, coupled with the excellent piezoelectric properties of TMCM-CdCl3, to realize a superior power density (636.9 µW cm−2 or 1273.9 µW cm−3). This output is 2000 times higher than that of flexible piezoelectric materials represented by poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF).

 The distal region of the uterine (Fallopian) tube is commonly associated with high-grade serous carcinoma (HGSC), the predominant and most aggressive form of ovarian or extra-uterine cancer. Specific cell states and lineage dynamics of the adult tubal epithelium (TE) remain insufficiently understood, hindering efforts to determine the cell of origin for HGSC. Here, we report a comprehensive census of cell types and states of the mouse uterine tube. We show that distal TE cells expressing the stem/progenitor cell marker Slc1a3 can differentiate into both secretory (Ovgp1+) and ciliated (Fam183b+) cells. Inactivation of Trp53 and Rb1, whose pathways are commonly altered in HGSC, leads to elimination of targeted Slc1a3+ cells by apoptosis, thereby preventing their malignant transformation. In contrast, pre-ciliated cells (Krt5+, Prom1+, Trp73+) remain cancer-prone and give rise to serous tubal intraepithelial carcinomas and overt HGSC. These findings identify transitional pre-ciliated cells as a cancer-prone cell state and point to pre-ciliation mechanisms as diagnostic and therapeutic targets.

 Ryanodine Receptor isoform 3 (RyR3) is a large ion channel found in the endoplasmic reticulum membrane of many different cell types. Within the hippocampal region of the brain, it is found in dendritic spines and regulates synaptic plasticity. It controls myogenic tone in arteries and is upregulated in skeletal muscle in early development. RyR3 has a unique functional profile with a very high sensitivity to activating ligands, enabling high gain in Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release. Here we solve high-resolution cryo-EM structures of RyR3 in non-activating and activating conditions, revealing structural transitions that occur during channel opening. Addition of activating ligands yields only open channels, indicating an intrinsically high open probability under these conditions. RyR3 has reduced binding affinity to the auxiliary protein FKBP12.6 due to several sequence variations in the binding interface. We map disease-associated sequence variants and binding sites for known pharmacological agents. The N-terminal region contains ligand binding sites for a putative chloride anion and ATP, both of which are targeted by sequence variants linked to epileptic encephalopathy.

 Domestication – the artificial selection of wild species to obtain variants with traits of human interest – was integral to the rise of complex societies. The oversupply of food was probably associated with the formalization of food preservation strategies through microbial fermentation. While considerable literature exists on the antiquity of fermented food, only few eukaryotic microbes have been studied so far for signs of domestication, less is known for bacteria. Here, we tested if cheese starter cultures harbour typical hallmarks of domestication by characterising over 100 community samples and over 100 individual strains isolated from historical and modern traditional Swiss cheese starter cultures. We find that cheese starter cultures have low genetic diversity both at the species and strain-level and maintained stable phenotypic traits. Molecular clock dating further suggests that the evolutionary origin of the bacteria approximately coincided with the first archaeological records of cheese making. Finally, we find evidence for ongoing genome decay and pseudogenization via transposon insertion related to a reduction of their niche breadth. Future work documenting the prevalence of these hallmarks across diverse fermented food systems and geographic regions will be key to unveiling the joint history of humanity with fermented food microbes.

 One of the most captivating properties of polaritons is their capacity to confine light at the nanoscale. This confinement is even more extreme in two-dimensional (2D) materials. 2D polaritons have been investigated by optical measurements using an external photodetector. However, their effective spectrally resolved electrical detection via far-field excitation remains unexplored. This hinders their exploitation in crucial applications such as sensing, hyperspectral imaging, and optical spectrometry, banking on their potential for integration with silicon technologies.

Subsequently, we electrically detect these mid-infrared resonators by near-field coupling to a graphene pn-junction. The nanoresonators simultaneously exhibit extreme lateral confinement and high-quality factors.

 Anemia is highly prevalent globally, especially in young children in low-income countries, where it often overlaps with a high burden of diarrheal disease. Distribution of iron interventions (as supplements or iron-containing multiple micronutrient powders, MNPs) is a key anemia reduction strategy. Small studies in Africa indicate iron may reprofile the gut microbiome towards pathogenic species. We seek to evaluate the safety of iron and MNPs based on their effects on diversity, composition, and function of the gut microbiome in children in rural Bangladesh as part of a large placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial of iron or MNPs given for 3 months (ACTRN12617000660381). In 923 infants, we evaluate the microbiome before, immediately following, and nine months after interventions, using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and shotgun metagenomics in a subset. We identify no increase in diarrhea with either treatment. In our primary analysis, neither iron nor MNPs alter gut microbiome diversity or composition. However, when not adjusting for multiple comparisons, compared to placebo, children receiving iron and MNPs exhibit reductions in commensal species (e.g., Bifidobacterium, Lactobacillus) and increases in potential pathogens, including Clostridium. These increases are most evident in children with baseline iron repletion and are further supported by trend-based statistical analyses.

 Climate change and inequality are critical and interrelated issues. Despite growing empirical evidence on the distributional implications of climate policies and climate risks, mainstream model-based assessments are often silent on the interplay between climate change and economic inequality. Here we fill this gap through an ensemble of eight large-scale integrated assessment models that belong to different economic paradigms and feature income heterogeneity. We quantify the distributional implications of climate impacts and of the varying compensation schemes of climate policies compatible with the goals of the Paris Agreement. By 2100, climate impacts will increase inequality by 1.4 points of the Gini index on average. Maintaining global mean temperature below 1.5 °C reduces long-term inequality increase by two-thirds but increases it slightly in the short term. However, equal per-capita redistribution can offset the short-term effect, lowering the Gini index by almost two points. We quantify model uncertainty and find robust evidence that well-designed policies can help stabilize climate and promote economic inclusion.

Here, the projections of the EDJ in a multimodel ensemble of CMIP6 are scrutinised by using a multiparametric description of the EDJ. The multimodel mean projects non-stationary responses of the EDJ latitude through the winter, characterised by a poleward shift in early winter and equator migration in late winter. These intraseasonal shifts (rather than a genuine narrowing) explain the previously established squeezing of the EDJ and are linked to the future changes in different drivers: the 200 hPa meridional temperature gradient and Atlantic warming hole in early winter, and the stratospheric vortex in late winter.

 Prompt ElastoGravity Signals are light-speed gravity-induced signals recorded before the arrival of seismic waves. They have raised interest for early warning applications but their weak amplitudes close to the background seismic noise have questioned their actual potential for operational use. A deep-learning model has recently demonstrated its ability to mitigate this noise limitation and to provide in near real-time the earthquake magnitude (Mw). However, this approach was efficient only for large earthquakes (Mw ≥ 8.3) of known focal mechanism. Here we show unprecedented performance in full earthquake characterization using the dense broadband seismic network deployed in Alaska and Western Canada. Our deep-learning model provides accurate magnitude and focal mechanism estimates of Mw ≥ 7.8 earthquakes, 2 minutes after origin time (hence the tsunamigenic potential). Our results represent a major step towards the routine use of prompt elastogravity signals in operational warning systems, and demonstrate its potential for tsunami warning in densely-instrumented areas.

A focus on increased data coverage in the Global South, long-term and multiple stressors studies and improved ecosystem models are promising avenues to improve our understanding. 
 Human activities and climate change substantially threaten coastal areas, impacting ecosystem functions, services, and human-wellbeing. Trace elements, from both natural and anthropogenic sources, can contaminate coastal regions, and at high concentrations may become toxic to marine biota. Climate change is likely to affect the sources, sinks and cycling of trace elements in coastal systems: for example, riverine runoff is set to increase as precipitation in the Arctic intensifies, and more frequent extreme floods are expected to activate previously deeply buried trace elements. Furthermore, changes in human activity under a warming climate, such as increased Arctic shipping and potential geoengineering projects such as ocean alkalinity enhancement, will likely introduce more trace elements to coastal ecosystems. Advancing our understanding of trace element cycling is at present limited by factors including lack of data coverage in the Global South, challenges in studying multi-stressor effects and ecosystem responses, lack of long-term data, and the difficulty in parametrizing robust models in coastal environments.

 Interregional transport plays a significant role in haze formation with varying and disputable contribution extent. Current research on quantitatively analyzing interregional atmospheric pollution transport has mainly relied on meteorological and chemical models. However, these models are typically affected by uncertainties due to the assumptions and simplifications inherent in the numerical simulations and source emission estimations. In this study, a comprehensive optical flow framework is developed to offer a new perspective on quantitative characterization of interregional transport of atmospheric pollution based on synergistic observations from geostationary and sun-synchronous satellites. In this framework, the high-frequency continuous aerosol observing images are regarded as video in computer vision, and an aerosol dynamic optical flow algorithm is proposed by incorporating aerosol-specific assumptions and constraints, overcoming the limitation that traditional optical flow methods are typically confined to rigid bodies. Results demonstrate that the developed optical flow framework could distinguish the aerosol transport process from other dynamic processes of aerosol development and accurately capture the fast-changing details of transport processes. Moreover, the satellite-based optical flow framework achieves aerosol transport results comparable to those of widely accepted model-based methods, demonstrating the physical interpretation of pixel-based optical flow results and highlighting its effectiveness in quantitative characterization of the atmospheric pollution transport process via the Aerosol Transport Index (ATI). Furthermore, a case analysis of long-term assessments of interregional transport of atmospheric pollution indicates that Beijing acts as a “sink” of atmospheric pollution, and a downward trend could be found from the annually averaged transported aerosol net loadings due to the emission reduction policy. Compared with model-based methods, the satellite-based optical flow framework is directly grounded in observations and does not rely on emission inventories that take years to update. Therefore, it not only helps improve understanding the patterns of atmospheric pollution interregional transport, but also provides a more efficient and economical way to assess the effectiveness of regional joint control policy."

 Detecting early signs of impending eruptions and monitoring the evolution of volcanic phenomena are fundamental objectives of applied volcanology, both essential for timely assessment of associated hazards. Thermal remote sensing proves to be a cost-effective, yet reliable, information source for these purposes, especially for the hundreds of volcanoes still lacking conventional ground-based monitoring networks. In this work, we present an innovative and effective single band TIR-based (11.45 μm) algorithm (TIRVolcH), capable of detecting thermal anomalies in a broad range of volcanic settings, from low-temperature hydrothermal systems to high-temperature effusive events. Based on the processing of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) scenes, the algorithm offers an unprecedented trade-off between spatial (375 m) and temporal resolution (multiple acquisitions per day), having the potential to detect thermal anomalies for pixel-integrated temperatures as low as 0.5 K above the background, while maintaining a false positive rate of ∼1.8 %. The analysis of decadal time series of VIIRS data (2012−2023), acquired at three different volcanoes, reveals how the algorithm can: (i) detect hydrothermal crises at fumarolic fields (Vulcano, Italy), (ii) unveil thermal unrest preceding dome extrusions and explosive eruptions (Agung, Indonesia), and (iii) spatially trace lava flows extent and quantify their advancement rate, as well as track their long-term cooling behaviour (La Palma, Spain).We envisage that the algorithm will prove instrumental for detecting early signs of volcanic activity and following the evolution of eruptive phenomena, providing a useful tool for hazard management and risk reduction applications. Furthermore, the compilation of statistically robust multidecadal thermal datasets will provide novel insights and new perspectives into volcano monitoring, laying the ground for forthcoming higher-resolution TIR missions."

 Mangroves face decline and degradation due to human activities and natural forces, making their accurate mapping and dynamic monitoring essential. However, most of the existing mangrove indices that rely on multispectral image spectral characteristics suffer from limitations in terms of recognition accuracy and universality. Therefore, this study aimed to develop a robust and efficient Phenology and Water level Time-series Mangrove Index (PWTMI) for mangrove monitoring. PWTMI is constructed by combining spectral and temporal characteristics from dense time-series multispectral data, wherein phenology and water level time-series characteristics are extracted from NDVI and MNDWI time series. The results show that PWTMI outperforms existing multispectral-based mangrove indices and has an accuracy similar to a hyperspectral-based mangrove index, with overall accuracy ranging from 91.49% to 98.83% and F1 score ranging from 0.91 to 0.98 in four typical areas in China, indicating great potential for long time-series and large-scale mangrove monitoring."

 The Loess Plateau in China is renowned for its dense gullies and complex terrain, with drastic changes primarily due to soil erosion and human activities, significantly affecting the evolution of the ecological environment. The complex terrains and dense vegetation make precise terrain measurement and modeling challenging. Although the development of Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) light detection and ranging (LiDAR) scanning and photogrammetry technologies has improved data acquisition precision, relying solely on one remote sensing technology struggles with accurately extracting bare earth information. This study adopted a method that fuses UAV lidar scanning with aerial photogrammetric imagery, generating detailed lidar point cloud data that includes coordinate, reflectance, true color, and texture information to enhance data classifiability and interpretability. Subsequently, a point cloud classification model based on the Transformer architecture (Stratified Transformer) is introduced to intelligently complete the initial ground point cloud extraction in complex gully terrains. Further, to address residual non-ground noise in the initial ground point clouds, a new point cloud classification optimization algorithm (MDD, Multi-scale C2M Distance Difference) is proposed. This algorithm, based on the characteristics of discrete and non-continuous with the ground surface of the noisy point clouds, effectively eliminates the discrete noisy point clouds by analyzing the distances between the point clouds and TINs (Triangular Irregular Networks) of different scales and their differences. This study effectively addresses the technical challenges of ground point cloud extraction in the mixed environment of complex terrain and vegetation, solving the problem of precise terrain measurement and intelligent data processing in complex gully terrains, and offering new technical pathways for detecting geomorphological changes."

 Existing methods for matching multi-modal remote sensing images (MRSI) demonstrate considerable adaptability. However, high-precision matching for rectification remains challenging due to differing imaging mechanisms in cross-modal remote sensing images, leading to numerous non-repeated detailed feature points. Additionally, assuming linear transformations between images conflicts with the complex aberrations present in remote sensing images, limiting matching accuracy. This paper aims to elevate matching accuracy by implementing a detailed texture removal strategy that effectively isolates repeatable structural features. Subsequently, we construct a radiation-invariant similarity function within a generalized gradient framework for least-squares matching, specifically designed to mitigate nonlinear geometric and radiometric distortions across MRSIs. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple datasets, employing substantial manual checkpoints, demonstrate that our method significantly enhances matching accuracy for image data involving multiple modal combinations and outperforms the current state-of-the-art solutions in matching accuracy. Additionally, rectification experiments employing WorldView and TanDEM-X images validate our method’s ability to achieve a matching accuracy of 1.05 pixels, thereby indicating its practical utility and generalization capacity.

 Inversion based on observational data and the source-receptor relationship (SRR) simulated by an air quality model is an effective means to estimate NOx emissions. However, the SRR bias induced by the inherent uncertainty of the simulated model leads to potential errors in the inversed emissions, but this is seldom considered in NOx inversion. In this study, we constructed an inversion model based on the SRR correction (IMSC) by introducing a correction matrix, combined with joint regularization scheme and genetic algorithm. We innovated the dynamic acquisition method of center-restricted parameters for the correction matrix, combined this with other parts of the IMSC, attaining the multi-month and multi-region pollutant emission inversion. Hypothetical examples demonstrated that the IMSC effectively corrected the SRR and accurately estimated the NOx emissions. The IMSC was used to estimate Linyi county-level NOx emissions for January, April, July and October (typical months) during 2020 and 2021. An inversion model without SRR correction (IMWSC) was developed for comparison with the IMSC. Results showed that the IMSC more accurately, robustly, and reasonably estimated NOx emissions. Compared to the IMWSC, the IMSC improved the mean correlation between NOx emissions and NO2 observational concentrations by 25.0%, enhancing the correlation between NOx emissions and NO2 column concentrations by 111.3%. The similar NOx emission change ratios (σaverage = 5.1%) between the typical months in 2021 and 2020 among the different counties indicated a more robust performance of the IMSC than the IMWSC (σaverage = 55.2%). In addition, the NOx emissions inversed by the IMSC also showed better consistency with social activity levels (i.e., electricity consumption). The typical monthly Linyi's county-level NOx emission characterization was also studied. NOx emissions were lower in April, July, and October 2021 than the same period in 2020 due to COVID-19 and pollution controls.

 In Mediterranean countries, such as Greece, the frequency of forest fires has increased in recent years, primarily due to the widespread impacts of climate change. At the end of August 2023, Greece experienced a record-breaking heatwave that triggered severe wildfire incidents, significantly impacting the atmospheric conditions of several cities, among them Thessaloniki. A significant number of wildfires occurred in northern Greece (Evros), burning thousands of hectares of the protected Dadia forest (Natura 2000) and releasing a significant load of smoke into the atmosphere. According to the European Strategy Forum on Research Infrastructures (ESFRI) a total area of 90,000 ha was burnt collectively by the Evros extreme wildfires during August 2023. The emissions led to severely adverse air pollution conditions, causing reduced visibility across an extended eastern Mediterranean region for several days. In this work, we analyze the influence of the transported biomass burning particles on the aerosol properties in the free troposphere, as well as on the surface UV radiation levels over Thessaloniki during the last week of August 2023. The transported smoke plume was detected over the Laboratory of Atmospheric Physics (LAP) in Thessaloniki, approximately 240 km away from the burning area, from August 22nd to the 25th. During this period, the presence of smoke led to exceptionally increased levels of aerosol optical depth (AOD), reaching up to 3.4 at 340 nm (the highest ever recorded in Thessaloniki), as well as high Ångström exponent (AE) values, peaking at 2.4 for the 440–870 nm range, followed by high Fine Mode Fractions (FMFs), indicating the prevalence of fine-mode smoke aerosol particle. Moreover, during the event, the presence of the biomass burning aerosols led to a strong attenuation of the solar UV irradiance by up to 90 %, reaching unprecedented levels, similar of a solar eclipse. The primary goal of this study is to highlight the extensive impacts that wildfires have, which are anticipated to increase in frequency in the near future, due to the predicted rise in the rate of occurrence of summer heatwaves especially for Mediterranean areas and specifically for Greece. Furthermore, the great value of the synergistic monitoring of the event with ground-based remote sensing instrumentation, along with satellite aerosol observations and modeling tools, is made prominent."

Here, our single-cell RNA sequencing data identify a subpopulation of macrophages expressing high levels of the phagocytic receptor MER proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase (MerTK+macrophages), which is closely associated with melanoma progression and immunotherapy resistance. Adoptive transfer of the MerTK+macrophages into recipient mice notably accelerated tumor growth regardless of macrophage depletion. Mechanistic studies further revealed that ALK And LTK Ligand 1 (ALKAL1), a target gene of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), facilitated MerTK phosphorylation, resulting in heightened phagocytic activity of MerTK+macrophages and their subsequent polarization toward an immunosuppressive phenotype. Specifically targeted delivery of AhR antagonist to tumor-associated macrophages with mannosylated micelles could suppress MerTK expression and improved the therapeutic efficacy of anti–programmed cell death ligand 1 therapy. Our findings shed light on the regulatory mechanism of MerTK+macrophages and provide strategies for improving the efficacy of melanoma immunotherapy."

Plant-derived membrane interfaces, engulfing invasive hyphal projections of fungal and oomycete pathogens, are prominent junctures dictating infection outcomes. Understanding how pathogens transform these host-pathogen interfaces to their advantage remains a key biological question. Here, we identified a conserved effector, secreted by plant pathogenic oomycetes, that co-opts a host Rab GTPase-activating protein (RabGAP), TOPGAP, to remodel the host-pathogen interface. The effector, PiE354, hijacks TOPGAP as a susceptibility factor to usurp its GAP activity on Rab8a, a key Rab GTPase crucial for defense-related secretion. By hijacking TOPGAP, PiE354 purges Rab8a from the plasma membrane, diverting Rab8a-mediated immune trafficking away from the pathogen interface. This mechanism signifies an uncanny evolutionary adaptation of a pathogen effector in co-opting a host regulatory component to subvert defense-related secretion, thereby providing unprecedented mechanistic insights into the reprogramming of host membrane dynamics by pathogens."

Human osteoarchaeological remains preserve small molecules, making them valuable for studies that aim to examine past conditions. We test if there are molecular differences in the metabolome of cortical bone between archaeological individuals who used tobacco and those who did not, and if these differences are distinct enough to assign tobacco use status to individuals with unknown tobacco use. Cortical bone of 323 known and unknown tobacco users was studied by an untargeted metabolomics assay using a liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry platform. We identified 45 discriminating molecular features that differed between tobacco consumers (15 up-regulated features) and nonconsumers (17 up-regulated features). Tobacco consumption leaves a metabolic record in human bone distinctive enough to identify its use in individuals of unknown tobacco consumption. Future work will validate molecular features relating to tobacco consumption."

We describe an unrecognized role for tumor necrosis factor–related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) in potentiating neo-angiogenesis and vessel stabilization. We show that the endothelium is a major source of TRAIL in the healthy circulation compromised in peripheral artery disease (PAD). EC deletion of TRAIL in vivo or in vitro inhibited neo-angiogenesis, pericyte recruitment, and vessel stabilization, resulting in reduced lower-limb blood perfusion with ischemia. Activation of the TRAIL receptor (TRAIL-R) restored blood perfusion and stable blood vessel networks in mice. Proof-of-concept studies showed that Conatumumab, an agonistic TRAIL-R2 antibody, promoted vascular sprouts from explanted patient arteries. Single-cell RNA sequencing revealed heparin-binding EGF-like growth factor in mediating EC-pericyte communications dependent on TRAIL. These studies highlight unique TRAIL-dependent mechanisms mediating neo-angiogenesis and vessel stabilization and the potential of repurposing TRAIL-R2 agonists to stimulate stable and functional microvessel networks to treat ischemia in PAD."

Here, we present a fluid-based strategy for localizing intravascular therapeutics that leverages surface tension and immiscible fluid interactions, to allow confined and focal treatment at brain aneurysm sites. We first show, computationally and experimentally, that an immiscible phase can be robustly positioned at the neck of human aneurysm models to seal and isolate the aneurysm’s cavity for further treatment, including in wide-neck aneurysms. We then demonstrate localized delivery and confined treatment, by selective staining of cell nuclei within the aneurysm cavity as well as by hydrogel-based embolization in patient-specific aneurysm models. Altogether, our interfacial flow-driven strategy offers a potential approach for intravascular localized treatment of cardiovascular and other diseases."

We find that modest delay of paternal mitochondrial elimination (PME) inCaenorhabditis elegansembryos unexpectedly impairs mating and cognition of adult animals and alters their locomotion behaviors. Delayed PME causes decreased adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels in early embryos, which lead to impaired physiological functions of adult animals through an energy-sensing pathway mediated by an adenosine monophosphate (AMP)–activated protein kinase, AAK-2, and a forkhead box class O (FOXO) transcription factor, DAF-16. Treatment of PME-delayed animals with MK-4, a subtype of vitamin K2that can improve mitochondrial ATP production, restores ATP levels in early embryos, and rescues physiological defects of adult animals. Our results suggest that moderate PME delay during embryo development adversely affects crucial physiological functions in adults, which could be evolutionarily disadvantageous. These observations provide mechanistic explanations for the need to swiftly remove paternal mitochondria early during embryo development."

During initial infection, HPV16, the most prevalent cancer-causing type, specifically interacts with heparan sulfates (HSs), not only enabling initial cell attachment but also triggering a crucial conformational change in viral capsids termed structural activation. It is unknown, whether these HPV16-HS interactions depend on HS sulfation patterns. Thus, we probed potential roles of HS sulfations using cell-based functional and physicochemical assays, including single-molecule force spectroscopy. Our results demonstrate that N-sulfation of HS is crucial for virus binding and structural activation by providing high-affinity sites, and that additional 6O-sulfation is required to mechanically stabilize the interaction, whereas 2O-sulfation and 3O-sulfation are mostly dispensable. Together, our findings identify the contribution of HS sulfation patterns to HPV16 binding and structural activation and reveal how distinct sulfation groups of HS synergize to facilitate HPV16 entry, which, in turn, likely influences the tropism of HPVs."

The major pro-fission DRP1 receptor is mitochondrial fission factor (MFF), and mitochondrial dynamics proteins of 49 and 51 kilodaltons (MiD49/51), which can sequester inactive DRP1. Together, they form a trimeric DRP1-MiD-MFF complex. Adenosine monophosphate–activated protein kinase (AMPK)–mediated phosphorylation of MFF is necessary for mitochondrial fragmentation, but the molecular mechanisms are unclear. Here, we identify MFF as a target of small ubiquitin-like modifier (SUMO) at Lys151, MFF SUMOylation is enhanced following AMPK-mediated phosphorylation and that MFF SUMOylation regulates the level of MiD binding to MFF. The mitochondrial stressor carbonyl cyanide 3-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) promotes MFF SUMOylation and mitochondrial fragmentation. However, CCCP-induced fragmentation is impaired in MFF-knockout mouse embryonic fibroblasts expressing non-SUMOylatable MFF K151R. These data suggest that the AMPK-MFF SUMOylation axis dynamically controls stress-induced mitochondrial fragmentation by regulating the levels of MiD in trimeric fission complexes."

However, single-modality MRA falls short in diagnosing diverse vascular abnormalities. Thus, contrast agents combiningT1andT2effects are sought for multiparameter MRA with clinical promise, yet achieving a balance inT1andT2contrast enhancement effects remains a scientific challenge. Herein, we developed a hypersensitive multiparameter MRA strategy using dual-modality NaGdF4nanoparticles. Because of the longer tumbling time (τR), NaGdF4nanoparticles can improve the longitudinal relaxivity (r1), brightening vessels inT1-weighted sequences. Simultaneously, the regular arrangement of Gd3+in the crystal induces magnetic anisotropy, creating local static magnetic field heterogeneity and generating negative signals inT2-weighted sequences. Consequently, the efficacy of NaGdF4-enhanced high-resolution multiparameter MRA has been validated in diagnosing ischemic stroke and Alzheimer’s disease in rodent models.

Among them, erg (ether-à-go-go–related gene) K+channels represent a subfamily of voltage-gated channels, consisting of erg1, erg2, and erg3 subunits; however, their subunit-specific neuronal functions in vivo are barely understood. To find erg3- and erg1-mediated functions, we generated globalKcnh7(erg3) and conditionalKcnh2(erg1) knockout mice. We found that erg3 channels stabilize the resting potential and dampen spontaneous activity in cerebellar Purkinje cells (PCs) and hippocampal CA1 neurons, whereas erg1 channels have suprathreshold functions. Lack of erg3 subunits induced hyperexcitability with increased action potential firing in PCs, but not in CA1 neurons. Notably, erg3 depletion caused depressive-like behavior with reduced locomotor activity, strongly decreased digging behavior, and shorter latencies to fall off a rotating wheel, while learning and memory remained unchanged.

To overcome this liability, antibody-drug conjugates were constructed using altered BCL-XL–targeting warheads, unique linker technologies, and therapeutic antibodies. The epidermal growth factor receptor–targeting antibody-drug conjugate AM1-15 inhibited growth of tumor xenografts and did not cause cardiovascular toxicity nor dose-limiting thrombocytopenia in monkeys. While an unprecedented BCL-XL–mediated toxicity was uncovered in monkey kidneys upon repeat dosing of AM1-15, this toxicity was mitigated via further drug-linker modification to afford AM1-AAA (AM1-25).
