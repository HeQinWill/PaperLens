We used simulations to explore the role of bigger droplets, known as precipitation embryos, in triggering rain. We found that they speed up rain only when their size and number exceed a critical threshold. This threshold becomes larger when collisions are naturally efficient, such as in clouds with broad droplet size distributions or strong turbulence. 
 Understanding warm rain initiation through droplet collision and coalescence is a fundamental yet complex challenge in cloud microphysics. Although it is well-known that sufficiently large droplets, so-called precipitation embryos (PEs), may accelerate droplet collisions, it is uncertain how many and how large these PEs should be to affect rain initiation substantially. We address this question using an ensemble of box simulations with Lagrangian cloud microphysics. We find that warm rain initiation is substantially accelerated only if the PE size or number (or the product of those) exceeds a critical threshold necessary to compensate for the PE-induced suppression of collisions among non-PEs. The sensitivity of this threshold to the shape of the droplet size distribution and turbulence effects on the collision process is analysed. It is shown that more and larger PEs are needed to accelerate rain initiation when collisions are already efficient without PEs, e.g. due to a broad droplet size distribution or a strong turbulence effect. Beyond increasing our fundamental understanding of the precipitation process in warm clouds, our results may help to constrain the effect of PE-like particles intentionally or unintentionally added in climate intervention approaches, such as rain enhancement or marine cloud brightening."

 The Three-Dimensional Precipitation Particle Imager (3D-PPI) is presented as a new instrument for measuring the size, fall velocity, and three-dimensional shape of precipitation particles. The 3D-PPI consists of three high-resolution cameras with telecentric lenses and one high-speed camera with one non-telecentric lens. The former captures high-resolution images of falling particles from three angles, enabling three-dimensional (3D) shape reconstruction via a 3D reconstruction algorithm, while the large observation volume facilitates particle size distribution (PSD) analysis. The latter records the images of the falling precipitation particles with 200 frames per second, based on which the falling velocity of particles can be calculated. The field experiment of the 3D-PPI and OTT Parsivel disdrometer (OTT) was conducted in Tulihe, China, with more than 880 000 snowflakes  recorded during a typical snowfall case lasting 13 h, and the results indicate  strong agreement between the PSDs obtained by the 3D-PPI and those obtained by the OTT.

We compare this to a reference method using dew point temperature for precipitation type classification. Evaluations with nearby disdrometers show that CMLs improve the classification of dry snow and rainfall, outperforming the reference method. 
 Differentiating between snow and rainfall is crucial for hydrological modeling and understanding. Commercial microwave links (CMLs) can provide rainfall estimates for liquid precipitation but show minimal signal attenuation during dry snow events, causing the CML time series during these periods to resemble non-precipitation periods. Weather radars can detect precipitation also for dry snow, yet they struggle to accurately differentiate between precipitation types. This study introduces a new approach to improve rainfall and dry snow classification by combining weather radar precipitation detection with CML signal attenuation. Specifically, events in which the radar detects precipitation but the CML does not are classified as dry snow. As a reference method, we use weather radar, with the precipitation type identified by the dew point temperature at the CML location. Both methods were evaluated using measurements from disdrometers located within 8 km of a CML, taken as ground truth. The analysis used data from Norway, including 550 CMLs in December 2021 and 435 CMLs in June 2022. Our results show that the use of CMLs can improve the classification of dry snow and rainfall, presenting an advantage over the reference method. In addition, our research provides valuable insight into how precipitation at temperatures around 0 °C, such as sleet or wet snow, can affect CMLs, contributing to a better understanding of CML applications in colder climates."

By measuring key parameters like pH and dissolved oxygen, our research provides valuable insights into groundwater behaviour and serves as a resource for future environmental studies. 
 The critical zone (CZ) is the skin of the Earth, where rock, water, air, and life interact, playing a pivotal role in sustaining ecological processes and life-supporting resources. Understanding these interactions, especially in forested headwater catchments, is essential to manage water resources, predict environmental responses, and assess human impacts. Here, we present a novel dataset from the Weierbach experimental catchment in Luxembourg, derived from a year-long high-frequency monitoring campaign focused on groundwater physico-chemical parameters.Through rigorous data collection and quality control, parameters such as electrical conductivity, dissolved oxygen, oxidation–reduction potential, and pH were measured, providing insights into the CZ's hydrological and biogeochemical dynamics. Although the 1-year dataset offers valuable observations, it represents an initial step toward understanding long-term patterns. The data highlight the interaction between redox reactions, pH, and seasonal hydrological variability, although these interpretations are limited by the temporal scope of the study.By offering a detailed snapshot of the response of the catchment to hydrological variations, this dataset contributes to addressing key gaps in CZ research and serves as a foundation for advancing our understanding of hydro-biogeochemical processes at the catchment scale. Despite the limited observation period, the dataset provides insights that can be integrated with long-term monitoring efforts. Researchers and practitioners can use these data to refine models, inform land management decisions, and improve our understanding of the biogeochemistry of the catchment.

Andrew;Zi Shao;Jiaoyue Wang;Fengming Xi,Global and national CO2 uptake by cement carbonation from 1928 to 2024,"This study provides an accurate bottom-up quantification of cement carbonation sinks at national and global levels. It shows that the global CO2 uptake by cement materials increased from 7.74 Mt yr-1 in 1928 to 0.84 Gt yr-1 in 2023; for 2024, this value is projected to be 0.86 Gt yr-1. The accumulated CO2 uptake offsets about 46 % of cement process emissions. Dominance with respect to cement carbon uptake has shifted from the USA, Japan, and some European countries to emerging economies such as China and India. 
 The hydration products of cement materials can absorb atmospheric CO2, and this carbonation process provides an important decarbonization pathway for the cement industry. Global carbon sequestration by cement materials has been reported, but carbon uptake in different countries remains unquantified. Here, we quantify the national cement carbon uptake from 1928 to 2023 based on 58 517 activity data from 163 cement-producing countries and regions worldwide and 6186 carbonation parameters from detailed data records of 42 countries, and we project the trend in carbon uptake by countries in 2024. The global CO2 uptake by cement materials has increased from 7.74 Mt yr−1 (95 % confidence interval, CI: 5.84–9.85 Mt CO2 yr−1) in 1928 to 0.84 Gt yr−1 (95 % CI: 0.71–1.00 Gt yr−1) in 2023, and it was projected to rise to 0.86 Gt yr−1 (95 % CI: 0.73–1.02 CO2 yr−1) in 2024. The accumulated CO2 uptake from 1928 to 2023 is 21.26 Gt CO2 (95 % CI: 17.93–25.17 Gt CO2), which offsets about 46 % of the cement process emissions (46.06 Gt CO2) in the past 96 years. Simultaneously, the dominance in cement carbon uptake has shifted from the USA, Japan, and some European countries to emerging economies such as China and India, which account for 38.0 % and 9.1 % of total CO2 uptake, respectively, in the last decade (2014–2023). By analysing the long time series of carbon emissions and uptake of the 42 countries with detailed data, we find that they contributed 82.1 % of global cement CO2 uptake from 1928 to 2023, including 21 countries for which cement emissions have peaked and 21 countries for which they have not yet peaked.  The annual carbon offset level (the ratio of uptake to process emissions in a given year) shows a remarkable decrease due to the temporal lag in cement carbon uptake. This is significant for countries with higher cement imports; for example, the cement industries in Australia and Japan have achieved net-zero emissions when considering the cement carbonation sink. This study provides an accurate bottom-up quantification of cement carbonation sinks at national and global levels.

West;Edward W.

This may help understand why models produce varying amounts of sea ice in the present day. We find that models tend to show more melt, growth or conduction for a given ice thickness than the buoys, although the difference is smaller for models with more physically realistic thermodynamics. 
 With the ongoing decline in Arctic sea ice extent, the accurate simulation of Arctic sea ice in coupled models remains an important problem in climate modelling. In this study, the substantial Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) model spread in Arctic sea ice extent and volume is investigated using a novel, process-based approach. An observational dataset derived from the Arctic ice mass balance buoy (IMB) network is used to evaluate fluxes of melt, growth and conduction produced by a subset of CMIP6 models, to better understand the model processes that underlie the large-scale sea ice states. Due to the sparse nature of the IMB observations, the evaluation is performed by comparing distributions of modelled and observed fluxes in the densely sampled regions of the North Pole and Beaufort Sea.We find that all fluxes are routinely biased high in magnitude with respect to the IMB measurements by nearly all models, with too much melt in summer and too much conduction and growth in winter, even as a function of ice thickness. We also show that fluxes vary in ways which are physically consistent with the thermodynamic parameterisations used and that these effects likely modulate the large-scale relationship between ice thickness and ice growth and melt in the CMIP6 models."

Polvani,ClimKern v1.2: a new Python package and kernel repository for calculating radiative feedbacks,"We developed ClimKern, a Python package and radiative kernel repository, to simplify calculating radiative feedbacks and make climate sensitivity studies more reproducible. Testing of ClimKern with sample climate model data reveals that radiative kernel choice may be more important than previously thought, especially in polar regions. Our work highlights the need for kernel sensitivity analyses to be included in future studies. 
 Climate feedbacks are a significant source of uncertainty in future climate projections and need to be quantified accurately and robustly. The radiative kernel method is commonly used to efficiently compute individual climate feedbacks from climate model or reanalysis output. Despite its popularity, it suffers from complications, including difficult-to-locate radiative kernels, inconsistent kernel properties, and a lack of standardized assumptions in radiative feedback calculations, limiting the robustness and reproducibility of climate feedback computations. We designed the ClimKern project to address these issues with a kernel repository and a separate but complementary Python package of the same name. We selected 11 sets of radiative kernels and gave them a common nomenclature and data structure. The ClimKern Python package provides easy access to the kernel repository and functions to compute feedbacks, sometimes with a single line of code. ClimKern functions contain helpful optional parameters while maintaining standard practices between calculations.After documenting the kernels and ClimKern package, we test it with sample climate model output from an abrupt 2×CO2 experiment to explore the sensitivity of feedback calculations to kernel choice. Interkernel spread exhibits considerable spatial heterogeneity, with the greatest spread in the surface albedo and cloud feedbacks occurring in the Arctic and Southern Ocean. In the global mean, the Planck and surface albedo feedbacks show the greatest interkernel variability. Our results highlight the importance of using multiple radiative kernels and standardizing feedback calculations in climate feedback, sensitivity, and polar amplification studies. As ClimKern continues to evolve, we hope others will contribute to its development to make it an even greater tool for the radiative feedback community."

Hausladen,"Impact of Organic Carbon on Manganese Release, Colloid Formation, and Aggregation in Surface and Groundwater","The interaction of manganese (Mn) oxides with natural organic matter (NOM) can mobilize Mn, impacting groundwater quality. However, the formation of Mn colloids, critical determinants of Mn transport and aggregation, is often overlooked. To investigate Mn behavior and colloid formation upon C amendment, humic acid was reacted with Mn oxide suspensions at different C:Mn molar ratios (C:Mn = 0–15) over 200 h. The addition of organic carbon promoted the formation of highly stabilized and mixed-valence Mn colloids through reductive dissolution and complexation, with “aqueous” Mn (<450 nm, C:Mn = 15) release increasing by 56.3% from 0 to 200 h and colloidal Mn increasing by up to 31.9% (3–450 nm, C:Mn = 15, t = 200 h) compared to without carbon addition. Analysis of Mn oxidation state revealed that C–Mn colloids contained Mn in multiple oxidation states, and the percentage of Mn(II,III) relative to total Mn increased with increasing C concentrations. In surface water, the hydrodynamic diameter of both Mn and C–Mn colloids remained stable. In groundwater, C–Mn colloids (C:Mn = 3) remained stable (150 nm) over 30 days, while Mn colloids aggregated into larger particles. Analysis of natural surface and groundwaters identified a substantial fraction of Mn (up to 19.2 and 27.2%, respectively) existing in colloidal phases. These findings shed light on the intricate cycling of Mn among particulate, colloidal, and dissolved phases, which governs Mn fate and transport in the environment."

Some conventional approaches for normalizing pathogen signals in sewersheds may not be appropriate when there is substantial inflow and infiltration (I&I). Our objective for this study was to evaluate the effect of multiple normalization approaches on wastewater pathogen signals at the WWTP influent and across a small rural sewershed (<3000 people) with different levels of I&I. We collected wastewater samples monthly, from 2022 to 2023, from the wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and 11 additional sewer system nodes with well-characterized I&I impacts. We quantified concentrations of SARS-CoV-2, norovirus GII, and rotavirus at the WWTP influent and subsewershed sites, and compared normalization approaches using flow, population, physicochemical parameters (COD, TSS, NH3(aq), PO43––P), and human fecal markers (crAssphage, HF183, mtDNA). Overall, our findings suggest that in systems with substantial I&I, some commonly used normalization approaches, particularly those using physicochemical parameters, may inadvertently introduce additional variability in viral signals measured at WWTP influent and result in wastewater measures that are more closely associated with precipitation trends rather than with pathogen signals. Normalization with human fecal markers appears to be a relatively robust option for sewersheds impacted by substantial I&I."

The particles of soot have a complex fractal morphology, but in atmospheric aerosol models, they are commonly represented as spheres. We show that taking the fractal morphology into consideration significantly accelerates the rate of aging of soot aerosol in the atmosphere because concave surfaces in fractal particles promote rapid capillary condensation of trace gas chemicals produced from the photochemical oxidation of volatile organic compounds, even when vapors of such chemicals are subsaturated. Our results suggest that, by capillary condensation alone, these chemicals can transform hydrophobic soot particles into cloud condensation nuclei within a few hours. Additionally, capillary condensation induces the compaction of fractal soot even at a moderately elevated relative humidity, changing its transport and optical properties. Representing an important mechanism of atmospheric aging, capillary condensation has a profound effect on the evolution of direct and indirect climate impacts of soot at a higher rate than previously recognized, and hence, it must be incorporated into atmospheric aerosol models to improve their predictive power."

Both anthropogenic and natural surfaces in environments provide ideal habitats for biofilm development. Microplastics (MPs), as emerging and rapidly proliferating anthropogenic pollutants, are of particular concern due to their unique physicochemical properties and ubiquity across environments. However, it remains unclear whether biofilms on MPs pose a higher AMR risk compared with natural surfaces. Here, we employed an integrative approach combining phenotypic and genotypic AMR analysis via single-cell spectroscopy and high-throughput quantitative PCR to systematically compare AMR risks on 5 MPs (polyethylene, polystyrene, poly(vinyl chloride), polylactic acid, and Tetra Pak) and 3 natural surfaces (wood, rock, and glass) in an urban aquatic ecosystem. Our results revealed that MPs harbored a higher proportion of metabolically active antibiotic-resistant bacteria and more high-risk antibiotic resistance genes than natural surfaces. By incorporating phenotypic and genotypic AMR with three additional biofilm-related risk factors, including biofilm biomass, microbial activity, and pathogen abundance, the health risk of AMR was quantified and found to be highly dependent on surface types. MPs exhibited, on average, a 10-fold higher health risk than natural surfaces. A structural equation model further identified surface hydrophobicity and microbial diversity as pivotal factors determining AMR risks across different surfaces. This systematic comparison provides new insights into the real-world environmental impact of MPs pollution and underscores the necessity of integrating plastic pollution control into AMR management strategies."

PL toxicity was positively correlated with plastic size and concentration and influenced by polymer type, biodegradability, aging conditions, and leaching conditions. Notably, marine species showed greater sensitivity than freshwater species, and primary consumers were more vulnerable than secondary consumers.

However, large uncertainties exist for marine CHBr3 emission estimations, especially around Asia. In this study, we establish a new marine emission inventory of CHBr3, considering the physical and biogeochemical forces in the interaction of the ocean and atmosphere. The surface seawater concentrations are predicted based on expanded in situ CHBr3 measurements and the machine-learning approach. The marine CHBr3 emission is estimated to be 55.9 Gg Br yr–1 around Asia, accounting for 20.4% of the global total. Our estimate is 18.7 Gg Br yr–1 higher than the previously widely used bottom-up emission inventory, primarily due to discrepancies in the Western Pacific and the South China Sea. Higher estimated marine CHBr3 emissions significantly affect the stratospheric bromine radicals and ozone over Asia, leading to a maximum increase of 13.6% in Br and 12.2% in BrO concentrations and thus up to a 2.5 ppbv reduction in stratospheric ozone. This study highlights the need for additional marine CHBr3 observations in data-sparse regions to better quantify marine CHBr3 emissions and assess their potential atmospheric impacts. This new approach also provides a valuable model framework to calculate sea–air fluxes for other compounds of interest."

Here we present simulations of a wintertime cloud case from Ny‐Ålesund with parameterizations optimized for representing secondary ice production (SIP). We compare cloud phase and its impact on radiation in present‐day conditions with simulations where we perturb (a) ice‐nucleating particle concentrations (INPC) and (b) atmospheric and surface temperatures using a pseudo‐global‐warming approach. Increasing the INPC leads to cloud thinning and reduced downward longwave radiation at the surface (SDLR). Intriguingly, with warming we find an increase in cloud ice due to increased rime splintering (RS) and subsequent SIP, which also leads to reduced SDLR.

These properties were previously uncharacterized due to a technical issue affecting one component of the search‐coil magnetometer after Encounter 1. Using a reconstruction technique, we show that whistlers are predominantly quasi‐parallel to the magnetic field across all distances and propagation directions, with 87% exhibiting a propagation angle relative to the background magnetic field (θ) $(\theta )$ below 25° ${}^{\circ}$. Waves with θ $\theta $ above 25° ${}^{\circ}$ are observed with significantly lower amplitudes. Sunward whistlers (including counter‐propagating (CP) cases, where anti‐sunward waves are observed at the same time) statistically exhibit higher normalized amplitudes and frequencies than anti‐sunward whistlers.

While it is accepted that an upward ENSO impact on the QBO exists, little investigation has been devoted to the potential downward influence of the QBO. Observational and model evidence show that the QBO modulates upper‐tropospheric divergence, with reduced outflow over the Maritime Continent during the westerly phase. It can also impact the warm phase of ENSO, El Niño, characterized by a weakened Walker circulation. Results show that the westerly phase of the QBO further suppresses tropical convection in the western Pacific and thus accentuates the weakening of the Walker circulation during El Niño.

The focus is on two shipping routes: the Northwest Passage and the Northeast Passage. In addition to more traditionally analyzed ice concentration and thickness, we present projected changes in ice strength and pressure, which are especially relevant for shipping hazards. Along both routes, the mean September values of ice strength and pressure, projected for the period 2041–2050, decrease by an order of magnitude relative to the period 2015–2024. The decrease is largely driven by changes in ice concentration, rather than thickness or velocity.

This study found that the decadal transition of winter mean NSWS across China around 1991 could be induced by the alterations in strong and light winds, which accounted for approximately 76% of decadal variations in mean NSWS. Meanwhile, the variance contributions of frequencies and intensities for strong and light winds to the mean NSWS were also considerable, which exceeded 70%. We found that the decadal variations in strong and light winds were linked to variations in weather types. Under a specific weather type, surface air temperature anomalies in East Asia displayed a warm Arctic and cold Eurasia pattern, and sea level pressure increased at Eurasia's high latitudes and declined across regions south of 30°N. Additionally, an upward propagation of planetary waves sustained a deep anticyclone over the Arctic region, motivated a robust Rossby wave train to propagate downstream, and facilitated the strengthening of Siberia High. These dynamics contributed to increase in strong wind events in China. Conversely, more light winds could be generated if opposing horizontal and vertical circulation patterns occurred. This study provides an insight into understanding the decadal variations in NSWS."

While the dynamical structures of SCCs resemble those of typical Kelvin waves, their phase speeds are much slower. This study investigates the physical processes underlying the eastward propagation of SCCs using a cloud‐permitting simulation of an MJO event over the tropical Indian Ocean. The results show that the eastward propagation of SCCs is hindered due to intersections with westward‐propagating waves originating from the western edge of the Maritime Continent. During these intersections, new cloud clusters, dominated by shallow convection, are triggered to the east. This shallow convection temporarily stalls the SCC due to positive feedback between shallow convective heating and moisture convergence. As shallow convection transitions to deep convection and new clusters replace the old ones, the system begins to move. Latent heat release causes low surface pressure to build to the east of the new clusters, setting the stage for the next intersection. The timescale of non‐instantaneous convection‐convergence feedback, which quantifies the time lag between moisture convergence and convective heating, governs the stagnation period during cloud cluster replacement and ultimately influences the propagation speed of SCCs."

Observations of ELF/VLF radio transients performed by the University of Florida's global ELF/VLF receiver network are used to determine quantitative metrics by which to characterize the ELF/VLF transients as Q‐bursts and N‐bursts. As a result of this effort, a new type of transient is identified and deemed the VO‐burst. These metrics are used to analyze the ELF/VLF transients observed simultaneously with ground‐based amateur optical observations of sprites and gigantic jets. Four case studies support the conclusions that sprites are associated with N‐bursts, whereas gigantic jets are associated with Q‐bursts. Additional observations performed during rocket‐triggered lightning experiments at Camp Blanding, Florida, suggest that typical cloud‐to‐ground lightning return strokes are associated with VO‐bursts, which do not exhibit any significant ELF component. While these new radio metrics can be employed to automatically process ELF/VLF transient observations to distinguish between Q‐bursts, N‐bursts, and VO‐bursts, we propose that this additional quantitative characterization of radio bursts could also be employed to detect and distinguish between various types of transient luminous events, but more observations are required to rigorously establish this relationship."

One-dimensional anyons have been theoretically proposed, but their experimental realization has proven to be difficult.

 To absorb nutrients and support commensal microbes, the host induces tolerogenic immune responses via peripheral regulatory T cells (pTregs) 1,2. Prior studies identified type 1 dendritic cells (cDC1) as initiators of dietary pTregs3. However, we now report that food-specific pTreg cells are exclusively induced by the recently identified RORγt APCs4–8 and not by cDCs. Instead, our data suggest that pTreg–cDC1 interactions in steady-state limit the expansion of food-specific CD8αβ T cells. This regulation breaks during infection or food poisoning, enabling dietary CD8αβ T cells to expand and acquire effector functions in response to mimicked food antigens. Unlike in typical infections, after the pathogen is cleared, dietary CD8αβ T cells do not expand in response to their corresponding dietary antigens. Thus, we propose that in response to dietary antigens, tolerance is mediated by a circuit of dedicated antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells. When the host is challenged by infection, this circuit permits the transient expansion of protective effector responses without compromising the overall strategy of tolerance that ensures safe food consumption."

They demonstrate how Topobexin, a Topoisomerase IIβ - selective catalytic inhibitor, blocks conformational changes and protects against anthracycline cardiotoxicity. 
 Topoisomerase II alpha and beta (TOP2A and TOP2B) isoenzymes perform essential and non-redundant cellular functions. Anthracyclines induce their potent anti-cancer effects primarily via TOP2A, but at the same time they induce a dose limiting cardiotoxicity through TOP2B. Here we describe the development of the obex class of TOP2 inhibitors that bind to a previously unidentified druggable pocket in the TOP2 ATPase domain to act as allosteric catalytic inhibitors by locking the ATPase domain conformation with the capability of isoform-selective inhibition. Through rational drug design we have developed topobexin, which interacts with residues that differ between TOP2A and TOP2B to provide inhibition that is both selective for TOP2B and superior to dexrazoxane. Topobexin is a potent protectant against chronic anthracycline cardiotoxicity in an animal model. This demonstration of TOP2 isoform-specific inhibition underscores the broader potential to improve drug specificity and minimize adverse effects in various medical treatments.

Here, the authors combine anionic and cationic nanofibers, which can absorb surface blood and form a seal, encapsulating blood components and forming a rapid thrombus while remaining biocompatibility and biodegradation properties. 
 Current hemostatic fabric often encounters the issue of blood seeping or leaking through the fabric and at the junctions between the fabric and tissue, leading to extra blood loss. Herein, we report a hemostatic nanofabric composed of anionic and cationic nanofibers. Upon contact with wound, the porous nanofabric can absorb the interfacial blood and self-seal to form a compact physical barrier through interfiber bonding, preventing blood from longitudinally penetrating the fabric. This process results in the encapsulation of blood components within the electrostatically crosslinked nanofiber network, creating a robust thrombus that reinforces the physical barrier. Moreover, this nanofabric exhibits strong tissue adhesiveness, inhibiting blood seeping out at the seam of the fabric and tissue. Its hemostatic performance in animal injuries surpasses that of standard cotton gauze and Combat GauzeTM. In the pig femoral artery injury, the blood loss from the nanofabric is only ca. 8% of that from Combat GauzeTM. The nanofabric exhibits excellent biodegradability, hemocompatibility, cytocompatibility, antibacterial activity, and wound healing promotion. Seepage can be an issue in haemostatic dressings.

Here, the authors show that lipid overload in chondrocytes boosts fatty acid oxidation, fueling disease progression via SOX9 degradation and epigenetic dysregulation. 
 Osteoarthritis is the most prevalent age-related degenerative joint disease and is closely linked to obesity. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here we show that altered lipid metabolism in chondrocytes, particularly enhanced fatty acid oxidation (FAO), contributes to osteoarthritis progression. Excessive FAO causes acetyl-CoA accumulation, thereby altering protein-acetylation profiles, where the core FAO enzyme HADHA is hyperacetylated and activated, reciprocally boosting FAO activity and exacerbating OA progression. Mechanistically, elevated FAO reduces AMPK activity, impairs SOX9 phosphorylation, and ultimately promotes its ubiquitination-mediated degradation. Additionally, acetyl-CoA orchestrates epigenetic modulation, affecting multiple cellular processes critical for osteoarthritis pathogenesis, including the transcriptional activation of MMP13 and ADAMTS7. Cartilage-targeted delivery of trimetazidine, an FAO inhibitor and AMPK activator, demonstrates superior efficacy in a mouse model of metabolism-associated post-traumatic osteoarthritis. These findings suggest that targeting chondrocyte-lipid metabolism may offer new therapeutic strategies for osteoarthritis. Osteoarthritis is closely linked to obesity.

Here, the authors conduct an environmental influenza surveillance study in remote, uninhabited regions of the Global South by sampling fresh bird guano. 
 Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) pose a growing global health threat, particularly in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where limited surveillance capacity and under-resourced healthcare systems hinder timely detection and response. Migratory birds play a significant role in the transboundary spread of AIVs, yet data from key regions along migratory flyways remain sparse. To address these surveillance gaps, we conducted a study between December 2021 and February 2023 using fresh bird guano collected across 10 countries in the Global South. Here, we show that remote, uninhabited regions in previously unsampled areas harbor a high diversity of AIV strains, with H5N1 emerging as the most prevalent. Some of these H5N1 samples also carry mutations that may make them less responsive to the antiviral drug oseltamivir. Our findings documented the presence of AIVs in several underrepresented regions and highlighted critical transmission hotspots where viral evolution may be accelerating. These results underscore the urgent need for geographically targeted surveillance to detect emerging variants, inform public health interventions, and reduce the risk of zoonotic spillover.

Here, the authors report a covalentization concept in intermetallic L10-structure Pt-based alloys to boost stability in fuel cells. 
 The long-standing challenges facing Pt-based alloy catalysts in oxygen reduction reactions (ORRs) are rapid oxidation and loss of transition metal/Pt in proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs). In this work, we report a concept of “covalentization” in intermetallic L10-PtMM’ (M = Fe, Co, Ni and M’ = one of the 4th-period elements (from Ti to Ge)) alloys to enhance their electrochemical stability. Specifically, the formation of a quasi-covalent bond network in L10-PtMM’ due to the less occupied antibonding states induced by high d-band positions of M’ elements (e.g., Ti, V, Cr) enhances atomic bond order and strength, diminishing Co anodic dissolution via strengthened Pt/Co-M’ bonds and reducing Co cathodic corrosion by inhibiting Pt oxidation through an electron buffering effect. The developed L10-PtCoCr/C catalysts show a high mass activity (MA = 1.27 A mgPt−1) and rated power (16.5 W mgPt−1) in PEMFCs at a low total Pt loading of 0.075 mgPt cm−2. The catalysts also exhibit high electrochemical stability with ~3% and 5% loss of MA and rated power after 30,000 accelerated durability testing cycles and projects a lifetime of about 42,000 hours.

 Interlayer coupling in two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterials can provide us strategies to evoke their superior properties, such as the layer-dependent phonon vibration, the formation of moiré excitons and related nontrivial topology. However, to accurately quantify interlayer potential and further measure elastic properties of 2D materials remain challenging, despite significant efforts. Herein, the layer-dependent lattice dynamics and elastic constants of 2D nanomaterials have been systematically investigated via pressure-engineering strategy based on ultralow frequency Raman spectroscopy. The shear and layer-breathing modes Raman shifts of 2H-MoS2 with various thicknesses are analyzed by the monoatomic chain model (MCM). Intriguingly, it is found that the layer-dependent dω/dP of shear (SN,1) and breathing (LBN,N-1) modes display the opposite trends, quantitatively consistent with MCM analysis, our molecular dynamics simulations and density functional theory calculations. The diatomic chain model is combined with Raman data to analyze the intralayer and interlayer shear force constants and their pressure coefficients, revealing a strong dependence on the number of layers. These results can be generalized to other van der Waals systems, and may shed light on the potential applications of 2D materials in nanomechanics and nanoelectronics.

Authors here assess how biodiversity levels of fisheries around the world can be leveraged to maximize nutrients provided with less biomass. 
 Wild fish harvests from freshwaters and oceans per person on Earth have been stagnating for decades due to increased food demand from a burgeoning global human population, raising the stakes for maximizing the nutritional benefits from limited fish stocks. Here we adopt an allocation optimization approach using biogeographic and nutrient data for the world’s fishes to identify ideal portfolios of species for consumption in every country. We find that, across nations, biodiversity increases opportunities to fulfil multiple nutritional requirements with less fish biomass. This advantage emerges through complementarity among species; portfolios of complementary species provide >60% more nutrients than the same biomass of the most nutrient-rich species. Moreover, biodiverse fisheries enable harvest allocation towards species with traits enhancing fishery resilience (for example, small size, low trophic position) and offer greater redundancy, whereby a wider range of comparably nutritious species is available. Our analysis underscores that conserving fish biodiversity can improve nutrition and fishery resilience while reducing harvest pressure on already-stressed aquatic ecosystems.

 Formation of mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) is a key process in the global carbon cycle, stabilising organic carbon in soils. The relative importance of mineral composition and land use as potential controls of MAOM stability at regional scales and underlying microbial processes are still unresolved. Here, we assessed the stability of MAOM formed on goethite (iron oxide) and illite (phyllosilicate clay) exposed for five years in topsoils at 68 forest and grassland sites across Germany. We incubated the newly formed MAOM, determined its extractability, and analysed the composition and functioning of associated microbial communities. Decomposition of MAOM was always significantly lower for goethite than illite, highlighting that higher organic carbon accumulation on goethite was not exclusively due to its larger sorption capacity. Instead, reduced organic carbon extractability and higher phosphorus-acquiring enzyme activities indicated stronger substrate limitation of microbial growth on goethite than illite. Across the two minerals, MAOM decomposition was consistently lower for forests than grasslands, relating to greater nutrient constraints and a different microbial community composition in forests. Overall, mineral type and land use explained 34.6 and 23.2% of the variance in MAOM decomposition. The pronounced land use effect on MAOM stability underlines its potential responsiveness to environmental change.

 Canadian prairies are among the world’s most endangered ecosystems, and the identification of native grasslands is crucial for supporting grassland management and wildlife conservation. However, the current amount, distribution, and dynamic changes of native grassland remain uncertain, partly due to the difficulty of separating native grassland with other land cover types, especially tame grassland in landcover classification products. This study aims to identify native grasslands in the Mixed Grasslands ecoregion of Saskatchewan using Sentinel-2 Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series data through deep learning and multi-temporal approaches. Three classifiers, one-dimensional convolutional (Conv1D), Attention Long Short-Term Memory (At-LSTM), and Random Forest (RF), were applied to distinguish the native and tame grasslands, analyzing the key phenological stages. The results show that the Conv1D-based model outperformed the others in both the South (accuracy: 0.88; F1 score: 0.87) and North (accuracy: 0.78; F1 score: 0.77) sub-regions. In contrast, the At-LSTM and RF models performed worse, particularly in the North sub-region, with F1 scores of 0.64 and 0.68, respectively. The early July period (Day of Year 170 to 200) was critical for distinguishing native and tame grassland landcover, especially in the South sub-region. Additionally higher resolution data (5-day intervals) generally improved model accuracy compared to 10-day and 30-day intervals. Overall, the study demonstrates the effectiveness of time series NDVI data and deep learning approaches for identifying native grasslands, offering valuable information to assist in grassland ecosystem management and conservation strategies in the Canadian prairies."

 Phase filtering is crucial for ensuring accurate phase unwrapping in the processing of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) data. Traditional filtering methods often struggle to effectively suppress noise and accurately preserve phase edge information when processing InSAR interferometric phases with complex noise and large gradient deformations. In response to this challenge, we have proposed the MCR-PFNet model based on residual attention convolution for InSAR phase filtering. MCR-PFNet integrates residual blocks, the convolutional block attention module (CBAM), and a multi-head self-attention module, enabling the simultaneous extraction of both local and global phase features, while filtering out noise and preserving phase details. To further enhance the generalization capability of MCR-PFNet, additive Gaussian noise and local phase jumps were introduced into the training dataset, and the MCR-PFNet model was trained with a custom-designed periodic phase loss function. The filtering performance was evaluated on simulated and real datasets. The results demonstrate that MCR-PFNet excels in scenarios with complex noise and large gradient deformations. In the simulated wrapped phase experiments, MCR-PFNet outperformed other methods in three metrics: PSNR (55.820–64.017 dB), SSIM (0.965–0.990), and MSE (0.026–0.170 rad2).

 Tire wear particles (TWPs) generated from vehicular sources significantly contribute to urban air pollution and pose risks to human health. To investigate the emission behavior of TWPs, chassis dynamometer driving tests were conducted on different-mileage vehicles. The results revealed that tire wear mileage increase led to decreased particle number emission for 10–500 nm TWPs and a gradual increase in particle mass emission. The long-mileage tires result in the formation of lumpy particles with fibrous structures. Tires with varying mileage produce lumpy particles and agglomerated irregular particles. Characteristic elements from the tire material are uniformly distributed on the lumpy particles. The agglomerated irregular particles mainly contain C and O and are not uniformly distributed with other characteristic elements. In addition, tire surface material from short-milage vehicles reduces more mass than long-milage vehicles under low thermogravimetric analysis temperatures. The lost material is mainly oxidized to CO2 gas. Wear over long mileages can lead to changes in the organic substances of tire surface material. The discussion of mileage impact provides data to support the assessment and control of particle emissions over the full life cycle of tires."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108207,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要探讨了东南太平洋典型区域单层层积云的分布特征和成因，并分析了其辐射效应。研究使用了CloudSat卫星数据（2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR和2B-FLXHR-LIDAR产品）以及ERA5数据，研究了层积云的季节性变化、形成机制以及辐射效应。研究结果表明，层积云的分布与整层湿度（TCWV）和低层大气稳定性（LTS）密切相关，气溶胶浓度也会影响其辐射效应。云几何厚度（CGT）是关键的气象指标，影响云辐射效应。该研究有助于改进云辐射强迫的模拟，从而减少气候变化评估中的不确定性。虽然没有直接涉及空气质量监测或大气成分分析，但卫星观测数据的使用以及对气溶胶和云辐射效应的关注，使其与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['Stratiform clouds', 'CloudSat', 'Radiative forcing', 'Aerosol optical depth', 'Cloud fraction', 'Shortwave radiation', 'Longwave radiation', 'Sea surface temperature', 'Lower Tropospheric Stability', 'ERA5']",Ximing Deng;Yong Han;Chunsong Lu;Xinxin Xie;Yurong Zhang;Tianwei Lu;Li Dong;Qicheng Zhou,Distributional characteristics and causes of single-layer stratiform clouds over typical region in the southeastern Pacific Ocean,"•Single-layer stratiform cloud distribution varies seasonally with humidity and stability driven by sea surface temperature. •Cloud fraction affects shortwave radiation more than longwave, depending on the cloud geometric thickness. 
 sSingle-layer Stratiform clouds (Sc), as the most common cloud system for stratiform clouds, plays an important role in global radiative balance due to their duration and extensive coverage. However, there are still substantial uncertainties in their formation and radiative forcing. In this paper, we use the Cloudsat 2B-CLDCLASS-LIDAR product from 2007 to 2010 to distinguish it from other cloud types. ERA5 data and 2B-FLXHR-LIDAR from the same period are used to investigate its formation mechanisms and radiative effects. The results show that the single-layer Sc exhibits obvious seasonal variation in the spatial distribution, which is closely related to the distribution of whole-layer humidity (TCWV) and Lower Tropospheric Stability (LTS). Different aerosol concentrations alter their effects. When aerosol optical depth (AOD) is less than 0.12, increased TCWV suppresses cloud formation, amplified by stronger LTS. However, as AOD > 0.14, TCWV promotes cloud fraction (CF), while LTS weakens this effect. CGT is a key meteorological indicator that, when fixed, reduces the impact of meteorological factors (e.g., TCWV, LTS) on cloud structure, enabling a clearer assessment of CF' s effect on cloud radiative effect (CRE). The results show CF has a larger impact on shortwave radiative forcing (CRE_SW) than on longwave (CRE_SW), but its effect depends on the cloud geometric thickness (CGT). When the cloud layer is thin (CGT < 310.3 m), the CF enhances the cloud shortwave and longwave radiative effect, resulting in a regional cooling effect (slope_CERnet = −25.2); the thick cloud layer (CGT > 310.3 m) will inhibit CRE_SW but enhance CRE_LW, thereby diminishing the cooling effect (slope_CERnet = −19.89). This study will help improve the simulation of cloud radiative forcing, thereby reducing uncertainties in climate change assessments."
