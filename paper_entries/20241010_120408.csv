Stout;Christopher D. Westbrook;Thorwald H. M. Stein;Mark W. McCorquodale,Stable and unstable fall motions of plate-like ice crystal analogues,"This study uses 3D-printed ice crystal analogues falling in a water–glycerine mix and observed with multi-view cameras, simulating atmospheric conditions. Four types of motion are observed: stable, zigzag, transitional, and spiralling. Particle shape strongly influences motion; complex shapes have a wider range of conditions where they fall steadily compared to simple plates. The most common orientation of unstable particles is non-horizontal, contrary to prior assumptions of always horizontal. 
 The orientation of ice crystals affects their microphysical behaviour, growth, and precipitation. Orientation also affects interaction with electromagnetic radiation, and through this it influences remote sensing signals, in situ observations, and optical effects. Fall behaviours of a variety of 3D-printed plate-like ice crystal analogues in a tank of water–glycerine mixture are observed with multi-view cameras and digitally reconstructed to simulate the falling of ice crystals in the atmosphere.Four main falling regimes were observed: stable, zigzag, transitional, and spiralling. Stable motion is characterised by no resolvable fluctuations in velocity or orientation, with the maximum dimension oriented horizontally. The zigzagging regime is characterised by a back-and-forth swing in a constant vertical plane, corresponding to a time series of inclination angle approximated by a rectified sine wave. In the spiralling regime, analogues consistently incline at an angle between 7 and 28°, depending on particle shape. Transitional behaviour exhibits motion in between spiral and zigzag, similar to that of a falling spherical pendulum.The inclination angles that unstable planar ice crystals make with the horizontal plane are found to have a non-zero mode. This observed behaviour does not fit the commonly used Gaussian model of inclination angle. The typical Reynolds number when oscillations start is strongly dependent on shape: solid hexagonal plates begin to oscillate at Re =237, whereas several dendritic shapes remain stable throughout all experiments, even at Re > 1000. These results should be considered within remote sensing applications wherein the orientation characteristics of ice crystals are used to retrieve their properties."
10.5194/acp-24-11207-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了当前甲烷对短波辐射的吸收如何影响其对气候的影响。研究发现，甲烷对短波辐射的吸收抵消了其对长波辐射吸收导致的表面温度升高的28%。研究还指出，甲烷对短波辐射的吸收也影响了其气候反馈参数，主要通过云反馈。该研究利用了理想化的气候模型模拟，并量化了当前甲烷对短波辐射吸收的辐射和气候影响。研究结果表明，甲烷对短波辐射的吸收确实会减弱其对长波辐射吸收导致的升温效应。研究还发现，与二氧化碳相比，甲烷对短波辐射的吸收效应更大，这表明甲烷仍然是一种强效的温室气体。这项研究对理解甲烷对气候的影响具有重要意义，并为更准确地预测未来气候变化提供了新的视角。,"['methane', 'shortwave absorption', 'longwave absorption', 'radiative effects', 'climate feedback', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Robert J. Allen;Xueying Zhao;Cynthia A. Randles;Ryan J. Kramer;Bjørn H. Samset;Christopher J. Smith,Present-day methane shortwave absorption mutes surface warming relative to preindustrial conditions,"Present-day methane shortwave absorption mutes 28% (7–55%) of the surface warming associated with its longwave absorption. The precipitation increase associated with the longwave radiative effects of the present-day methane perturbation is also muted by shortwave absorption but not significantly so.  Methane shortwave absorption also impacts the magnitude of its climate feedback parameter, largely through the cloud feedback. 
 Recent analyses show the importance of methane shortwave absorption, which many climate models lack. In particular, Allen et al. (2023) used idealized climate model simulations to show that methane shortwave absorption mutes up to 30 % of the surface warming and 60 % of the precipitation increase associated with its longwave radiative effects. Here, we explicitly quantify the radiative and climate impacts due to shortwave absorption of the present-day methane perturbation. Our results corroborate the hypothesis that present-day methane shortwave absorption mutes the warming effects of longwave absorption. For example, the global mean cooling in response to the present-day methane shortwave absorption is -0.10±0.07 K, which offsets 28 % (7 %–55 %) of the surface warming associated with present-day methane longwave radiative effects. The precipitation increase associated with the longwave radiative effects of the present-day methane perturbation (0.012±0.006 mm d−1) is also muted by shortwave absorption but not significantly so (-0.008±0.009 mm d−1). The unique responses to methane shortwave absorption are related to its negative top-of-the-atmosphere effective radiative forcing but positive atmospheric heating and in part to methane's distinctive vertical atmospheric solar heating profile. We also find that the present-day methane shortwave radiative effects, relative to its longwave radiative effects, are about 5 times larger than those under idealized carbon dioxide perturbations. Additional analyses show consistent but non-significant differences between the longwave versus shortwave radiative effects for both methane and carbon dioxide, including a stronger (negative) climate feedback when shortwave radiative effects are included (particularly for methane). We conclude by reiterating that methane remains a potent greenhouse gas."

We observed that SSA flux is suppressed during increased marine biological activity in the Baltic Sea. At the same time, the influence of wave age showed higher SSA emissions in the Baltic Sea for younger waves compared to the Atlantic Ocean. These insights underscore the complex interplay between biological activity and physical dynamics in regulating SSA emissions. 
 Ship-based measurements of sea spray aerosol (SSA) gradient fluxes in the size range of 0.5–47 µm in diameter were conducted between 2009–2017 in both the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic Ocean. Measured total SSA fluxes varied between 8.9 × 103 ± 6.8 × 105 m−2 s−1 for the Baltic Sea and 1.0 × 104 ± 105 m−2 s−1 for the Atlantic Ocean. The analysis uncovered a significant decrease (by a factor of 2.2 in the wind speed range of 10.5–14.5 m s−1) in SSA fluxes, with chlorophyll a (chl a) concentration higher than 3.5 mg m−3 in the Baltic Sea area. We found statistically significant correlations for both regions of interest between SSA fluxes and various environmental factors, including wind speed, wind acceleration, wave age, significant wave height, and wave Reynolds number. Our findings indicate that higher chl a concentrations are associated with reduced SSA fluxes at higher wind speeds in the Baltic Sea, while the influence of wave age showed higher aerosol emissions in the Baltic Sea for younger waves compared to the Atlantic Ocean. These insights underscore the complex interplay between biological activity and physical dynamics in regulating SSA emissions. Additionally, in both measurement regions, we observed weak correlations between SSA fluxes and air and water temperature and between SSA fluxes and atmospheric stability. Comparing the Baltic Sea and the North Atlantic, we noted distinct emission behaviors, with higher emissions in the Baltic Sea at low wave age values compared to the Atlantic Ocean. This study represents the first comparative analysis of SSA flux measurements using the same methodology in these contrasting marine environments."

Koenig;François Hendrick;Douglas Kinnison;Christopher F. Lee;Michel Van Roozendael;Rainer Volkamer,Troposphere–stratosphere-integrated bromine monoxide (BrO) profile retrieval over the central Pacific Ocean,"Atmospheric bromine destroys ozone, impacts oxidation capacity, and oxidizes mercury into its toxic form. We constrain bromine by remote sensing of BrO from a mountaintop. Previous measurements retrieved two to three pieces of information vertically; we apply new methods to get five and a half vertically and two more in time. We compare with aircraft measurements to validate the methods and look at variations in BrO over the Pacific. 
 Bromine monoxide (BrO) is relevant to atmospheric oxidative capacity, affecting the lifetime of greenhouse gases (i.e., methane, dimethylsulfide) and mercury oxidation. However, measurements of BrO radical vertical profiles are rare, and BrO is highly variable. As a result, the few available aircraft observations in different regions of the atmosphere are not easily reconciled. Autonomous multi-axis differential optical absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) instruments placed at remote mountaintop observatories (MT-DOAS) present a cost-effective alternative to aircraft, with the potential to probe the climate-relevant yet understudied free troposphere more routinely.Here, we describe an innovative full-atmosphere BrO and formaldehyde (HCHO) profile retrieval algorithm using MT-DOAS measurements at Mauna Loa Observatory (MLO – 19.536° N, 155.577° W; 3401 m a.s.l.). The retrieval is based on time-dependent optimal estimation and simultaneously inverts 190+ individual BrO (and formaldehyde, HCHO) SCDs (slant column densities; SCD = dSCD + SCDRef) from solar stray light spectra measured in the zenith and off-axis geometries at high and low solar zenith angles (92° > SZA > 30°) to derive BrO concentration profiles from 1.9 to 35 km with 7.5 degrees of freedom (DoFs). Two case study days are characterized by the absence (26 April 2017, base case) and presence of a Rossby-wave-breaking double tropopause (29 April 2017, RW-DT case). Stratospheric-BrO vertical columns are nearly identical on both days (VCD = (1.5 ± 0.2) × 1013 molec. cm−2), and the stratospheric-BrO profile peaks at a lower altitude during the RW-DT (1.6–2.0 DoFs). Tropospheric-BrO VCDs increase from (0.70 ± 0.14) × 1013 molec. cm−2 (base case) to (1.00 ± 0.14) × 1013 molec. cm−2 (RW-DT) owing to a 3-fold increase in BrO in the upper troposphere (1.7–1.9 DoFs). BrO at MLO increases from (0.23 ± 0.03) pptv (base case) to (0.46 ± 0.03) pptv (RW-DT) and is characterized by an added time resolution (∼ 3.8 DoFs). Up to (0.9 ± 0.1) pptv BrO is observed above MLO in the lower free troposphere in the absence of the double tropopause.We validate the retrieval using aircraft BrO profiles and in situ HCHO measurements aboard the NSF/NCAR GV aircraft above MLO (11 January 2014) that establish BrO peaks around 2.4 pptv above 13 km in the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS) during a similar RW-DT event (0.83 × 1013 molec. cm2 tropospheric-BrO VCD above 2 km). The tropospheric-BrO profile measured using MT-DOAS (RW-DT case) and using the aircraft agree well (after averaging-kernel smoothing). Furthermore, these tropospheric-BrO profiles over the central Pacific Ocean are found to closely resemble those over the eastern Pacific Ocean (2–14 km) and are in contrast to those over the western Pacific Ocean, where a C-shaped tropospheric-BrO profile shape has been observed."

We comprehensively characterized the spatio-temporal dynamics of P fertilizer management over the last 170 years by considering cross-crop variations. This dataset will greatly contribute to the field of agricultural sustainability assessment and Earth system modeling. 
 Understanding and assessing the spatiotemporal patterns in crop-specific phosphorus (P) fertilizer management are crucial for enhancing crop yield and mitigating environmental problems. The existing P fertilizer dataset, derived from sales data, depicts an average application rate over total cropland at the county level but overlooks cross-crop variations. Conversely, the survey-based dataset offers crop-specific application details at the state level yet lacks inter-state variability. By reconciling these two datasets, we developed long-term gridded maps to characterize crop-specific P fertilizer application rates, timing, and methods across the contiguous US at a resolution of 4 km × 4 km from 1850 to 2022. We found that P fertilizer application rate over fertilized areas in the US increased from 0.9 g P m−2 yr−1 in 1940 to 1.9 g P m−2 yr−1 in 2022, with substantial variations among crops. However, approximately 40 % of cropland nationwide has remained unfertilized in the recent decade. The hotspots for P fertilizer use have shifted from the southeastern and eastern US to the Midwest and the Great Plains over the past century, reflecting changes in cropland area, crop choices, and P fertilizer use across different crops. Pre-planting (fall and spring) and broadcast application are prevalent among corn, soybean, and cotton in the Midwest and the Southeast, indicating a high P loss risk in these regions. In contrast, wheat and barley in the Great Plains receive the most intensive P fertilization at planting and via non-broadcast application. The P fertilizer management dataset developed in this study can advance our comprehension of agricultural P budgets and facilitate the refinement of best P fertilizer management practices to optimize crop yield and to reduce P loss.

 Landslide inventories are crucial for evaluating susceptibility, hazards, and risks, and for devising resilience strategies in mountainous regions. This importance is amplified in the context of climate change, as existing inventories might not adequately reflect changing stability conditions. In May 2023, the Emilia-Romagna region of Italy was hit by two major rainfall events, leading to widespread flooding and the triggering of thousands of landslides. Predominantly, these were shallow debris slides and debris flows, occurring on slopes previously deemed stable based on historical data with no prior landslides recorded. Our team supported the Civil Protection Agency through field surveys and mapping efforts to pinpoint and record these landslides, prioritizing areas critical to immediate public safety and focusing on thorough mapping for future recovery planning. The outcome is a detailed map of all landslides induced by these events, manually identified using high-resolution aerial photography (0.2 m pixel resolution, RGB+NIR four bands) and categorized with the help of a 3D viewer.

Harris,Revised and updated geospatial monitoring of twenty-first century forest carbon fluxes,"Updated global maps of greenhouse gas emissions and sequestration by forests from 2001 onwards using satellite-derived data show that forests are strong net carbon sinks, capturing about as much CO2 each year on average as the United States emits from fossil fuels. After reclassifying fluxes to countries’ reporting categories for national greenhouse gas inventories, we found that roughly two-thirds of the total net flux from forests is anthropogenic and one-third is non-anthropogenic. 
 Forests are a key component of climate change mitigation strategies because they both emit and remove atmospheric carbon dioxide. Earth observation data are increasingly used to estimate the magnitude and geographic distribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) fluxes and reduce overall uncertainty in the global carbon budget, including for forests. Here we report on a revised and updated geospatial, Earth observation-based forest carbon flux modelling framework that maps GHG emissions (Gibbs et al. 2024a), carbon removals (Gibbs et al. 2024b), and the net balance between them (Gibbs et al. 2024c) globally from 2001 onwards at roughly 30-meter resolution (Harris et al. 2021, hereafter referred to as the Global Forest Watch (GFW) model). Beyond updating the model to include the most recent years, revisions address some of the original model’s limitations, improve model inputs, and refine the uncertainty analysis. We found that between 2001 and 2023, global forest ecosystems were, on average, a net carbon sink of -5.5 ± 8.1 (one standard deviation) gigatonnes CO2 equivalent yr-1 (Gt CO2e yr-1), which reflects the balance of 9.0 ± 2.7 Gt CO2e yr-1 of GHG emissions and -14.5 ± 7.7 of carbon removals, with an additional -0.20 Gt CO2e yr-1 transferred into harvested wood products. Uncertainty in gross removals was greatly reduced compared to the original model due to refinement of temperate secondary forest carbon removal factor uncertainties."

It merges large-scale weather patterns with local weather using the analog method. Evaluations in central Spain show that RASCAL outperforms ERA20C reanalysis in reconstructing precipitation and temperature. RASCAL offers opportunities for broad scientific applications, from short-term forecasts to local-scale climate change scenarios. 
 The reduction of in situ observations over the last few decades poses a potential risk of losing important information in regions where local effects dominate the climatology. Reanalyses face challenges in representing climatologies with highly localized effects, especially in regions with complex orography. Empirical downscaling methods offer a cost-effective and easier-to-implement alternative to dynamic downscaling methods and can partially overcome the aforementioned limitations of reanalyses by taking into account the local effects through statistical relationships. This article introduces RASCAL (Reconstruction by AnalogS of ClimatologicAL time series), an open-source Python tool designed to extend time series and fill gaps in observational climate data, especially in regions with limited long-term data and significant local effects, such as mountainous areas.Employing an object-oriented programming style, RASCAL's methodology effectively links large-scale circulation patterns with local atmospheric features using the analog method in combination with principal component analysis (PCA).The package contains routines for preprocessing observations and reanalysis data, generating reconstructions using various methods, and evaluating the reconstruction's performance in reproducing the time series of observations, statistical properties, and relevant climatic indices. Its high modularity and flexibility allow fast and reproducible downscaling. The evaluations carried out in central Spain, in mountainous and urbanized areas, demonstrate that RASCAL performs better than the ERA20C and ERA20CM reanalysis, as expected, in terms of R2, standard deviation, and bias. When analyzing reconstructions against observations, RASCAL generates series with statistical properties, such as seasonality and daily distributions, that closely resemble observations. This confirms the potential of this method for conducting robust climate research. The adaptability of RASCAL to diverse scientific objectives is also highlighted. However, as with any other method based on empirical training, this method requires the availability of sufficiently long-term data series. Furthermore, it is susceptible to disruption caused by changes in land use or urbanization processes that might compromise the homogeneity of the training data. Despite these limitations, RASCAL's positive outcomes offer opportunities for comprehensive climate variability analyses and potential applications in downscaling short-term forecasts, seasonal predictions, and climate change scenarios. The Python code and the Jupyter Notebook for the reconstruction validation are publicly available as an open project."

Properly calibrating model parameters is essential, and although automated tools can speed up this process, they may occasionally produce incorrect values due to inconsistencies in the model. We demonstrate that by carefully applying automated tools, we were able to identify and correct a flaw in a widely used model for lake environments. 
 Models are simplified descriptions of reality and are intrinsically limited by the assumptions that have been introduced in their formulation. With the development of automatic calibration toolboxes, finding optimal parameters that suit the environmental system has become more convenient. Here, we explore how optimization toolboxes can be applied innovatively to uncover flaws in the physical formulations of models. We illustrate this approach by evaluating the effect of simplifications embedded in the formulation of a widely used hydro-thermodynamic model. We calibrate a Delft3D model based on temperature profiles for a case study, Lake Morat (Switzerland), through the optimization tool DYNO-PODS. Results show that neglecting the fraction β of shortwave radiation absorbed at the water surface can be compensated by higher values of the light extinction coefficient. This leads to unrealistic values of the latter parameter, as the optimization pushes the coefficient towards the limit of no transparency, consistent with the need to reproduce a significant absorption at the surface. While it is well-known that β is significantly larger than zero, its absence in the model was never noticed as critical. The extensive use of automatic calibration tools may offer similar outcomes in other applications."

We used detailed models, finding that forecasts at Baring Head improved significantly due to its strong tidal currents, but changes at Banks Peninsula were minimal. The study demonstrates that local conditions greatly influence the effectiveness of wave prediction models, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in coastal forecasting to enhance accuracy in the predictions. 
 This study evaluates the effects of downscaling, source terms, and tidal interactions on numerical wave forecasts in Aotearoa New Zealand. We utilised a set of three nested domains (from global to regional scale) to examine significant wave height (Hs), mean period (Tm01), and peak wave direction at two coastal locations, Banks Peninsula and Baring Head. Downscaling markedly improved forecast accuracy at Baring Head, a tidally constricted region, reducing Hs forecast error by 25 %. However, improvements at Banks Peninsula were minimal, likely due to its open coast characteristics which are adequately represented even by lower resolution models. Source term enhancements using default ST6 parameters generally improved Hs predictions on the west coast but worsened them on the east, indicating a geographical dependency in model performance. This variability was also evident in the Tm01 predictions, with notable improvements in bias reduction through model downscaling, particularly at Baring Head. Tidal influences were significant, especially at Baring Head, where they enhanced the forecast accuracy of wave height and direction due to the strong tidal currents characteristic of this location. In contrast, at Banks Peninsula, tidal effects were less pronounced. The study underscores the importance of tailored modelling approaches that consider local geographical and hydrodynamic conditions to optimise wave forecasting."

We investigate here whether GreenScreen, Cradle to Cradle, multiple-criteria decision analysis (MCDA), the Pollution Prevention Options Analysis System, the U.S. EPA Safer Choice Standard and Criteria, and the GHS column model 2020 from IFA use similar criteria for the evaluation of substances as Article 57 of the European chemicals regulation, REACH, and how suitable these methods are for assessing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. MCDA and GreenScreen were analyzed in detail using two different data sets. The results of the assessments show that none of the investigated hazard assessment methods use the same criteria as described in Article 57 of REACH. It was also not possible to parametrize multi-attribute value theory (MAVT), a commonly used MCDA method, to align with Article 57 of REACH by using the relatively simple objective hierarchy that has been proposed in previous publications. There is therefore an urgent need for a modified/new method that can be used in the future to assess organic substances that are used within the European Economic Area."

Herein, the three-month dynamic degradation process of BPs (the copolymer of poly(butylene adipate-co-terephthalate) and polylactic acid (PLA) (PBAT/PLA) and single PLA) in a natural aquatic environment was investigated, with nonbiodegradable plastics polyvinyl chloride, polypropylene, and polystyrene as controls. PBAT/PLA showed the weight loss of 47.4% at 50 days and severe fragmentation within two months, but no significant decay for other plastics. The significant increase in the specific surface area and roughness and the weakening of hydrophobicity within the first month promoted microbial attachment to the PBAT/PLA surface. Then, a complete microbial succession occurred, including biofilm formation, maturation, and dispersion. Metagenomic analysis indicated that plastispheres selectively enriched degraders. Based on the functional genes involved in BPs degradation, a total of 16 high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes of degraders (mainly Burkholderiaceae) were recovered from the PBAT/PLA plastisphere. These microbes showed the greatest degrading potential at the biofilm maturation stage and executed the functions by PLA_depolymerase, polyesterase, hydrolase, and esterase.

The mechanisms controlling terrOC preservation are not completely understood, while lateral oxygen exposure time (OET) is considered as a critical controlling factor. Here, we first utilized molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the structural properties of lignin under anoxic, suboxic, and oxic conditions for understanding the mechanisms of terrOC preservation during sediment lateral transport in the ocean. Our finding suggested that oxygen exposure was indispensable for terrOC degradation through influencing the structural stability and reactivity of lignin. Our simulated results showed that in suboxic environments, prolonged OET may enhance terrOC preservation. Our organic geochemical results suggested that terrOC preferably preserved in coarse silts (20–63 μm) than fine silts (<20 μm) in suboxic environments, largely due to hydrodynamics-driven prolonged OET in coarse sediments, which may efficiently reduce CO2 emissions. Overall, our study sheds new light on the mechanisms of lateral OETs on terrOC preservation in suboxic conditions and, from a unique molecular structural perspective, provides insights into the impact of prolonged OETs on terrOC oxidative degradation in the marine environment."

However, there is very limited knowledge regarding its toxicity, mechanisms of action, and potential health risks. Using new alternative methods (NAMs), across the molecular interactions, signaling pathways, cell functions, animal effects, and population risks, we investigated the potential adipogenic effects and associated risks of CDP and legacy OPE triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) by acting on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ). Among the 19 screened OPEs, CDP bound to PPARγ with the highest binding potency, followed by TPHP. CDP activated PPARγ through fitting into the binding pocket with strong hydrophobicity and hydrogen bond interactions; CDP exhibited higher potency compared to TPHP. In 3T3-L1 cells, CDP enhanced the PPARγ-mediated adipogenesis activity, exhibiting greater potency than TPHP. The intracellular concentration and receptor-bound concentrations (RBC) of CDP were also higher than those of TPHP in both HEK293 cells and 3T3-L1 cells. In mice, exposure to CDP activated the PPARγ-mediated adipogenic pathway, leading to an increased white adipose tissue weight gain. Overall, CDP could bind to and activate PPARγ, thereby promoting preadipocyte differentiation and the development of white adipose tissue. Its potential obesogenic risks should be of high concern."

However, the photodegradation mechanisms of the asymmetrically polarized OMPs at 222 nm remain unclear, potentially posing a knowledge barrier to the applications of far-UVC. This study selected carbamazepine (CBZ), a prevalent aquatic antiepileptic drug that degrades negligibly at 254 nm, to investigate its photodegradation mechanisms at 222 nm. Accelerated CBZ treatment by 222 nm far-UVC was mainly attributed to in situ ROS generation via self-sensitized photodegradation of CBZ. By quenching experiments and EPR tests, •OH radicals were identified as the major contributor to the CBZ photodegradation, whereas O2•– played a minor role. By deoxygenation and solvent exchange experiments, the H2O molecules were demonstrated to play a crucial role in deactivating the excited singlet state of CBZ (1CBZ*) at 222 nm: generating •OH radicals via electron transfer interactions with 1CBZ*. In addition, 1CBZ* could also undergo a photoionization process. The transformation products and pathways of CBZ at 222 nm were proposed, and the toxicities of CBZ’s products were predicted.

However, the influence of fulvic acid (FA), as a microbial carbon source, on carbon and nitrogen cycles in paddy soils remains elusive. Therefore, to investigate it, an incubation experiment was conducted. Gas analyses indicated that the carbon dioxide and methane emissions were enhanced in FA treatment, which increased up to 94.08-fold and 5.06-fold, respectively. 15N-labeling experiments revealed that nitrogen fixation capability was promoted (1.2-fold) to reduce the carbon and nitrogen imbalance due to fulvic acid amendment. Metagenomic analysis further revealed that gene abundances of degradation of lignin-like compounds, gallate degradation, methanogenesis, nitrogen fixation, and urea hydrolysis increased, while the bacterial ammonia oxidation and anaerobic ammonium oxidation decreased, caused by FA application. Metabolic reconstruction of metagenome-assembled genomes revealed that Azospirillaceae, Methanosarcinaceae, and Bathyarchaeota, with higher abundance in FA treatment, were the key microorganisms to maintain the carbon and nitrogen balance.

In the context of CCS implementation, it is particularly crucial to understand the complex molecular diffusive and adsorptive behaviors of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2) in the subsurface at the nanoscale. Yet, conventional molecular models typically represent only single-slit pores and overlook the complexity of interconnected nanopores. In this work, finite kaolinite lamellar assemblages with abundant nanopores (r < 2 nm) were used. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed to quantify the spatial distribution correlations, adsorption preference, diffusivity, and residence time of the CO2 molecules in kaolinite nanopores. The movement of the CO2 molecules primarily occurs in the central and proximity regions of the siloxane surfaces, progressing from larger to smaller nanopores. CO2 prefers smaller nanopores over larger ones. The diffusion coefficients increase, while residence times decrease, with the pore size increasing, differing from typical slit-pore models due to the pore shape and interconnectivity.

In contrast, heterogeneous surface processes played an important or even dominant role in the abatement of pollutants that have a high surface affinity (e.g., fS = 32–82% for atrazine and perfluorooctanoic acid).

The influence of climate and vegetation on Ei is not well known at continental‐to‐global and annual‐to‐decadal scales. Here, we use a long‐term multi‐product approach to examine the global trends in Ei, and further utilize a recently developed and validated dataset to isolate the relative contributions of precipitation, vegetation and evaporative demand. At decadal timescales, increasing Ei is largely driven by global vegetation greening through an increase in the intercepting surface and storage capacity, while its inter‐annual variations are mainly controlled by changes in precipitation, largely related to El Niño/Southern Oscillation. Increasing evaporative demand, driven by atmospheric warming, also positively contributes to the global rise in Ei.

This model significantly reduces the previously reported overlap between coseismic slip and afterslip on the megathrust of this earthquake, consistent with the expectation that these slip modes are spatially partitioned.

This poses a significant challenge in the under‐sampled Middle East, where estimates predominantly depend on remote sensing observations and bottom‐up reporting of national emissions. Here, we present in situ shipborne observations of greenhouse gases (GHGs) and non‐methane hydrocarbons (NMHCs) collected along a >10,000‐km route from Vigo, Spain, to Abu Dhabi, UAE. By comparing our observations with Lagrangian dispersion model simulations, coupled with two methane emission inventories, we identify periods of considerable mismatch and apportion the responsible sources. Employing interspecies relationships with NMHCs has enabled the characterization of methane emissions from oil and gas (O&G) operations, urban centers, Red Sea deep water, enteric fermentation, and agriculture across diverse atmospheric environments. Our analysis reveals that the Suez area is a regional emission hotspot, where simulations consistently underestimate the methane emission sources. Importantly, the Middle Eastern O&G sector has been identified as an additional source of considerable uncertainty. Here, methane emissions were alternately underestimated and overestimated by the two inventories, exposing significant gaps in our understanding of fuel exploitation‐related emissions in the Middle East. This underscores the need for further targeted field campaigns and long‐term observations to improve the accuracy of emission data in the inventories."

Shepherd,A Forensic Investigation of Climate Model Biases in Teleconnections: The Case of the Relationship Between ENSO and the Northern Stratospheric Polar Vortex,"Teleconnections are crucial in shaping climate variability and regional climate change. The fidelity of teleconnections in climate models is important for reliable climate projections. As the observed sample size is limited, scientific judgment is required when models disagree with observed teleconnections. We illustrate this using the example of the relationship between El Niño‐Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the northern stratospheric polar vortex (SPV), where the MIROC6 large ensemble exhibits an ENSO‐SPV correlation opposite in sign to observations. Yet the model well captures the upward planetary‐wave propagation pathway through which ENSO is known to affect the SPV. We show that the discrepancy arises from the model showing an additional linkage related to horizontal stratospheric wave propagation. Observations do not provide strong statistical evidence for or against the existence of this linkage. Thus, depending on the research purpose, a choice has to be made in how to use the model simulations. Under the assumption that the additional linkage is spurious, a physically‐based bias adjustment is applied to the SPV, which effectively aligns the modeled ENSO‐SPV relationship with the observations, and thereby removes the model‐observations discrepancy in the surface air temperature response. However, if one believed that the additional linkage was genuine and was undersampled in the observations, a different approach could be taken. Our study emphasizes that caution is needed when concluding that a model is not suitable for studying teleconnections. We propose a forensic approach and argue that it helps to better understand model performance and utilize climate model data more effectively."

To date, economic assessments of adaptive decision‐making that take into account future learning about sea level rise uncertainty are rare and the existing ones have relied on simple quantification of future learning not validated against sea level science. To address this gap, we develop an economic adaptive decision‐making framework that takes into account future learning about sea level rise uncertainty and apply it to a coastal case study in Lübeck, Germany, to answer the question of how adaptation to sea level rise can be improved through adaptive adaptation pathways as opposed to non‐adaptive pathways. To address this question, we use a Markov decision process to formulate the stochastic optimization problem. We quantify future learning about sea level rise uncertainty through sea level rise learning scenarios based on and validated against the latest scenarios of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Our case study results show that the city of Lübeck is currently under‐protected against storm surges and that immediate adaptation actions are advisable in the face of future sea level rise. We find that adaptive adaptation pathways, in contrast to non‐adaptive pathways, generate sea level rise thresholds for adaptation actions that are similar across climate change scenarios and can reduce expected costs up to 1.8%."

 Animals must navigate changing environments to find food, shelter or mates. In mammals, grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex construct a neural spatial map of the external environment1–5. However, how grid cell firing patterns rapidly adapt to novel or changing environmental features on a timescale relevant to behaviour remains unknown. Here, by recording over 15,000 grid cells in mice navigating virtual environments, we tracked the real-time state of the grid cell network. This allowed us to observe and predict how altering environmental features influenced grid cell firing patterns on a nearly instantaneous timescale. We found evidence that visual landmarks provide inputs to fixed points in the grid cell network. This resulted in stable grid cell firing patterns in novel and altered environments after a single exposure. Fixed visual landmark inputs also influenced the grid cell network such that altering landmarks induced distortions in grid cell firing patterns. Such distortions could be predicted by a computational model with a fixed landmark to grid cell network architecture. Finally, a medial entorhinal cortex-dependent task revealed that although grid cell firing patterns are distorted by landmark changes, behaviour can adapt via a downstream region implementing behavioural timescale synaptic plasticity6. Overall, our findings reveal how the navigational system of the brain constructs spatial maps that balance rapidity and accuracy. Fixed connections between landmarks and grid cells enable the brain to quickly generate stable spatial maps, essential for navigation in novel or changing environments. Conversely, plasticity in regions downstream from grid cells allows the spatial maps of the brain to more accurately mirror the external spatial environment. More generally, these findings raise the possibility of a broader neural principle: by allocating fixed and plastic connectivity across different networks, the brain can solve problems requiring both rapidity and representational accuracy. How the navigational system of the brain constructs spatial maps that require both rapid changes and representational accuracy is explored."

 Many-particle entanglement is a key resource for achieving the fundamental precision limits of a quantum sensor1. Optical atomic clocks2, the current state of the art in frequency precision, are a rapidly emerging area of focus for entanglement-enhanced metrology3–6. Augmenting tweezer-based clocks featuring microscopic control and detection7–10 with the high-fidelity entangling gates developed for atom-array information processing11,12 offers a promising route towards making use of highly entangled quantum states for improved optical clocks. Here we develop and use a family of multi-qubit Rydberg gates to generate Schrödinger cat states of the Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger (GHZ) type with up to nine optical clock qubits in a programmable atom array. In an atom-laser comparison at sufficiently short dark times, we demonstrate a fractional frequency instability below the standard quantum limit (SQL) using GHZ states of up to four qubits. However, because of their reduced dynamic range, GHZ states of a single size fail to improve the achievable clock precision at the optimal dark time compared with unentangled atoms13. Towards overcoming this hurdle, we simultaneously prepare a cascade of varying-size GHZ states to perform unambiguous phase estimation over an extended interval14–17. These results demonstrate key building blocks for approaching Heisenberg-limited scaling of optical atomic clock precision.

 Ferroelectric structures have spontaneous macroscopic polarization that can be inverted using external electric fields and have potential applications including information storage, energy transduction, ultralow-power nanoelectronics1,2 and biomedical devices3. These functions would benefit from nanoscale control of ferroelectric structure, the ability to switch polarization with lower applied fields (low coercive field) and biocompatibility. Soft ferroelectrics based on poly(vinylidene fluoride) (PVDF)4–6 have a thermodynamically unstable ferroelectric phase in the homopolymer, complex semi-crystalline structures, and high coercive fields. Here we report on ferroelectric materials formed by water-soluble molecules containing only six VDF repeating units covalently conjugated to a tetrapeptide, with the propensity to assemble into the β-sheet structures that are ubiquitous in proteins. This led to the discovery of ribbon-shaped ferroelectric supramolecular assemblies that are thermodynamically stable with their long axes parallel to both the preferred hydrogen-bonding direction of β-sheets and the bistable polar axes of VDF hexamers. Relative to a commonly used ferroelectric copolymer, the biomolecular assemblies exhibit a coercive field that is two orders of magnitude lower, as the result of supramolecular dynamics, and a similar level of remnant polarization, despite having a peptide content of 49 wt%. Furthermore, the Curie temperature of the assemblies is about 40 °C higher than that of a copolymer containing a similar amount of VDF. This supramolecular system was created using a biologically inspired strategy that is attractive in terms of sustainability and that could lead to new functions for soft ferroelectrics.

 Massive stars are predominantly born in stellar associations or clusters1. Their radiation fields, stellar winds and supernovae strongly impact their local environment. In the first few million years of a cluster’s life, massive stars are dynamically ejected and run away from the cluster at high speed2. However, the production rate of dynamically ejected runaways is poorly constrained. Here we report on a sample of 55 massive runaway stars ejected from the young cluster R136 in the Large Magellanic Cloud. An astrometric analysis of Gaia data3–5 reveals two channels of dynamically ejected runaways. The first channel ejects massive stars in all directions and is consistent with dynamical interactions during and after the birth of R136. The second channel launches stars in a preferred direction and may be related to a cluster interaction. We found that 23–33% of the most luminous stars initially born in R136 are runaways. Model predictions2,6,7 have significantly underestimated the dynamical escape fraction of massive stars. Consequently, their role in shaping and heating the interstellar and galactic media and their role in driving galactic outflows are far more important than previously thought8,9.

 Plasmids are major drivers of gene mobilization by means of horizontal gene transfer and play a key role in spreading antimicrobial resistance among pathogens1,2. Despite various bacterial defence mechanisms such as CRISPR–Cas, restriction–modification systems and SOS-response genes that prevent the invasion of mobile genetic elements3, plasmids robustly transfer within bacterial populations through conjugation4,5. Here we show that the leading region of plasmids, the first to enter recipient cells, is a hotspot for an extensive repertoire of anti-defence systems, encoding anti-CRISPR, anti-restriction, anti-SOS and other counter-defence proteins. We further identified in the leading region a prevalence of promoters known to allow expression from single-stranded DNA6, potentially facilitating rapid protection against bacterial immunity during the early stages of plasmid establishment. We demonstrated experimentally the importance of anti-defence gene localization in the leading region for efficient conjugation. These results indicate that focusing on the leading region of plasmids could lead to the discovery of diverse anti-defence genes. Combined, our findings show a new facet of plasmid dissemination and provide theoretical foundations for developing efficient conjugative delivery systems for natural microbial communities.

 Global emission reduction efforts continue to be insufficient to meet the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement1. This makes the systematic exploration of so-called overshoot pathways that temporarily exceed a targeted global warming limit before drawing temperatures back down to safer levels a priority for science and policy2–5. Here we show that global and regional climate change and associated risks after an overshoot are different from a world that avoids it. We find that achieving declining global temperatures can limit long-term climate risks compared with a mere stabilization of global warming, including for sea-level rise and cryosphere changes. However, the possibility that global warming could be reversed many decades into the future might be of limited relevance for adaptation planning today. Temperature reversal could be undercut by strong Earth-system feedbacks resulting in high near-term and continuous long-term warming6,7. To hedge and protect against high-risk outcomes, we identify the geophysical need for a preventive carbon dioxide removal capacity of several hundred gigatonnes. Yet, technical, economic and sustainability considerations may limit the realization of carbon dioxide removal deployment at such scales8,9. Therefore, we cannot be confident that temperature decline after overshoot is achievable within the timescales expected today. Only rapid near-term emission reductions are effective in reducing climate risks.

 Mate recognition systems evolve rapidly to reinforce the reproductive boundaries between species, but the underlying neural mechanisms remain enigmatic. Here we leveraged the rapid coevolution of female pheromone production and male pheromone perception in Drosophila1,2 to gain insight into how the architecture of mate recognition circuits facilitates their diversification. While in some Drosophila species females produce unique pheromones that act to arouse their conspecific males, the pheromones of most species are sexually monomorphic such that females possess no distinguishing chemosensory signatures that males can use for mate recognition3. We show that Drosophila yakuba males evolved the ability to use a sexually monomorphic pheromone, 7-tricosene, as an excitatory cue to promote courtship. By comparing key nodes in the pheromone circuits across multiple Drosophila species, we reveal that this sensory innovation arises from coordinated peripheral and central circuit adaptations: a distinct subpopulation of sensory neurons has acquired sensitivity to 7-tricosene and, in turn, selectively signals to a distinct subset of P1 neurons in the central brain to trigger courtship. Such a modular circuit organization, in which different sensory inputs can independently couple to parallel courtship control nodes, may facilitate the evolution of mate recognition systems by allowing novel sensory modalities to become linked to male arousal. Together, our findings suggest how peripheral and central circuit adaptations can be flexibly coordinated to underlie the rapid evolution of mate recognition strategies across species. Peripheral and central circuit adaptations can be flexibly coordinated in Drosophila, and such a modular circuit organization may facilitate the evolution of mate recognition systems by allowing novel sensory modalities to become linked to male arousal."

 Olfaction is a fundamental sensory modality that guides animal and human behaviour1,2. However, the underlying neural processes of human olfaction are still poorly understood at the fundamental—that is, the single-neuron—level. Here we report recordings of single-neuron activity in the piriform cortex and medial temporal lobe in awake humans performing an odour rating and identification task. We identified odour-modulated neurons within the piriform cortex, amygdala, entorhinal cortex and hippocampus. In each of these regions, neuronal firing accurately encodes odour identity. Notably, repeated odour presentations reduce response firing rates, demonstrating central repetition suppression and habituation. Different medial temporal lobe regions have distinct roles in odour processing, with amygdala neurons encoding subjective odour valence, and hippocampal neurons predicting behavioural odour identification performance. Whereas piriform neurons preferably encode chemical odour identity, hippocampal activity reflects subjective odour perception. Critically, we identify that piriform cortex neurons reliably encode odour-related images, supporting a multimodal role of the human piriform cortex. We also observe marked cross-modal coding of both odours and images, especially in the amygdala and piriform cortex. Moreover, we identify neurons that respond to semantically coherent odour and image information, demonstrating conceptual coding schemes in olfaction. Our results bridge the long-standing gap between animal models and non-invasive human studies and advance our understanding of odour processing in the human brain by identifying neuronal odour-coding principles, regional functional differences and cross-modal integration.

 The rate of river migration affects the stability of Arctic infrastructure and communities1,2 and regulates the fluxes of carbon3,4, nutrients5 and sediment6,7 to the oceans. However, predicting how the pace of river migration will change in a warming Arctic8 has so far been stymied by conflicting observations about whether permafrost9 primarily acts to slow10,11 or accelerate12,13 river migration. Here we develop new computational methods that enable the detection of riverbank erosion at length scales 5–10 times smaller than the pixel size in satellite imagery, an innovation that unlocks the ability to quantify erosion at the sub-monthly timescales when rivers undergo their largest variations in water temperature and flow. We use these high-frequency observations to constrain the extent to which erosion is limited by the thermal condition of melting the pore ice that cements bank sediment14, a requirement that will disappear when permafrost thaws, versus the mechanical condition of having sufficient flow to transport the sediment comprising the riverbanks, a condition experienced by all rivers15. Analysis of high-resolution data from the Koyukuk River, Alaska, shows that the presence of permafrost reduces erosion rates by 47%. Using our observations, we calibrate and validate a numerical model that can be applied to diverse Arctic rivers. The model predicts that full permafrost thaw may lead to a 30–100% increase in the migration rates of Arctic rivers.

 The movement of large amounts of nutrients by migrating animals has ecological benefits for recipient food webs1,2 that may be offset by co-transported contaminants3,4. Salmon spawning migrations are archetypal of this process, carrying marine-derived materials to inland ecosystems where they stimulate local productivity but also enhance contaminant exposure5–7. Pacific salmon abundance and biomass are higher now than in the last century, reflecting substantial shifts in community structure8 that probably altered nutrient versus contaminant delivery. Here we combined nutrient and contaminant concentrations with 40 years of annual Pacific salmon returns to quantify how changes in community structure influenced marine to freshwater inputs to western North America. Salmon transported tonnes of nutrients and kilograms of contaminants to freshwaters annually. Higher salmon returns (1976–2015) increased salmon-derived nutrient and contaminant inputs by 30% and 20%, respectively. These increases were dominated by pink salmon, which are short-lived, feed lower in marine food webs than other salmon species, and had the highest nutrient-to-contaminant ratios. As a result, the delivery of nutrients increased at a greater rate than the delivery of contaminants, and salmon inputs became more ecologically beneficial over time. Even still, contaminant loadings may represent exposure concerns for some salmon predators. The Pacific salmon example demonstrates how long-term environmental changes interact with nutrient and contaminant movement across large spatial scales and provides a model for exploring similar patterns with other migratory species9.

 Quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are luminous bursts of soft X-rays from the nuclei of galaxies, repeating on timescales of hours to weeks1–5. The mechanism behind these rare systems is uncertain, but most theories involve accretion disks around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) undergoing instabilities6–8 or interacting with a stellar object in a close orbit9–11. It has been suggested that this disk could be created when the SMBH disrupts a passing star8,11, implying that many QPEs should be preceded by observable tidal disruption events (TDEs). Two known QPE sources show long-term decays in quiescent luminosity consistent with TDEs4,12 and two observed TDEs have exhibited X-ray flares consistent with individual eruptions13,14. TDEs and QPEs also occur preferentially in similar galaxies15. However, no confirmed repeating QPEs have been associated with a spectroscopically confirmed TDE or an optical TDE observed at peak brightness. Here we report the detection of nine X-ray QPEs with a mean recurrence time of approximately 48 h from AT2019qiz, a nearby and extensively studied optically selected TDE16. We detect and model the X-ray, ultraviolet (UV) and optical emission from the accretion disk and show that an orbiting body colliding with this disk provides a plausible explanation for the QPEs.

 The human hippocampus and prefrontal cortex play critical roles in learning and cognition1,2, yet the dynamic molecular characteristics of their development remain enigmatic. Here we investigated the epigenomic and three-dimensional chromatin conformational reorganization during the development of the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, using more than 53,000 joint single-nucleus profiles of chromatin conformation and DNA methylation generated by single-nucleus methyl-3C sequencing (snm3C-seq3)3. The remodelling of DNA methylation is temporally separated from chromatin conformation dynamics. Using single-cell profiling and multimodal single-molecule imaging approaches, we have found that short-range chromatin interactions are enriched in neurons, whereas long-range interactions are enriched in glial cells and non-brain tissues. We reconstructed the regulatory programs of cell-type development and differentiation, finding putatively causal common variants for schizophrenia strongly overlapping with chromatin loop-connected, cell-type-specific regulatory regions. Our data provide multimodal resources for studying gene regulatory dynamics in brain development and demonstrate that single-cell three-dimensional multi-omics is a powerful approach for dissecting neuropsychiatric risk loci.

 Caloric restriction extends healthy lifespan in multiple species1. Intermittent fasting, an alternative form of dietary restriction, is potentially more sustainable in humans, but its effectiveness remains largely unexplored2–8. Identifying the most efficacious forms of dietary restriction is key for developing interventions to improve human health and longevity9. Here we performed an extensive assessment of graded levels of caloric restriction (20% and 40%) and intermittent fasting (1 and 2 days fasting per week) on the health and survival of 960 genetically diverse female mice. We show that caloric restriction and intermittent fasting both resulted in lifespan extension in proportion to the degree of restriction. Lifespan was heritable and genetics had a larger influence on lifespan than dietary restriction. The strongest trait associations with lifespan included retention of body weight through periods of handling—an indicator of stress resilience, high lymphocyte proportion, low red blood cell distribution width and high adiposity in late life. Health effects differed between interventions and exhibited inconsistent relationships with lifespan extension. 40% caloric restriction had the strongest lifespan extension effect but led to a loss of lean mass and changes in the immune repertoire that could confer susceptibility to infections. Intermittent fasting did not extend the lifespan of mice with high pre-intervention body weight, and two-day intermittent fasting was associated with disruption of erythroid cell populations. Metabolic responses to dietary restriction, including reduced adiposity and lower fasting glucose, were not associated with increased lifespan, suggesting that dietary restriction does more than just counteract the negative effects of obesity. Our findings indicate that improving health and extending lifespan are not synonymous and raise questions about which end points are the most relevant for evaluating aging interventions in preclinical models and clinical trials.

 Multivesicular bodies are key endosomal compartments implicated in cellular quality control through their degradation of membrane-bound cargo proteins1–3. The ATP-consuming ESCRT protein machinery mediates the capture and engulfment of membrane-bound cargo proteins through invagination and scission of multivesicular-body membranes to form intraluminal vesicles4,5. Here we report that the plant ESCRT component FREE16 forms liquid-like condensates that associate with membranes to drive intraluminal vesicle formation. We use a minimal physical model, reconstitution experiments and in silico simulations to identify the dynamics of this process and describe intermediate morphologies of nascent intraluminal vesicles. Furthermore, we find that condensate-wetting-induced line tension forces and membrane asymmetries are sufficient to mediate scission of the membrane neck without the ESCRT protein machinery or ATP consumption. Genetic manipulation of the ESCRT pathway in several eukaryotes provides additional evidence for condensate-mediated membrane scission in vivo. We find that the interplay between condensate and machinery-mediated scission mechanisms is indispensable for osmotic stress tolerance in plants. We propose that condensate-mediated scission represents a previously undescribed scission mechanism that depends on the physicomolecular properties of the condensate and is involved in a range of trafficking processes. More generally, FREE1 condensate-mediated membrane scission in multivesicular-body biogenesis highlights the fundamental role of wetting in intracellular dynamics and organization.

 Behavioural time scale plasticity (BTSP) is non-Hebbian plasticity induced by integrating presynaptic and postsynaptic components separated by a behaviourally relevant time scale (seconds)1. BTSP in hippocampal CA1 neurons underlies place cell formation. However, the molecular mechanisms that enable synapse-specific plasticity on a behavioural time scale are unknown. Here we show that BTSP can be induced in a single dendritic spine using two-photon glutamate uncaging paired with postsynaptic current injection temporally separated by a behavioural time scale. Using an improved Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II (CaMKII) sensor, we did not detect CaMKII activation during this BTSP induction. Instead, we observed dendritic, delayed and stochastic CaMKII activation (DDSC) associated with Ca2+ influx and plateau potentials 10–100 s after BTSP induction. DDSC required both presynaptic and postsynaptic activity, which suggests that CaMKII can integrate these two signals. Also, optogenetically blocking CaMKII 15–30 s after the BTSP protocol inhibited synaptic potentiation, which indicated that DDSC is an essential mechanism of BTSP. IP3-dependent intracellular Ca2+ release facilitated both DDSC and BTSP. Thus, our study suggests that non-synapse-specific CaMKII activation provides an instructive signal with an extensive time window over tens of seconds during BTSP. Induction of behavioural time scale plasticity leads to dendritic, delayed and stochastic Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent kinase II activation, findings that clarify the mechanisms that underlie place cell formation."

 Advanced urothelial cancer is a frequently lethal disease characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity1. In this study, we investigated the evolution of genomic signatures caused by endogenous and external mutagenic processes and their interplay with complex structural variants (SVs). We superimposed mutational signatures and phylogenetic analyses of matched serial tumours from patients with urothelial cancer to define the evolutionary dynamics of these processes. We show that APOBEC3-induced mutations are clonal and early, whereas chemotherapy induces mutational bursts of hundreds of late subclonal mutations. Using a genome graph computational tool2, we observed frequent high copy-number circular amplicons characteristic of extrachromosomal DNA (ecDNA)-forming SVs. We characterized the distinct temporal patterns of APOBEC3-induced and chemotherapy-induced mutations within ecDNA-forming SVs, gaining new insights into the timing of these mutagenic processes relative to ecDNA biogenesis. We discovered that most CCND1 amplifications in urothelial cancer arise within circular ecDNA-forming SVs. ecDNA-forming SVs persisted and increased in complexity, incorporating additional DNA segments and contributing to the evolution of treatment resistance. Oxford Nanopore Technologies long-read whole-genome sequencing followed by de novo assembly mapped out CCND1 ecDNA structure. Experimental modelling of CCND1 ecDNA confirmed its role as a driver of treatment resistance. Our findings define fundamental mechanisms that drive urothelial cancer evolution and have important therapeutic implications.

 For patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), dual immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) with CTLA4 inhibitors and PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors (hereafter, PD-(L)1 inhibitors) is associated with higher rates of anti-tumour activity and immune-related toxicities, when compared with treatment with PD-(L)1 inhibitors alone. However, there are currently no validated biomarkers to identify which patients will benefit from dual ICB1,2. Here we show that patients with NSCLC who have mutations in the STK11 and/or KEAP1 tumour suppressor genes derived clinical benefit from dual ICB with the PD-L1 inhibitor durvalumab and the CTLA4 inhibitor tremelimumab, but not from durvalumab alone, when added to chemotherapy in the randomized phase III POSEIDON trial3. Unbiased genetic screens identified loss of both of these tumour suppressor genes as independent drivers of resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition, and showed that loss of Keap1 was the strongest genomic predictor of dual ICB efficacy—a finding that was confirmed in several mouse models of Kras-driven NSCLC. In both mouse models and patients, KEAP1 and STK11 alterations were associated with an adverse tumour microenvironment, which was characterized by a preponderance of suppressive myeloid cells and the depletion of CD8+ cytotoxic T cells, but relative sparing of CD4+ effector subsets. Dual ICB potently engaged CD4+ effector cells and reprogrammed the tumour myeloid cell compartment towards inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-expressing tumoricidal phenotypes that—together with CD4+ and CD8+ T cells—contributed to anti-tumour efficacy. These data support the use of chemo-immunotherapy with dual ICB to mitigate resistance to PD-(L)1 inhibition in patients with NSCLC who have STK11 and/or KEAP1 alterations. Alterations in the tumour suppressor genes STK11 and/or KEAP1 can identify patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer who are likely to benefit from combinations of PD-(L)1 and CTLA4 immune checkpoint inhibitors added to chemotherapy."

 Enhancing the precision of measurements by harnessing entanglement is a long-sought goal in quantum metrology1,2. Yet attaining the best sensitivity allowed by quantum theory in the presence of noise is an outstanding challenge, requiring optimal probe-state generation and read-out strategies3–7. Neutral-atom optical clocks8, which are the leading systems for measuring time, have shown recent progress in terms of entanglement generation9–11 but at present lack the control capabilities for realizing such schemes. Here we show universal quantum operations and ancilla-based read-out for ultranarrow optical transitions of neutral atoms. Our demonstration in a tweezer clock platform9,12–16 enables a circuit-based approach to quantum metrology with neutral-atom optical clocks. To this end, we demonstrate two-qubit entangling gates with 99.62(3)% fidelity—averaged over symmetric input states—through Rydberg interactions15,17,18 and dynamical connectivity19 for optical clock qubits, which we combine with local addressing16 to implement universally programmable quantum circuits. Using this approach, we generate a near-optimal entangled probe state1,4, a cascade of Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger states of different sizes, and perform a dual-quadrature5 Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger read-out.

 Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and has the highest rate of recurrence1. The predominant standard of care for advanced TNBC is systemic chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy; however, responses are typically short lived1,2. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments. Components of the PI3K pathway represent plausible therapeutic targets; more than 70% of TNBCs have alterations in PIK3CA, AKT1 or PTEN3–6. However, in contrast to hormone-receptor-positive tumours, it is still unclear whether or how triple-negative disease will respond to PI3K pathway inhibitors7. Here we describe a promising AKT-inhibitor-based therapeutic combination for TNBC. Specifically, we show that AKT inhibitors synergize with agents that suppress the histone methyltransferase EZH2 and promote robust tumour regression in multiple TNBC models in vivo. AKT and EZH2 inhibitors exert these effects by first cooperatively driving basal-like TNBC cells into a more differentiated, luminal-like state, which cannot be effectively induced by either agent alone. Once TNBCs are differentiated, these agents kill them by hijacking signals that normally drive mammary gland involution. Using a machine learning approach, we developed a classifier that can be used to predict sensitivity. Together, these findings identify a promising therapeutic strategy for this highly aggressive tumour type and illustrate how deregulated epigenetic enzymes can insulate tumours from oncogenic vulnerabilities. These studies also reveal how developmental tissue-specific cell death pathways may be co-opted for therapeutic benefit.

 Ion-sensitive field-effect transistors (ISFETs) have emerged as indispensable tools in chemosensing applications1–4. ISFETs operate by converting changes in the composition of chemical solutions into electrical signals, making them ideal for environmental monitoring5,6, healthcare diagnostics7 and industrial process control8. Recent advancements in ISFET technology, including functionalized multiplexed arrays and advanced data analytics, have improved their performance9,10. Here we illustrate the advantages of incorporating machine learning algorithms to construct predictive models using the extensive datasets generated by ISFET sensors for both classification and quantification tasks. This integration also sheds new light on the working of ISFETs beyond what can be derived solely from human expertise. Furthermore, it mitigates practical challenges associated with cycle-to-cycle, sensor-to-sensor and chip-to-chip variations, paving the way for the broader adoption of ISFETs in commercial applications. Specifically, we use data generated by non-functionalized graphene-based ISFET arrays to train artificial neural networks that possess a remarkable ability to discern instances of food fraud, food spoilage and food safety concerns. We anticipate that the fusion of compact, energy-efficient and reusable graphene-based ISFET technology with robust machine learning algorithms holds the potential to revolutionize the detection of subtle chemical and environmental changes, offering swift, data-driven insights applicable across a wide spectrum of applications.

Boixo,Phase transitions in random circuit sampling,"By implementing random circuit sampling, experimental and theoretical results establish the existence of transitions to a stable, computationally complex phase that is reachable with current quantum processors. 
 Undesired coupling to the surrounding environment destroys long-range correlations in quantum processors and hinders coherent evolution in the nominally available computational space. This noise is an outstanding challenge when leveraging the computation power of near-term quantum processors1. It has been shown that benchmarking random circuit sampling with cross-entropy benchmarking can provide an estimate of the effective size of the Hilbert space coherently available2–8. Nevertheless, quantum algorithms’ outputs can be trivialized by noise, making them susceptible to classical computation spoofing. Here, by implementing an algorithm for random circuit sampling, we demonstrate experimentally that two phase transitions are observable with cross-entropy benchmarking, which we explain theoretically with a statistical model. The first is a dynamical transition as a function of the number of cycles and is the continuation of the anti-concentration point in the noiseless case. The second is a quantum phase transition controlled by the error per cycle; to identify it analytically and experimentally, we create a weak-link model, which allows us to vary the strength of the noise versus coherent evolution. Furthermore, by presenting a random circuit sampling experiment in the weak-noise phase with 67 qubits at 32 cycles, we demonstrate that the computational cost of our experiment is beyond the capabilities of existing classical supercomputers. Our experimental and theoretical work establishes the existence of transitions to a stable, computationally complex phase that is reachable with current quantum processors.

 The interplay between translation and mRNA decay is widespread in human cells1–3. In quality-control pathways, exonucleolytic degradation of mRNA associated with translating ribosomes is mediated largely by the cytoplasmic exosome4–9, which includes the exoribonuclease complex EXO10 and the helicase complex SKI238 (refs. 10–16). The helicase can extract mRNA from the ribosome and is expected to transfer it to the exoribonuclease core through a bridging factor, HBS1L3 (also known as SKI7), but the mechanisms of this molecular handover remain unclear7,17,18. Here we reveal how human EXO10 is recruited by HBS1L3 (SKI7) to an active ribosome-bound SKI238 complex. We show that rather than a sequential handover, a direct physical coupling mechanism takes place, which culminates in the formation of a cytoplasmic exosome–ribosome supercomplex. Capturing the structure during active decay reveals a continuous path in which an RNA substrate threads from the 80S ribosome through the SKI2 helicase into the exoribonuclease active site of the cytoplasmic exosome complex. The SKI3 subunit of the complex directly binds to HBS1L3 (SKI7) and also engages a surface of the 40S subunit, establishing a recognition platform in collided disomes. Exosome and ribosome thus work together as a single structural and functional unit in co-translational mRNA decay, coordinating their activities in a transient supercomplex. The structure of a human exosome–ribosome supercomplex reveals the mechanisms behind the formation of active cytoplasmic exosomes and their role in co-translational RNA decay."

Here, the authors show that the Attribute Neutral Framework reduces these biases and enhances fairness without compromising diagnostic accuracy. 
 Questions of unfairness and inequity pose critical challenges to the successful deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare settings. In AI models, unequal performance across protected groups may be partially attributable to the learning of spurious or otherwise undesirable correlations between sensitive attributes and disease-related information. Here, we introduce the Attribute Neutral Framework, designed to disentangle biased attributes from disease-relevant information and subsequently neutralize them to improve representation across diverse subgroups. Within the framework, we develop the Attribute Neutralizer (AttrNzr) to generate neutralized data, for which protected attributes can no longer be easily predicted by humans or by machine learning classifiers. We then utilize these data to train the disease diagnosis model (DDM). Comparative analysis with other unfairness mitigation algorithms demonstrates that AttrNzr outperforms in reducing the unfairness of the DDM while maintaining DDM’s overall disease diagnosis performance. Furthermore, AttrNzr supports the simultaneous neutralization of multiple attributes and demonstrates utility even when applied solely during the training phase, without being used in the test phase. Moreover, instead of introducing additional constraints to the DDM, the AttrNzr directly addresses a root cause of unfairness, providing a model-independent solution. Our results with AttrNzr highlight the potential of data-centered and model-independent solutions for fairness challenges in AI-enabled medical systems. Unfairness in AI healthcare models arise from biased correlations between sensitive attributes and disease data.

 Eukaryotic translation initiation factor eIF4B is required for efficient cap-dependent translation, it is overexpressed in cancer cells, and may influence stress granule formation. Due to the high degree of intrinsic disorder, eIF4B is rarely observed in cryo-EM structures of translation complexes and only ever by its single structured RNA recognition motif domain, leaving the molecular details of its large intrinsically disordered region (IDR) unknown. By integrating experiments and simulations we demonstrate that eIF4B IDR orchestrates and fine-tunes an intricate transition from monomers to a condensed phase, in which large-size dynamic oligomers form before mesoscopic phase separation. Single-molecule spectroscopy combined with molecular simulations enabled us to characterize the conformational ensembles and underlying intra- and intermolecular dynamics across the oligomerization transition. The observed sensitivity to ionic strength and molecular crowding in the self-association landscape suggests potential regulation of eIF4B nanoscopic and mesoscopic behaviors such as driven by protein modifications, binding partners or changes to the cellular environment.

Here, the authors show that a population of cells that express Vasa2 and Piwi1 genes can generate both germ and somatic cells, for example neurons, in a sea anemone. 
 Germline segregation, essential for protecting germ cells against mutations, occurs during early embryogenesis in vertebrates, insects and nematodes. Highly regenerative animals (e.g., cnidarians), however, retain stem cells with both germinal and somatic potentials throughout adulthood, but their biology and evolution remain poorly understood. Among cnidarians (e.g., sea anemones, jellyfish), stem cells are only known in few hydrozoans (e.g., Hydra). Here, we identify and characterize a rare, multipotent population of stem and/or progenitor cells expressing the conserved germline and multipotency proteins Vasa2 and Piwi1 in the sea anemone Nematostella vectensis. Using piwi1 and vasa2 transgenic reporter lines, we reveal that the Vasa2+/Piwi1+ cell population generates not only gametes, but also a diversity of proliferative somatic cells, including neural progenitors, in juveniles and adults. Our work has uncovered a multipotent population of Vasa2+/Piwi1+ stem/progenitor cells that forms the cellular basis to understand body plasticity and regenerative capacities in sea anemones and corals.

 RNAs and their encoded proteins intricately regulate diverse cell types and states within the human body. Dysregulated RNA expressions or mutations can lead to various diseased cell states, including tumorigenesis. Detecting and manipulating these endogenous RNAs offers significant promise for restoring healthy cell states and targeting tumors both in research and clinical contexts. This study presents an RNA-IN and RNA-OUT genetic circuit capable dynamically sensing and manipulating any RNA target in a programmable manner. The RNA-IN module employes a programmable CRISPR-associated protease (CASP) complex for RNA detection, while the RNA-OUT module utilizes an engineered protease-responsive dCas9-VPR activator. Additionally, the CASP module can detect point mutations by harnessing an uncovered dual-nucleotide synergistic switching effect within the CASP complex, resulting in the amplification of point-mutation signals from initially undetectable levels (1.5-fold) to a remarkable 94-fold. We successfully showcase the circuit’s ability to rewire endogenous RNA-IN signals to activate endogenous progesterone biosynthesis pathway, dynamically monitor adipogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) and the epithelial-to-mesenchmal trans-differentiation, as well as selective killing of tumor cells.

Here, authors designed carbon nitride-supported single-atom iron catalysts, with a tandem catalytic process, for microplastic degradation and green hydrogen production. 
 Microplastic pollution, an emerging environmental issue, poses significant threats to aquatic ecosystems and human health. In tackling microplastic pollution and advancing green hydrogen production, this study reveals a tandem catalytic microplastic degradation-hydrogen evolution reaction (MPD-HER) process using hierarchical porous carbon nitride-supported single-atom iron catalysts (FeSA-hCN). Through hydrothermal-assisted Fenton-like reactions, we accomplish near-total ultrahigh-molecular-weight-polyethylene degradation into C3-C20 organics with 64% selectivity of carboxylic acid under neutral pH, a leap beyond current capabilities in efficiency, selectivity, eco-friendliness, and stability over six cycles. The system demonstrates versatility by degrading various daily-use plastics across different aquatic settings. The mixture of FeSA-hCN and plastic degradation products further achieves a hydrogen evolution of 42 μmol h‒1 under illumination, outperforming most existing plastic photoreforming methods. This tandem MPD-HER process not only provides a scalable and economically feasible strategy to combat plastic pollution but also contributes to the hydrogen economy, with far-reaching implications for global sustainability initiatives.

 Moiré superlattices in van der Waals heterostructures represent a highly tunable quantum system, attracting substantial interest in both many-body physics and device applications. However, the influence of the moiré potential on light-matter interactions at room temperature has remained largely unexplored. In our study, we demonstrate that the moiré potential in MoS2/WSe2 heterobilayers facilitates the localization of interlayer exciton (IX) at room temperature. By performing reflection contrast spectroscopy, we demonstrate the importance of atomic reconstruction in modifying intralayer excitons, supported by the atomic force microscopy experiment. When decreasing the twist angle, we observe that the IX lifetime becomes longer and light emission gets enhanced, indicating that non-radiative decay channels such as defects are suppressed by the moiré potential. Moreover, through the integration of moiré superlattices with silicon single-mode cavities, we find that the devices employing moiré-trapped IXs exhibit a significantly lower threshold, one order of magnitude smaller compared to the device utilizing delocalized IXs. These findings not only encourage the exploration of many-body physics in moiré superlattices at elevated temperatures but also pave the way for leveraging these artificial quantum materials in photonic and optoelectronic applications.

 Marine silicate alteration exerts a major influence on marine carbon and cation cycles, but has proven difficult to quantify. In this context, silicon isotopes of marine pore fluids became an important tracer. However, poorly constrained silicon isotope signatures of precipitates produced during silicate alteration (i.e. authigenic clays) remain a major source of uncertainty. Here we present in situ silicon isotope analyses of marine authigenic clays (intergrown iron-smectites and iron-glauconites) occurring within recent sediments from the Oregon margin, eastern North Pacific. We identify a trend to lower silicon isotopes (from −2.24‰ to −3.17‰), accompanied by decreasing aluminum/silicon ratios and increasing potassium oxide contents, which we interpret as an isotopic shift caused by progressive clay maturation via dissolution-reprecipitation reactions. Our modelling suggests that this clay maturation pathway, together with mixing of other fluid sources, may induce pore fluid silicon isotope shifts of up to −1.7‰, if sufficient newly precipitated clays are re-dissolved. This could potentially produce silicon isotopes values significantly lower than seawater and implies that conventional isotope-based approaches underestimate the prevalence of marine silicate alteration. Our findings highlight that clay maturation must be considered when interpreting silicon isotope signatures in terms of marine silicate alteration and upscaling to global element cycles.

 Methane hydrates on continental margins sequester substantial amounts of methane. Ocean warming often triggers hydrate dissociation, influencing global climate and marine ecosystems. Here we use ocean reanalysis to investigate bottom marine heatwaves affecting methane seeps at the Northwest Atlantic continental margin. These heatwaves are driven by downward displacement of ocean subsurface isopycnals that brings anomalously warm water to the seafloor, which frequently lacked surface expressions. The isopycnal anomalies are generated by the interaction of Gulf Stream mesoscale activity and slope topography, including warm core ring intrusions and impingements at the tail of the Grand Banks. Once generated, the isopycnal anomalies propagate along the slope and affect the seep area via topographic Rossby waves, offering predictability for bottom marine heatwaves. A northward shift and increasing instability of the Gulf Stream has intensified bottom marine heatwaves at the seep area since 2009, and future climate change will likely exacerbate this trend.

 The intraplate magmatic systems of the Wudalianchi potassic volcanic region in northeast China have historically exhibited eruption activity, and there is evidence that they retain the potential for future eruptions.

A horizontally interconnected low-velocity zone in the middle-lower crust indicates a magmatic migration pathway transporting potassium-rich melts directly among the potassic volcanic units.

 The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) is one of the world's most important agricultural regions. Over recent decades, the declining trend in precipitation has caused more frequent droughts over the northern plateau of the GMS, and this has led to a significant reduction in agricultural productivity. These drought events can also affect agriculture within the middle and lower parts of the Mekong River basin. To reveal the main causes of the decline in precipitation, this study investigates interdecadal variations in summer precipitation over the northern GMS during 1979–2022. Results indicate that summer conditions over the northern GMS entered a relatively dry period after the late 1990s. The interdecadal decrease in summer precipitation is closely associated with the warming of the northern Arabian Sea (AS), which induces a cyclonic anomaly that enhances local precipitation and associated diabatic heating. The anomalous diabatic heating induces a downstream Rossby wave train that intensifies the circumglobal teleconnection (CGT) pattern and causes the South Asian high (SAH) to extend farther southeastwards. The southeastward-displaced SAH induces easterly anomalies over the northern Bay of Bengal (BOB) that weaken the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) southwesterly flows and reduce moisture transport from the northern BOB to the northern GMS. The southeastward displacement of the SAH also causes anomalous descent over the northern GMS. Both conditions result in reduced precipitation over the northern GMS. Numerical experiments substantiate the proposed modulating role of AS warming in the interdecadal decrease in summer precipitation over the northern GMS."

However, the 2016 extreme El Niño unexpectedly coincided with the longest and most extensive marine heatwave ever recorded in the region. This heatwave, spanning over 1.7 million square kilometers, persisting for 24 days with a peak intensity of 1.5°C, resulted in massive coral bleaching and fish mortality. This exceptional warming resulted from anomalously strong shortwave radiation and reduced heat loss via latent heat fluxes, owing to low wind speed and increased air humidity. These anomalies are attributed to a rare combined event “Madden-Julian Oscillation and extreme El Niño.” Following 10 February, the rapid dissipation of this marine heatwave results from the most intense cyclone ever recorded in the South Pacific. The hazardous ecological impacts of this extreme event highlight the needs for improving our understanding of marine heatwave–driving mechanisms that may result in better seasonal predictions."

SLC26A4 (Pendrin) is necessary for normal reabsorption of endolymph, the fluid bathing the inner ear. We identified the μ2 subunit of adaptor protein 2 (AP-2) complex required for clathrin-mediated endocytosis as a protein-partner of SLC26A4 involved in regulating its plasma membrane abundance. We showed that, in the endolymphatic sac, where fluid reabsorption occurs, SLC26A4 is localized along the apical microvilli of mitochondria-rich cells, in contact with the endolymph, and associated with clathrin-coated pits where μ2 and AP-2 are present. Based on SLC26A4 structure, the elements involved in SLC26A4-μ2 interaction were identified and validated experimentally, allowing modeling of this interaction at the atomic level. Pharmacological inhibition of clathrin-mediated endocytosis led to an increased plasma membrane abundance of hemagglutinin-tagged SLC26A4 virally or endogenously expressed in mitochondria-rich cells.

Deciphering the complexity of the membrane-binding behavior of α-syn is crucial to understand its functions and the pathology of PD. Here, we used single-molecule imaging to show that α-syn forms multimers on lipid membranes with huge intermultimer distances. The multimers are characterized by self-limiting growth, manifesting in concentration-dependent exchanges of monomers, which are fast at micromolar concentrations and almost stop at nanomolar concentrations. We further uncovered movement patterns of α-syn’s occasional trapping on membranes, which may be attributed to sparse lipid packing defects. Mutations such as E46K and E35K may disrupt the limit on the growth, resulting in larger multimers and accelerated amyloid fibril formation.

Here, we report an unexpected role for the transcription factor p63 (Trp63/TP63) in the fate choice of the squamous versus neuroendocrine lineage in esophageal development and malignancy. Deletion ofp63results in extensive neuroendocrine differentiation in the developing mouse esophagus and esophageal progenitors derived from human embryonic stem cells. In human esophageal neuroendocrine carcinoma (eNEC) cells, p63 is transcriptionally silenced by EZH2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3). Up-regulation of the major p63 isoform ΔNp63α, through either ectopic expression or EZH2 inhibition, promotes squamous transdifferentiation of eNEC cells.

VGLL3 depletion impairs the accumulation of RNF8 and RAD51 at sites of DNA damage, leading to reduced homologous recombination efficiency and increased cellular sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs. Mechanistically, VGLL3 can prevent CtIP from KLHL15-mediated ubiquitination and degradation through competitive binding with KLHL15 and, meanwhile, stabilize MDC1 by limiting TRIP12-MDC1 but promoting USP7-MDC1 associations for optimal RNF8 signaling initiation.

UnlikeRhodabacter sphaeroidescounterpart,Rba. blasticusRC-LH1 dimer has a less bent conformation, lacks the PufY subunit near the LH1 opening, and includes two extra LH1 αβ subunits, forming a more enclosed S-shaped LH1 ring. Spectroscopic assays reveal that these unique structural features are accompanied by changes in the kinetics of quinone/quinol trafficking between RC-LH1 and cytochromebc1. Our findings reveal the assembly principles and structural variability of photosynthetic RC-LH1 supercomplexes, highlighting diverse strategies used by phototrophic bacteria to optimize light-harvesting and electron transfer in competitive environments."

Our previous research identified that quiescent adult naïve CD4+T cells express LINE1 (long interspersed nuclear elements 1) spliced in previously unknown isoforms, and their down-regulation marks the transition to activation. Here, we unveil that neonatal naïve T cell quiescence is characterized by enhanced energy production and protein synthesis. This phenotype is associated with the absence of LINE1 expression attributed to tonic T cell receptor/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling and (polypyrimidine tract-binding protein 1 (PTBP1)–mediated LINE1 splicing suppression. The absence of LINE1 expression primes these cells for rapid execution of the activation program by directly regulating protein synthesis. LINE1 expression progressively increases in childhood and adults, peaking in elderly individuals, and, by decreasing protein synthesis, contributes to immune senescence in aging. Our study proposes LINE1 as a critical player of human T cell function across the human life span."

The molecular mechanism underlying the dynamic organization of ACCs is largely unknown. Here, we determined the cryo–electron microscopy (EM) structure of human ACC1 in its inactive state, which forms a unique filament structure and is in complex with acetyl-CoA. We also determined the cryo-EM structure of human ACC1 activated by dephosphorylation and citrate treatment, at a resolution of 2.55 Å. Notably, the covalently linked biotin binds to a site that is distant from the acetyl-CoA binding site when acetyl-CoA is absent, suggesting a potential coordination between biotin binding and acetyl-CoA binding. These findings provide insights into the structural dynamics and regulatory mechanisms of human ACCs."

We show that ordered defect compound semiconductor CuIn5Se8, which forms regular defect complexes with defect-pair compensation, can simultaneously achieve high performance and solution processability. CuIn5Se8transistors exhibit defect-tolerant, band-like transport supplying an output current above 35 microamperes per micrometer, with a large on/off ratio greater than 106, a small subthreshold swing of 189 ± 21 millivolts per decade, and a high field-effect mobility of 58 ± 10 square centimeters per volt per second, with excellent uniformity and stability, superior to devices built on its less defective parent compound CuInSe2, analogous binary compound In2Se3, and other solution-deposited semiconductors.

Walsh;Robert G. Hilton;Suzanne E. Tank;Edwin Amos,Temperature sensitivity of the mineral permafrost feedback at the continental scale,"Oxidative weathering of sulfide minerals in sedimentary rocks releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere. In permafrost zones, this could be a positive feedback on climate change if it increases with warming, yet sulfide oxidation rates and their temperature response remain unknown over large spatial and temporal scales. We analyze a 60-year sulfate concentration dataset from catchments across the Mackenzie River Basin. Sulfate fluxes increased by 45% in the mainstem with 2.3°C of warming, and the temperature sensitivity suggests that continental-scale CO2fluxes could double by 2100. The largest increases occur in catchments with geomorphic settings which act to rapidly expose rocks through physical weathering and thermokarst processes. Comparisons with a weathering model suggest that warming can increase reaction rates, and changes in the exposure of minerals with warming are also required. Future warming across vast Arctic landscapes could further increase sulfide oxidation rates and affect regional carbon cycle budgets."

Kaplitt,Bidirectional regulation of motor circuits using magnetogenetic gene therapy,"Here, we report a magnetogenetic system, based on a single anti-ferritin nanobody-TRPV1 receptor fusion protein, which regulated neuronal activity when exposed to magnetic fields. Adeno-associated virus (AAV)–mediated delivery of a floxed nanobody-TRPV1 into the striatum of adenosine-2a receptor–Cre drivers resulted in motor freezing when placed in a magnetic resonance imaging machine or adjacent to a transcranial magnetic stimulation device. Functional imaging and fiber photometry confirmed activation in response to magnetic fields. Expression of the same construct in the striatum of wild-type mice along with a second injection of an AAVretro expressing Cre into the globus pallidus led to similar circuit specificity and motor responses. Last, a mutation was generated to gate chloride and inhibit neuronal activity. Expression of this variant in the subthalamic nucleus in PitX2-Cre parkinsonian mice resulted in reducedc-fosexpression and motor rotational behavior. These data demonstrate that magnetogenetic constructs can bidirectionally regulate activity of specific neuronal circuits noninvasively in vivo using clinically available devices."

Robert Horvitz,The pro-apoptotic function of the C. elegans BCL-2 homolog CED-9 requires interaction with the APAF-1 homolog CED-4,"InCaenorhabditis elegans, apoptosis is inhibited by the BCL-2 homolog CED-9. Although canonically anti-apoptotic, CED-9 has a poorly understood pro-apoptotic function. CED-9 is thought to inhibit apoptosis by binding to and inhibiting the pro-apoptoticC. elegansAPAF-1 homolog CED-4. We show that CED-9 or CED-4 mutations located in their CED-9–CED-4 binding regions reduce apoptosis without affecting the CED-9 anti-apoptotic function. These mutant CED-9 and CED-4 proteins are defective in a CED-9–CED-4 interaction in vitro and in vivo, revealing that the known CED-9–CED-4 interaction is required for the pro-apoptotic but not for the anti-apoptotic function of CED-9. The pro-apoptotic CED-9–CED-4 interaction occurs at mitochondria. In mammals, BCL-2 family members can activate APAF-1 via cytochrome c release from mitochondria. The conserved role of mitochondria in CED-9/BCL-2–dependent CED-4/APAF-1 activation is notable and suggests that understanding how CED-9 promotes apoptosis inC. eleganscould inform the understanding of mammalian apoptosis and how disruptions of apoptosis promote certain human disorders."
