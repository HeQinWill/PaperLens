It plays a key role in hydrological decision-support systems and as input for short-term weather forecasts. Major changes were implemented on 31 January 2023 and the associated quality improvement is presented. Moreover, the employed radar and rain gauge datasets and the algorithms needed to produce this real-time radar product are described. 
 The Dutch real-time gauge-adjusted radar quantitative precipitation estimation (QPE) product provides 5 min accumulations every 5 min on a ∼ 1 km2 grid covering the Netherlands and the area around it (∼ 4.5×105 km2). It plays a key role in hydrological decision-support systems and as input for nowcasts in order to inform decision makers. Major changes to the production of this QPE product were implemented on 31 January 2023, and include (polarimetric) fuzzy logic clutter removal, rain-induced attenuation correction and vertical profile of reflectivity correction. Moreover, the mean-field bias rain gauge ad- justment was replaced by a spatially variable rain gauge adjustment. We evaluate the potential quality improvement resulting from these changes by comparing the last year of the old and the first year of the renewed QPE product. Clutter leading to overestimation in the old radar product is effectively removed in the renewed radar product. Evaluation against rain gauge accumulations shows a strong improvement. Average underestimation decreases by about ten percentage points to 15 % over the Netherlands. Improvements of statistics are clear for daily precipitation over a large part of the QPE product domain, but also show the potential for incorporating rain gauge accumulations outside the Netherlands. The 1 h and daily extremes over the Netherlands are also better captured by the renewed product. Improvements in daily precipitation accumulations for the renewed product are stronger in the winter period than in the summer period. Finally, it is recommended to include Belgian and German rain gauge data in the product.

Johnson;Kai-Lan Chang;Emma Yates;Owen R. Cooper;Laura T. Iraci,Global Source-Receptor-Relationship Database for Integrated Tropospheric Ozone Observations from Multiplatform Datasets in Western North America during 1994–2021,"Atmospheric observations show that free tropospheric ozone has increased across the Northern Hemisphere over the past three decades. The sources driving this increase remain unclear. In this study, we developed a source-receptor relationship database combining harmonized multiplatform ozone data and advanced atmospheric transport modeling. This database can identify emission regions responsible for ozone increases and can also be used to analyze other co-observed atmospheric constituents. 
 Long-term atmospheric ozone observations in Western North America (WNA) provide essential data for assessing tropospheric ozone trends. Backward atmospheric simulations based on these observations establish the source-receptor relationships (SRRs) to improve our understanding of the factors driving ozone trends across different regions, time periods, and atmospheric layers. In this study, we integrated 28 years of ozone data (1994–2021) from ozonesondes, lidar, commercial aircraft, and aircraft campaigns across WNA, spanning the upper atmospheric boundary layer, free troposphere, and upper troposphere (i.e., 900 to 300 hPa). We reconciled the multiplatform datasets using a data fusion framework to generate 553,608 gridded ozone receptors. For each receptor, we use the FLEXible PARTicle (FLEXPART) dispersion model, driven by ERA5 reanalysis data, to achieve the SRRs calculations, providing global simulations at high temporal (hourly) and spatial (1° x 1°) resolution from the surface up to 20 km above ground level. This SRR database retains detailed information for each receptor, including the gridded ozone value product, which enables user to illustrate and identify source contributions to various subsets of ozone observations in the troposphere above WNA over nearly 3 decades at different vertical layers and temporal scales, such as diurnal, daily, seasonal, intra-annual, and decadal. More generally, the calculated SRRs are applicable to any study looking to evaluate origins of airmasses reaching WNA. As such, this database can support source contribution analyses for other atmospheric components observed over WNA, if other co-located observations have been made at the spatial and temporal scales defined for some or all of the gridded ozone receptors used here."

 This data paper presents an overview of the cloud spectrometers deployed during the Pallas Cloud Experiment (PaCE) in autumn 2022, a coordinated measurement campaign in the Finnish subarctic that took place between September 12th and December 15th, 2022. Four cloud spectrometers, the Cloud Aerosol Spectrometer (CAS), the Forward Scattering Spectrometer Probe (FSSP-100), the Cloud Droplet Analyzer (CDA), and the ICEMET were operated as ground-based setups, providing high-resolution, in-cloud measurements of droplet size distributions and key microphysical properties, such as number concentration (Nc), liquid water content (LWC), median volume diameter (MVD), and effective diameter (ED). The dataset is complemented by meteorological observations of temperature, humidity, wind speed, and visibility at a 1 min resolution.

The data show a relatively large level of variability, but also important trends in greenhouse gases, and signals from fires as well as seasonal biological activity. 
 Long-term and high-precision measurements of the mole fraction of greenhouse gases (GHG), together with their isotopic composition, are of fundamental importance to understand land-atmosphere interactions. Current flask monitoring programs have important information gaps in large regions of the Earth, particularly in the southern hemisphere and in continental tropical regions. Here, we report on the initiation of a monitoring program and the resulting dataset of high-precision GHG measurements at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO), located in the central Amazon region of Brazil. In September 2021, we installed an automated flask sampler designed and built by the Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) to collect air samples in 3-liter flasks at a height of 324 m above ground level. Samples are collected weekly, during a one-hour integration time between 13:00 and 14:00 h local time (17:00–18:00 UTC). The flasks are shipped to Jena, Germany, for analyses of CO2, CO, CH4, N2O, H2, SF6, 13C–CO2, 14C–CO2, 18O–CO2, 13C–CH4, 2H–CH4, O2/N2, and Ar/N2 at the laboratories of the Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry (MPI-BGC). Measurements from this monitoring program provide reference information for this site and act as an additional independent quality control for other measurements in the region. The record of SF6 and simulations based on a regional atmospheric transport model suggest that the footprint of the measurements is predominantly from the southeasterly and northeasterly directions. The time series of the different gas species measured in this monitoring program are being made publicly available through the ATTO data portal and the atmospheric flask sampling program of the MPI-BGC."

Observations of decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D5-Siloxane) are used for optimizing emissions from personal care products, para-dichlorobenzene (PDCBZ) for insecticides, and parachlorobenzotrifluoride (PCBTF) for emissions from the construction (coatings + adhesives) subsector. Continuous ground-site measurements obtained in Las Vegas and Los Angeles (LA) during summer 2021 are used to optimize the temporal emission profiles of the area sources. Additionally, in situ aircraft-based observations (June 2021) over the LA region are used to evaluate emission factors for the basin. The configuration of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model is optimized using vertical wind profile measurements obtained from the Pick-Up truck-based Mobile Atmospheric Sounder (PUMAS) deployed in the LA basin to minimize the uncertainty of the inversion due to meteorology. While the diurnal amplitude in emission rates from personal care products and insecticides is reduced after optimization, that of construction VCPs (coatings + adhesives) is enhanced. From the aircraft inversion, we find that the inventory underestimates the emissions originating from construction by a factor of 5.3 (95% confidence interval 4.3–6.3) in the LA basin. Emissions from consumer products (personal care + cleaning) and insecticides were reduced by a factor of 2.1 (1.7–2.5) and 5.2 (3.9–6.4), respectively, following optimization."

However, studies on OBS-induced environmental health risks of obstructive biosynthesis (OBS) are currently limited, particularly the risk for thyroid diseases. Following the construction of in vivo (mouse) and in vitro (normal human primary thyrocytes) models of subchronic low-dose OBS exposure, we explored the thyroid-disrupting effects of OBS through multiomics approaches and experimental validations. Our results showed that subchronic exposure to low doses of OBS led to primary hypothyroidism in mice, presenting with reduced number and functional abnormalities of thyrocytes. Further in vitro assays confirmed that low-dose OBS-induced disulfidptosis, a newly discovered form of programmed cell death, in human primary thyrocytes. Meanwhile, exposure to low-dose OBS remarkably suppressed thyroid hormone synthesis pathways in mouse and human thyrocytes. The charted multiomic landscape of OBS-induced primary hypothyroidism in mammals revealed the thyroid toxicity and endocrine-disrupting properties of OBS, suggesting that it is not a safe alternative to PFOS."

While prior studies have demonstrated that OPFRs can be transferred from mothers to fetuses, the mechanism underlying transplacental transfer remains unclear. The pregnant ICR mouse and JAR cell (a monolayer model), in combination with molecular docking, were used to explore the underlying mechanism. OPFRs were rapidly metabolized into diester metabolites following oral gavage in the ICR mouse, with considerable concentrations detected in maternal serum, amniotic fluid, and placenta, as well as fetus within 3 h. After 6 h, the accumulation ratios of OPFRs between the mother and fetus exhibited a parabolic relationship with log KOW. Oral exposure resulted in a decrease in interstitial cells in the decidua and an expansion of vascular systems in the labyrinthine area. RT-qPCR analysis revealed upregulated expression levels of transporter mRNA in the placenta, suggesting a protective mechanism characterized by greater efflux than influx transport efficiency. Metabolic inhibitors applied during in vitro transepithelial transport experiments using the JAR cells significantly reduced the transport efficiency, indicating that active transport facilitated the transplacental transport of aryl-OPFRs, with reductions exceeding 50%. Molecular docking analysis indicated that aryl-OPFRs exhibited greater binding affinities to placental transporters compared to other types of OPFRs, with more bonding interactions. These findings offer new insights into the potential health impacts of OPFR exposure and highlight the importance of elucidating their transplacental transport mechanisms."

The approach was applied to soil impacted by aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) contamination. A total of 96 tentatively identified PFAS were semiquantified in addition to 28 quantified compounds based on available standards. Semiquantified concentrations exceeded those of target analytes, demonstrating the critical role of this method in capturing broader PFAS contamination. In this case, validation against extractable organofluorine (EOF) showed a 102% closed mass balance.

Currently, nontargeted screening of ECs has been developed for their assessment, which requires sophisticated instrumentation. Although satellite remote sensing is a cost-effective technology for water quality assessment, accurately measuring ECs in a river-to-ocean continuum remains a significant challenge due to their trace levels. To address this challenge, we innovate a strategy utilizing satellite remote sensing to achieve high-resolution nontargeted EC screening. By employing DOM as an intermediary variable, bridging the gap between satellite remote sensing and ECs in river-to-ocean continua. DOM, including the total sum of ECs, reflects their distribution and spectral sensitivity, enabling satellite sensing to capture their unique fingerprints. In this study, this strategy has enhanced the accuracy of nontargeted EC screening from 32.2 to 95.7% using machine learning. Interpretable machine learning causal inference and SHAP models reveal that shortwave infrared (SWIR) S2-B11 is crucial for EC screening while emphasizing the importance of avoiding multicollinearity with similar SWIR band S2-B12. Additionally, the band reflectance is influenced by the proportion of polarity-related heterogeneity in the ECs.

Nevertheless, little is known about the photochemical activity of colored microplastics and the associated risks that are ubiquitous in the environment. In this study, we report the strong photochemical activity of microplastics colored with cadmium pigments. These colored microplastics can be excited by photons within the solar spectrum (<514 nm), readily generating •OH, O2•–, and H2O2. Consequently, they can effectively degrade 17β-estradiol, achieving >91% degradation within 23 h under simulated solar exposure. Among microplastics colored with different cadmium pigments, those with a cadmium pigment S/Se ratio of 2:5 exhibited the highest photoactivity. This is attributed to the narrow band gap, fast charge separation, and efficient charge transfer of the microplastics, as suggested by the energy band, photocurrent, and electrochemical impedance results. Meanwhile, hazardous Cd2+ was leached from colored microplastics mainly owing to the oxidation of pigment lattices by photogenerated holes. Our results reveal that microplastics colored with photoactive inorganic pigments behave drastically differently from uncolored counterparts. This highlights the importance of considering pigments as a critical factor for better assessing the environmental fate and risks of colored microplastics and plastic products."

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are among the most toxic substances in petroleum oil, yet their behavior in sea-ice-covered waters remains poorly studied. Here, we report an outdoor microcosm study to examine the partitioning behavior of four PAHs (naphthalene, phenanthrene, pyrene, and benzo(a)pyrene) across the seawater-sea-ice-atmosphere interface in the presence of particulate humic acid as a surrogate for particulate organic carbon (POC). We show that the higher the molecular weight of the PAH, the higher its concentration in sea-ice and the POC fraction. The POC-aqueous phase (seawater or bulk sea-ice) partition coefficients, Kd, are reasonably well explained by temperature and salinity for all four PAHs in seawater and for phenanthrene and pyrene in sea-ice. Relationships of Kd with temperature and salinity in sea-ice and freezing seawater are complex and nonunidirectional, most likely due to the dynamic nature of sea-ice and seawater under such temperatures. This suggests that conventional equilibrium-based approaches developed for open-water conditions need to be revisited when describing the behavior of PAHs in ice-covered waters."

By enhancing oxygen adsorption and facilitating charge carrier separation, OVs significantly improve reactive oxygen species (ROS, including ·O2– and ·OH) generation and overall photocatalytic activity. As a demonstration, the surface OVs-engineered BiOCl-based photocatalytic solar interfacial evaporator demonstrated a 3.41-fold increase in VOC (phenol) removal efficiency compared to a conventional system, achieving over 99.6% VOC removal in condensed water and maintaining a high water vapor generation flux of 1.90 kg/m2/h. This innovative design was further validated using ZnO-based photocatalysts, demonstrating the broad applicability of OV-engineering in interfacial systems. By fully utilizing both the high oxygen content at the air–water interface and improving photocarrier dynamics, this approach represents a significant advancement in photocatalytic water treatment technologies, offering a scalable and highly efficient solution for VOC removal and clean water production."

However, whether LPS participates in atmospheric chemistry and how its biological health impacts change with the relevant processes are poorly understood. In this study, we employed the rat model to investigate the impact of ozone oxidation on the biological toxicity of LPS and used Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and high-resolution electrospray mass spectrometry to study the underlying reaction mechanisms. The results show that the LPS can be oxidized by ozone and the resulting reactant greatly enhanced inflammatory anemia with a 177% capacity increase despite a minor influence on its immunogenicity. In contrast to the control, rats exposed to oxidized LPS were observed to release characteristic exhaled biomarkers, indicating that the formed reactant indeed altered the biological effects of LPS. Mechanistic investigation reveals that ozone oxidation of the hydroxyl group in the key toxic part of LPS, kdo2-lipid A, can cause dysregulation of iron homeostasis in rats, which is the mechanism of oxidized LPS-enhanced anemia. Unfortunately, these chemical structure changes and the resulting health impacts cannot be detected by the conventional LPS analysis method. This study highlights the changes in the toxicity of LPS and its health impacts when oxidized by ozone and the need to broadly consider the involvement of bioaerosol in atmospheric chemistry."

Previous field studies have observed an inverse correlation between these two pollutants indoors, but the specific mechanism remains unclear. Given the semivolatile behavior of HONO, a possible mechanism is its multiphase reaction with ozone. In this study, we measured ozone uptake on surface HONO/NO2– under environmentally relevant conditions in a flow tube. The ozone deposition velocities (vd = 0.002 ± 0.001–0.3 ± 0.005 cm s–1) and uptake coefficients (γ = (0.2 ± 0.1) × 10–6–(2.0 ± 0.2) × 10–4) depend on reactant concentrations, relative humidity, and reaction time but are less affected by illumination. The lifetimes of gaseous HONO and ozone are approximately 10 min due to this multiphase reaction under indoor conditions, which is a significant sink for HONO and O3 as compared to those of other indoor reactions and air exchange. This study for the first time revealed the previously overlooked vital role of the reaction of surface HONO/NO2– with O3 in affecting both indoor HONO and O3 and has significance for understanding the multiphase chemistry of HONO and O3, with implications for outdoor surfaces and model studies to better constrain HONO sinks."

However, limited understanding of electron propagation mechanisms during discharge has led previous research to focus on hydrated electrons (eaq–) while neglecting free electrons (e–). In this study, a consistent and modeled dielectric barrier discharge (DBD) plasma was employed to degrade PFOA. Contribution analysis indicated that reactions driven by e– were dominant, with substantial contributions from hydroxyl radical (•OH)-mediated oxidation. By integrating a kinetic model with a streamer solver, a basic discharge unit model was developed. Simulation of e– streamer propagation identified a high-intensity response electric field formed by the e– memory effect, with a peak strength of 1.816 × 106 V/m. This electric field facilitated a secondary acceleration of e–, allowing e– to penetrate the surface water layer and directly attack PFOA via chain-shortening mechanisms. The delocalized state of e– restricted degradation primarily to the gas–liquid interface, minimizing interference from the surrounding medium. This study highlights the previously overlooked role of e– and provides essential theoretical insights for the plasma-based treatment of PFOA-contaminated water."

The range of total PFAS concentrations in surface sediments from the river outlets and the NSCS was 244–14400 pg/g dry weight (dw) and 31.6–363 pg/g dw, respectively. In sediment cores, perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) concentrations initially increased and then declined around ten years ago. Levels of long-chain perfluorinated carboxylates have been increasing since the 1980s and experienced an accelerated rise in the 2000s. Hydrogen-substituted polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonate (H-PFESA) was widely found in sediment samples for the first time. The ratios of 6:2 H-PFESA to 6:2 chlorinated (Cl-) PFESA in sediment cores exceeded those in surface sediment and exhibited an increasing trend with the sediment age, implying the gradual transformation of 6:2 Cl-PFESA to its hydrogen-substituted analog in sediments.

However, current preferred end-of-life waste management solutions, such as aerobic composting and anaerobic digestion, are not optimal for bioplastics, due to their slow and variable degradation rates. Thus, the isolation of novel microbes and their plastic-degrading enzymes is necessary to improve existing bioplastic disposal and create more sustainable routes to valorize waste plastic. In this study, through functional enrichment cultures, we isolated 14 unique microbes capable of PLA and PBAT degradation and applied a computational discovery pipeline to identify plastic-degrading enzymes. Through this, a focused set of 97 enzymes was functionally characterized, finding three active PLA-degrading enzymes. The two most active enzymes, JW45_1534 and JW44_1708, displayed broad polyester degrading activity against PLA, PBAT, PBSA, PCL, and Impranil polyurethane. Uniquely, under optimized reaction conditions, JW44_1708 fully solubilized low-molecular-weight PLA powder (100−500 mM lactic acid equivalents) in 18 h at 30 °C, with 43−65% conversion to monomeric lactic acid.

Those models would enable accurate prediction of surface fluxes and reliable classification of environmental risks. Notably, the pollutant fluxes through the soil–air interface over a short period could be sufficient to cause slow-airflow space air concentrations to exceed acceptable levels.

However, salt entrapment in the close-dendritic ice pore network is uncontrollable, which makes ice-salt separation a challenge. To address this issue, this study reported the electro-assisted crystallization (EAC) to realize the controllable FD, inspired by the ice purification during insulator flashover frequently observed in power transmission systems. The experiment performed at −20 °C demonstrated that EAC allowed ice crystallization with an open ice pore network, whose open-area percentage was increased from 25 to 41% as current density was raised from 10 to 30 mA cm–2. The EAC could achieve 89.3% desalination efficiency from 35 g L–1 saltwater at 30 mA cm–2, the value being four times that obtained for direct FD.

Estuarine sediments function as major sinks for MPs and hotspots for critical biogeochemical processes, which are significantly influenced by benthic bioturbation. However, the impacts of MPs on the behavior of highly mobile benthic organisms and the ecological effects of bioturbation activities remain poorly understood. This study utilized laboratory simulation experiments, AI-based behavioral tracking, and metagenomic sequencing to systematically examine the effects of sand crab bioturbation on MPs migration, sediment physicochemical properties and sulfur cycling processes. Results demonstrated that sand crab bioturbation substantially enhanced the vertical migration of MPs, with fluxes to surface layers and the overlying water increasing by 27-fold compared to undisturbed conditions. Exposure to PE-MPs reduced sand crabs’ surface foraging intensity and induced behavioral abnormalities. The crabs actively avoided MPs, exhibiting a preference for burrowing and residing in deeper sediment layers. This behavioral shift significantly altered microbial community distributions, with an increase of Pseudomonadota abundance and a decline of sulfate-reducing bacteria Thermodesulfobacteriota abundance. Furthermore, bioturbation accelerated sulfate oxidation in deeper sediments while inhibited dissimilatory sulfate reduction. This study is the first to identify the role of bioturbation in promoting the upward migration of MPs in sediments. Altered sand crab bioturbation will impact sediment biogeochemistry, estuarine function, and coastal resilience."

To improve our understanding of the chemical and physical properties of BBA emitted at different times of the day and their evolution during atmospheric aging, we conducted a study as a part of the Fire Influence on Regional to Global Environments and Air Quality field campaign. Particle samples were collected onboard a research aircraft from smoke plumes from a wildfire in eastern Oregon during late afternoon and nighttime flights on August 28, 2019. A time-resolved aerosol collector was used to collect samples on substrates for offline spectromicroscopic imaging to investigate the single-particle characteristics of BBA particles. Approximately 20,400 individual particles from 10 selected samples were analyzed using computer-controlled scanning electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis, revealing their elemental composition, morphology, and viscosity. Elemental microanalysis indicated that aged potassium is likely found in the form of K2SO4, KNO3, and possible K-organic salts. Further chemical speciation and carbon bonding mapping within individual particles were conducted using synchrotron-based scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM) coupled with near edge X-ray absorption fine structure (NEXAFS) spectroscopy. Real-time, water-soluble light absorption measurements were acquired using a particle-into-liquid sampler instrument coupled to a liquid waveguide capillary cell and total organic analyzer. In the late afternoon samples, 65% of the total particle number population consisted entirely of organic components, compared to 46% in the nighttime particles. These differences were attributed to discrepancies in composition at the time of emission and to the daytime condensation and accumulation of photochemically formed secondary organic material on existing BBA particles, a process that halts at night. Microscopy images indicated that particle viscosity was lower in the nighttime particles (<101 Pa·s), likely due to increased relative humidity and a higher contribution from hygroscopic inorganic components. The chemical heterogeneity of individual particles was quantified using STXM-derived mixing state parameters. The nature of carbon bonding within individual particles was inferred from the extent of carbon sp2 hybridization derived from NEXAFS spectra. Average percentages of sp2 hybridization range between 40% and 60%, with no noticeable differences between late afternoon and nighttime flights. These findings were compared with the online optical properties of both late afternoon and nighttime smoke plumes, providing valuable insights into the complex relationship between chemical composition and optical properties of BBA particles at different times of the day."

Notably, the co-occurrence frequency was higher during the COVID-19 pandemic, implying that such co-occurrence may be more spatially widespread with continuous PM2.5 reduction in China. Taking the pandemic period as an example, we leveraged a machine learning algorithm (i.e., Random Forest) coupled with SHapley Additive ExPlanation (SHAP) to identify higher relative importance of solar radiation-related variables (e.g., surface net solar radiation) during co-occurrence periods compared to non-co-occurrence periods in the YRD. Additionally, incorporating volatile organic compounds (VOCs) measurements, we further showed the higher relative importance of VOCs to the extremes of ozone and PM2.5 through a case study at Shaoxing (a typical city in the YRD).

Salivary proteomics demonstrated salivary secretion was upregulated in AAs while Fc gamma R-mediated phagocytosis, bacterial invasion defense, natural killer cell function, leukocyte migration, and phagosome function were downregulated, suggesting dysregulated innate immune function in AA vapers. Additionally, focal adhesion, cell–substrate junction, and actin cytoskeleton regulation were downregulated in AA vapers, indicating that mucous epithelium barrier integrity may be disrupted. Lastly, the Community Periodontal Index of Treatment Need (CPITN), a dental assessment tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) to evaluate periodontal health and determine the need for treatment, revealed that a significantly higher proportion of AA vapers had CPITN scores of 3 or higher, suggesting the need for further clinical assessment of periodontal disease. Collectively, our results suggest that AAs may be more susceptible to oral health effects of vaping than individuals of other racial groups, with elevated levels of oxidative stress, dysregulated innate immune function, mucous epithelium barrier integrity disruption, and varying nicotine metabolism."

Despite this potential, few field trials have been published that verify the carbon dioxide removal (CDR) potential of enhanced weathering in croplands and, until now, none had been published in grazing lands. Anthony et al. (2025, https://doi.org/10.1029/2024AV001480) conducted the first trial of enhanced weathering in a California rangeland and showed weathering of ground silicate rocks despite drought conditions in an already dry climate. Co‐application of inorganic (silicate rocks) with organic (biochar and compost) amendments revealed not just additive, but synergistic effects whereby organic amendments increased rates of weathering. This is important because field CDR rates were <10% of the theoretical maximum (i.e., the rate if basalt was completely weathered); thus, methods to improve weathering rates will be necessary for this practice to scale in a meaningful way. Multi‐carbon pool measurements revealed not only how co‐application of soil amendments heightened net carbon benefits, but also how soil amendments complemented each other to produce net benefits for soil carbon, biomass growth, and greenhouse gas emission reductions. Anthony et al.

To address this gap, we propose a modeling framework that combines river flow observations, paleo‐hydrological reconstructions, and climate model simulations. Such diversity of climate information, that is bridged in a flexible approach, allows evaluating the hazard of hydrological droughts for any large catchment globally. By focusing on the specific case of Alpine regions and analyzing the information contained in an ensemble for the period 1100–2100, we show that, compared to the past nine centuries, the mean annual flow in the Po River (Italy's main water course) may decrease by about 10% during the 21st century, while the mean drought duration and severity are likely to increase by approximately 11% and 12%, respectively. Future drought conditions are likely to match, or even exceed, the driest period of the Medieval Climate Anomaly under different emissions scenarios. This indicates unprecedented drought conditions in Alpine regions in the coming decades, thus calling for an increased preparedness in managing water resources under climate change."

However, studies using geophysical methods to assess how soil crack patterns and shrinkage respond to climate change remain scarce. Induced polarization, a non‐intrusive geophysical technique, is highly sensitive to the moisture content and pore structure of the porous media. For the first time, we investigate the effect of soil surface crack patterns on complex conductivity under freeze‐thaw cycling and desiccation processes using a new experimental set‐up. Results show that Y‐junction‐dominated crack patterns form on the sample surface after freeze‐thaw cycling, and surface cracking network extends along existing cracks until desiccation ceases. Our findings from induced polarization experiments reveal that two components of complex conductivity are linearly sensitive to surface crack ratio and gravimetric water content. Additionally, they both exhibit a similar decay behavior with drying time. In summary, these results indicate that induced polarization provides a preliminary approach for monitoring the surface crack patterns of clayey soils."

SW07 occurred at the earliest winter time of the year recorded in the satellite era (1979 to present). The study found that, strong blocking highs affected stratospheric warming via nonlinear planetary wave prior to SW07, and the substantial sea ice loss over Antarctic Ross Sea and Amundsen Sea likely created favorable conditions for the formation of these blocking highs. Furthermore, the stratospheric preconditioning significantly amplified the intensity of the planetary waves.

Errors in trajectory modeling introduce mismatches between areas actually affected by ship‐emissions and virtual ship‐track locations, that is, positional errors. Positional errors systematically underestimate ACI signals and the underestimate is severe as indicated by analysis of cloud droplet number concentration changes.

 Accurately extracting forest land and understanding its spatial distribution are crucial for forest monitoring and management. However, variations in tree species, human activities, and natural disturbances create diverse and distinct forest land characteristics in remote sensing images, posing challenges for precise forest land extraction. To address these challenges, we propose a spatial-semantic information fusion network (S2-IFNet) integrated with boundary feature enhancement for forest land extraction from Sentinel-2 data. S2-IFNet employs a dual-branch network to separately extract the spatial and semantic features of forest land. In the semantic branch, two modules are introduced: a boundary enhancement module using the Sobel operator to capture forest land boundary details, and an attention module to strengthen the feature representation capability. Finally, a spatial-semantic fusion module effectively combines the spatial, semantic, and boundary detail information to improve the forest land extraction accuracy. S2-IFNet was evaluated across five regions in different global climate zones, with a comparative analysis conducted against four forest land-cover products in Yunnan, China. The results show that S2-IFNet can achieve an overall accuracy exceeding 90%, demonstrating its strong forest land extraction capability. Compared to the different forest land extraction models, S2-IFNet shows a superior performance, with ablation experiments confirming the effectiveness of each module. In particular, the boundary feature enhanced spatial-semantic fusion strategy enables S2-IFNet to focus more precisely on the boundaries and range of forest land, thereby enhancing the extraction accuracy. Meanwhile, S2-IFNet can adapt to complex scenarios, including varying forest density and similar object confusion. Furthermore, S2-IFNet can achieve results that are superior to the four other products."

 Fall Armyworm (FAW), Spodoptera frugiperda (J.E. Smith) (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), poses a significant risk to global food and income security by attacking various crops, particularly maize. Early detection and management of FAW infestation are crucial for mitigating its impact on crop yields. This study investigated the effect of FAW infestation on the spectral signature of maize fields and classified infestation severity in Bangladesh using Sentinel-2 satellite imagery and Random Forest (RF) classification. Field observations on FAW infestation severity (none, moderate, and severe), collected by the Bangladesh Department of Agricultural Extension during 2019 and 2020, were used to train the RF classifier. Six thousand nine hundred ninety-eight observations were collected from 579 maize fields through weekly scouting. The Kruskal-Wallis test and Dunn’s post-hoc test were applied to identify the most significant spectral bands (P < 0.05) for detecting FAW incidence and severity across different maize growth stages. The results demonstrated that the spectral reflectance from Sentinel-2 bands varied significantly among different classes of FAW infestation, with noticeable differences observed during the early developmental stages of maize (vegetative growth stages 3 to 8). RF identified nine spectral bands and two spectral vegetation indices as important for FAW infestation discrimination. The RF classifier was evaluated using five-fold cross-validation, achieving an overall accuracy between 74 % and 84 %. The independent test set’s accuracy ranged from 72 % to 82 %. The mean multiclass AUC ranged from 0.83 to 0.95. Moreover, the results demonstrated the feasibility of detecting the severity of FAW infestation using temporal Sentinel-2 data and machine learning techniques. These findings underscore the potential of remote sensing and machine learning techniques for effectively monitoring and managing crop pests. The study provides valuable insights for classifying FAW infestation using high-resolution multitemporal data."

 The El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) has complex effects on human health through ozone pollution and heatwave compound events (OPHW). Although the climatic driving mechanisms of single extreme events in China have been preliminarily confirmed, the nexus of ENSO-OPHW-population exposure risk remains unclear. This study collected Niño 3.4 index, surface O3 and 209 Chinese cities' meteorological station data during the warm seasons (May–October) of 2013–2020, to reveal the effects of the ENSO on the three types of OPHW (ozone pollution-daytime heatwave: OPDH, ozone pollution-nighttime heatwave: OPNH, and ozone pollution-daytime and nighttime compound heatwave: OPCH) and the OPHW risks in major cities in China, via spatiotemporal statistics and geographical and temporal weighted regression (GTWR) modeling. Trend analyses indicate that ozone concentration, temperature, and the co-occurrence days of the three types of OPHW increase at a higher rate during El Niño periods than during La Niña periods. The driving effect of ENSO are found to amplify the OPHW is ranked as follows: ozone concentration (6.1 μg m−3) > temperature (1.8 °C) > co-occurrence days (0.2 days). Driven by the position of the subtropical high and anticyclonic changes over the continent, clear skies, high temperatures, low humidity, and low wind speeds significantly influence the three types of compound events. Moreover, during La Niña periods, the anomalous low-level anticyclone shows a significant southward shift compared to El Niño periods. During El Niño periods, the population exposure risk caused by OPHW is generally higher than during La Niña periods. OPDH, OPNH, and OPCH lead to the maximum relative changes of population exposure risk in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River (100 %), Sichuan-Chongqing (44.5 %), and Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (11.2 %) urban agglomerations, respectively. These findings highlight the need for targeted research on the differential impacts of various compound events on regional population health and ecosystems.

 With the increasing frequency of ozone (O3) pollution episodes in China, there is a growing emphasis on understanding the contributions of precursors to O3. Identifying key volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that drive O3 formation has become a primary research focus. However, comprehending these key VOCs' distribution characteristics and patterns remains challenging. This study employs the convergent cross-mapping (CCM) method to identify and quantify causal relationships between 25 VOCs and O3 simulated by WRF-Chem model. The results indicate that key VOCs identified by CCM can correspond well with those calculated based on observational data. Furthermore, the contributions and sources of various VOCs exhibits notable regional variations, showing a change with the O3 formation sensitivity (OFS). In areas where OFS is strongly limited by VOCs, such as coastal ports and cities with concentrated resources or populations, alkenes, ketoaldehyde, and alcohols contribute more to O3 formation. Meanwhile, the proportion of primary emission sources of oxygenated VOCs is relatively high (62.36–78.64 %), while secondary production sources are relatively low. Conversely, in regions where OFS is minimally limited by VOCs, such as agricultural areas in northern China, alkanes, aromatics, and phenols become more important. In this context, primary source contributions diminish while secondary source contributions rise to 19.1 %–45.6 %. Given North China's complex VOCs sources, this study suggests reducing key VOCs by targeting OFS characteristics within specific regions."

 The lower atmosphere close to the Earth's surface, though crucial for various process studies and models, still remained a gap area for a long. The Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology (IITM) pioneered in collecting aerosol and cloud data using manned aircraft. However, to fill the data gap in the lower atmosphere, IITM envisaged Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) as an innovative aerial platform and the program ‘Lower Atmospheric Research using Unmanned Aerial System Facility (LARUS)’ is instigated to demonstrate the efficacy of a fixed-wing medium size UAS for probing the lower atmosphere for climate studies. The UAS is equipped with lightweight advanced science payload and an isokinetic aerosol inlet, for targeted in-situ measurements of aerosol, chemistry, radiation, turbulence and meteorological parameters (temperature (T) and Relative Humidity (RH)). The vertical profiles on different flight days depicted high vertical diurnal variability of the measured parameters. Comparison of T & RH profiles of INSAT-3DR Sounder and UAS depicted huge data gap in satellite profiles in the lower altitudes. The new approach in our study is obtaining high frequency simultaneous in-situ measurements within the footprint of 5 km with high vertical resolution to study local atmospheric processes.The data emphasises elevated absorbing aerosol layers (AAL) or haze layers with maximum absorption up to 500 m above the ground due to local anthropogenic activities. The sample filter papers revealed the type, source and morphology of the observed aerosols. The incoming and reflected (outgoing) shortwave radiation indicated distinct features with an albedo of 0.178 above the haze layer (at 500 m) and 0.017 at the surface and solar absorption of 70 W/m2 in the layer 0–500 m. The presence of haze also influenced the turbulence parameters (u, v, w) and Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE) at those altitudes.

10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108102,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注的是欧亚大陆春季积雪的年代际变化，以及太平洋年代际涛动（PDO）对这种变化的影响。研究表明，PDO通过影响气温和大气环流来调节积雪的变化。虽然该研究涉及大气环流，但其重点在于气候现象对积雪的影响，而不是直接关于大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Eurasian snow cover', 'Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO)', 'air temperature', 'atmospheric circulation']",Taotao Zhang;Haishan Chen,Pacific decadal oscillation modulates the decadal variations of spring Eurasian snow cover,"•Northern Eurasian spring snow cover features a coherent change on decadal timescale. •Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) is the main driver of the decadal snow change. •PDO affects the snow change by modulating the variations of air temperature. •PDO-induced anomalous atmospheric circulations spread its influence to Eurasia. •Circulation shapes temperature anomaly via thermal advection and diabatic heating. 
 The prominent decadal variations can be observed in the warming-induced long-term decline of Eurasian spring snow cover, which have reversed or accelerated the decreasing trend during some periods, making the understanding and prediction of the response of snow cover to climate warming more complicated. However, it remains unknown what contributes to such decadal variations. This study reveals that the spring snow cover over the mid-high latitudes of Eurasia features a consistent oscillation on the decadal timescale, which is tightly associated with the preceding winter Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). The sea surface temperature anomaly related to the winter PDO can persist into the following spring and excite an anomalous wave train type circulation extending eastward from North Pacific to Eurasia. In the positive PDO phases, there is an anticyclonic and a cyclonic circulation over northern Europe and northeast Eurasia that would reduce the surface air temperature over northern Eurasia via favoring the cold advection and negative diabatic heating. Consequently, the decreased air temperature is conducive to forming the positive anomaly of snow cover. Our results can provide a valuable clue for the decadal prediction of spring Eurasian snow cover variations."

 Mitigating air pollution in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), one of China's most densely populated regions, is critical for reducing pollution-related health impacts. This study uses the WRF-Chem model to simulate the concentrations of two key pollutants, PM2.5 and O3, and to assess their responses to various emission control measures. Our objective is to provide actionable insights for designing effective clean air policies to improve future air quality in the YRD. The sensitivity analysis using the Comprehensive Air Quality Index (CAQI) underscores the complex interactions between PM2.5, O3, and reductions in NOx and VOC emissions. Notably, NOx reductions exhibit the greatest potential for lowering CAQI in summer, but in winter, the positive effects on PM2.5 reduction may be offset by higher O3 levels. Despite this trade-off, deep NOx emission cuts remain the most effective strategy for controlling both PM2.5 and O3 pollution in the YRD. These findings provide critical numerical insights and serve as a strong foundation for policymakers to develop targeted air quality management strategies."

 High-resolution precipitation data aid climate research and forecasting, reveal precipitation mechanisms, assess extreme events, provide empirical support for models, enhance prediction accuracy, and have application value for weather forecasting and beyond. The Xinjiang region of China, characterized by its vast expanse and complex terrain, exhibits a pronounced spatial and temporal disparity in precipitation distribution. Traditional ground meteorological observation stations are sparse and unevenly distributed, leading to considerable limitations and uncertainties in precipitation observation data. The Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement products (i.e., IMERG) provide new-generation satellite precipitation measurements, but they are inaccurate in regions with complex terrain. Leveraging the advantages of multiple data sources to achieve complementary fusion of precipitation data can effectively increase the accuracy and spatiotemporal resolution of data. In this study, we proposed a merged (automatic weather station and IMERG measurements) high-spatiotemporal resolution (0.1° × 0.1°) hourly precipitation product (M-AWSI), and then evaluated its applications. For the 2027 AWS in Xinjiang, the RBFN (radial basis function neural network) method was used to obtain the gridded data, and RBFN can overcome the insufficient of traditional interpolation in local approximation ability. Furtherly, the gridded data is fused with the IMERG data by using an optimized probability matching total correction scheme, where multiple constraints are incorporated, such as effective correction radius and distance weight correction to avoid temporal and spatial discontinuity of the data in neighboring areas. Compared with observational data, the IMERG product effectively captures the spatial distribution characteristics of precipitation in the Xinjiang region. However, it exhibits significant underestimation of heavy precipitation and overestimations of weak precipitation, while failing to accurately depict the peak time in the diurnal precipitation variation. The M-AWSI data have markedly elevated the representation indices for daily precipitation across various intensities, with particularly prominent performance in augmenting the hit rate for identifying heavy rain and rainstorm events. Furthermore, in relation to the hourly probability density distribution and the attributes of daily precipitation variability, the alignment between M-AWSI and observational data has been significantly strengthened. Additionally, the M-AWSI data demonstrates a substantial improvement in its ability to represent extreme precipitation zones and their evolutionary characteristics compared to IMERG data. The M-AWSI data effectively overcomes the limitations of IMERG, which tend to underestimate heavy precipitation and overestimate weak precipitation. The establishment of this dataset will contribute to a deeper understanding of precipitation characteristics, particularly extreme precipitation events, in the Xinjiang region."

We found that regulatory T cells (Tregcells) could inhibit nociception through a mechanism that was not dependent on their ability to regulate immune activation and tissue repair. Site-specific depletion or expansion of meningeal Tregcells (mTregcells) in mice led to female-specific and sex hormone–dependent modulation of mechanical sensitivity. Specifically, mTregcells produced the endogenous opioid enkephalin that exerted an antinociceptive action through the delta opioid receptor expressed by MrgprD+sensory neurons. Although enkephalin restrains nociceptive processing, it was dispensable for Tregcell–mediated immunosuppression. Thus, our findings uncovered a sexually dimorphic immunological circuit that restrains nociception, establishing Tregcells as sentinels of pain homeostasis."

We demonstrate superior ratcheting resistance in high-strength austenitic stainless steel with a gradient hierarchy of dislocation cells. The ratcheting rate is two to four orders of magnitude lower than for coarse-grained counterparts. Its resistance results from sustained microstructural refinement through deformation-induced coherent martensitic transformations to hexagonal close-packed nanolayers within stable dislocation cells.

However, bacterial metabolism has left signatures in the geochemical record, most conspicuously the Great Oxidation Event (GOE). We combine machine learning and phylogenetic reconciliation to infer ancestral bacterial transitions to aerobic lifestyles, linking them to the GOE to calibrate the bacterial time tree. Extant bacterial phyla trace their diversity to the Archaean and Proterozoic, and bacterial families prior to the Phanerozoic. We infer that most bacterial phyla were ancestrally anaerobic and adopted aerobic lifestyles after the GOE. However, in the cyanobacterial ancestor, aerobic metabolism likely predated the GOE, which may have facilitated the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis."

Transient thalamofrontal neural synchrony and cross-frequency coupling were both driven by the θ phase of the intralaminar and medial nuclei during conscious perception.

However, the fundamental mechanisms underlying these remarkable abilities remain unclear due to the lack of high-resolution determination of DNA structures on SWCNTs. Here, we combine atomic force microscopy and single-particle cryo–electron microscopy to determine DNA structures on five different types of single-chirality SWCNTs, achieving unprecedented subnanometer resolution. This resolution enables the direct observation of left-handed helical DNA structures with pitches ranging from 1.59 to 2.20 nm, depending on the DNA sequence and nanotube chirality. These findings provide structural insights into the mechanisms by which DNA differentiates the chirality of SWCNTs, and governs the sensitivity, dynamic response range, and analyte differentiability of SWCNT sensors.

Genome sequencing data of 244 individuals uncovered relatively low overall genomic diversity/heterozygosity and long runs of homozygosity, with captive populations exhibiting higher heterozygosity and smaller inbreeding coefficients compared to wild individuals. The decreased level of inbreeding in the captive population demonstrates the contribution of the large captive breeding population. The estimated recent effective population size was around a few dozen. To combat challenges of inbreeding depression and reduced adaptability, we used genome-wide SNP-based kinship analysis on captive populations to enable a genome-informed breeding program that minimizes inbreeding. Long-term field monitoring revealed that the Chinese government greatly advanced the conservation ofA. sinensisthrough conservation measures and reintroduction programs.

Here, we present a versatile denial-of-spread (DoS) strategy to target and eliminate specific conjugative plasmids. Our strategy exploits retrotransfer, whereby an engineered DoS plasmid is introduced into host cells containing a target plasmid. Acting as a predatory gene drive, DoS propagates itself at the expense of the target plasmid, through competition or active elimination. Once the target plasmid is eradicated, DoS is removed via induced plasmid suicide, resulting in a community containing neither plasmid.

10.1126/sciadv.ado5000,False,Science Advances,这篇论文主要研究的是通过调节催化剂载体之间的相互作用来控制电化学二氧化碳还原反应的路径。论文通过改变碳载体的掺杂原子种类，进而改变载体的电负性，发现高电负性的掺杂会降低铜纳米颗粒的电子密度，从而提高多碳产物（C2+）的选择性。最终，论文构建了一种铜和氟掺杂碳复合催化剂，实现了较高的C2+法拉第效率。虽然论文提到了烟道气，但其重点在于催化剂的设计和反应机理的研究，与大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，没有直接的关联。,"['electrochemical CO2 reduction', 'CO2', 'catalyst', 'carbon support', 'electronegativity', 'C2+ products', 'flue gas']",Meng Wang;Yuke Li;Jinfeng Jia;Tanmay Ghosh;Ping Luo;Yu-Jhih Shen;Sibo Wang;Jiguang Zhang;Shibo Xi;Ziyu Mi;Mingsheng Zhang;Wan Ru Leow;Bernt Johannessen;Zainul Aabdin;Sung-Fu Hung;Jia Zhang;Yanwei Lum,Tuning catalyst-support interactions enable steering of electrochemical CO2 reduction pathways,"Tuning of catalyst-support interactions potentially offers a powerful means to control activity. However, rational design of the catalyst support is challenged by a lack of clear property-activity relationships. Here, we uncover how the electronegativity of a support influences reaction pathways in electrochemical CO2reduction. This was achieved by creating a model system consisting of Cu nanoparticles hosted on a series of carbon supports, each with a different heteroatom dopant of varying electronegativity. Notably, we discovered that dopants with high electronegativity reduce the electron density on Cu and induce a selectivity shift toward multicarbon (C2+) products. With this design principle, we built a composite Cu and F-doped carbon catalyst that achieves a C2+Faradaic efficiency of 82.5% at 400 mA cm−2, with stable performance for 44 hours. Using simulated flue gas, the catalyst attains a C2+FE of 27.3%, which is a factor of 5.3 times higher than a reference Cu catalyst."

Valero-Cuevas,Curriculum is more influential than haptic feedback when learning object manipulation,"Dexterous manipulation remains an aspirational goal for autonomous robotic systems, particularly when learning to lift and rotate objects against gravity with intermittent finger contacts. We use model-free reinforcement learning to compare the effect of curriculum (i.e., combinations of lift and rotation tasks) and haptic information (i.e., no-tactile versus 3D-force) on learning with a simulated three-finger robotic hand. In addition, a novel curriculum-based learning rate scheduler accelerates convergence. We demonstrate that the choice of curriculum biases the progression of learning for dexterous manipulation across objects with different weights, sizes, and shapes—underscoring the robustness of our learning approach. Unexpectedly, learning is achieved even in the absence of haptic information. This challenges conventional thinking about task “complexity” and the necessity of haptic information for dexterous manipulation for this task. This work invites the analogy of curriculum learning as a malleable developmental process from a pluripotent state driven by the nature of the learning experience."
