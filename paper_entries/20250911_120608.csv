Karydis,Aerosol composition trends during 2000–2020: in-depth insights from model predictions and multiple worldwide near-surface observation datasets,"This study examines global changes in air pollution from 2000 to 2020, focusing on fine aerosols that impact climate and health. Using models and global data, it finds that organic aerosols dominate in many regions, especially with wildfires or natural emissions. Pollution from sulfate and nitrate has decreased in Europe and North America due to regulations, while trends in Asia are more complex. The findings improve understanding and support policies for cleaner air and healthier environments. 
 Atmospheric aerosols significantly impact Earth's climate and air quality. In addition to their number and mass concentrations, chemical composition influences their environmental effects. This study examines global trends in aerosol composition from 2000 to 2020, using the EMAC atmospheric chemistry–climate model and a variety of observational datasets. These include PM2.5 surface data from regional networks and 744 PM1 datasets from 169 aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) field campaigns worldwide. Organic aerosol (OA) is the dominant fine aerosol component across all continents, particularly in areas with significant biomass burning and biogenic volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions. EMAC reproduces the prevalence of secondary OA but underestimates OA aging, revealing uncertainties in distinguishing fresh versus aged secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Although sulfate remains a major component in filter-based observations, both AMS measurements and model simulations reveal that nitrate has emerged as the dominant aerosol species in Europe and Eastern Asia over the past decade, except in summer. Mineral dust also contributes significantly to specific regions, as highlighted by EMAC. The study identifies substantial declines in sulfate, nitrate, and ammonium in Europe and North America, attributed to emission controls, though EMAC underestimates these reductions, especially sulfate, due to discrepancies in early 2000s levels. In Eastern Asia, sulfate reductions due to SO2 controls are partially captured. OA trends differ between methodologies, with filter data showing slight decreases, while AMS and model results suggest slight increases in PM1 OA across Europe, North America, and Eastern Asia. These findings underscore the need for integrating advanced models and diverse datasets to better understand aerosol trends and guide environmental policy."

The results highlight large variability in the aerosol concentration, size, and water vapor affinity depending on in situ conditions and air mass transport over the ocean. Marine aerosol chemical composition is highly variable over this region and should be considered to better study the impacts of aerosols on regional weather and climate. 
 This study presents observations of marine aerosols made during six ship-based campaigns in the southwestern Indian Ocean in 2021 and 2023. A set of aerosol measurement instruments is used to study the spatial and temporal variability in the number and size distribution of marine aerosols, the concentration of cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and the hygroscopic properties of aerosols (kappa–Köhler parameter, κ). It has been shown that the number of submicron aerosols measured varies much more significantly (ranging from 100 to over 3000 cm−3) than the number of CCN (60 to 500 cm−3 at 0.4 % supersaturation). As a result, the κ values obtained show considerable variability, ranging from 0.05 to 0.7. Four distinct scenarios are examined to elucidate some of these variations: (1) the predominance of pristine air masses in the eastern regions of the subtropical Indian Ocean, with highly variable κ values sensitive to the low aerosol concentration measured in this area; (2) the predominance of polluted air masses in the Mozambique Channel, with weakly hydrophilic aerosols; (3) a precipitation and storm event in the southern Indian Ocean, with highly variable κ values; and (4) a new particle formation event in the open ocean, with an increase in κ values as the newly formed particles grow to Aitken mode particles.The size distribution of the sampled marine aerosols was analyzed according to the origin of the air masses. In general, a shift of the Aitken and accumulation modes toward larger aerosol sizes was observed for continental and subtropical air masses in the Indian Ocean due to aging. Conversely, the modes shifted toward smaller sizes for air masses in the southern Indian Ocean due to higher primary marine emissions. Aerosols are more hydrophobic for continental air masses (κ ∼ 0.1), more hydrophilic and variable over the subtropical Indian Ocean (κ ranging from 0.2 to 0.6), and intermediate (κ ∼ 0.2) over the southern Indian Ocean. The κ of the subtropical Indian Ocean increases with wind intensity, while it remains stable in the southern Indian Ocean. This effect is attributed to the high proportion of primary organic matter, which is due to the important concentration of nanophytoplankton in the southern Indian Ocean. It has been shown that primary organic aerosols act as surfactants, thus counterbalancing the highly hydrophilic properties of NaCl."
10.5194/acp-25-10215-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文分析了加拿大北极地区大气气溶胶中碳酸盐的含量和稳定同位素组成。虽然没有直接涉及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它关注大气成分的分析，特别是气溶胶的组成。研究结果对于理解北极地区的气候变化和碳循环至关重要，而这些信息可以被用于改进大气模型和验证遥感数据。例如，通过地面测量来验证卫星观测的气溶胶光学厚度，或者利用研究中碳酸盐的含量信息来改进气溶胶类型的识别算法。,"['atmospheric aerosols', 'carbonate carbon', 'stable isotopes', 'air quality monitoring (indirectly)', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Petr Vodička;Kimitaka Kawamura;Bhagawati Kunwar;Lin Huang;Dhananjay Kumar;Md. Mozammel Haque;Ambarish Pokhrel;Sangeeta Sharma;Leonard Barrie,Carbonate content and stable isotopic composition of atmospheric aerosol carbon in the Canadian High Arctic,"Carbonate carbon (CC) is not negligible in Arctic total suspended particles (TSPs). If not considered, CC biases the contribution of elemental and organic carbon. CC content in TSPs was strongly reflected in the δ13C values of total carbon (TC). The carbon contribution from CaCO3 supports the strong dependence of CC and δ13C on Ca. Finally, two hypothetical CC sources were identified based on the analysis of air mass back trajectories: dust resuspension and marine microorganisms. 
 The carbon cycle in the Arctic atmosphere is important in understanding abrupt climate changes occurring in this region; 2 years of measurements (summer 2016 to spring 2018) of carbonaceous aerosols at the High Arctic station Alert, Canada, showed that, in addition to organic carbon (OC) and elemental carbon (EC), carbonate carbon (CC) was episodically but not negligibly present. The relative abundances of CC in total carbon (TC) ranged from 0 % to 65 %, with an average of approximately 11 % over the entire period. Also, there was a strong correlation of CC with aerosol Ca2+, which is associated mostly with soil dust and, to a lesser extent, sea salt aerosol. Based on this and the analysis of air mass back trajectories (AMBTs), we infer two possible sources of CC in the Arctic total suspended particles (TSPs). The major one is the erosion and resuspension of limestone sediments, particularly in the semi-desert areas of the northern Canadian Arctic. Another potential minor source of CC is marine aerosol, including calcified marine phytoplankton shells (coccoliths) introduced into the atmosphere via sea-to-air emission.The CC content significantly influenced the stable carbon isotopic composition (δ13C) of TC. The higher the CC content, the higher the δ13C values, which is consistent with the strong 13C enrichment in carbonates. Therefore, carbonates in Arctic TSPs must be taken into account not only in isotopic studies using δ13C analyses but also when assessing the impact of carbonaceous aerosols on the Arctic climate."

To address this issue, we incorporated 177 halogen reactions, together with anthropogenic and natural halogen emissions into the CTMs. Our findings reveal that incorporation of these halogen processes significantly improves model performances compared to observations. In addition, we emphasize the influence of halogen radicals on air quality. 
 Halogen radicals (Cl, Br, and I) significantly influence atmospheric oxidation capacity, affecting both O3 formation and destruction. However, understanding of halogen chemistry remains limited. To better investigate comprehensive atmospheric halogen chemistry, we incorporated halogen processes into the Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model: (i) emissions of Cl2, HCl, Br2, and HBr from anthropogenic sources and Br2, I2, HOI, and halocarbons from natural sources and (ii) 177 multi-phase halogen reactions. Model performance was evaluated against observed ClNO2 levels and by comparison with reported ranges of BrO and IO levels. The updated model showed significant improvements in simulating ClNO2 mixing ratios, with the index of agreement (IOA) increasing from 0.41 to 0.66 and mean bias (MB) decreasing from −159.36 to −25.07 ppt at supersites. Furthermore, simulated BrO and IO levels fell within the ranges reported in previous studies. We found that these improvements were driven by four key reactions: (i) ClO self-reaction, (ii) heterogeneous HOBr chemistry, (iii) NO2 uptake, and (iv) revised N2O5 parameterization. Based on our modeling system, we found that the presence of halogen radicals led to changes in the net Ox production rate (P(Ox)), which increased from 3.08 to 3.33 ppb h−1 on land and decreased from 0.21 to 0.07 ppb h−1 over ocean. It was noted that levels of OH, HCHO, and NOx also increased by ∼0.007 ppt (5.5 %), ∼0.03 ppb (1.6 %), and ∼0.29 ppb (2.9 %), respectively, while levels of HO2 and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) decreased by ∼0.45 ppt (5.3 %) and ∼0.71 ppb (5.9 %). These results highlight the importance of accurately representing halogen processes in regional air quality models."

We employ a multi-phase microphysics scheme that distinguishes between ice from different nucleation processes. Ice crystals in the cirrus outflow mostly stem from in situ formation. Hence, they were formed directly from the vapor phase. Sedimentational redistribution modulates cirrus properties and leads to disagreement between cirrus origin classifications based on thermodynamic history and nucleation processes. 
 Formation pathways of cirrus clouds are thought to differ in their dominant ice nucleation mechanism and thermodynamic regime: liquid-origin cirrus form at water saturation, and ice crystals form by freezing of liquid water drops, while in situ cirrus form below water saturation at low temperatures (T < 235 K), and ice crystals form without an intermediate, stable liquid phase.Warm conveyor belts (WCBs) can transport liquid droplets and vapor from the boundary layer into the upper troposphere, where cirrus is formed in the outflow. The dominant ice formation pathway remains uncertain. We employ a two-moment multi-class cloud microphysics scheme that distinguishes between five ice classes. Each ice class represents ice formed by a unique formation mechanism. Thus, the formation signature is available even a long time after the formation process occurred.Our analysis for a WCB case study shows that cirrus in the outflow consists predominantly of ice formed by processes only active below water saturation. From a nucleation perspective, this suggests in-situ-origin cirrus. However, Lagrangian trajectories show that the cirrus is derived from mixed-phase clouds. Hence, from a thermodynamic perspective, the cirrus is from a liquid origin. We found that sedimentation is a key process for the vertical redistribution of ice formed by different pathways. The main WCB ascent region was embedded in a slowly ascending air mass that resulted in in situ ice formation above the WCB. This in-situ-formed ice sedimented into mixed-phase clouds of the WCB below, which also altered the macrophysical properties of the outflow cirrus."

Y. Cheung;Kun Li;André S. H. Prévôt;Imad El Haddad;David M. Bell,Ozonolysis of primary biomass burning organic aerosol particles: insights into reactivity and phase state,"Authentic aerosols emitted from residential wood stoves and open burning processes are only slightly oxidized by ozone in the atmosphere. Under dry conditions, the reaction does not proceed to completion, while under high humidity conditions, the reactivity proceeds further. These results indicate that the reactivity with ozone is likely impacted by aerosol phase state (e.g., aerosol viscosity). 
 Biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) particles are a major contributor to atmospheric particulate matter, with various effects on climate and public health. Quantifying these effects is limited by our understanding of the BBOA particles' evolving chemical composition during atmospheric aging, driven by their exposure to atmospheric oxidants. This study explores the role of ozone (O3) as an atmospheric oxidant in processing primary BBOA particles. We exposed particulate emissions from beech, spruce, and pine wood fires to O3 in an oxidative flow reactor, monitoring their chemical evolution using high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometry (HR-ToF-AMS) and extractive electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (EESI-ToF-MS). We found that the oxidative state of the particles increased with O3 exposure, as shown by the consistent, albeit minor, rise in O/C ratios. Analysis of the EESI-ToF-MS data revealed specific molecular groups containing 18 and 20 carbon atoms, likely mainly abietic, linoleic, and oleic acids, as highly reactive towards O3 and driving the increase in oxidative state. At higher relative humidity, increased oxidation and loss of reactive species indicate that enhanced O3 diffusion into particles allows the ozonolysis to progress further, highlighting humidity's role in overcoming diffusion barriers that limit ozonolysis in dry conditions. This study provides qualitative insights into the oxidative processing of primary BBOA particles in different phase states, presenting O3 as a selective oxidant. Further research could focus on quantifying the progression of the ozonolysis, in particular, the change in diffusion rates depending on relative humidity conditions or particle sizes."

This study explores how pollutants from urban sources, as m-xylene and naphthalene, form new particles in the atmosphere under different conditions. Using advanced techniques, we show how temperature and nitrogen oxides affect the formation and behavior of these particles. Our findings will improve our understanding of secondary organic particle and air quality models. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) react with atmospheric oxidants, resulting in oxygenated products of lower volatility known as semi-volatile and intermediate-volatility organic compounds (S/IVOCs), which form secondary organic aerosols (SOAs). Those compounds can partition between the gas and particle phases, a critical process that is influenced by several environmental parameters yet is poorly constrained. This study aims to evaluate the effect of temperature and the VOC/NOx ratio on SOA formation and the partitioning of individual SOA products from m-xylene and naphthalene OH oxidation.  Experiments are carried out in an oxidation flow reactor (OFR), and products are identified and quantified using a proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-ToF-MS) coupled to a CHemical Analysis of aeRosol ONline (CHARON) inlet. Results show that lower temperatures significantly enhance SOA formation, while lower VOC/NOx ratios reduce it. Gas-phase m-xylene major products are C3, C5, and C8 compounds, whereas particle–product distributions exhibit a progressive increase from C2 to C8. In contrast, naphthalene products partition more readily into the condensed phase, with C8–C10 products dominating. Most of the oxidation products from both precursors exhibit a volatility distribution in the SVOC regime, with fewer in the IVOC regime. The decrease in temperature shifts the effective saturation concentration (Ci∗) values towards lower values, although no clear relationship between Ci∗ and the oxidation state is observed. A comparison between observed and estimated volatilities using a model based on the group contribution method (SIMPOL.1) reveals systematic deviations for both light molecules and heavy compounds, suggesting a need for improved predictive models."

Perez-Solano;Jaume Segura-Garcia,Improving raw readings from low-cost ozone sensors using artificial intelligence for air quality monitoring,"The World Health Organization (WHO) warns of ground-level ozone problems in urban areas and recommends increased monitoring. This paper shows that low-cost sensors coupled with artificial intelligence are an excellent alternative. 
 Ground-level ozone (O3) is a highly oxidizing gas with very reactive properties. It is harmful at high levels and is generated by complex photochemical reactions when primary pollutants from the combustion of fossil materials react with sunlight. Thus, its concentration indicates the activity of other air pollutants and plays a crucial role in smart cities.  With the growing interest in high-resolution air quality (AQ) monitoring, low-cost ozone sensors present an interesting alternative, although they lack accuracy and suffer from cross-sensitivity issues. In this context, artificial intelligence techniques, particularly ensemble machine learning (ML) models, can improve the raw readings from these sensors by incorporating additional environmental information to minimize inaccuracies and nonlinearities, as well as by including metadata to account for sensor aging effects and improve the models based on road traffic patterns.  In this paper, based on the low-cost ZPHS01B multisensor module with nine sensors, we analyze, propose, and compare different techniques using four ML models in a low O3 concentration scenario (mean value of 55.72 µg m−3). We carried out a thorough exploratory data analysis process to extract the main features (variables) and performed hyperparameter optimization for the different models. As a result, we reduced the estimation error by approximately 94.05 %. In particular, using the gradient boosting algorithm, we achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4.022 µg m−3 and a mean relative error (MRE) of 7.21 %, outperforming related work while using a module approximately 10 times less expensive. To carry out this work, we generated two datasets in the city of Valencia (Spain), at two different locations with the same characteristics (close to the ring road but separated by 4.1 km), of 165 and 239 d."

In Chiang Mai, Thailand, we developed a new light detection and ranging (lidar)-based method to better distinguish key atmospheric layers by incorporating temperature-based adjustments. This improves accuracy, especially at night, compared to traditional techniques. Our findings help refine air quality models and provide better data for tackling pollution in Southeast Asia. 
 Accurate determination of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height, mixing-layer height (MLH), and aerosol layer top (ALT) is essential for air quality and climate studies, particularly in regions with complex aerosol dynamics such as Chiang Mai, northern Thailand. This study introduces a novel lidar-based retrieval method that integrates a temperature-dependent, dynamic maximum analysis altitude (MAA) into the traditional Haar wavelet covariance transform (WCT) framework. Unlike conventional fixed-altitude WCT approaches, which often misclassify the ALT as the PBL – especially under stable nighttime or transitional conditions – this dynamic approach adapts the vertical search range for PBL detection in real time using observed surface temperature variations. The method is physically grounded in boundary layer thermodynamics, allowing for more accurate identification of the true PBL top while reducing contamination from residual aerosol layers and low clouds. Validation against radiosonde observations and comparison with previously validated WRF-Chem simulations demonstrate strong agreement, with the lidar-derived PBL heights capturing diurnal variations more reliably than traditional methods. The findings also reveal model biases during high-aerosol events, highlighting the need for improved aerosol–meteorology coupling in mesoscale models. This integrated retrieval framework represents a significant advancement in lidar-based boundary layer detection and offers a robust tool for enhancing pollutant dispersion analysis, air quality forecasting, and climate modeling across aerosol-rich regions in Southeast Asia."

Burrows;Hartmut Bösch,Improved detection of global NO2 signals from shipping in Sentinel-5P TROPOMI data,"This study presents our advanced methods to qualitatively detect ship-related nitrogen dioxide (NO2) signals in TROPOMI satellite data. By applying filtering techniques, we identify numerous global shipping routes, including previously undetected ones, as well as emissions from offshore platforms. Additionally, we compare the filtered satellite data with high-pass-filtered CAMS global model data to estimate the differences between observed and modeled NO2 emissions. 
 Shipping is an important source of nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions worldwide, contributing to air pollution and negatively affecting marine environments, ecosystems, and biodiversity. TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) on board the Sentinel-5 Precursor (S5P) has significantly enhanced the ability to detect ship emissions from space due to its low measurement noise levels and high spatial resolution of 5.5×3.5 km2 at nadir. This study uses the TROPOMI tropospheric NO2 slant column density (tSCD) to identify global shipping routes qualitatively. Preprocessing techniques, including iterative high-pass and Fourier filtering, markedly improve the detection of shipping lanes, revealing previously undetectable routes. Our analysis examines the impact of high-pass-filter box sizes, demonstrating that smaller sizes enhance the visibility of narrow shipping features, whereas larger box sizes increase overall NO2 signals. Additionally, we investigate various flagging criteria that affect NO2 signal distribution, highlighting the critical importance of careful selection for accurate emission monitoring. Filtered TROPOMI NO2 tSCDs over oceans show a strong correlation with shipping activities, as confirmed by comparison with the CAMS-GLOB-SHIP (Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service for Global Shipping) inventory, and also reveal unknown shipping routes in regions such as the Bering Sea. Furthermore, TROPOMI effectively captures NO2 emissions from offshore oil and gas platforms, with NO2 hotspots in the TROPOMI data aligning well with locations of offshore installations listed in the OSPAR (Oslo and Paris Commission) and BOEM (Bureau of Ocean Energy Management) inventories. Lastly, the filtered TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric vertical column densities (tVCDs) are compared with the high-pass-filtered NO2 tVCDs from the CAMS (Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service) model, which has a coarse spatial resolution of 0.4°. While both datasets effectively identify global shipping lanes, the high-pass-filtered CAMS NO2 tVCDs are significantly higher than the filtered TROPOMI NO2 tVCDs in the North Atlantic and strongly depend on the masking threshold in the high-pass filtering method in the South Atlantic Ocean."

 For balloon-borne detection of aerosols and cloud droplets (diameter 0.4 < Dp < 40 µm), a passive-flow Universal Cloud and Aerosol Sounding System (UCASS) was used, whose sample flow rate is conventionally derived from balloon ascent rates using GPS or pressure measurements. Improvements are achieved by implementing thermal flow sensors (TFSs) 94 mm downstream of the UCASS detection region for continuously measuring true UCASS sample flow velocities. UCASS-mounted TFSs were calibrated during wind tunnel experiments at up to 10 m s−1, and under various angles of attack (AOAs), as these vary during actual balloon ascents. It was found that the TFS calibration is determined with sufficient precision using three calibration points at tunnel flows of ∼ 2, 5, and 8 m s−1, simplifying efficient TFS upgrades of numerous UCASSs. In iso-axial alignment, UCASS flows are accelerated (by ∼ 11.3 %) compared to tunnel flows (at 2–8 m s−1). In-flight comparisons up to 7.5 km in height revealed that UCASS sample flows rarely match the balloon's ascent rate. Laboratory experiments show that equality (vGPS=vTFS) is achieved only at AOA ≠ 0°, potentially affecting the UCASS internal flow pattern and particle transmission efficiency in flight. To minimise errors in calculated UCASS-based particle number concentrations, real-time measurements of the true UCASS flow velocity are recommended."

The dataset is based on quality-controlled station data, and various interpolation techniques were evaluated for generating the daily grids. CLIMADAT-GRid serves as a valuable resource for research and information in climate studies as well as in other areas such as hydrology, agriculture, energy, and health. 
 We introduce the development of CLIMADAT-GRid, the first publicly available daily air temperature and precipitation gridded climate dataset for Greece at a high resolution of 1 km × 1 km, covering the period 1981–2019. The dataset is derived from quality-controlled and homogenized daily measurements from an extensive network of meteorological stations: 122 for temperature and 312 for precipitation. Several approaches are evaluated for generating daily gridded datasets, including fixed random Kriging, generalized additive models, k-nearest neighbors, and support vector machines. Based on the evaluation analysis against withheld observational data, fixed random Kriging is selected as the method for the CLIMADAT-GRid construction. To address the lack of a dense temperature observational network, high-resolution simulations from the Weather Research and Forecasting  (WRF) model are blended with observational data to produce the gridded temperature datasets. CLIMADAT-GRid is benchmarked against the CHELSA-W5E5, a global climate product with a similar resolution, for the overlapping period 1981–2016. While both datasets show comparable results for temperature, CLIMADAT-GRid demonstrates superior spatial performance and closer agreement with observational data for both the mean and the extreme values. Regarding precipitation, CLIMADAT-GRid consistency indicates higher values than CHELSA-W5E5, especially during the rainy season, but exhibits better agreement with observations. In terms of the number of wet days, both datasets overestimate spatial means relative to observations, with CLIMADAT-GRid showing a more pronounced orographic pattern than CHELSA-W5E5. Both datasets show similar results for the number of days with precipitation amounts equal to or higher than 10 mm, with CLIMADAT-GRid indicating better overall agreement with the observations.

It was collected at sea in the Bay of Biscay (France) and comprises audio recordings of echolocation clicks, whistles, and other social sounds as well as visual observations of dolphin behaviour. This dataset could be used to improve the comprehension of dolphin communication by scientists, which could assist in the development of conservation strategies, particularly with regard to by-catches. 
 Dolphins are highly vocal cetaceans with a complex acoustic repertoire. These marine mammals rely heavily on sound for critical activities: echolocation clicks for navigation and prey detection, whistles for social communication, and pulsed sounds for less well-documented purposes. Understanding their acoustic behaviour is essential for insights into their ecology, social structure, and responses to anthropogenic noise. However, to date, there has been a lack of open-access datasets of acoustic recordings of wild free-ranging short-beaked common dolphins (Delphinus delphis) coupled with observational data. Here, we present a new dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14637674, Lehnhoff, 2025a) of high-resolution acoustic recordings of (D. delphis) observed in various behavioural states, including foraging, travelling, socializing, milling, and attraction to the boat. The dataset was collected in the northern Bay of Biscay, France, in the summers of 2020 to 2022 during surveys conducted as part of the DOLPHINFREE project. Audio recordings were made during opportunistic encounters using two devices: a single high-quality hydrophone (sampling rate 512 kHz and bit depth 32 bits) and a compact array of four hydrophones (256 to 512 kHz and 16 to 24 bits) for localization purposes. The dataset comprises over 400 min of unedited audio recordings of D. delphis accompanied by visual observations. In total, we identified about 68 000 echolocation clicks, 4600 whistle contours, and more than 350 pulsed sounds. This comprehensive resource is invaluable for detailed studies of the acoustic repertoire of (D. delphis), coupled with behavioural studies or analyses of the directionality of their acoustic emissions."

The GeoEcoKorea online platform, developed alongside this dataset, aims to enhance the accessibility of Korean paleodata and promote FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data sharing among researchers. 
 Ecological insights beyond human-observable timescales are derived from records preserved in geological sediments worldwide. Nonetheless, significant regional data gaps persist in global syntheses of these records as open data practices are still emerging. Korean Quaternary paleoecological data remain underrepresented in global research efforts, despite a growing body of site-level research. Here, we organize an inventory of 328 paleoecological study sites (72 paleo-sites with paleoproxy-based records from sediments and 256 surface sites with modern pollen samples) in South Korea, compiled from 66 research articles published from 2003 to 2023. We have built three datasets (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.28236596.v2, Kim and Byun, 2025) related to this inventory: (1) Publication Metadata, which provide citation details of the 66 articles; (2) the Site Inventory, which contains metadata about geospatial coordinates, depositional environments, chronological ranges, age coverage, and proxies; and (3) Geochronology Data, which include chronological details (dating methods, ages, and depth points) for each site. The sites span  33.2508 to 33.4808° N and 126.1486 to 129.2132° E, with elevations from −156 to 1867.5 m. Sediment samples were collected by coring or trenching from six depositional environments: open coastal zone, estuary, lagoon, river, volcanic cone, and other. A total of 812 chronological controls were analyzed, and most are based on radiocarbon dating. Pollen, diatoms, and grain size have been widely applied, with multi-proxy approaches increasingly common in recent studies. To enhance accessibility, we have developed GeoEcoKorea (https://www.geoecokorea.org, last access: 28 August 2025), an open-access platform featuring interactive maps where each site marker displays site-level metadata and links to bibliographic information and uncalibrated geochronological datasets, when available.

 Ocean fronts are critical interfaces between different water masses, profoundly influencing atmosphere–ocean interactions, weather systems, marine ecosystems, and climate regulation. Accurate and long-term observations of ocean fronts are essential for advancing studies in meteorology, oceanography, and climate science. However, no publicly available, long-term ocean front dataset currently exists, and existing detection methods often rely on time-consuming manual labeling or traditional algorithms with limited accuracy in complex frontal regions. In this study, we release the first publicly available 30-year ocean front dataset (1993–2023) for the Northwest Pacific, generated by applying a deep learning framework (Mask R-CNN) to daily sea surface temperature (SST) fields, with manually annotated samples for model training. The dataset provides pixel-level frontal boundaries along with associated attributes, including position, intensity, and width, stored in NetCDF-4 format at 1/12° spatial and daily temporal resolution. Accuracy evaluation shows a mean average precision (mAP) exceeding 0.90, with smaller errors in front width and intensity compared with traditional gradient-based methods, while capturing more small-scale features. The dataset offers three main contributions: (1) Filling the critical gap of a standardized, long-term ocean front product; (2) Serving as a ready-to-use training resource for deep learning models, greatly reducing the need for manual labeling; and (3) Providing benchmark samples for validation and intercomparison of other ocean front detection products.

Users often need statistics covering periods longer than the stream duration, requiring algorithms that do not store full time series. One-pass methods address this need while avoiding full data archiving, offering memory-efficient, accurate results for high-performance computing (HPC) workflows and downstream applications like bias adjustment. 
 Global climate models (GCMs) are being increasingly run at finer resolutions to better capture small-scale dynamics and reduce uncertainties associated with parameterizations. Despite advances in high-performance computing (HPC), the resulting terabyte- to petabyte-scale data volumes now being produced from GCMs are overwhelming traditional long-term storage. To address this, some climate modelling projects are adopting a method known as data streaming, where model output is transmitted directly to downstream data consumers (any user of climate model data, e.g. an impact model) during model runtime, eliminating the need to archive complete datasets. This paper introduces the One_Pass Python package (v0.8.0), which enables users to compute statistics on streamed GCM output via one-pass algorithms – computational techniques that sequentially process data in a single pass without requiring access to the full time series. Crucially, packaging these algorithms independently, rather than relying on standardized statistics from GCMs, provides flexibility for a diverse range of downstream data consumers and allows for integration into various HPC workflows.  We present these algorithms for four different statistics: mean, standard deviation, percentiles and histograms. Each statistic is presented in the context of a use case, showing its application to a relevant variable. For statistics that can be represented by a single floating point value (i.e. mean, standard deviation, variance), the results are identical to “conventional” approaches within numerical precision limits, while the memory savings scale linearly with the period of time covered by the statistic. For statistics that require a distribution (percentiles and histograms), we make use of the t-digest, an algorithm that ingests streamed data and reduces them to a set of key clusters representing the distribution. Using this algorithm, we achieve excellent accuracy for variables with near-normal distributions (e.g. wind speed) and acceptable accuracy for skewed distributions such as precipitation. We also provide guidance on the best compression factor (the memory vs. accuracy trade-off) to use for each variable. We conclude by exploring the concept of convergence in streamed statistics, an essential factor for downstream applications such as bias-adjusting streamed data."

The abundance in the sediments of these lakes ranged from 0.3 to 66.7 items g–1. Microfibers and fiber-shaped microplastics accounted for 45% and 32% of the abundance. The risk levels assessed by IMRI indicated that microplastics and microfibers in the sediments of 33.3%, 28.4%, 27.5%, and 9.8% of the lakes had moderate, extremely high, high, and low risk, respectively, which was more consistent with the real situation of Chinese lakes compared with PLI, PHI, and RI and independent of background abundance. Secondary and tertiary industry-related activities and aquaculture activities contributed 64% and 36% to the abundance, posing extremely high risk and high risk, respectively. Artificial cellulosic microfibers mainly derived from aquaculture activities contributed 61% to the risk due to the residual toxic chemical additives.

Microbial C fixation and degradation, closely implicated in nitrogen (N) transformation and plant–soil–microbe interactions, significantly regulate soil C accumulation. However, how shifts in microbial functional potential impact soil C sequestration during vegetation succession remains unclear. Here, we synchronized microbial C and N cycling genes in the rhizosphere and bulk soils across an ∼130-year chronosequence at the Hailuogou Glacier in the eastern Tibetan Plateau. Carbon fixation dominated microbial C cycling throughout the chronosequence, contributing to 74% of C-cycling gene abundances and increasing 3–6 times at the intermediate stage relative to the initial stage. Microbes favored energy-efficient and carbonate utilization pathways, such as the Wood–Ljungdahl and 3-hydroxypropionate cycles, to support high C-fixation potential. Ammonification, primarily driven by the ureC gene (>50% of N-cycling gene abundances), dictated N supply for plants and microbes. This enhanced soil N availability likely stimulated microbial biomass, diversity, and specific taxa, thereby optimizing C use efficiency. However, the ammonification-driven C fixation was contingent upon specific plant species at different succession stages. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of microbial N mineralization in shaping microbial communities and driving soil C accumulation in deglaciated landscapes."

However, S-ZVI is susceptible to corrosion in aquifers with elevated dissolved oxygen (DO) levels. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that a trade-off between the passivation and oxidative corrosion of aged S-ZVI can be achieved in the presence of silicate to promote its dechlorination performance on trichloroethylene. The electron transfer from aged S-ZVI to target contaminants and DO can be promoted to generate reactive oxygen species (ROS), simultaneously enhancing reductive and oxidative dechlorination. Silicate interactions contribute up to an 18.9% decrease in the electron resistance, a 23.3% increase in oxidative dechlorination, a 61.1% increase in the dechlorination rate constant, and an 85.7% increase in the degradation capacity of aged S-ZVI as compared to the control. Furthermore, the decrease in the reductive sulfur species over an extended aging time promotes the depolymerization of silica polymers into monomer silicate on S-ZVI, which is conducive to mitigating silicate passivation and promoting the release of dissolved silicate in aged S-ZVI systems. This process, in turn, facilitates ferrous iron dissolution and ROS production, thereby enhancing the redox reactivity of aged S-ZVI.

The proposed system directs HTL-produced biocrude to oil refineries and recovers regionally tailored nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers. In an independent facility analysis, 576 WRRFs in the contiguous U.S. (CONUS) could deploy financially viable HTL-based wastewater solids management, simultaneously achieving cost savings of 4.81M [4.04M to 5.51M] $·day–1 and a GHG reduction of 1,300 [351 to 2,140] tonne CO2 eq·day–1 while offsetting ∼ 1 to 2% of synthetic fertilizers. Key sustainability drivers include the biochemical composition of solids and internal rate of return (IRR), though IRR becomes less impactful at larger WRRFs.

PLA activated the enzymatic pathway for lignin-derived DOM decomposition and downregulated genes involved in bacterial anabolism, such as those related to protein, amino sugar, and peptidoglycan biosynthesis. In contrast, PHA increased the content of microbially derived DOM compounds such as proteins and amino sugars by 2.1-fold relative to the control with peptide chain elongation. PHA resulted in the degradation of lignin-derived DOM into pyruvate and acetyl-CoA, accelerated bacterial ATP synthesis, the de novo biosynthesis of proteins and peptidoglycan, and cell renewal and death, thereby increasing PHA- and soil organic matter-derived microbial necromass carbon. Our study provides new insights into the impact of biodegradable MPs on soil DOM transformation and underscores the importance of the microbial physiological processes involved."

This phenomenon has been increasingly discussed in the environmental sciences as the impacts of regulatory capture on human and ecosystem health have become increasingly apparent. Regulatory capture is just one tactic employed by vested interests in the strategy of delaying, weakening, or abolishing policies designed to protect the public interest. Here, we define capture strategies as ‘the act of influencing individuals, organizations, or governments to prioritize corporate interests over those of human and ecosystem health’. Similar to the evolution of terms like whitewashing and greenwashing into the broader concept of colorwashing, this new definition expands the scope of capture to include a wide range of targets, such as individuals, educational institutions, nongovernmental organizations, media, and local, national, and intergovernmental organizations. By broadening the definition, we anticipate that researchers, policymakers, and civil society will find it easier to identify and prevent such nefarious activities. This paper illustrates how ‘capture strategies’ have played, and (unless kept in check) will continue to play, an instrumental role in obstructing efforts to address the triple planetary crises of climate change, biodiversity loss, and chemical pollution."

This study evaluated the use of silicone ankle bands to assess OPE exposure in infants under 18 months of age. Infants (n = 21) wore silicone ankle bands for three consecutive days, and spot urine samples were collected using either pediatric urine collection bags or toddler training toilets. Ankle bands were analyzed for 20 OPEs; seven were detected in >70% of samples. TDCIPP and TPHP were the most abundant compounds on bands (medians = 57.5 and 53.0 ng/g, respectively). All targeted urinary metabolites were detected in most samples, with BDCIPP being the most abundant biomarker (median = 3.7 ng/mL SG-corrected), 2.5 times higher than DPHP. Significant positive correlations were observed between urinary metabolites and parent compounds on the ankle bands (rs = 0.40–0.73, p < 0.05), suggesting that silicone samplers reliably capture exposure trends. These findings support ankle bands as a practical, noninvasive tool for assessing OPE exposures in infants, offering an alternative to urine-based biomonitoring."

However, knowledge about its adverse health effects is limited, particularly regarding its oxidative properties relative to other PM types. In 2023, Canada experienced its worst recorded WF season, with smoke strongly impacting air quality across North America. Here we collected ambient PM samples from two urban (Toronto and Champaign) and one rural (East Trout Lake) sites in North America in 2023 and assessed their oxidative potential (OP; mass-normalized) and burden (OB; volume-normalized) using the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. Our results indicate that OP of urban WF PM was not greater than non-WF PM. At the rural site, WF PM showed slightly higher OP than background PM, which may be related to a lesser extent of atmospheric aging of WF PM, or low OP of background PM in rural areas. During WF-influenced periods in Toronto, mass fractions of OP-active metals were significantly lower, but there was no significant difference in OP, indicating the importance of nonmetallic components to OP. Across all sites, OB was greater during WF periods, driven by elevated PM concentrations. Our findings suggest that while the OP of WF PM is similar to urban PM, higher PM concentrations during WF episodes can increase exposure to potentially harmful DTT-active species."

Based on the Chinese Undergraduates Cohort (CUC), we aim to explore the association between summer temperature exposure and blood metabolomics in young adults. Plasma samples were tested with an untargeted metabolomic analysis. Meteorological data was collected from China Meteorological Data Sharing Service System. The three consecutive months with the highest monthly average temperatures of the whole year were defined as summer. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the multiple linear regression model were used to assess the effects of summer mean temperature exposure on blood metabolomics, followed by stratified analysis by sex. A total of 1,930 participants, with a mean age of 18.18 ± 0.65 years, were included in this study. The summer mean temperature was 26.03 ± 1.70 °C. Metabolomic analysis identified 54 altered metabolites related to summer mean temperature, of which 7 altered metabolites were enriched in 4 significant metabolic pathways (p < 0.05), which were mainly involved in amino acid and peptide compound metabolism. Stratified analysis results showed that in addition to amino acid metabolism, summer mean temperature exposure also disrupted vitamin metabolism in females. Summer mean temperature could possibly be associated with altered metabolic pathways such as amino acid metabolism, causing inflammation and oxidative stress damage. Females could be more susceptible to summer temperature in terms of disrupted vitamin metabolism."

We fit the electron measurements with a sum of two anisotropic kappa distributions and provide estimates of the electron density, temperature, anisotropy, and thermodynamic kappa for the cold and hot populations, separately. We find that the electron temperature increases non‐adiabatically with M‐shell and the cold electron temperature anisotropy is most extreme near M = 15.

Further analysis reveals that the transition occurs at larger M‐shells for higher‐energy electrons and at greater distances from the equatorial plane, placing strong constraints on the underlying mechanisms. By developing a model based on Liouville's theorem and the conservation of adiabatic invariants, we show that adiabatic radial transport can reproduce these features, suggesting it as a mechanism driving the observed PAD transition.

The results show that endogenous displacement efficiency is almost always higher than that of exogenous displacement, by up to 63% in the same specimen. Hydrophobic sands provide more nucleation sites and stimulate bubble exsolution in the saturated solution, leading to the highest endogenous displacement efficiency.

By the end of this century, austral mid‐latitude waves are projected to intensify in winter but to shift poleward in summer. Here we find that an asymmetric response of the waves across scales drives their seasonally asymmetric changes. Specifically, a strengthening of large‐scale waves contributes to the future intensification in winter, while a reduced intensity of small‐scale waves leads to the poleward shift of the waves during summer. Our analysis further reveals that seasonal differences in upper‐level warming patterns are responsible for the contrasting future changes in the waves across scales and seasons.

In this study, we use measurements from the Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) to investigate how the microphysical and optical properties of MBL clouds change at the cloud top when precipitation forms. These changes include (a) broadening of particle size distributions when transitioning from cloud droplets to raindrops, as evidenced by a pronounced decrease in the cloud extinction‐to‐backscatter ratios; (b) lower droplet number concentrations, resulting in reduced in‐cloud signal attenuation, smaller backscatter coefficients, lower depolarization ratios, and deeper signal penetration into clouds; and (c) increased cloud inhomogeneity, arising from significant spatial variability in droplet size and number concentrations that yield corresponding variations in lidar backscatter signal intensities. The distinct differences observed in CALIOP measurements of precipitating and non‐precipitating clouds allow for effective discrimination between the two states. Independent detections of precipitating clouds from space‐borne lidar are expected to provide new insights into cloud life cycles and enhance the existing A‐Train data record by filling many of the existing gaps in global‐scale light precipitation detection."

Along with the warming climate system, CH4 emissions from these ecosystems are projected to increase, presenting challenges for accurate CH4 budget accounting and climate mitigation efforts. This study assessed CH4 emissions and controlling factors in wetlands across East, South, and Southeast Asia (EA, SA, and SEA) for 2010–2020, using a regional Earth system model coupled online with a microbial functional‐group‐based CH4 model (RegESM‐Microbe). The results from the RegESM‐Microbe model were evaluated against 11 offline wetland models from the Global Carbon Project and revealed consistent hotspots for wetland CH4 emissions, including the Yangtze River floodplain, the Ganges and Brahmaputra River basins, and the Mekong River basin. The annual total wetland CH4 emissions in Asia estimated (34.69 ± 2.55 Tg CH4 yr−1) by the RegESM‐Microbe model was close to the bottom‐up wetland model ensemble (36.66 ± 1.19 Tg CH4 yr−1). The time series of emissions showed a decreasing trend before 2014. Meanwhile, the weakening of anaerobic CH4 oxidation between 2014 and 2020 contributed to increased CH4 flow in the three transport sub‐processes, driving the enhanced CH4 emissions. Most wetlands in the region exhibited an upward trend in CH4 emission, with precipitation and radiation as the primary driver, followed by rising atmospheric CO2. Our study highlighted the critical role of climate change‐induced wetland CH4 emissions in shaping long‐term greenhouse gas mitigation strategies."

While ER is often modeled as an exponential function of temperature, recent evidence shows that ER exhibits an optimal temperature (Topt). However, the temporal dynamics of Topt under climate warming remain poorly understood. This study analyzed data from 135 long‐term FLUXNET sites, each with at least 5 years of observation. Our results show that Topt of ER increased with rising temperatures across years within a site, indicating thermal acclimation, with a global average acclimation magnitude (Topt change per unit change in maximum temperature) of 0.82. More interestingly, this acclimation magnitude showed a negative correlation with the mean annual temperature across sites which was particularly evident in deciduous broadleaf forests and in cold regions. This negative correlation suggests that ecosystems in colder sites exhibit higher acclimation magnitudes compared to warmer sites, potentially reducing the variation in Topt across globe under future warming. These findings indicate a global homogenization of Topt under warming conditions. Future scenario analysis suggested that neglecting thermal acclimation may lead to inaccurate Topt estimates under climate change. This study underscores the importance of considering variable thermal acclimation responses of Topt for accurate prediction of future ER."

This paper traces generalizable phases in groundwater‐withdrawal regimes in individual aquifer systems and their associated impacts on eco‐ and geosystem services. The concept seeks to address common misunderstandings of fundamental concepts in hydrogeology, which have practical consequences for the management of groundwater systems that sustain these services. The Peak Groundwater concept highlights the critical need to acknowledge the nested character of transient groundwater flow systems and the effects of groundwater withdrawals beyond the aquifer boundary. Importantly, estimations of sustainable groundwater withdrawals need to consider indirect human‐environmental risks of withdrawals, such as surface water depletion and land subsidence. Estimating acceptable steady‐state limits for future groundwater withdrawals presents an “optimization challenge.” Solving this optimization challenge, estimating sustainable withdrawals for balanced groundwater budgets, is rooted in societal priorities and demands high‐quality simulation models and monitoring tools and practices such as 4D monitoring systems that are complementary in type and scale. Recognition and prediction of Peak Groundwater can guide groundwater managers on how to operate within sustainable limits of abstraction. Proactive adaptive groundwater management can prevent Peak Groundwater and associated decline in withdrawal capacities."

 Smoke from extreme wildfires in Canada adversely affected air quality in many regions in 20231,2. Here we use satellite observations, machine learning and a chemical transport model to quantify global and regional PM2.5 (particulate matter less than 2.5 μm in diameter) exposure and human health impacts related to the 2023 Canadian wildfires. We find that the fires increased annual PM2.5 exposure worldwide by 0.17 μg m–3 (95% confidence interval, 0.09–0.26 μg m–3). North America had the largest increase in annual mean exposure (1.08 μg m–3; 0.82–1.34 μg m–3), but there were also increases in Europe (0.41 μg m–3; 0.32–0.50 μg m–3) owing to long-range transport. Annual mean PM2.5 exposure in Canada increased by 3.82 μg m–3 (3.00–4.64 μg m–3). In the USA, the contribution of the Canadian fires to increased PM2.5 was 1.49 μg m–3 (1.22–1.77 μg m–3), four times as large as the contribution from the 2023 wildfires originating in the USA. We find that 354 million (277–421 million) people in North America and Europe were exposed to daily PM2.5 air pollution caused by Canadian wildfires in 2023. We estimate that 5,400 (3,400–7,400) acute deaths in North America and 64,300 (37,800–90,900) chronic deaths in North America and Europe were attributable to PM2.5 exposure to the 2023 Canadian wildfires.

 The Lepidosauria is the most species-rich group of land-dwelling vertebrates. The group includes around 12,000 species of lizards and snakes (Squamata) and one species of Rhynchocephalia, the tuatara Sphenodon punctatus from New Zealand1. Squamates owe their success to their generally small size, but also to their highly mobile skull that enables them to manipulate large prey. These key features of lizard and snake skulls are not seen in Sphenodon, which makes it important to understand the nature of their common ancestor. Lepidosaurs originated in the Triassic 252–201 million years ago, but confusion has arisen because of incomplete fossils, many of which are generalized lepidosauromorphs, neither squamates nor rhynchocephalians2–5. Here we report a reasonably complete skull and skeleton of a definitive rhynchocephalian from the Middle Triassic (Anisian) Helsby Sandstone Formation of Devon, UK that is around 3–7 million years older than the oldest currently known lepidosaur. The new species shows, as predicted, a non-mobile skull but an open lower temporal bar and no large palatine teeth, and it seems to have been a specialized feeder on insects. This specimen helps us understand the initial diversification of Lepidosauria as part of the Triassic Revolution, when modern-style terrestrial ecosystems emerged.

 The human stomach features distinct, regionalized functionalities along the anterior–posterior axis1,2. Historically, studies on stomach patterning have used animal models to identify the underlying principles3–7. Recently, human pluripotent stem (hPS)-cell-based gastric organoids for modelling domain-specific development of the fundic and antral epithelium are emerging8–10. However, recapitulating self-organized fundic–antral patterning in early stomach organogenesis remains challenging, presenting a considerable barrier for advancing knowledge of stomach organogenesis. Here we report human gastroids—a self-organized multilineage gastric organoid derived from hPS cells—to model gastric fundic–antral patterning in vitro. Through multi-germ-layer co-development, we generate gastroids that feature an epithelial chamber with bipolar fundic–antral patterning, annexed with neural populations near the fundic domain while enveloped by mesenchymal cells, therefore showing molecular, cellular, structural and anatomical similarity to stomach development in vivo. Non-endodermal cells, especially neural populations, function as a critical signalling centre to instruct fundic–antral patterning in gastroids through WNT-mediated crosstalk. Single-cell transcriptomic profiling and genetic silencing further reveal NR2F2 as a key mediator of fundic–antral patterning in gastroid development. This study reveals a principle for instructing gastric patterning and provides a higher-fidelity platform for advancing knowledge of stomach organogenesis and gastric organoid development.

 Globular clusters (GCs) are among the oldest and densest stellar systems in the Universe, yet how they form remains a mystery1. Here we present a suite of cosmological simulations in which both dark-matter-free GCs and dark-matter-rich dwarf galaxies naturally emerge in the Standard Cosmology. We show that these objects inhabit distinct locations in the size–luminosity plane and that they have similar ages, age spread, metallicity and metallicity spread to globulars and dwarfs in the nearby Universe. About half of our simulated globulars form by means of regular star formation near the centres of their host dwarf, with the rest forming further out, triggered by mergers. The latter are more tidally isolated and more likely to survive to the present day. Finally, our simulations predict the existence of a new class of object that we call ‘globular-cluster-like dwarfs’ (GCDs). These form from a single, self-quenching, star-formation event in low-mass dark-matter halos at high redshift and have observational properties intermediate between globulars and dwarfs. We identify several dwarfs in our Galaxy, such as Reticulum II (refs. 2–4), that could be in this new class. If so, they promise unprecedented constraints on dark-matter models and new sites to search for metal-free stars.

 Bacteriophages are the most abundant entities on earth and exhibit vast genetic and phenotypic diversity. Exploitation of this largely unexplored molecular space requires identification and functional characterization of genes that act at the phage–host interface. So far, this has been restricted to few model phage–host systems that are amenable to genetic manipulation. Here, to overcome this limitation, we introduce a non-genetic mRNA targeting approach using exogenous delivery of programmable antisense oligomers to silence genes of DNA and RNA phages. A systematic knockdown screen of core and accessory genes of the nucleus-forming jumbo phage ΦKZ, coupled to RNA-sequencing and microscopy analyses, reveals previously unrecognized proteins that are essential for phage propagation and that, upon silencing, elicit distinct phenotypes at the level of the phage and host response. One of these factors is the RNase H-like protein ΦKZ155 (also known as Nlp2), which acts at a major decision point during infection, linking the formation of the protective phage nucleus to phage genome amplification. This non-genetic antisense oligomer-based gene silencing method promises to be a versatile tool for molecular discovery in phage biology, will help to elucidate defence and anti-defence mechanisms in non-model phage–host pairs, and offers potential for optimizing phage therapy and biotechnological procedures.

 Amino acids (AAs) have a long history of being used as stabilizers for biological media1. For example, they are important components in biomedical formulations. The effect of AAs on biological systems is also starting to be appreciated. For example, it is believed that water-stressed cells increase the levels of AAs to prevent protein aggregation2. Several hypotheses have been put forward regarding their function, ranging from water-structuring3 to hydrotropic4 to specific effects such as stabilization against misfolding, yet it is not known whether their stabilizing function is protein specific or a generic colloidal property. Here we deduce that AAs possess a new and broad colloidal property: they stabilize patchy nanoscale colloids by adsorbing onto their surfaces through weak interactions. We demonstrate this general property by careful experimental evaluation of the stabilizing effect of AAs on dispersions of various proteins, plasmid DNA and non-biological nanoparticles. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework that captures this phenomenon and experimentally corroborate several new broad theoretical implications that apply beyond AAs. In vivo experiments further demonstrate that the addition of 1 M proline to insulin doubles its bioavailability in blood. Overall, our results indicate that the role of small molecules is as important as that of ionic strength and should always be reported in biophysics experiments.

 Cancer development and response to treatment are evolutionary processes1,2, but characterizing evolutionary dynamics at a clinically meaningful scale has remained challenging3. Here we develop a new methodology called EVOFLUx, based on natural DNA methylation barcodes fluctuating over time4, that quantitatively infers evolutionary dynamics using only a bulk tumour methylation profile as input. We apply EVOFLUx to 1,976 well-characterized lymphoid cancer samples spanning a broad spectrum of diseases and show that initial tumour growth rate, malignancy age and epimutation rates vary by orders of magnitude across disease types. We measure that subclonal selection occurs only infrequently within bulk samples and detect occasional examples of multiple independent primary tumours. Clinically, we observe faster initial tumour growth in more aggressive disease subtypes, and that evolutionary histories are strong independent prognostic factors in two series of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Using EVOFLUx for phylogenetic analyses of aggressive Richter-transformed chronic lymphocytic leukaemia samples detected that the seed of the transformed clone existed decades before presentation. Orthogonal verification of EVOFLUx inferences is provided using additional genetic data, including long-read nanopore sequencing, and clinical variables. Collectively, we show how widely available, low-cost bulk DNA methylation data precisely measure cancer evolutionary dynamics, and provides new insights into cancer biology and clinical behaviour.

 Antigen-induced clustering of cell surface receptors, including T cell receptors and Fc receptors, represents a widespread mechanism in cell signalling activation1,2. However, most naturally occurring antigens, such as tumour-associated antigens, stimulate limited receptor clustering and on-target responses owing to insufficient density3–5. Here we repurpose proximity labelling6, a method used to biotinylate and identify spatially proximal proteins, to amplify designed probes as synthetic antigen clusters on the cell surface. We develop an in vivo proximity-labelling technology controlled by either red light or ultrasound to covalently tag fluorescein probes at high density near a target antigen. Using T cell receptors as an example, we demonstrate that the amplified fluorescein effectively clusters and directs a fluorescein-binding bispecific T cell engager to induce enhanced T cell activation and cytotoxicity. Noninvasive, tissue-selective labelling in multiple syngeneic mouse tumour models produces potent immune responses that rapidly eradicate treated tumours. Efficient cell lysis further promotes epitope spreading to induce systemic immunity against untreated distal lesions and immune memory against rechallenge. Thus, proximity-labelling chemistry holds promise as a generalized strategy to manipulate antigen-dependent receptor function and cell states.

 Loss-of-function variants in the lipid transporter ABCA7 substantially increase the risk of Alzheimer’s disease1,2, yet how they impact cellular states to drive disease remains unclear. Here, using single-nucleus RNA-sequencing analysis of human brain samples, we identified widespread gene expression changes across multiple neural cell types associated with rare ABCA7 loss-of-function variants. Excitatory neurons, which expressed the highest levels of ABCA7, showed disrupted lipid metabolism, mitochondrial function, DNA repair and synaptic signalling pathways. Similar transcriptional disruptions occurred in neurons carrying the common Alzheimer’s-associated variant ABCA7 p.Ala1527Gly3, predicted by molecular dynamics simulations to alter the ABCA7 structure. Induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived neurons with ABCA7 loss-of-function variants recapitulated these transcriptional changes, displaying impaired mitochondrial function, increased oxidative stress and disrupted phosphatidylcholine metabolism. Supplementation with CDP-choline increased phosphatidylcholine synthesis, reversed these abnormalities and normalized amyloid-β secretion and neuronal hyperexcitability—key Alzheimer’s features that are exacerbated by ABCA7 dysfunction. Our results implicate disrupted phosphatidylcholine metabolism in ABCA7-related Alzheimer’s risk and highlight a possible therapeutic approach.

 Neural activity is increasingly recognized as a crucial regulator of cancer growth. In the brain, neuronal activity robustly influences glioma growth through paracrine mechanisms1 and by electrochemical integration of malignant cells into neural circuitry via neuron-to-glioma synapses2,3. Outside of the central nervous system, innervation of tumours such as prostate, head and neck, breast, pancreatic, and gastrointestinal cancers by peripheral nerves similarly regulates cancer progression4–12. However, the extent to which the nervous system regulates small cell lung cancer (SCLC) progression, either in the lung or when growing within the brain, is less well understood. SCLC is a lethal high-grade neuroendocrine tumour that exhibits a strong propensity to metastasize to the brain. Here we demonstrate that in the lung, vagus nerve transection markedly inhibits primary lung tumour development and progression, highlighting a critical role for innervation in SCLC growth. In the brain, SCLC cells co-opt neuronal activity-regulated mechanisms to stimulate growth and progression. Glutamatergic and GABAergic (γ-aminobutyric acid-producing) cortical neuronal activity each drive proliferation of SCLC in the brain through paracrine and synaptic neuron–cancer interactions. SCLC cells form bona fide neuron-to-SCLC synapses and exhibit depolarizing currents with consequent calcium transients in response to neuronal activity; such SCLC cell membrane depolarization is sufficient to promote the growth of intracranial tumours. Together, these findings illustrate that neuronal activity has a crucial role in dictating SCLC pathogenesis.

 Carbonaceous asteroids are the source of the most primitive meteorites1 and represent leftover planetesimals that formed from ice and dust in the outer Solar System and may have delivered volatiles to the terrestrial planets2–5. Understanding the aqueous activity of asteroids is key to deciphering their thermal, chemical and orbital evolution, with implications for the origin of water on the terrestrial planets. Analyses of the objects, in particular pristine samples returned from asteroid Ryugu, have provided detailed information on fluid–rock interactions within a few million years after parent-body formation6–11. However, the long-term fate of asteroidal water remains poorly understood. Here we present evidence for fluid flow in a carbonaceous asteroid more than 1 billion years after formation, based on the 176Lu–176Hf decay systematics of Ryugu samples, which reflect late lutetium mobilization. Such late fluid flow was probably triggered by an impact that generated heat for ice melting and opened rock fractures for fluid migration. This contrasts the early aqueous activity powered by short-lived radioactive decay, with limited fluid flow and little elemental fractionation12. Our results imply that carbonaceous planetesimals accreted by the terrestrial planets could have retained not only hydrous minerals but also aqueous water, leading to an upwards revision of the inventory of their water delivery by a factor of two to three. Analysis of samples from the asteroid Ryugu provide evidence of late fluid flow in a carbonaceous asteroid, indicating that such bodies may have retained two to three times more water than previously thought."

 Cancer-associated muscle wasting is associated with poor clinical outcomes1, but its underlying biology is largely uncharted in humans2. Unbiased analysis of the RNAome (coding and non-coding RNAs) with unsupervised clustering using integrative non-negative matrix factorization3 provides a means of identifying distinct molecular subtypes and was applied here to muscle of patients with colorectal or pancreatic cancer. Rectus abdominis biopsies from 84 patients were profiled using high-throughput next-generation sequencing. Integrative non-negative matrix factorization with stringent quality metrics for clustering identified two highly coherent molecular subtypes within muscle of patients with cancer. Patients with subtype 1 (versus subtype 2) showed clinical manifestations of cachexia: high-grade weight loss, low muscle mass, atrophy of type IIA and type IIX muscle fibres, and reduced survival. On the basis of differential expression between the subtypes, we identified biological processes that may contribute to cancer-associated loss of muscle mass and function, including altered posttranscriptional regulation and perturbation of neuronal systems; cytokine storm and cellular immune response; pathways related to extracellular matrix; and metabolic abnormalities spanning xenobiotic metabolism, haemostasis, signal transduction, embryonic and/or pluripotent stem cells, and amino acid metabolism. Differential expression between subtypes indicated the involvement of multiple intertwined higher-order gene regulatory networks, suggesting that network interactions of (hub) long non-coding RNAs, microRNAs and mRNAs could represent targets for future research.

 Controlling spin currents, that is, the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices, is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy-efficient information technologies1,2. A pure spin current has never been measured directly because the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport3,4. Here we report that resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons—the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order—in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.

 Epithelial cells work collectively to provide a protective barrier, yet they turn over rapidly through cell division and death. If the numbers of dividing and dying cells do not match, the barrier can vanish, or tumours can form. Mechanical forces through the stretch-activated ion channel Piezo1 link both of the processes; stretch promotes cell division, whereas crowding triggers live cells to extrude and then die1,2. However, it was not clear what selects a given crowded cell for extrusion. Here we show that the crowded cells with the least energy and membrane potential are selected for extrusion. Crowding triggers sodium (Na+) entry through the epithelial Na+ channel (ENaC), which depolarizes cells. While those with sufficient energy repolarize, those with limited ATP remain depolarized, which, in turn, triggers water egress through the voltage-gated potassium (K+) channels Kv1.1 and Kv1.2 and the chloride (Cl−) channel SWELL1. Transient water loss causes cell shrinkage, amplifying crowding to activate crowding-induced live cell extrusion. Thus, our findings suggest that ENaC acts as a tension sensor that probes for cells with the least energy to extrude and die, possibly damping inadvertent crowding activation of Piezo1 in background cells. We reveal crowding-sensing mechanisms upstream of Piezo1 that highlight water regulation and ion channels as key regulators of epithelial cell turnover.

 Extreme event attribution assesses how climate change affected climate extremes, but typically focuses on single events1–4. Furthermore, these attributions rarely quantify the extent to which anthropogenic actors have contributed to these events5,6. Here we show that climate change made 213 historical heatwaves reported over 2000–2023 more likely and more intense, to which each of the 180 carbon majors (fossil fuel and cement producers) substantially contributed. This work relies on the expansion of a well-established event-based framework1. Owing to global warming since 1850–1900, the median of the heatwaves during 2000–2009 became about 20 times more likely, and about 200 times more likely during 2010–2019. Overall, one-quarter of these events were virtually impossible without climate change. The emissions of the carbon majors contribute to half the increase in heatwave intensity since 1850–1900. Depending on the carbon major, their individual contribution is high enough to enable the occurrence of 16–53 heatwaves that would have been virtually impossible in a preindustrial climate. We, therefore, establish that the influence of climate change on heatwaves has increased, and that all carbon majors, even the smaller ones, contributed substantially to the occurrence of heatwaves. Our results contribute to filling the evidentiary gap to establish accountability of historical climate extremes7,8.

 The Perseverance rover has explored and sampled igneous and sedimentary rocks within Jezero Crater to characterize early Martian geological processes and habitability and search for potential biosignatures1–7. Upon entering Neretva Vallis, on Jezero Crater’s western edge8, Perseverance investigated distinctive mudstone and conglomerate outcrops of the Bright Angel formation. Here we report a detailed geological, petrographic and geochemical survey of these rocks and show that organic-carbon-bearing mudstones in the Bright Angel formation contain submillimetre-scale nodules and millimetre-scale reaction fronts enriched in ferrous iron phosphate and sulfide minerals, likely vivianite and greigite, respectively. This organic carbon appears to have participated in post-depositional redox reactions that produced the observed iron-phosphate and iron-sulfide minerals. Geological context and petrography indicate that these reactions occurred at low temperatures. Within this context, we review the various pathways by which redox reactions that involve organic matter can produce the observed suite of iron-, sulfur- and phosphorus-bearing minerals in laboratory and natural environments on Earth. Ultimately, we conclude that analysis of the core sample collected from this unit using high-sensitivity instrumentation on Earth will enable the measurements required to determine the origin of the minerals, organics and textures it contains.

 Monocyte-derived macrophages (mo-macs) often drive immunosuppression in the tumour microenvironment (TME)1 and tumour-enhanced myelopoiesis in the bone marrow fuels these populations2. Here we performed paired transcriptome and chromatin accessibility analysis over the continuum of myeloid progenitors, circulating monocytes and tumour-infiltrating mo-macs in mice and in patients with lung cancer to identify myeloid progenitor programs that fuel pro-tumorigenic mo-macs. We show that lung tumours prime accessibility for Nfe2l2 (NRF2) in bone marrow myeloid progenitors as a cytoprotective response to oxidative stress, enhancing myelopoiesis while dampening interferon response and promoting immunosuppression. NRF2 activity is amplified during monocyte differentiation into mo-macs in the TME to regulate stress and drive immunosuppressive phenotype. NRF2 genetic deletion and pharmacological inhibition significantly reduced the survival and immunosuppression of mo-macs in the TME, restoring natural killer and T cell anti-tumour immunity and enhancing checkpoint blockade efficacy. Our findings identify a targetable epigenetic node of myeloid progenitor dysregulation that sustains immunoregulatory mo-macs in the lung TME and highlight the potential of early interventions to reprogram macrophage fate for improved immunotherapy outcomes.

 The electrolyte–electrode interface serves as the foundation for a myriad of chemical and physical processes. In battery chemistry, the formation of a well-known solid–electrolyte interphase (SEI) plays a pivotal role in ensuring the reversible operations of rechargeable lithium-ion batteries (LIBs)1,2. However, characterizing the precise chemical composition of the low crystallinity and highly sensitive SEI presents a formidable challenge3. Here, taking lithium fluoride (LiF)—a widely studied and considered crucial SEI component4–7—as an example, we use 19F solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and identify that LiF formed in SEI (LiFSEI) has fruitful spectroscopy features that originated from the formation of limited LiF–LiH solid solutions: H-rich phase (LiH1−yFy) and F-rich phase (LiF1−xHx), which is further validated by 6Li isotope NMR, synchrotron X-ray diffraction and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM). By characterizing SEI formed in various electrolytes, we confirm the dominance of LiH1−yFy in high-coulombic-efficiency electrolyte, which can be rationalized by the fact that LiF–LiH solid solution shows improved ionic conductivity over LiF. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate that LiH1−yFy-rich coating layer presents obvious advantages compared with LiF-rich coating layer in lithium-metal batteries. This revised understanding of the heterogeneous nature of SEI components would provide new insights for electrode–electrolyte interface design.

 Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a highly aggressive type of lung cancer, characterized by rapid proliferation, early metastatic spread, frequent early relapse and a high mortality rate1–3. Recent evidence has suggested that innervation has an important role in the development and progression of several types of cancer4,5. Cancer-to-neuron synapses have been reported in gliomas6,7, but whether peripheral tumours can form such structures is unknown. Here we show that SCLC cells can form functional synapses and receive synaptic transmission. Using in vivo insertional mutagenesis screening in conjunction with cross-species genomic and transcriptomic validation, we identified neuronal, synaptic and glutamatergic signalling gene sets in mouse and human SCLC. Further experiments revealed the ability of SCLC cells to form synaptic structures with neurons in vitro and in vivo. Electrophysiology and optogenetic experiments confirmed that cancer cells can receive NMDA receptor- and GABAA receptor-mediated synaptic inputs. Fitting with a potential oncogenic role of neuron–SCLC interactions, we showed that SCLC cells derive a proliferation advantage when co-cultured with vagal sensory or cortical neurons. Moreover, inhibition of glutamate signalling had therapeutic efficacy in an autochthonous mouse model of SCLC. Therefore, following malignant transformation, SCLC cells seem to hijack synaptic signalling to promote tumour growth, thereby exposing a new route for therapeutic intervention. Small cell lung cancer cells form functional synapses with glutamatergic neurons, receiving synaptic transmissions and deriving a proliferative advantage from these interactions."

 As a key mitochondrial Ca2+ transporter, NCLX regulates intracellular Ca2+ signalling and vital mitochondrial processes1–3. The importance of NCLX in cardiac and nervous-system physiology is reflected by acute heart failure and neurodegenerative disorders caused by its malfunction4–9. Despite substantial advances in the field, the transport mechanisms of NCLX remain unclear. Here we report the cryo-electron microscopy structures of NCLX, revealing its architecture, assembly, major conformational states and a previously undescribed mechanism for alternating access. Functional analyses further reveal an unexpected transport function of NCLX as a H+/Ca2+ exchanger, rather than as a Na+/Ca2+ exchanger as widely believed1. These findings provide critical insights into mitochondrial Ca2+ homeostasis and signalling, offering clues for developing therapies to treat diseases related to abnormal mitochondrial Ca2+.

 Out-of-equilibrium phases in many-body systems constitute a new paradigm in quantum matter—they exhibit dynamical properties that may otherwise be forbidden by equilibrium thermodynamics. Among these non-equilibrium phases are periodically driven (Floquet) systems1–5, which are generically difficult to simulate classically because of their high entanglement. Here we realize a Floquet topologically ordered state theoretically proposed in ref. 6, on an array of superconducting qubits. We image the characteristic dynamics of its chiral edge modes and characterize its emergent anyonic excitations. Devising an interferometric algorithm allows us to introduce and measure a bulk topological invariant to probe the dynamical transmutation of anyons for system sizes up to 58 qubits. Our work demonstrates that quantum processors can provide key insights into the thus-far largely unexplored landscape of highly entangled non-equilibrium phases of matter.

 Quantum simulations of many-body systems are among the most promising applications of quantum computers1. In particular, models based on strongly correlated fermions are central to our understanding of quantum chemistry and materials problems2, and can lead to exotic, topological phases of matter3,4. However, owing to the non-local nature of fermions, such models are challenging to simulate with qubit devices5. Here we realize a digital quantum simulation architecture for two-dimensional fermionic systems based on reconfigurable atom arrays6. We utilize a fermion-to-qubit mapping based on Kitaev’s model on a honeycomb lattice3, in which fermionic statistics are encoded using long-range entangled states7. We prepare these states efficiently using measurement8 and feedforward9, realize subsequent fermionic evolution through Floquet engineering10,11 with tunable entangling gates12 interspersed with atom rearrangement, and improve results with built-in error detection. Leveraging this fermion description of the Kitaev spin model, we efficiently prepare topological states across its complex phase diagram13 and verify the non-Abelian spin-liquid phase3 by evaluating an odd Chern number14,15. We further explore this two-dimensional fermion system by realizing tunable dynamics and directly probing fermion exchange statistics. Finally, we simulate strong interactions and study the dynamics of the Fermi–Hubbard model on a square lattice. These results pave the way for digital quantum simulations of complex fermionic systems for materials science, chemistry16 and high-energy physics17.

 West Antarctic outlet glaciers are in a stage of rapid ice loss, modulated by wind-driven exposure to warm ocean water. Rapid ice loss probably began in the mid-twentieth century and is often attributed to warmer ocean conditions near the ice shelves driven by strengthening westerly winds at the continental shelf break. This westerly wind trend is a feature of some historical climate simulations but is not supported by proxy (for example, ice-core, tree-ring) observations. Here we present an ensemble of regional ocean simulations and proxy-constrained climate reconstructions and show that shelf-break westerlies are a poor indicator of ocean conditions near the ice shelves. Instead, cumulative northerly wind anomalies close coastal polynyas (open-water regions), driving anomalous warming and freshening near the ice shelves, increasing ice-shelf melting. The increased meltwater leads to strengthening of the undercurrent that supplies warm water, further increasing melting. Our results highlight the importance of local northerly winds and associated sea ice changes for ice-shelf melting in West Antarctica. Proxy reconstructions show a significant historical northerly wind trend in this region, providing the atmospheric forcing that can explain the initiation of West Antarctic glacier retreat in the mid-twentieth century. Ocean simulations and proxy-constrained climate reconstructions suggest that the rapid retreat of West Antarctic outlet glaciers was initiated by local northerly wind trends over the twentieth century."

 Soil organic carbon is crucial for climate mitigation and agroecosystem sustainability, yet its depletion is concerning and its response to long-term fertilization remains unclear. Here we leverage the Broadbalk Classical Experiment at Rothamsted (UK), the world’s longest-running continuous winter wheat fertilization trial, along with 14C labelling, metagenomics and metabolomics to determine how 180 years of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) fertilization impact soil organic carbon dynamics. Compared with no fertilization, long-term P, N and combined NP fertilization increased the soil organic carbon content by 10%, 22% and 28%, respectively. P application alone disproportionately increased microbial respiration (37%) and biomass (20%), limiting stable carbon formation and slightly increasing labile carbon. N application alone increased microbial carbon use and necromass accumulation efficiency, increasing mineral-associated carbon build-up. Combined NP fertilization enhanced plant-derived carbon inputs and the transformation of labile carbon into stable carbon, increasing soil organic carbon quantity and stability. A meta-analysis of the effects of fertilization duration on soil organic carbon revealed that N and P fertilization globally increased cropland soil organic carbon by 21% and 13%, and these promoting effects decreased before increasing after 16 and 34 years, respectively.

Although EV has proven to be very effective both as monotherapy and in combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors, patients unfortunately develop resistance to EV after about 1 year, which calls for the need to develop new treatment options. In this study, we developed a NECTIN4-targeting chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell, and showed that it was highly effective against bladder cancer cells expressing NECTIN4. We previously found that patient tumors ranged from negative to very high levels of NECTIN4. We showed that cells with higher. NECTIN4 levels were more easily targeted by the CAR T cell. Interestingly, stimulating the PPARγ pathway using small molecules like rosiglitazone (an old diabetes drug) was effective at increasing NECTIN4 expression, particularly in UC cells with lower NECTIN4 levels. This translated into enhanced NECTIN4-CAR T killing in vitro and in mouse tumor xenografts. Moreover, we found that NECTIN4 is largely retained on tumors after patients become resistant to EV, and we developed EV-resistant cell lines to study this. Importantly, NECTIN4-CAR T cells remained effective even against these EV-resistant cancer cells. Together, our findings demonstrate that NECTIN4-CAR T cells are effective, whose activity can be further enhanced by repurposing a diabetes drug, rosiglitazone, to induce NECTIN4. Our findings may pave the way to new therapeutic approaches for bladder cancer patients in the future. 
 With the approval of the antibody-drug conjugate enfortumab vedotin (EV), NECTIN4 has emerged as a bona fide therapeutic target in urothelial carcinoma (UC). Here, we report the development of a NECTIN4-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell, which exhibits reactivity across cells expressing a range of endogenous NECTIN4, with enhanced activity in high expressors. We demonstrate that the PPARγ pathway, critical for luminal differentiation, transcriptionally controls NECTIN4, and that the PPARγ agonist rosiglitazone primes and augments NECTIN4 expression, thereby increasing sensitivity to NECTIN4-CAR T cell-mediated killing. NECTIN4-CAR T cells have potent anti-tumor activity even against EV resistant cells, which largely retain NECTIN4 expression, including in a post-EV biopsy cohort. Our results elucidate a therapeutically actionable mechanism that UC cells use to control NECTIN4 expression and suggest therapeutic approaches that leverage PPARγ agonists for rational combinations with NECTIN4-targeting agents in UC, as well as future potential treatment options for EV-refractory patients.

 Radial spokes (RSs) are conserved multimolecular structures attached to the axonemal microtubule doublets and are essential for the motility control of both cilia and sperm flagella. CFAP91, an RS3 protein, is implicated in human male infertility, yet its molecular function remains poorly understood. Here, we demonstrate that Cfap91 knockout (KO) mice exhibit impaired sperm flagellum formation and male infertility. Using a transgenic rescue model expressing FLAG- and BioID2-tagged CFAP91, we reveal that CFAP91 immunoprecipitates with RS3 proteins CFAP251 and LRRC23, whose localization is disrupted in Cfap91 KO sperm flagella. In addition, proximity labeling in mature spermatozoa identifies EFCAB5 as a sperm-specific CFAP91-proximal component. We show that Efcab5 KO males exhibit reduced sperm motility and fertility. Our findings establish CFAP91 as an essential scaffolder of RS3 assembly and EFCAB5 as a sperm-specialized movement regulator, advancing understanding of axonemal specialization in mammalian spermatozoa and its relevance to male infertility.

They showed a long-term warming trend that diverges from the contemporaneous global sea surface cooling. 
 How terrestrial mean annual temperature (MAT) evolved throughout the past 2 million years (Myr) remains elusive, limiting our understanding of the patterns, mechanisms, and impacts of past temperature changes. Here we report a ~2-Myr terrestrial MAT record based on fossil microbial lipids preserved in the Heqing paleolake, East Asia. The increased amplitude and periodicity shift of glacial-interglacial changes in our record align with those in sea surface temperature (SST) records. However, its long-term warming trend (1.0 °C/Myr, 95% CI = 0.4–1.7 °C/Myr) during 1.8–0.6 Myr ago diverges from the contemporaneous SST cooling. We propose that the Pleistocene warming in East Asia primarily resulted from regionally enhanced heat input and greenhouse effect of rising water vapor driven by Antarctic ice sheets (AIS) growth, highlighting the important climatic effect of AIS evolution. Such long-term warming across the Mid-Pleistocene Transition might have been beneficial for archaic humans’ flourishing in Eurasia.

Here, the authors conduct multiomic profiling of human livers to demonstrate that RNA splicing is dysregulated in alcohol-associated liver disease, interfering with liver regeneration. 
 Individuals with progressive liver failure risk dying without liver transplantation. However, our understanding of why regenerative responses are disrupted in failing livers is limited. Here, we perform multiomic profiling of healthy and diseased human livers using bulk and single-nucleus RNA- and ATAC-seq. We report that in alcohol-associated liver disease, alterations in the hepatic immune milieu prevent hepatocytes from transitioning to proliferative progenitors. We also find differences in RNA binding protein expression, particularly of the ESRP, PTBP, and SR families, leading to misregulation of developmentally controlled RNA splicing. Our data pinpoint ESRP2 as a disease-sensitive splicing factor and support a causal role for its deficiency in the pathogenesis of severe alcoholic hepatitis. Notably, splicing defects in Tcf4 and Slk, two ESPR2 targets, alter their nuclear localization and activities, disrupting WNT and Hippo signaling pathways that are critical for normal liver regeneration. We further demonstrate that changes in stromal cell populations enrich failing livers with TGF-β, which suppresses the ESRP2-driven epithelial splicing program and replaces functional parenchyma with quasi-progenitor-like cells lacking liver-specific functions. Taken together, these findings indicate that misspliced RNAs are effective biomarkers for alcohol-associated liver disease, and targeting them could improve recovery in affected individuals.

Firms spend little funds on carbon credits, and emission offsetting is not a central part of their climate strategies. 
 Carbon credits feature prominently in corporate climate strategies and have sparked public debate about their potential to delay companies’ internal decarbonisation. While industry reports claim that credit purchasers decarbonise faster, rigorous evidence is missing. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of 89 multinational companies’ historical emission reductions and climate target ambitions. Based on self-reported environmental data and more than 400 sustainability reports, we find no significant difference between the climate strategies of companies that purchased credits and those that did not. Voluntary offsetting is not a central part of most companies’ climate strategies, and many pass credit costs directly onto their customers. While the companies within our sample retired one-fourth of all carbon credits in 2022, the top five offsetters’ expenditures on voluntary emission offsetting are, on average, only 1 percent relative to their capital expenditures. For most companies, carbon credits are, therefore, unlikely to crowd out internal decarbonisation measures. Yet, we document that for large-scale offsetters in the airline industry, carbon credit purchases competed with financing internal decarbonisation measures. This study of 89 multinational firms finds no significant link between voluntarily offsetting emissions and decarbonization speed.

 Atherosclerosis, a major cause of cardiovascular diseases, is characterized by the buildup of lipids and chronic inflammation in the arteries, leading to plaque formation and potential rupture. Despite recent advances in single-cell transcriptomics (scRNA-seq), the underlying immune mechanisms and transformations in structural cells driving plaque progression remain incompletely defined. Existing datasets often lack comprehensive coverage and consistent annotations, limiting the utility of downstream analyses. Here, we present an integrated single-cell atlas of human atherosclerotic plaques, covering roughly 250k high-quality annotated cells. We achieve robust cell type annotations validated by expert consensus and surface protein measurements. Using this atlas, we introduce distinct markers for plaque neutrophils, identify a proangiogenic endothelial cell cluster enriched in advanced lesions, and specialized macrophage subsets. We also establish that fibromyocytes are exclusive to vascular tissue. This comprehensive atlas enables accurate automatic cell type annotation of new datasets, improves experimental design by guiding sample size and detection power, and supports the deconvolution of bulk RNA-seq data.

 The European Union’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) aims to avoid carbon leakage by pricing the production emissions of imported goods. Currently, the CBAM applies to iron and steel, cement, aluminium, fertilizers, electricity and hydrogen. As the European Union considers extending the CBAM to chemicals by 2030, its effectiveness in this complex industry remains uncertain. Here we assess how well the CBAM would capture emissions in the chemical industry by using the life-cycle assessment data of 4,470 global chemical production facilities, focusing on the key products ethylene and polyethylene. We find that the current CBAM framework would cover 50–60% of production emissions for these products, leaving substantial upstream emissions unpriced. This limited emission coverage risks compromising the policy’s climate ambition and distorts market incentives. To improve effectiveness, the CBAM would need to expand to include fossil feedstocks and refinery products, and implement high fallback default values for embodied emissions to incentivize data reporting.

 The timing of harvesting is crucial for determining crop yield potential as it influences the final stages of the crop growth cycle and affects crop grain quality. Early harvesting can lead to yield losses from excessive moisture and insufficient dry matter, while delayed harvesting can degrade grain quality due to over-maturation and increased susceptibility to weather, pests, and diseases. Accurate monitoring of harvest timing is essential to assess yield gaps, support profitable and sustainable farming practices, and optimize agricultural supply chains. However, remote sensing-based harvesting date detection methods often suffer from biases due to the inconsistent relationship between end-of-season (EOS) metrics in vegetation index (VI) time series and actual harvesting dates. This inconsistency occurs because harvesting decisions are often influenced by human factors such as equipment availability, labor constraints, and fuel costs, rather than plant condition alone. In this study, we develop a novel Normalized Harvest Phenology Index (NHPI) that integrates the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Near-Infrared (NIR) reflectance to accurately monitor whether fields of corn and soybean have been harvested. Leveraging the distinct separability of NIR reflectance for corn and soybean before harvesting (senescent plants) and after harvesting (crop residue), combined with the contrasting trends between NIR and NDVI during this transition, the NIR-to-NDVI ratio amplifies the harvesting signal in its time series, making it a robust indicator of harvesting events. As the first spectral index designed for scalable identification of crop harvesting stage, the developed NHPI is applied to map harvesting dates for corn and soybean fields across the U.S. Midwest from 2020 to 2023 using Landsat and Sentinel-2 imagery via Google Earth Engine (GEE). At the field level, the NHPI-based harvesting date estimation method achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 4 days and an R2 of 0.85 when compared against field-recorded harvesting dates, significantly outperforming all advanced harvesting date estimation benchmarks (i.e., EOS phenometric-based method, shape model fitting method (SMF), and shape model fitting by the separate phenological stage method (SMF-S). The NHPI-based harvesting date mapping also shows strong alignment with the state-level cumulative distribution of harvesting dates of the USDA crop progress reports, achieving an average MAE of 3 days. Further analysis of NHPI values before and after harvesting events reveals its strong adaptability to diverse weather conditions at large scales, highlighting its efficiency and robustness."

 Studying and analyzing cropland is a difficult task due to its dynamic and heterogeneous growth behavior. Usually, diverse data sources can be collected for its estimation. Although deep learning models have proven to excel in the crop classification task, they face substantial challenges when dealing with multiple inputs, named multi-modal or Multi-View Learning (MVL). The methods used in the MVL scenario can be structured based on the encoder architecture, the fusion strategy, and the optimization technique. Here, the literature has primarily focused on using specific encoder architectures for local regions, lacking a deeper exploration of other components in the MVL methodology. In contrast, we investigate the simultaneous selection of the fusion strategy and encoder architecture, assessing global-scale cropland and crop-type classifications. We use a range of five fusion strategies (Input, Feature, Decision, Ensemble, Hybrid) and five temporal encoders (LSTM, GRU, TempCNN, TAE, L-TAE) as possible configurations in the MVL method. We use the CropHarvest dataset for validation, which provides optical, radar, weather time series, and topographic information as input data. We found that in scenarios with a limited number of labeled samples, a unique configuration is insufficient for all cases. Instead, a specific combination should be meticulously sought, including an encoder and fusion strategy. To streamline this search process, we suggest identifying the optimal encoder architecture tailored for a particular fusion strategy and then determining the most suitable fusion strategy for the classification task. We provide a standardized model schema for the exploration of crop classification through an MVL methodology. jn"

 Investigations on the raindrop size distributions (RSDs) are essential for understanding the dynamical and microphysical processes contributing to precipitation. Empirical relationships derived from RSD parameters, like radar reflectivity–rainfall rate (Z–R), mass-weighted mean diameter–rainfall rate (Dm–R), shape–slope (μ–Ʌ), and normalized intercept parameter–rainfall rate (log10Nw–R) relationships, can enhance the rainfall estimation, and cloud modeling simulations. In the present study, four years (2018–2021) measurements of a Laser Precipitation Monitor (LPM; Thies) disdrometer installed at the National Institute of Technology Rourkela, India, are used to investigate the RSD characteristics of thunderstorms (TSs) and tropical cyclones (TCs) observed during pre-monsoon (March–May) season. Along with the disdrometer data, auxiliary parameters like convective available potential energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CIN), total column water vapor (WV), vertical profiles of temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) from reanalysis data sets of ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) fifth-generation reanalysis (ERA5) are also used in this study. TCs have dominant small-sized raindrops, whereas moderate and large-sized raindrops predominate in TSs. Diurnal variation of RSD indicates that raindrop sizes during TCs are limited to 4.5 mm. The mean values of R, Z, Dm, μ, and liquid water content (W) are maximum during the TSs and the normalized intercept parameter (log10Nw) and slope parameter (Ʌ) are maximized during the TCs. The average RSD indicated significant variations between TSs and TCs precipitation with a significant difference in Z–R, Dm–R, μ–Ʌ, log10Nw–R relationships. The Z–R relationships during the TSs and TCs are Z = 543.22R1.46 and Z = 291.3R1.31, respectively. The diurnal variations in Z–R coefficient ‘A' and exponent ‘b’ values are associated with sizeable diurnal variations of CAPE and CIN."

 Substantial uncertainties remain in numerical models incorporating different planetary boundary layer (PBL) schemes when it comes to reproducing the detailed thermodynamic structure of the convective boundary layer (CBL), particularly for the level of neutral stability (zn), at which statically unstable lower CBL begins to transit into slightly stable upper CBL. Using multi-year radiosonde data from 12 stations and large-eddy simulation (LES), we examined the detailed CBL thermodynamic structure and processes over the Tibetan Plateau, particularly focusing on the impact of surface heating and entrainment on zn. The results indicated that the values of zn spatially ranged within 0.16–0.38zi on the plateau, with zi representing the CBL depth, and zn was higher in the southwestern region and lower in the southeastern region. Surface−/entrainment-induced large-scale thermals (corresponding to nonlocal fluxes) tended to suppress/elevate zn, due to warm air penetrating into the upper/lower CBL, whereas small-scale eddies (corresponding to local fluxes) exert the opposite effect on zn. The LES results indicated that zn increased before 08:00 Local Time (about 80 min after sunrise), as surface-induced small eddies dominated during the early stage of CBL development. After this time, zn decreased as large-scale surface-induced thermals became more active. This improved understanding provides guidance for further improvement of PBL schemes.Plain language summaryConvective boundary layer (CBL) over the Tibetan Plateau plays an important role in the climate system in East Asia. Nevertheless, detailed CBL structure and the impact factors over the plateau have not been fully examined yet. Combining the multi-year radiosonde fine-resolution profiles of potential temperature (θ) with the large eddy simulation (LES), we investigate the CBL structure, particularly the position of neutral point (zn), a transition level separating the statically unstable lower CBL from the slightly statically stable upper CBL. We also examine the impacts of surface heating and entrainment process on detailed CBL structure. θ profiles exhibit a three-layer structure, with zn spatially varying over the plateau. Different eddies with different sizes initiated from the surface and from the entrainment zone at the CBL top synergistically affect the evolution of the CBL and the altitude of zn. This improved understanding of the detail CBL structure and the relevant physical processes provides a new angle to evaluate and calibrate numerical weather prediction (NWP) models with PBL schemes."

However, the secondary messengers involved in this process are largely unknown. Here, we use the olfactory signal transduction of the aggregation pheromone 4-vinylanisole (4VA) as a model to address this question. When locusts detect 4VA, the pheromone is transported by OBP10 and OBP13 to the OR35–Orco receptor complex, thereby activating downstream pathways in the antenna. A pivotal downstream molecule, the lipid-binding protein Clvs2, facilitates phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate transportation across the cytolemma, providing more substrates for inositol trisphosphate (IP3) production. PLCe1, a biosynthetic enzyme, boosts IP3levels in the antennal lobe of the brain. IP3is responsible for converting chemical signals from the antenna into neural signals, confirming IP3as a secondary messenger in olfaction perception instead of GPCR in locusts. These findings elucidate the universal function of IP3in olfactory signal perception, shedding light on the key nodes of insect olfactory signal transduction."

The heteroplasmic nature of mtDNA—where mutant and wild-type mtDNA coexist—complicates efforts to define its contribution to disease progression. In this study, bulk whole-genome sequencing of 637 matched tumor-normal samples from the Pediatric Cancer Genome Project revealed an enrichment of functionally impactful mtDNA variants in specific pediatric leukemia subtypes. Collectively, the results from single-cell sequencing of five diagnostic leukemia samples demonstrated that somatic mtDNA mutations can arise early in leukemogenesis and undergo positive selection during disease progression, achieving intermediate heteroplasmy—a “sweet spot” that balances mitochondrial dysfunction with cellular fitness. Network-based systems biology analyses link specific heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations to metabolic reprogramming and therapy resistance.

Our findings reveal higher reactivity of terrestrial organic matter released to the Laptev Sea and the eastern East Siberian Sea, lower reactivity in the western East Siberian Sea, and no deducible degradation in the Kara Sea. The reactivity of terrestrial organic matter is primarily determined by the degradation status and composition of its source, alongside potential microbiological controls during transport.

We exploit unprecedented ocean-bottom observations using ultralong-period “tilt mechanical amplifiers,” along with hydrostatic pressure, global navigation satellite system, and satellite interferometric synthetic aperture radar data. The joint inversion of these geodetic data, template-matching seismicity, and repeating earthquakes, revealed the first two shallow slow slip events (SSEs) observed in Mexico. The first one migrated from the trench to the earthquake hypocenter before rupture, and the second one occurred following anMw7.3 long-term SSE induced by the earthquake. Episodic near-trench oceanic-crust deformations (i.e., tilt transients) associated with shallow and deep synchronous decoupling of the plate interface reveal the occurrence of “slab-pull surges” before three regional earthquakes of magnitude 7 or greater, including the Acapulco event, suggesting that they may serve as rupture precursors observable in subduction zones."

Our analysis of atmospheric energetics further reveals key mechanisms for magnitude uncertainty: aerosol radiative forcing drives, cloud radiative feedback amplifies, and ocean circulation damps the intermodel uncertainty in cross-equatorial atmospheric energy transport change and the meridional shift of tropical rain bands. This has important implications for understanding and reducing intermodel uncertainty in anthropogenic climate change."

In a humanized xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) model, they dampen T cell activation, alleviate GVHD pathology, and prolong survival without impairing antileukemia activity. Mechanistically, CD8 Trpcells promote immune regulation by inducing FOXP3 expression in both CD4 Tregcells and themselves.

The OMR achieves a triply resonant optical-to-optical conversion with an enhanced coupling rateGb= 3.6 gigahertz per square-root milliwatt at a peak conversion efficiency of 1.2% with 3.6-milliwatt microwave drive power and a microwave-to-optical conversion efficiency of 1.5 × 10−5at 10-milliwatt optical drive power. Our results show that the unsuspended SOS platform, which mitigates the thermal effect and is compatible with superconducting qubits, is a promising platform for optomechanical circuitry and quantum transduction."

Inspired by findings from optogenetic stimulation in mice, we hypothesized that STN-DBS can mimic dopaminergic reinforcement of ongoing movement kinematics during stimulation. To investigate this hypothesis, we delivered DBS bursts during particularly fast and slow movements in 24 patients with PD. Our findings reveal that DBS during fast movements enhanced future movement speed more than DBS during slow movements, raising movement speed to the level of healthy controls. To understand which brain circuits mediate this neurophysiological mechanism, we investigated the behavioral effects using magnetic resonance imaging connectomics and motor cortex electrocorticography. Last, we demonstrate that machine learning–based brain signal decoding can be used to predict continuous movement speed for fully embedded state-dependent closed-loop algorithms. Our findings provide important evidence for reinforcement-based DBS circuit mechanisms that may inspire previously unexplored treatment avenues for dopaminergic disorders."

Here, based on in vivo CRISPR screen, we identified PTDSS1 as a target to improve anti–PD-1 therapy. Depletion ofPtdss1in tumor cells increased expression of interferon-γ (IFN-γ)–regulated genes, includingB2m,Cxcl9,Cxcl10, andStat1, even in the absence of IFN-γ stimulation in vitro. Loss ofPtdss1in tumor cells also led to increased expression of MHC-I, enhanced cytotoxicity of CD8+T cells, and increased frequency of an iNOS+myeloid subset.

Here, we found that the rib structure of a cicada’s tymbal exhibits exceptional toughness and fatigue resistance, attributed to its unique architecture composed of alternating soft and stiff polymer layers. Inspired by this rib structure, we developed a robust artificial rib film (ARF) using a nanoconfined crystallization strategy that involves the deposition of soft polyethylene oxide and stiff phenol formaldehyde. The ARF demonstrates a toughness amplification factor twice that of the cicada’s tymbal rib and exhibits an exceptionally long fatigue life. The nanoconfined crystallization restricts molecular motion and disperses external forces within the crystalline structure, thereby enhancing its mechanical properties. These improvements enable the ARF to outperform commercial polymer films as an acoustic transducer, achieving 2.7 times increase in frequency response and 2.2 times increase in displacement amplitude."

Loss of CB5LP inArabidopsiscauses embryonic defects, seedling lethality, and accumulation of 14α-methyl-sterols, with reduced levels of sitosterol and stigmasterol—indicating a defect in sterol 14α-demethylation.

To address this challenge, we develop an end-to-end inverse design methodology for acoustic tweezers based on coding metasurfaces, establishing a dual-objective, dual-scale optimization paradigm. At the microscale, the phase modulation and transmission efficiency are co-optimized through coupled physical models. While at the mesoscale, the particle suspension and rotation dynamics are considered.

Early-season westerly wind bursts (WWBs) have long been suggested to be important for ENSO evolution and diversity, with the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) among the main sources of WWBs. However, MJO’s contribution to ENSO evolution has been difficult to quantify. Here, using an ensemble hindcast approach specifically designed to isolate internal atmospheric variability, we evaluate the influences of March MJO on subsequent ENSO development. Our results show that the March MJO, under favorable background conditions, by itself has limited impacts on ENSO due to weak equatorial air-sea coupling in spring. In comparison, the North Pacific Oscillation–induced meridional mode exerts a more sustained influence on ENSO evolution. A cyclonic circulation anomaly over Hawaii, associated with the Pacific-North American pattern, also plays a role.

Seventy percent of providers prescribed antibiotics without indication of bacterial infection. Knowledge gaps explain little: 62% of providers who knew antibiotics were inappropriate still prescribed them. Closing this “know-do gap” would reduce prescribing by 30 percentage points, versus only 6 points if all providers had perfect knowledge. Using randomized experiments, we revealed that the know-do gap stems from providers’ beliefs that patients want antibiotics, not from profit motives or lack of alternative treatments.
