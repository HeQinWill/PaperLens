Conventional monitoring and modeling methods are limited to accurately revealing the evolution process and trends of river aquatic organisms. In the present study, based on HJ-1A/1B CCD sensor, combined with genetic algorithm (GA) and regression tree (GART), a remote sensing inversion prediction model was established; the model can estimate algal blooms in the Han River affected by China’s Middle Route of the South-to-North Water Diversion Project (SNWTP). During the outbreak of algal blooms, the near-infrared band reflectance evidently increased between 2009 and 2015, with increasing algal density. The algal density in the downstream of the Han River has a nearly synchronous positive change with the reflectance in the B4 (near-infrared) band and a nearly synchronous reverse change with the B1 (blue) band. B1 and B4 screened by GA reduced redundancy by 14%, leading to a good prediction performance (R2 = 0.88). According to GART and partial dependence analysis, the B4 band is a crucial characterization factor of algal blooms in the Han River. When the remote sensing band was in the range of B1 ⩾ 0.085 and B4 ⩽ 0.101, the algal density was lower than 0.15 × 107 cells l−1, indicating no algal bloom in the downstream of the Han River. When B4 was >0.103 and B1 ⩽ 0.076, algal density was higher than 1 × 107 cells l−1 and algal blooms were very likely to occur. These findings could provide a scientific reference for diagnosing and predicting large-scale water ecological degradation in similar watersheds."

Understanding these impacts (positive and negative) requires a comprehensive evaluation framework. This study develops and applies an integrated simulation framework for assessing the impacts of the GERD on Sudan, focusing on the simultaneous economywide effects of riverine flood hazards, irrigation water supply, hydropower generation, and floodplain-dependent industries, namely traditional fired clay brick production. The simulation framework incorporates three models: a river infrastructure system model, a flood model, and a Computable General Equilibrium Model. Results indicate positive impacts for hydropower generation and flood control, marginal benefits for water supply to existing irrigation, and negative consequences for brick production and the construction sector. Assuming that the GERD starts its long-term operation in 2025, we find an overall positive economic impact on Sudan’s Gross Domestic Product in 2025, with an increase of up to just over 0.1%, subject to river flow conditions. Recognizing the differences in impacts across sectors and income groups, the study emphasizes the need for interventions that ameliorate negative effects. While the study captures several impacts, other effects on the environment, recession agriculture, and soil fertility require further investigation. Still, our findings underscore the importance of adopting an integrated simulation approach to dam evaluation, acknowledging the interconnected nature of water and related sectors in national economies."

Vincent;Andrew J. Dowdy,Multi-scale variability of southeastern Australian wind resources,"We investigate how wind speed at the height of a wind turbine changes during El Niño and La Niña years and with season and time of day in southeastern Australia. We found that El Niño and La Niña can cause average wind speed differences of around 1 m s-1 in some regions. The highest wind speeds occur in the afternoon or evening around mountains or the coast and during the night for inland areas.  The results help show how placement of wind turbines can help balance electricity generation. 
 There is growing need to understand wind variability in various regions throughout the world, including in relation to wind energy resources. Here we examine wind variability in southeastern Australia in relation to the El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) as a dominant mode of atmospheric and oceanic variability for this region. The analysis covers variability from seasonal to diurnal timescales for both land and maritime regions of relevance to wind energy generation. Wind speeds were obtained from the 12 km grid length Bureau of Meteorology Atmospheric high-resolution Regional Reanalysis for Australia (BARRA) reanalysis, with a focus on wind at a typical hub-height of 100 m above the surface. Results show spatiotemporal variations in how ENSO influences wind speeds, including consistency in these variations over the wind speed distribution. For example, ENSO-related variations in mean winds were mostly similar in sign to ENSO-related variations in weak winds, noting uncertainties for strong winds given available data. Diurnal variability in wind speed was larger for summer than winter and for land than ocean regions, with the diurnal cycle maxima typically occurring in the afternoon and evening rather than morning, plausibly associated with sensible heating of air above land following solar radiation. Localised variations in the diurnal cycle were identified around mountains and coastal regions. The results show some indication of ENSO influences on the diurnal variability. These findings are intended to help enhance scientific understanding on wind variability, including in relation to ENSO, and to contribute information towards practical guidance in planning such as for use in energy sector applications."

Pérez-Invernón;Patrick Jöckel;Torsten Neubert;Olivier Chanrion;Victor Reglero;Nikolai Østgaard,Parameterizations for global thundercloud corona discharge distributions,"Sudden local ozone (O3) enhancements have been reported in different regions of the world since the 1970s. While the hot channel of lightning strokes directly produce significant amounts of nitrogen oxide, no direct emission of O3 is expected. Corona discharges in convective active regions could explain local O3 increases, which remains unexplained. We present the first mathematical functions that relate the global annual frequency of in-cloud coronas with four sets of meteorological variables. 
 Four parameterizations, distinguishing between land and ocean, have been developed to simulate global distributions of thundercloud streamer corona discharges (also known as Blue LUminous Events or BLUEs) mainly producing bluish optical emissions associated with the second positive system of N2 accompanied by no (or hardly detectable) 777.4 nm light emission. BLUEs occur globally about 12 times less frequently (Soler et al., 2022) than lightning flashes. The four schemes are based on non-linear functions of the cloud-top height (CTH), the product of the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and total precipitation (TP), the product of CAPE and specific cloud liquid water content (CLWC), and the product of CAPE and specific cloud snow water content (CSWC). Considering that thunderstorms occur on hourly timescales, these parameterizations have been tested using hourly ERA5 data (except for CTH, not available in ERA5) for the meteorological variables considered, finding that the proposed BLUE schemes work fine and are consistent with observations by the Atmosphere–Space Interactions Monitor (ASIM). Moreover, the parameterizations have been implemented in a global chemistry–climate model that generates annual and seasonal global distributions for present-day and end of 21st century climate scenarios. Present-day predictions are in reasonable agreement with recent observations by the ASIM.  Predictions for the end of the 21st century suggest BLUE occurrence rates that range between 13 % higher (∼ 3 % K−1) and 52 % higher (∼ 13 % K−1) than present-day average occurrences of BLUEs."
10.5194/acp-24-10245-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了混合相云的冰化过程，即液态水云中冰晶形成的过程。研究者使用实验室实验数据，结合数值模型模拟，分析了冰核浓度增加对混合相云演化的影响。研究结果表明，冰核浓度增加会导致云中冰晶数量增加，冰晶半径增长，最终达到冰化阈值。然而，由于湍流混合作用，液态水滴并未完全消失，这表明混合相云和冰云之间存在一个过渡阶段。这项研究对于理解云的微物理过程、辐射特性和降水过程具有重要意义，并对卫星观测和数值模拟提供参考。,"['mixed-phase clouds', 'glaciation', 'ice nucleating particles', 'cloud microphysics', 'satellite observations', 'cloud radiative properties', 'precipitation']",Aaron Wang;Steve Krueger;Sisi Chen;Mikhail Ovchinnikov;Will Cantrell;Raymond A. Shaw,Glaciation of mixed-phase clouds: insights from bulk model and bin-microphysics large-eddy simulation informed by laboratory experiment,"We employ two methods to examine a laboratory experiment on clouds with both ice and liquid phases. The first assumes well-mixed properties; the second resolves the spatial distribution of turbulence and cloud particles. Results show that while the trends in mean properties generally align, when turbulence is resolved, liquid droplets are not fully depleted by ice due to incomplete mixing. This underscores the threshold of ice mass fraction in distinguishing mixed-phase clouds from ice clouds. 
 Mixed-phase clouds affect precipitation and radiation differently from liquid and ice clouds, posing greater challenges to their representation in numerical simulations. Recent laboratory experiments using the Pi Cloud Chamber explored cloud glaciation conditions based on increased injection of ice-nucleating particles. In this study, we use two approaches to reproduce the results of the laboratory experiments: a bulk scalar mixing model and large-eddy simulation (LES) with bin microphysics. The first approach assumes a well-mixed domain to provide an efficient assessment of the mean cloud properties for a wide range of conditions. The second approach resolves the energy-carrying turbulence, the particle size distribution, and their spatial distribution to provide more details. These modeling approaches enable a separate and detailed examination of liquid and ice properties, which is challenging in the laboratory. Both approaches demonstrate that, with an increased ice number concentration, the flow and microphysical properties exhibit the same changes in trends. Additionally, both approaches show that the ice integral radius reaches the theoretical glaciation threshold when the cloud is subsaturated with respect to liquid water. The main difference between the results of the two approaches is that the bulk model allows for the complete glaciation of the cloud. However, LES reveals that, in a dynamic system, the cloud is not completely glaciated as liquid water droplets are continuously produced near the warm lower boundary and subsequently mixed into the chamber interior. These results highlight the importance of the ice mass fraction in distinguishing the mixed-phase clouds and ice clouds."

Wofsy,Methane retrieval from MethaneAIR using the CO2 proxy approach: a demonstration for the upcoming MethaneSAT mission,"MethaneSAT is an upcoming satellite mission designed to monitor methane emissions from the oil and gas (O&amp;G) industry globally. Here, we present observations from the first flight campaign of MethaneAIR, a MethaneSAT-like instrument mounted on an aircraft. MethaneAIR can map methane with high precision and accuracy over a typically sized oil and gas basin (~200 km2) in a single flight. This paper demonstrates the capability of the upcoming satellite to routinely track global O&amp;G emissions. 
 Reducing methane (CH4) emissions from the oil and gas (O&G) sector is crucial for mitigating climate change in the near term. MethaneSAT is an upcoming satellite mission designed to monitor basin-wide O&G emissions globally, providing estimates of emission rates and helping identify the underlying processes leading to methane release in the atmosphere. MethaneSAT data will support advocacy and policy efforts by helping to track methane reduction commitments and targets set by countries and industries. Here, we introduce a CH4 retrieval algorithm for MethaneSAT based on the CO2 proxy method. We apply the algorithm to observations from the maiden campaign of MethaneAIR, an airborne precursor to the satellite that has similar instrument specifications. The campaign was conducted during winter 2019 and summer 2021 over three major US oil and gas basins.Analysis of MethaneAIR data shows that measurement precision is typically better than 2 % at a 20×20 m2 pixel resolution, exhibiting no strong dependence on geophysical variables, e.g., surface reflectance. We show that detector focus drifts over the course of each flight, likely due to thermal gradients that develop across the optical bench. The impacts of this drift on retrieved CH4 can mostly be mitigated by including a parameter that squeezes the laboratory-derived, tabulated instrument spectral response function (ISRF) in the spectral fit. Validation against coincident EM27/SUN retrievals shows that MethaneAIR values are generally within 1 % of the retrievals. MethaneAIR retrievals were also intercompared with retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI). We estimate that the mean bias between the instruments is 2.5 ppb, and the latitudinal gradients for the two data sets are in good agreement.We evaluate the accuracy of MethaneAIR estimates of point-source emissions using observations recorded over the Permian Basin, an O&G basin, based on the integrated-mass-enhancement approach coupled with a plume-masking algorithm that uses total variational denoising. We estimate that the median point-source detection threshold is 100–150 kg h−1 at the aircraft's nominal above-surface observation altitude of 12 km. This estimate is based on an ensemble of Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) large-eddy simulations used to mimic the campaign's conditions, with the threshold for quantification set at approximately twice the detection threshold. Retrievals from repeated basin surveys indicate the presence of both persistent and intermittent sources, and we highlight an example from each case. For the persistent source, we infer emissions from a large O&G processing facility and estimate a leak rate between 1.6 % and 2.1 %, higher than any previously reported emission levels from a facility of its size. We also identify a ruptured pipeline that could increase total basin emissions by 2 % if left unrepaired; this pipeline was discovered 2 weeks before it was found by its operator, highlighting the importance of regular monitoring by future satellite missions. The results showcase MethaneAIR's capability to make highly accurate, precise measurements of methane dry-air mole fractions in the atmosphere, with a fine spatial resolution (∼ 20×20 m2) mapped over large swaths (∼ 100×100 km2) in a single flight. The results provide confidence that MethaneSAT can make such measurements at unprecedentedly fine scales from space (∼ 130×400 m2 pixel size over a target area measuring ∼ 200×200 km2), thereby delivering quantitative data on basin-wide methane emissions."
10.5194/amt-17-5491-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究了利用两套不同的算法，从MetOp-A卫星上的IASI仪器获取的红外光谱数据中反演大气甲烷浓度。其中一个算法由法国气象动力学实验室（LMD）开发，另一个由英国卢瑟福·阿普尔顿实验室（RAL）开发。论文通过与CAMS模型、地面FTIR观测和探空资料的比较，对两种算法的反演结果进行了独立验证，并分析了两种算法在不同区域和时间尺度上的差异。该研究对于评估卫星遥感技术在监测大气甲烷浓度方面的应用具有重要意义。,"['methane', 'CH4', 'IASI', 'MetOp-A', 'satellite', 'remote sensing', 'air quality', 'atmospheric composition', 'validation', 'algorithm']",Bart Dils;Minqiang Zhou;Claude Camy-Peyret;Martine De Mazière;Yannick Kangah;Bavo Langerock;Pascal Prunet;Carmine Serio;Richard Siddans;Brian Kerridge,"Independent validation of IASI/MetOp-A LMD and RAL CH4 products using CAMS model, in situ profiles, and ground-based FTIR measurements","The paper discusses two very distinct methane products from the IASI instrument aboard the MetOp-A satellite. One (referred to as LMD NLISv8.3) uses a machine-learning approach, while the other (RALv2.0) uses a more conventional optimal estimation approach. We used a variety of model and independent reference measurement data to assess both products' overall quality, their differences, and specific aspects of each product that would benefit from further analysis by the product development teams. 
 In this study, we carried out an independent validation of two methane retrieval algorithms using spectra from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) that has been aboard the Meteorological Operational Satellite A (MetOp-A) since 2006. Both algorithms, one developed by the Laboratoire de Météorologie Dynamique (LMD), called the non-linear inference scheme (NLISv8.3), and the other by the Rutherford Appleton Laboratory (RAL), referred to as RALv2.0, provide long-term global CH4 concentrations using distinctively different retrieval approaches (neural network vs. optimal estimation, respectively). They also differ with respect to the vertical range covered, where LMD provides mid-tropospheric dry-air mole fractions (mtCH4), and RAL provides mixing ratio profiles from which we can derive total column-averaged dry-air mole fractions (XCH4) and potentially two partial column layers (qCH4).We compared both CH4 products using the Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) model, in situ profiles (range extended using CAMS model data), and ground-based Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) remote-sensing measurements. The average difference (in mtCH4) with respect to in situ profiles for LMD ranges between −0.3 and 10.9 ppb, while for RAL the XCH4 difference ranges between −4.6 and −1.6 ppb. The standard deviation (SD) of the observed differences between in situ measurements and RAL retrievals is 14.1–21.9 ppb, which is consistently smaller than that between LMD retrievals and in situ measurements (15.2–30.6 ppb). By comparing with ground-based FTIR sites, the mean differences are within ±10 ppb for both RAL and LMD retrievals. However, the SD of the differences at the ground-based FTIR stations shows significantly lower values for RAL (11–15 ppb) than for LMD (about 25 ppb).The long-term trend and seasonal cycles of CH4 derived from the LMD and RAL products are further investigated and discussed. The seasonal variation in XCH4 derived from RAL is consistent with the seasonal variation observed by the ground-based FTIR measurements. However, the overall 2007–2015 XCH4 trend derived from RAL measurements is underestimated, if not adjusted, for an anomaly occurring on 16 May 2013 due to a L1 calibration change. For LMD, we see very good agreement at the (sub)tropics (<35° N–35° S) but notice deviations in the seasonal cycle (both in the amplitude and phase) and an underestimation of the long-term trend with respect to the RAL and reference data at higher-latitude sites."

Praju Kiliyanpilakkil;Xiaohua Pan,Increasing aerosol optical depth spatial and temporal  availability by merging datasets from geostationary  and sun-synchronous satellites,"In this study, for the first time, we combined aerosol data from six satellites using a unified algorithm. The global datasets are generated at a high spatial resolution of about 25 km with an interval of 30 min. The new datasets are compared against ground truth and verified. They will be useful for various applications such as air quality monitoring, climate research, pollution diurnal variability, long-range smoke and dust transport, and evaluation of regional and global models. 
 This comprehensive study analyzed aerosol products from six low-Earth orbit (LEO) and geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) sensors. LEO sensors like the MODerate resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and VIsible InfraRed Suite (VIIRS) provide one to two daily global measurements, while GEO sensors (Advanced Himawari Imager: AHI, Advanced Baseline Imager: ABI) offer high-frequency data (∼ 10 min) over specific regions. The combination of LEO and GEO capabilities offers expanded coverage of the global aerosol system if aerosol retrievals are applied consistently across all sensors and packaged in an easy-to-use product. The Dark Target aerosol retrieval algorithm was applied to the six sensors, and the resulting Level 2 aerosol optical depth (AOD) products were gridded and merged into a Level 3 quarter-degree latitude–longitude grid with a 30 min temporal resolution, providing the necessary consistency and packaging. Validation of this packaged Level 3 AOD product against Aerosol Robotics NETwork (AERONET) measurements across global locations showcased the merged product's robustness with a correlation coefficient of 0.83, revealing a global mean bias of approximately ±0.05, with 65.5 % of retrievals falling within an expected uncertainty range, underlining the reliability of the dataset. The new gridded Level 3 dataset significantly improved daily global coverage to nearly 45 %, overcoming the limitations of individual sensors, which typically range from 12 % to 25 %. Furthermore, this merged dataset approximates the diurnal cycle of AOD observed by AERONET, thus offering insights into diurnal signatures retrieved elsewhere. The resulting dataset's high spatiotemporal resolution and improved global coverage, especially in regions covered by GEO sensors (Americas and Asia), make it a valuable tool for diverse applications. Tracking aerosol transport from phenomena like wildfires and dust storms is gaining precision, enabling enhanced air quality forecasting and hindcasting. Additionally, the study positions the merged dataset as a significant asset for evaluating and intercomparing regional or global model simulations, which was previously unattainable in such a gridded format. The dataset and fusion framework layout in this study have the potential to include data from recently (future) launched other GEO (FCI, AMI) and LEO (PACE, VIIRS-JPSS) sensors."

Kambhammettu​​​​​​​,The role of time averaging of eddy covariance fluxes on water use efficiency dynamics of maize,"This study investigates the role of the averaging period of eddy covariance fluxes on the energy balance ratio and further propagation into water use efficiency dynamics. Application was demonstrated on a maize field considering EC flux data. We found that the time averages of EC fluxes that yield the most effective EBR are at 45 and 60 min. The 30 min averaging period was insufficient to capture low-frequency fluxes. Time averaging of EC fluxes needs to be performed based on crop growth stage. 
 Direct measurement of carbon and water fluxes at high frequencies make eddy covariance (EC) the technique most preferred to characterize water use efficiency (WUE). However, reliability of EC fluxes largely hinges on the energy balance ratio (EBR) and inclusion of low-frequency fluxes. This study is aimed at investigating the role of the averaging period in representing EC fluxes and its propagation into WUE dynamics. Carbon and water fluxes were monitored in a drip-irrigated maize field at 10 Hz frequency and were averaged over 1, 5, 10, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 120 min, considering daytime unstable conditions. The optimal averaging period to simulate WUE fluxes for each growth stage is obtained by considering cumulative frequency (Ogive) curves. A clear departure of EBR from unity was observed during the dough and maturity stages of the crop due to ignorance of canopy heat storage, low-frequency flux losses, and an inadequate averaging period. Deviations in representing water (carbon) fluxes relative to the conventional 30 min average are within ±3 % (±10 %) for 10–120 min averaging and beyond ±3 % (±10 %) for other time averages. Ogive plots show that the optimal averaging period to represent carbon, water, and WUE fluxes is 15–30 min for the sixth leaf and silking stages and is 45–60 min for the dough and maturity stages. Dynamics of WUE considering optimal averaging periods are in the range of μ ± σ: 1.49 ± 0.95, 1.37 ± 0.74, 1.39 ± 0.79, and 3.06 ± 0.69 µmol mmol−1 for the sixth leaf, silking, dough, and maturity stages, respectively. The error in representing WUE by conventional 30 min averaging is marginal (< 1.5 %) throughout the crop period except for the dough stage (12.12 %). We conclude that the conventional 30 min averaging of EC fluxes is not appropriate for representing WUE throughout the crop period. Our findings can help to develop efficient water management strategies by accurately characterizing WUE fluxes from the EC measurements."

These data are presented here and made publicly available on the NASA Physical Oceanography Distributed Active Archive Center (PO.DAAC), along with code to manipulate the data and generate the figures presented herein. 
 As our planet warms, Arctic sea ice coverage continues to decline, resulting in complex feedbacks with the climate system. The core objective of NASA's Salinity and Stratification at the Sea Ice Edge (SASSIE) mission is to understand how ocean salinity and near-surface stratification affect upper-ocean heat content and thus sea ice freeze and melt. SASSIE specifically focuses on the formation of Arctic Sea ice in autumn. The SASSIE field campaign in 2022 collected detailed observations of upper-ocean properties and meteorology near the sea ice edge in the Beaufort Sea using ship-based and piloted and drifting assets. The observations collected during SASSIE include vertical profiles of stratification up to the sea surface, air–sea fluxes, and ancillary measurements that are being used to better understand the role of salinity in coupled Arctic air–sea–ice processes. This publication provides a detailed overview of the activities during the 2022 SASSIE campaign and presents the publicly available datasets generated by this mission (available at https://podaac.jpl.nasa.gov/SASSIE, last access: 29 May 2024; DOIs for individual datasets in the “Data availability” section), introducing an accompanying repository that highlights the numerical routines used to generate the figures shown in this work."

 A newly available radiative flux dataset specifically designed to enable the evaluation of the diurnal cycle in top-of-atmosphere (TOA) fluxes as captured by climate and Earth system models is presented. Observations over the period 2007–2012 made by the Geostationary Earth Radiation Budget (GERB) instrument are used to derive monthly hourly mean outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and reflected shortwave (RSW) fluxes on a regular 1° latitude–longitude grid covering approximately 60° N–60° S and 60° E–60° W. The impact of missing data is evaluated in detail, and a data-filling solution is implemented using estimates of broadband fluxes from the Spinning Enhanced Visible and Infrared Imager flying on the same Meteosat platform, scaled to the GERB observations. This relatively simple approach is shown to deliver an approximate improvement by a factor of 10 in both the bias caused by missing data and the associated variability in the error. To demonstrate the utility of this V1.1 filled GERB Observations for Climate Model Intercomparison Projects (Obs4MIPs) dataset, comparisons are made to radiative fluxes from two climate configurations of the Hadley Centre's Global Environmental Model: HadGEM3-GC3.1 and HadGEM3-GC5.0. Focusing on marine stratocumulus and deep convective cloud regimes, diurnally resolved comparisons between the models and observations highlight discrepancies between the model configurations in terms of their ability to capture the diurnal amplitude and the phase in TOA fluxes, details that cannot be diagnosed by comparisons at lower temporal resolutions. For these cloud regimes the GC5.0 configuration shows improved fidelity to the observations relative to GC3.1, although notable differences remain. The V1.1 filled GERB Obs4MIPs monthly hourly TOA fluxes are available from the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis, with the OLR fluxes accessible at https://doi.org/10.5285/90148d9b1f1c40f1ac40152957e25467 (Bantges et al., 2023a) and the RSW fluxes accessible at https://doi.org/10.5285/57821b58804945deaf4cdde278563ec2 (Bantges et al., 2023b)."

While evaluating recent developments in EC-Earth3-AerChem, this study aims to understand the extent to which the Twomey effect manifests itself at larger scales. We find a reduction in the warm bias over the Southern Ocean due to model improvements. While we see footprints of the Twomey effect at larger scales, the negative relationship between cloud droplet number and liquid water drives the shortwave radiative effect. 
 Given the importance of aerosols and clouds and their interactions in the climate system, it is imperative that the global Earth system models accurately represent processes associated with them. This is an important prerequisite if we are to narrow the uncertainties in future climate projections. In practice, this means that continuous model evaluations and improvements grounded in observations are necessary. Numerous studies in the past few decades have shown both the usability and the limitations of utilizing satellite-based observations in understanding and evaluating aerosol–cloud interactions, particularly under varying meteorological and satellite sensor sensitivity paradigms. Furthermore, the vast range of spatio-temporal scales at which aerosol and cloud processes occur adds another dimension to the challenges faced when evaluating climate models.In this context, the aim of this study is two-fold. (1) We evaluate the most recent, significant changes in the representation of aerosol and cloud processes implemented in the EC-Earth3-AerChem model in the framework of the EU project FORCeS compared with its previous CMIP6 version (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6; https://pcmdi.llnl.gov/CMIP6/, last access: 13 February 2019). We focus particularly on evaluating cloud physical properties and radiative effects, wherever possible, using a satellite simulator. We report on the overall improvements in the EC-Earth3-AerChem model. In particular, the strong warm bias chronically seen over the Southern Ocean is reduced significantly. (2) A statistical, maximum covariance analysis is carried out between aerosol optical depth (AOD) and cloud droplet (CD) effective radius based on the recent EC-Earth3-AerChem/FORCeS simulation to understand to what extent the Twomey effect can manifest itself in the larger spatio-temporal scales. We focus on the three oceanic low-level cloud regimes that are important due to their strong net cooling effect and where pollution outflow from the nearby continent is simultaneously pervasive. We report that the statistical covariability between AOD and CD effective radius is indeed dominantly visible even at the climate scale when the aerosol amount and composition are favourably preconditioned to allow for aerosol–cloud interactions. Despite this strong covariability, our analysis shows a strong cooling/warming in shortwave cloud radiative effects at the top of the atmosphere in our study regions associated with an increase/decrease in CD effective radius. This cooling/warming can be attributed to the increase/decrease in low cloud fraction, in line with previous observational studies."

This study investigated the generational recruitment of microorganisms in different root niches of Vetiveria zizanioides (V. zizanioides) under arsenic (As) and antimony (Sb) stress. The V. zizanioides was cultivated in As- and Sb-cocontaminated mine soils (MS) and artificial pollution soils (PS) over two generations in controlled conditions. The root-associated microbial communities were analyzed through 16S rRNA, arsC, and aioA gene amplicon and metagenomics sequencing. V. zizanioides accumulated higher As(III) and Sb(III) in its endosphere in MS in the second generation, while its physiological indices in MS were better than those observed in PS. SourceTracker analysis revealed that V. zizanioides in MS recruited As(V)- and Sb(V)-reducing microorganisms (e.g., Sphingomonales and Rhodospirillaceae) into the rhizoplane and endosphere. Metagenomics analysis further confirmed that these recruited microorganisms carrying genes encoding arsenate reductases with diverse carbohydrate degradation abilities were enriched in the rhizoplane and endosphere, suggesting their potential to reduce As(V) and Sb(V) and to decompose root exudates (e.g., xylan and starch). These findings reveal that V. zizanioides selectively recruits As- and Sb-reducing microorganisms to mitigate As–Sb cocontamination during the generational growth, providing insights into novel strategies for enhancing phytoremediation of metalloid-metal contaminants."

However, this can generate Hg-rich surfaces that facilitate microbial production of methylmercury (MeHg), a potent, bioaccumulative neurotoxin. Herein, we prove the concept that the risk of mercury methylation can be effectively minimized by adding sulfur-intercalated layered double hydroxide (S-LDH) to Hg-contaminated soils. Hg bound to S-LDH has minimal methylation potential when incubated with model methylating bacteria Pseudodesulfovibrio mercurii ND132 and Geobacter sulfurreducens PCA. With a combination of spectroscopic and microscopic evidence, as well as theoretical calculations, we confirm that dissolved Hg(II) tends to enter the interlayers of S-LDH to bind to the sulfur groups intercalated within, leading to the formation of nanoscale metacinnabar (β-HgS). This not only physically blocks the contact of methylating microorganisms but also inhibits secondary release of bound mercury in the presence of strong binding ligands in porewater. This study highlights the promising concept of in situ risk reduction of heavy metal contamination by inducing precipitation within (nano)confined domains, achieving a sustainable outcome of enhanced removal and reduced bioaccessibility for pollutants that may otherwise be bioavailable in the form of nanoprecipitates."

What remains elusive is how such metabolic constraints respond to dynamic flooding and drainage cycles characteristic of floodplain soils. Here we show that microbial depolymerization and respiration of organic compounds, two rate-limiting steps in decomposition, vary spatially and temporally with seasonal flooding of mountainous floodplain soils (Gothic, Colorado, USA). Combining metabolomics and -proteomics, we found a lower abundance of oxidative enzymes during flooding coincided with the accumulation of aromatic, high-molecular weight compounds, particularly in surface soils. In subsurface soils, we found that a lower oxidation state of carbon coincided with a greater abundance of chemically reduced, energetically less favorable low-molecular weight metabolites, irrespective of flooding condition. Our results suggest that seasonal flooding temporarily constrains oxidative depolymerization of larger, potentially plant-derived compounds in surface soils; in contrast, energetic constraints on microbial respiration persist in more reducing subsurface soils regardless of flooding. Our work underscores that the potential vulnerability of these distinct anaerobic carbon storage mechanisms to changing flooding dynamics should be considered, particularly as climate change  shifts both the frequency and extent of flooding in floodplains globally."

Benthic fluxes in these extreme habitats may enrich seawater with toxic metals such as mercury (Hg). We asked whether this phenomenon may lead to Hg accumulation in elasmobranchs. We thus analyzed total Hg (THg) in muscle, liver, and kidney tissues of oviparous Galeus melastomus catsharks and their embryos, which aggregate in vast numbers near deep-sea brine pools in the southeastern Mediterranean Sea. These Hg-rich brines (≤238 ng L–1) are a likely liable geogenic Hg source in this nursery. Shark tissues carried substantial THg [2.7 μg (g of wet weight)−1, median], and extreme values were found in kidneys [≤26.7 μg (g of wet weight)−1], likely due to environmental uptake. Increased THg in embryos [0.64 ± 0.31 μg (g of wet weight)−1] implies substantial maternal offloading (∼20%).

This study examines how surface ozone is impacted by local circulations spatially and temporally under different temperature scenarios (all summer days, hot summer days, and extreme heat days) with the help of cluster‐based meteorological conditions during the summertime of 2017–2019. The most polluted days are found to be highly associated with hot sea breeze days with weak background flow. When sea breeze development in the New York Bight is delayed and its penetration north is intercepted by the dominant westerlies during hot summer days, daily maximum 8‐hr average ozone (DMA8) in some ozone hot spots of New York City (NYC) and the south shore of Connecticut (CT) typically drops 9–10 ppb under comparable temperature levels. The average regional decrease of DMA8 for NYC and coastal CT is 6.7 and 8.3 ppb, respectively. Furthermore, we conclude that a change in early morning meridional wind direction is the most critical meteorological characteristic in controlling sea breeze onset type and helping modulate ozone exceedances in the region during extreme hot days when ozone exceedances are expected to be very common.

The median estimated aggregation efficiency is approximately 0.15 with a relatively narrow interquartile range that spans from 0.1 to just over 0.2. Values of optimized aggregation efficiencies are nearly independent of the assumed gamma distribution shape parameter. These results are used to derive temperature‐dependent, climatological steady‐state relations for vertical profiles of Nt, Dm, and liquid‐equivalent snowfall rates.

Here, the authors examine evolutionary convergence in the inner ear morphology of Afrotheria species and similar, non-Afrotheria analogue species, finding unexpectedly high evolvability. 
 Evolutionary convergence in distantly related species is among the most convincing evidence of adaptive evolution. The mammalian ear, responsible for balance and hearing, is not only characterised by its spectacular evolutionary incorporation of several bones of the jaw, it also varies considerably in shape across modern mammals. Using a multivariate approach, we show that in Afrotheria, a monophyletic clade with morphologically and ecologically highly disparate species, inner ear shape has evolved similar adaptations as in non-afrotherian mammals. We identify four eco-morphological trait combinations that underlie this convergence. The high evolvability of the mammalian ear is surprising: Nowhere else in the skeleton are different functional units so close together; it includes the smallest bones of the skeleton, encapsulated within the densest bone. We suggest that this evolvability is a direct consequence of the increased genetic and developmental complexity of the mammalian ear compared to other vertebrates. The inner ear is responsible for hearing and balance control. Here, the authors examine evolutionary convergence in the inner ear morphology of Afrotheria species and similar, non-Afrotheria analogue species, finding unexpectedly high evolvability."

Here, the authors report reservoir computing with magnetic skyrmions able to detect millisecond time-scale hand gestures, matching software neural networks’ performance. 
 Physical reservoir computing leverages the dynamical properties of complex physical systems to process information efficiently, significantly reducing training efforts and energy consumption. Magnetic skyrmions, topological spin textures, are promising candidates for reservoir computing systems due to their enhanced stability, non-linear interactions and low-power manipulation. Traditional spin-based reservoir computing has been limited to quasi-static detection or real-world data must be rescaled to the intrinsic timescale of the reservoir. We address this challenge by time-multiplexed skyrmion reservoir computing, that allows for aligning the reservoir’s intrinsic timescales to real-world temporal patterns. Using millisecond-scale hand gestures recorded with Range-Doppler radar, we feed voltage excitations directly into our device and detect the skyrmion trajectory evolution. This method scales down to the nanometer level and demonstrates competitive or superior performance compared to energy-intensive software-based neural networks. Our hardware approach’s key advantage is its ability to integrate sensor data in real-time without temporal rescaling, enabling numerous applications.

 Poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene):polystyrene sulfonate (PEDOT:PSS), a successfully commercialized polymeric semiconductor material, has potential as a transparent electrode in flexible electronic devices, yet has insufficient conductivity. We present the synthesis, properties, and directed crystallization of the PEDOT:dodecyl sulfate (PEDOT:DS) film. Iron(III) dodecyl sulfate (Fe(DS)3) multi-lamellar vesicles (MLVs), a new growth template, are used to synthesize and direct the growth of the PEDOT:DS film via vapor-phase polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene to form huge PEDOT:DS co-crystal domains within the MLV superstructure. The polycrystalline film has metallic conductivity (avg. ~1.0 × 104 S cm−1), is highly transparent and mechanically durable yet flexible, and suitable for next-generation flexible electronics. These noteworthy properties are conferred by the MLV lamellar superstructure of Fe(DS)3, a selective oxidant and an efficient in situ dopant that enhances the film hydrophobicity and durability. Sophisticated MLV-type oxidants are foreseen to enable the synthesis of more conductive, transparent, robust, flexible, and water-stable polymer electrode materials in future.

Here, the authors determined the cryo-EM structures of VMAT2, providing a structural basis for understanding VMAT2- mediated vesicular transport of neurotransmitters. 
 Human vesicular monoamine transporter 2 (VMAT2), a member of the SLC18 family, plays a crucial role in regulating neurotransmitters in the brain by facilitating their uptake and storage within vesicles, preparing them for exocytotic release. Because of its central role in neurotransmitter signalling and neuroprotection, VMAT2 is a target for neurodegenerative diseases and movement disorders, with its inhibitor being used as therapeutics. Despite the importance of VMAT2 in pharmacophysiology, the molecular basis of VMAT2-mediated neurotransmitter transport and its inhibition remains unclear. Here we show the cryo-electron microscopy structure of VMAT2 in the substrate-free state, in complex with the neurotransmitter dopamine, and in complex with the inhibitor tetrabenazine. In addition to these structural determinations, monoamine uptake assays, mutational studies, and pKa value predictions were performed to characterize the dynamic changes in VMAT2 structure. These results provide a structural basis for understanding VMAT2-mediated vesicular transport of neurotransmitters and a platform for modulation of current inhibitor design.

Here, a global map of 3D canopy complexity modeled from spaceborne lidar reveals that highly complex forests are concentrated in the tropics, with significant variations observed across biomes. 
 Forest structural complexity is a key element of ecosystem functioning, impacting light environments, nutrient cycling, biodiversity, and habitat quality. Addressing the need for a comprehensive global assessment of actual forest structural complexity, we derive a near-global map of 3D canopy complexity using data from the GEDI spaceborne lidar mission. These data show that tropical forests harbor most of the high complexity observations, while less than 20% of temperate forests reached median levels of tropical complexity. Structural complexity in tropical forests is more strongly related to canopy attributes from lower and middle waveform layers, whereas in temperate forests upper and middle layers are more influential. Globally, forests exhibit robust scaling relationships between complexity and canopy height, but these vary geographically and by biome. Our results offer insights into the spatial distribution of forest structural complexity and emphasize the importance of considering biome-specific and fine-scale variations for ecological research and management applications. The GEDI Waveform Structural Complexity Index data product, derived from our analyses, provides researchers and conservationists with a single, easily interpretable metric by combining various aspects of canopy structure.

Seismic noise correlations yield a reflection matrix whose physics-based post-processing allows an optimized focusing through volcano heterogeneities. 
 Volcanic eruptions necessitate precise monitoring of magma pressure and inflation for improved forecasting. Understanding deep magma storage is crucial for hazard assessment, yet imaging these systems is challenging due to complex heterogeneities that disrupt standard seismic migration techniques. Here we map the magmatic and hydrothermal system of the La Soufrière volcano in Guadeloupe by analyzing seismic noise data from a sparse geophone array under a matrix formalism. Seismic noise interferometry provides a reflection matrix containing the signature of echoes from deep heterogeneities. Using wave correlations resistant to disorder, matrix imaging successfully unscrambles wave distortions, revealing La Soufrière’s internal structure down to 10 km with 100 m resolution. This method surpasses the diffraction limit imposed by geophone array aperture, providing crucial data for modeling and high-resolution monitoring. We see matrix imaging as a revolutionary tool for understanding volcanic systems and enhancing observatories’ abilities to monitor dynamics and forecast eruptions.
