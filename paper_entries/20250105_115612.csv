Presently, adverse health effects of ambient SBTEX exposure in highly polluted regions, such as the Gulf States, must be evaluated. Epidemiologists, however, are limited by inadequate estimates of ambient SBTEX. Using Bayesian Maximum Entropy, SBTEX estimation methods of varying resource intensity were evaluated, including simple kriging (least intense), incorporation of observational and emissions data trends (moderately intense), and data fusion of observed and Comprehensive Air quality Model with extensions (CAMx) data (most intense). Generally, as resource intensity increased, so did SBTEX estimation performance, where SBTEX Spearman R values increased by 0.48 on average from the least to most intense methods. Data fusion of observed and CAMx data was identified as the best ambient SBTEX estimation method in the Gulf States. Exposure estimates revealed that Gulf States residences within commuting distance of high industrial activity experienced 1.64 times higher 97.5th percentile daily exposures to SBTEX on average than those living in less industrialized areas, which could contribute to total occupational and ambient exposure disparities. Furthermore, ambient benzene exposure was greater than the acceptable one-in-a-million excess cancer risk threshold for 75% of estimated residence locations in the Gulf States."

Edwards,Visualization of Syntrophic Benzene-Fermenting Desulfobacterota ORM2 in a Methanogenic Enrichment Culture Using Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization,"Benzene degradation under anoxic conditions was first reported more than 25 years ago; however, the activation mechanism in the absence of oxygen remains elusive. Progress has been hindered by the difficulty in cultivating anaerobic benzene-degrading enrichment cultures. Our laboratory has sustained a methanogenic enrichment culture harboring Desulfobacterota ORM2, a benzene fermenter distinct from any known genus but related to other known or predicted benzene degraders. ORM2’s slow doubling time (∼30 days) and extended lag phase after inoculation complicate its study. We developed a fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) probe for ORM2, revealing rod-shaped cells of variable length that tend to cluster with other organisms, particularly methanogens. Microscopy and genomic evidence suggest that ORM2 may produce extracellular polymeric substances, facilitating cell aggregation and possibly consuming energy that contributes to the lag phase. Interestingly, higher benzene concentrations (90–120 mg/L) appeared to reduce cell aggregation. This study visualized the cells of Desulfobacterota ORM2 within a methanogenic community, offering insights into spatial organization and potential strategies to enhance its growth rate."

N. Anderson;Xinbin Feng,Novel Insights into Hg0 Oxidation in Rice Leaf: Catalase Functions and Transcriptome Responses,"Rice leaves can assimilate atmospheric mercury (Hg0), which is accumulated by grains and causes health risks to rice consumers. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying Hg0 assimilation in rice leaves remain poorly understood. Here, we investigated catalase’s (CAT) function in Hg0 oxidation within rice leaves, as well as the Hg speciation and transcriptomic profiles of rice leaves exposed to Hg0. The inactivation of catalase reduced Hg0 oxidation by 91% in the leaf homogenate and the Hg0 oxidation rate increased along with CAT activity, showing the CAT’s function in Hg0 oxidation. Hg0 was converted to Hg(cysteine)2 complexes in the leaf. Transcriptomic results revealed that the expression levels of both OsCATA and OsCATB (catalase-encoding genes) increased with Hg concentration, suggesting the involvement of catalase-related molecular network in Hg0 oxidation. Upstream transcription factors, including NAC (NAM-no apical meristem, ATAF-Arabidopsis transcription activation factor, and CUC-cup-shaped cotyledon), and ethylene-responsive transcription factor, are likely involved in catalase expression. Genes related to cysteine metabolism and amino acid transport appeared to regulate Hg accumulation. Our findings demonstrate the important function of catalase in Hg0 oxidation within rice and are fundamental for developing genetically modified rice cultivars to minimize human Hg exposure health risks."

Sensitivity to this toxicant is highly variable across fish species and life stages. With environmental concentrations meeting or exceeding toxicity thresholds in sensitive fishes, the potential for ecologically relevant effects is significant. There is currently no data regarding the sensitivity of lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) to 6PPD-Q. As early life stages of fishes are typically more sensitive than adults, the goal of this study was to evaluate the acute and subchronic toxicity of 6PPD-Q to early life stage lake trout. Alevins exposed from hatch until 45 days posthatch (dph) to time-weighted average 6PPD-Q concentrations ranging from 0.22 to 13.5 μg/L exhibited a 45 day median lethal dose (LC50) of 0.39 μg/L. Deformities throughout growth were observed, with a unique pooling of blood observed in the caudal fin and eye. A subsequent acute study with exogenously feeding lake trout fry determined a 96 h LC50 of 0.50 μg/L. From this study we can conclude that lake trout alevins and exogenously feeding fry are sensitive to 6PPD-Q, which underscores the relevance of this chemical to inland freshwater ecosystems."

Mayhew and Jessica D. Haskins,Potential Air Quality Side-Effects of Emitting H2O2 to Enhance Methane Oxidation as a Climate Solution,"Methane (CH4) is a greenhouse gas with a global warming potential 81.2 times higher than carbon dioxide (CO2). The intentional emission of oxidants into the atmosphere has been proposed as a geoengineering solution to accelerate the oxidation of CH4 to CO2, thereby reducing surface warming. However, there has been little consideration for competing atmospheric oxidation pathways that will reduce CH4 oxidation efficiencies and result in the formation of secondary pollutants such as ozone and particulate matter. Using a global chemical-transport model, we simulate a proposed technology to intentionally emit H2O2 into the atmosphere to elevate OH concentrations and enhance CH4 oxidation. We find that proposed emission rates of oxidants have minimal impacts on monthly average tropospheric ozone and particulate matter concentrations. However, competition for the oxidation of CH4 would necessitate widespread adoption of such technology to remove substantial concentrations of atmospheric CH4, which would in-turn cause considerable increases in regional winter-time particulate matter. Our work underscores the need to consider competing chemistry in evaluating the efficacy and side effects of proposals to enhance the atmospheric oxidation of CH4 as a climate solution."

However, the meteorological feedback mechanisms affecting smoke dispersion and wildfire emissions on a synoptic scale remain unclear. This study focused on the largest wildfires occurring between December 25, 2019 and January 10, 2020, under the enhanced subtropical high, when the double peak in wildfire evolution was favored by sustained low humidity and two synchronous increases in temperature and wind. Based on the coupled atmospheric chemical transport model, we revealed an abnormal downdraft and a lowered planetary boundary layer over southeastern Australia, caused by the radiative cooling effects (exceeding −100 W m–2 at surface) of carbonaceous aerosols (CAs) from wildfires. These changes hindered the smoke dispersion and increased the PM2.5 concentration by ∼27.8%. By contrast, the low-level anomalous cyclonic circulation induced by CAs brought more water vapor toward the fire zone. This, combined with surface cooling and low wind speeds, suppressed wildfire emissions, thereby reducing PM2.5 concentration by ∼11.6%. These findings highlight the critical role of aerosol-radiation interaction in wildfire behavior."

The vehicle was tested on routes in the South Coast Air Basin (SCAB) of California, representative of typical goods movement operation between the ports to warehouses and logistic centers with a mixture of urban and highway driving, as well as elevation change. We evaluated emissions during normal vehicle operation and diesel particulate filter (DPF) active regeneration events. Results revealed small variations in particle emissions between the routes, with particles below 23 nm and even 10 nm being abundant in the exhaust. Both total and solid particle number emissions were about 3 to 246 times higher during DPF regeneration compared to normal vehicle operation, with higher fractions of sub-10 nm solid particles. We showed that typical daily routes for goods movement operation in SCAB, especially the more urban routes, mostly occurred within disadvantaged communities, with minority populations and high indices for poverty, unemployment, and poor education. Our results indicated the vehicles spent a higher fraction of their total time within these areas at low speed and idling conditions, resulting in disproportionately higher exposures to ultrafine particles."

Surfactant composition, fraction of total particle mass, surface tension minimums, and CMC values of organics extracted from fresh and aged BBA produced using fuel beds from Georgia ecoregions (Piedmont, Coastal Plain, and Blue Ridge) and with fuel moisture contents representative of prescribed fires or drought-induced wildfires were measured using high resolution mass spectrometry, UV–vis spectroscopy, and pendant drop tensiometry. Surface tension minimums of organics extracted from all BBA were low (<45 mN m–1), and surfactants were ∼2% of the total particle mass. The surfactant fraction was tied to combustion conditions, with the highest fractions present in BBA produced from the most efficient (highest temperature) combustion. Aging of BBA using a potential aerosol mass oxidative flow reactor resulted in an increase in the surfactant fractions of total BBA mass. The dependence of the surfactant fraction on combustion conditions may have implications for the microphysics of BBA from wildfires and prescribed fires."

Here, we highlight a previously overlooked methodological issue with techniques employing a re-equilibration step and present an improved experiment based on selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). Specifically, the overlooked aspect of these techniques is unaccounted for VOC loss from the sample during the headspace flushing step. Diffusion modeling indicates that this loss can be significant even when the flushing time is a fraction of the diffusion time. To experimentally demonstrate the impact of mass loss during flushing, we compare the initial concentrations of several volatile methyl siloxanes in Sylgard 184 obtained from multiple headspace extraction (MHE) and a real-time extraction method: TD-SIFT-MS. We find that the TD-SIFT-MS method reports higher c0 values than MHE with a lower temperature dependence. A technique like TD-SIFT-MS is advantageous because it does not require numerous lengthy equilibration steps and offers full awareness of the system dynamics over the course of the experiment."

This study investigates the impact of human‐induced climate change on circulation patterns conducive to extreme precipitation over the Central Plains Urban Agglomeration in China, a region frequently experiencing severe flooding and home to a dense population with significant economic and agricultural activities. Using advanced techniques such as deep learning and optimal fingerprinting, this study identifies and analyzes the physical mechanisms behind the extreme precipitation. The findings reveal that greenhouse gas emissions play a pivotal role in altering atmospheric circulation patterns, specifically promoting the westward extension of western North Pacific subtropical high and northwestward shift of South Asian High, along with tropical cyclones.

The scarcity and brevity of observations, including in situ observations and weather station data, limit our understanding of the Karakoram anomaly. Here, we present the stable water isotopes and snow accumulation records of Karakoram's first shallow ice core, covering 1998 to 2018. The decreased δ18O suggests an overall cooling trend in the Karakoram region for the early 21st century. In contrast, snow accumulation shows a significant increasing trend, which reveals that the Karakoram glacier has been getting more and more precipitation supplies recently. Using correlation field analysis and a backward trajectory model, we find that the decreased temperature and increased precipitation in the Karakoram are related to weakening westerlies. The northward shift of westerlies will transport colder water vapor from the North Atlantic to Karakoram, decreasing temperature and increasing precipitation in Karakoram. Our results indicated a trend of temperature cooling and precipitation increase trend in the Karakoram related to the weakened westerlies and the North Atlantic, which might explain the Karakoram anomaly that occurred in the Pamir‐Karakoram‐Kunlun region under the present climate change background.

In recent years, advanced microwave sounders have been proposed to be onboard future CubeSats that are less expensive than traditional satellites, providing unprecedented rapid‐update and low‐earth‐orbit microwave observations that can follow the evolution of the typhoon and convective weather systems. In this study, the potential values of assimilating future CubeSat constellation microwave radiances in clear‐sky condition for regional NWP are preliminarily assessed with observing system simulation experiments using the convection‐permitting 4DEnVar for the prediction of typhoon “Infa” and its associated “7.20” heavy rainfall event that occurred in China in July 2021. This constellation is assumed to include 12 CubeSats equipped with microwave sounders obtaining radiances sensitive to water vapor and temperature. The results show the CubeSat constellation radiances demonstrate positive impacts on the analyses and forecasts of typhoon's track, intensity, precipitation, and dynamical conditions.

Conventional radiative cooling strategies, such as cool roofs with high albedo, lead to undesired winter cooling and increased space heating demand for cities with cold winters, a phenomenon known as heating energy penalty. A novel roof coating with high albedo and temperature‐adaptive emissivity (TAE)—low emissivity during cold conditions and high emissivity during hot conditions—has the potential to mitigate winter heating energy penalty. In this study, we implement this roof coating in a global climate model to evaluate its impact on air temperature and building energy demand for space heating and cooling in global cities. Adopting roofs with TAE increases global urban air temperature by up to +0.54°C in the winter (99th percentile; mean change +0.16°C) but has negligible effects on summer urban air temperature (mean change +0.05°C). Combining TAE with high albedo effectively provides summer cooling and does not increase building energy demand in the winter, particularly for mid‐latitude cities. Sensitivities of air temperature to changes in emissivity and albedo are associated with local “apparent” net longwave radiation and incoming solar radiation, respectively. We propose a simple parameterization of air temperature responses to emissivity and albedo to facilitate the development of city‐specific radiative mitigation strategies. This study emphasizes the necessity of developing mitigation approaches specific to local cloudiness."

Here, the authors report a direct correlation between device lifetime and Faradaic yield for oxidative degradation of emitter molecules. 
 1,4-Azaborine-based arenes are promising electroluminescent emitters with thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF), offering narrow emission spectra and high quantum yields due to a multi-resonance (MR) effect. However, their practical application is constrained by their limited operational stability. This study investigates the degradation mechanism of MR-TADF molecules. Electroluminescent devices incorporating these compounds display varied operational lifetimes, uncorrelated with excitonic stability or external quantum efficiency roll-off. Bulk electrolysis reveals significant instability in the radical cationic forms of MR-TADF compounds, with device lifetime linked to the Faradaic yield of oxidation. Comprehensive chemical analyses corroborate that the degradation byproducts originated from intramolecular cyclization of radical cation, followed by hydrogen atom transfer. The mechanism is further supported by enhanced stability observed in a deuterated MR-TADF emitter, attributed to a secondary kinetic isotope effect. These findings provide insights into the stabilizing effects of deuteration and mechanism-driven strategies for designing MR-TADF compounds with improved operational longevity.

 Natural materials with highly oriented heterogeneous structures are often lightweight but strong, stiff but tough and durable. Such an integration of diverse incompatible mechanical properties is highly desired for man-made materials, especially weak hydrogels which are lack of high-precision structural design. Herein, we demonstrate the fabrication of hierarchically aligned heterogeneous hydrogels consisting of a compactly crosslinked sheath and an aligned porous core with alignments of nanofibrils at multi-scales by a sequential self-assembly assisted salting out method. The produced hydrogel offers ultrahigh mechanical properties among the reported hydrogels, elastomers and natural materials, including a toughness of 1031 MJ · m-3, strength of 55.3 MPa, strain of 3300%, stiffness of 6.8 MPa, fracture energy of 552.7 kJ · m-2 and fatigue threshold of 40.9 kJ · m-2.

 Prime Editing can rewrite genes in living cells by allowing point mutations, deletions, or insertion of small DNA sequences with high precision.

 The boundary between wet and arid climate zones in the Tethys Ocean remains challenging to trace, complicating our understanding of global aridification pattern during the Late Carboniferous to Early Permian transition. The North China Block (NCB), situated in the Tethys Ocean, underwent a transition from humid to arid climate during the Early Permian, providing a rare opportunity to trace this climate boundary across this region. Here, we present paleomagnetic evidence indicating that the NCB underwent rapid northward drift between 290 and 281 million years ago. The NCB’s movement from a tropical wet to a subtropical arid zone corresponds to a lithological change from coal-bearing to red-bed deposits, demonstrating tectonic drift into a subtropical arid zone as the main driver of aridification in the NCB during this period. This drift also delineates the wet–dry boundary over the Tethys Ocean, consistent with modern climatic zonation patterns.

 Identifying cell types and brain regions critical for psychiatric disorders and brain traits is essential for targeted neurobiological research. By integrating genomic insights from genome-wide association studies with a comprehensive single-cell transcriptomic atlas of the adult human brain, we prioritized specific neuronal clusters significantly enriched for the SNP-heritabilities for schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder along with intelligence, education, and neuroticism. Extrapolation of cell-type results to brain regions reveals the whole-brain impact of schizophrenia genetic risk, with subregions in the hippocampus and amygdala exhibiting the most significant enrichment of SNP-heritability. Using functional MRI connectivity, we further confirmed the significance of the central and lateral amygdala, hippocampal body, and prefrontal cortex in distinguishing schizophrenia cases from controls.

Here, the authors combine biochemistry, NMR, and cryo-EM to show that spontaneous base flipping drives specificity in double stranded RNA substrates. 
 Coronaviruses evade detection by the host immune system with the help of the endoribonuclease Nsp15, which regulates levels of viral double stranded RNA by cleaving 3′ of uridine (U). While prior structural data shows that to cleave double stranded RNA, Nsp15’s target U must be flipped out of the helix, it is not yet understood whether Nsp15 initiates flipping or captures spontaneously flipped bases. We address this gap by designing fluorinated double stranded RNA substrates that allow us to directly relate a U’s sequence context to both its tendency to spontaneously flip and its susceptibility to cleavage by Nsp15. Through a combination of nuclease assays, 19F NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and single particle cryo-EM, we determine that Nsp15 acts most efficiently on unpaired Us, particularly those that are already flipped. Across sequence contexts, we find Nsp15’s cleavage efficiency to be directly related to that U’s tendency to spontaneously flip. Overall, our findings unify previous characterizations of Nsp15’s cleavage preferences, and suggest that activity of Nsp15 during infection is partially driven by bulged or otherwise relatively accessible Us that appear at strategic positions in the viral RNA.

 In terms of safety and emergency response, identifying hazardous gaseous acid chemicals is crucial for ensuring effective evacuation and administering proper first aid. However, current studies struggle to distinguish between different acid vapors and remain in the early stages of development. In this study, we propose an on-site monitorable acid vapor decoder, MOF-808-EDTA-Cu, integrating the robust MOF-808 with Cu-EDTA, functioning as a proton-triggered colorimetric decoder that translates the anionic components of corrosive acids into visible colors. The sensor exhibits a cyan-to-yellow shift when exposed to HCl vapor and can visually differentiate various acidic vapors (HF, HBr, and HI) through unique color changes. Furthermore, the compatibility of the MOF-based sensor with multiple metal ions having atomic-level dispersion broadens its discrimination range, enabling the identification of six different colorless acid vapors within a single sensor domain. Additionally, by incorporating a flexible polymer, the MOF-808-EDTA-Cu has been successfully processed into a portable miniaturized acid sensor, exhibiting distinct color changes that can be easily monitored by the naked eye and camera sensors. This provides experimental validation as a practical sensor capable of on-site 24-hour monitoring in the real world. Identifying hazardous acid vapors is crucial for safety and emergency response.

 Given the significant environmental and health risks associated with near-surface nitrogen dioxide (NO2), machine learning is frequently employed to estimate near-surface NO2 concentrations (SNO2) from satellite-derived tropospheric NO2 column densities (CNO2). However, data-driven methods often face challenges in explaining the complex relationships between these variables. In this study, the correlation between CNO2 and SNO2 is examined using vertical profile observations from China’s MAX-DOAS network. Cloud cover and air convection substantially weaken (R = −0.68) and strengthen (R = 0.71) the CNO2-SNO2 correlation, respectively. Meteorological factors dominate the correlation (R2 = 0.58), which is 31% stronger in northern regions than in the southwest. Additionally, anthropogenic emissions impact SNO2, while topographical features shape regional climate patterns. At the Chongqing site, the negative impacts of unfavorable meteorological conditions, high emissions, and basin topography lead to significant contrasts and delays in daily CNO2 and SNO2 variations. This study enhances understanding of the spatial and temporal dynamics and influencing mechanisms of CNO2 and SNO2, supporting improved air quality assessments and pollution exposure evaluations."

 NASA's Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) satellite mission provides an unprecedented opportunity to monitor global surface soil moisture (SM). The retrieval of SMAP official SM product relies on the inversion of a zeroth-order τ-ω radiative transfer model constrained by climatological Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) derived vegetation optical depth (VOD) and constant surface roughness. However, NDVI climatology cannot capture vegetation variation in response to climate extremes and agricultural practices, which can cause non-negligible errors in SMAP SM products. To resolve this issue, we develop a new Dynamic Dual-Channel Algorithm (DDCA) by constraining the τ-ω model using VOD and surface roughness derived from the real-time dynamic NDVI observations acquired from MODIS and VIIRS, where surface roughness is estimated through the classic DCA with VOD determined via dynamic NDVI. Considering that NDVI is not a perfect proxy for VOD, its derived surface roughness may contain VOD information to some extent. To reduce uncertainties in surface roughness, four different parameterization schemes are considered, including daily-scale, monthly average, yearly average, and constant surface roughness. Validation results against in-situ measurements demonstrate that DDCA is typically superior to the SMAP baseline algorithm – Regularized Dual-Channel Algorithm (RDCA) – across different continents, land covers, and climates, especially when parameterized with surface roughness at relatively coarse time scales (i.e., monthly or annually), indicating that averaging daily surface roughness at monthly and yearly scales can effectively reduce its uncertainties. One exception is that daily-scale roughness works well for grassland, likely because NDVI can accurately approximate VOD in grassland and its derived surface roughness is of high quality. Further analysis demonstrates that the improvement of DDCA SM over the SMAP official SM (SMAP_L3_SMPE) is particularly remarkable in cases of drought and agricultural practices. Overall, these results highlight the necessity to account for accurate vegetation dynamics during SMAP SM retrieval."

 Inland waters comprise various aquatic systems, including rivers, lakes, lagoons, reservoirs, and others, and satellite data play a crucial role in providing holistic and dynamic observations of these complex ecosystems. However, available medium-spatial resolution satellite sensors, such as Sentinel-2 Multi-Spectral Instrument (MSI), are typically designed for land monitoring and lack suitable spectral bands and radiometric quality for water applications. This study developed a novel synthetic band generation method, called Sentinel-2/3 Synthetic Aquatic Reflectance Bands (S2/3Aqua), for computing eight 10-m synthetic spectral bands from multivariate regression analysis between Sentinel-2 MSI and Sentinel-3 OLCI image pair. Three multivariate regressor models, Multivariate Linear Regressor (MLR), Multivariate Quadratic Regressor (MQR), and Random Forest Regressor (RFR), were applied and assessed to replicate the Sentinel-3 spectral consistency on 10-m Sentinel-2 images. A cyanobacteria modeling was developed based on in-situ observations (n = 54), and we demonstrated, for the first time, the application of 10-m harmful algal bloom mapping over two eutrophic tropical urban reservoirs (Promissão and Billings, Brazil). Additionally, the generalization of S2/3Aqua was assessed by comparing its spectral signatures across different water optical types. Overall, the comparison between S2/3Aqua and Sentinel-3 bands achieved a mean absolute error of 6 % and a mean difference close to zero. We found that MLR exhibited a higher accuracy with in-situ observations (with a 28 % bias) and was more suitable than other tested models. S2/3Aqua also performed satisfactorily across all eight spectral bands, including at 620 and 681 nm, with a mean difference of less than 0.003 reflectance units. The cyanobacteria mapping showed a high level of agreement between S2/3Aqua and Sentinel-3 for low concentrations of Phycocyanin (less than 50 mg m−3), and S2/3Aqua effectively captured the spatial variability of narrower and smaller blooms. Finally, S2/3Aqua provides reliable synthetic spectral bands that can effectively be used in several aquatic system studies, including monitoring potentially harmful algal blooms."

 Accurately mapping urban functional zone (UFZ) provides crucial foundational geographic information services for urban sustainable development, territorial spatial planning, and public resource allocation. UFZs are blocks within urban environments that serve specific functions, typically comprising physical objects with specific spatial distribution patterns and semantic objects of various types. However, previous studies for identifying UFZs have focused on physical or semantic aspects of UFZs, overlooking the spatial relationships and connectivity among objects. Furthermore, few have leveraged the constructed graphs by heterogeneous geospatial data to identify functional zones by street block-based mapping units. To bridge this gap, we developed a graph-based multimodal data fusion framework (G2MF) to identify UFZs. It is a fully graph-based identification framework with a feature-level fusion strategy that integrates very high-resolution remote sensing images and point of interest data. Firstly, physical objects within a UFZ unit are classified using semantic segmentation technology; then, the two independent graph structures are constructed for both physical and semantic objects within the UFZ unit; finally, the graphs are input into the proposed graph-based multimodal fusion network for UFZ identification. Experimental results show that the proposed G2MF achieves an overall identification accuracy of 88.5 % on test data from four Chinese cities and also exhibits good generalization ability on test data with geographic isolation. This study not only promotes the development of automatic UFZ identification technology but also provides new directions and methodologies for future urban big data analysis.

10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107895,False,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文关注的是改进Budyko框架，用于更准确地预测单个流域的月度蒸散发量。它提出了一种新的Budyko框架解释，并与其他两种方法进行了比较，评估了其在全球520个主要流域和0.25°网格尺度上的性能。研究的核心在于水文模型的改进和水文循环过程的模拟，并没有直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,[],Hao Sun;Xingwang Wang;Yanping Qu;Juan Lyu;Hehe Cai;Xuejun Zhang,Interpretation of the Budyko framework for monthly evapotranspiration prediction of individual basins,"•A new interpretation of Budyko theory is proposed for individual basins at monthly scale •Moving average method maintains steady state of the proposed Budyko interpretation •New interpretation performs satisfactorily for global 520 major basins and grid cells •The interpretation considering double parameters is recommended for monthlyEprediction 
 The Budyko framework is widely used to investigate basin-scale water balance and has been extended from mean annual scale for multiple basins to monthly scale for an individual basin. However, this expanded application leads to some controversies regarding whether the aridity index and evaporation ratio vary synergistically along the Budyko curve under the unsteady state. To address this gap, a new interpretation of the Budyko framework was proposed and compared with two other Budyko-type equations: the Greve (a typical single-parameter equation) and the Du (a two-parameter equation requiring additional terrestrial water storage input) equations. The new interpretation defined as Du-MA, was derived from the initial Du form using the moving average (MA) method to maintain the steady state without the requirement of terrestrial water storage. The different methods were evaluated globally for 520 major basins and also at 0.25° grid scale using the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS) dataset. Overall, the Du-MA well characterized the aridity index trajectory of individual basins, with 79.8 % of basins achieving Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) >0.75, surpassing Greve (28.7 %) and Du (69.8 %). Additionally, the Du-MA equation also outperformed the Greve equation in evapotranspiration predictions at both the basin and grid scales. While if monthly terrestrial water storage were available, the Du equation was found to be an alternative method. In summary, the proposed interpretation keeps consistent with the original Budyko theory and is conveniently used to estimate monthly evapotranspiration for individual basins with available precipitation and potential evaporation data."

 Numerical prediction of warm-sector heavy precipitation under weak synoptic-scale forcing in South China remains a challenging problem. In this study, the simulation capabilities of four microphysics schemes (WSM6, Thompson, Thompson aerosol-aware, and Morrison) for the heavy rainfall event that occurred during 10–11 May 2022, which featured both a coastal warm-sector rain belt and an inland frontal rain belt, have been evaluated and improved by using polarimetric radar and 2DVDs. The results showed that four schemes effectively reproduced the coastal and inland heavy precipitation amounts but exhibited poor performance in describing raindrop size and number concentration, with noticeable differences among these schemes. Compared to observations, the microphysics schemes tended to produce raindrops with larger size and fewer number concentration. By incorporating the observed relationship between rainwater and generalized intercept parameter into the WSM6 scheme, the simulated raindrop size and number concentration were optimized with real-time diagnosis of raindrop intercept parameter. For the Thompson and Morrison double-moment schemes, modifying the diameter threshold parameter in raindrop self-collection process to enhance raindrop breakup efficiency was the most direct and effective method for improving simulation. Even though the impact of vertical wind shear on raindrop breakup was considered here, there remained a discrepancy between the simulated and observed raindrop sizes and number concentrations. Therefore, the reasons for adjusting this threshold parameter were still unclear. Additionally, using ECMWF-CAMS aerosol reanalysis data as input for Thompson aerosol-aware scheme showed a better representation of aerosol spatial distribution, thereby improving precipitation distribution, especially for the inland rain belt."

 This study conducted WRF simulations of Typhoon In-Fa (2021), which caused significant damage to the eastern China in 2021, to investigate how cloud vertical structure may affect the development of a tropical cyclone (TC). Specifically, the TC was simulated using two cloud-fraction schemes: the default Xu-Randall (XR) scheme and a newly-developed neural Network-based Scale-Adaptive (NSA) scheme. Results show that the NSA scheme simulates a more eastward TC track than the XR scheme for both the pre-landfall and landfall phases and is closer to the observation. The underlying mechanisms differ between the two phases and are closely associated with the TC asymmetric structure and phase evolution. First, the XR scheme simulates larger cloud fractions than the NSA scheme across the entire TC, yielding a stronger longwave cloud radiative effect (LWCRE). This tends to increase the instability and invigorates the convection. Second, the relatively strong convections in the northeast quadrant of the TC cause a horizontally-distributed cloud layer, where the NSA scheme simulates a less-tilted cloud structure and a more pronounced horizontal gradient of LWCRE, which can amplify the secondary circulation.During the pre-landfall phase, the effects of increased instability and enhanced secondary circulation in the northeast quadrant tend to counterbalance each other, making the instability effect in the southwest quadrant dominate changes of the TC track. This increases the cloud ice water path (IWP) and latent heating in the west of the TC in the XR simulation, shifting the TC track westward. During the landfall phase, cloud fraction decreases throughout the TC, diminishing the instability effect and allowing the secondary circulation effect in the northeast quadrant to become dominant. This increases the IWP and latent heating in the east of the TC in the NSA simulation, shifting the TC track eastward."

 This paper analyses and characterizes snowfall events in one of the hottest, most arid areas in continental Europe. Our information was taken from a snowfall database that was partly our own, covering a period of over 100 years. The FLEXTRA model of air-mass back-trajectories was applied together with our own subjective synoptic classification. Data from the ECMWF Reanalysis of the 20th Century (ERA20C) were used for the calculation and clustering of the back-trajectories and the establishment of synoptic weather types. The snowfall events were classified into 8 synoptic types and 4 first-level and 8 s-level back-trajectories. The meteorological scenario for these extreme events was marked by mixed structures at altitude with a main NE/SW axis and dipoles on the surface dominated by powerful North Atlantic anti-cyclones and back-trajectories from the NE at the three levels analysed (500, 1500 and 5000 m.a.s.l.)."

 Detailed characterization of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and mixing layer height (MLH) is essential for gaining insights into air quality, pollutant dispersion, and the dynamics of the lower atmosphere. This research involves MLH from four atmospheric models—ERA5 (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5), Reanalysis, GDAS (Global Data Assimilation System), and GFS (Global Forecast System), representing diverse approaches commonly applied in atmospheric research, mainly in air quality studies. The intercomparison analyzes the simulated MLH from the models, comparing them with observations from radiosondes and ceilometers to capture diurnal and seasonal variations in boundary layer dynamics. The study reveals significant diurnal and seasonal variations, with a close alignment between ERA5 boundary layer and ceilometer mixing layer observations, Reanalysis consistently underestimating MLH altitude, and both GFS and GDAS models demonstrating reasonable diurnal cycles of MLH. During summer, all models underestimate MLH compared to ceilometer observations by 34–42 %, while in winter, overestimation relative to ceilometer observations ranges from 11 to 20 %. Factors contributing to this discrepancy, including meteorological variables and synoptic situations, were examined. GFS and GDAS tend to overestimate global radiation after 12:00 but underestimate MLH, while ERA5 consistently underestimated both radiation and MLH. Dependence in agreement between models and ceilometer observations was also observed for various synoptic situations. The interconnected nature of atmospheric stability and turbulence, highlighted by Richardson number analysis, further emphasizes the importance of understanding turbulence patterns for accurate MLH predictions."
