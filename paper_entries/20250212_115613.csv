10.1088/1748-9326/ada971,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要研究直接空气捕获（DAC）技术与二氧化碳转化和封存相结合的地球系统影响。虽然涉及二氧化碳这一大气成分，但其重点在于碳捕获、转化和封存过程对土地利用的影响，以及如何通过技术进步减少土地占用。该研究更侧重于气候变化缓解策略和土地利用规划，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['CO2 removal', 'Direct Air Capture', 'Carbon Sequestration', 'Land Use', 'Climate Change Mitigation']",Moritz Adam;Thomas Kleinen;Matthias M May;Kira Rehfeld,"Land conversions not climate effects are the dominant indirect consequence of sun-driven CO2 capture, conversion, and sequestration","Removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere is required for mitigating climate change. Large-scale direct air capture combined with injecting CO2 into geological formations could retain carbon long-term, but demands a substantial amount of energy, pipeline infrastructure, and suitable sites for gaseous storage. Here, we study Earth system impacts of modular, sun-powered process chains, which combine direct air capture with (electro)chemical conversion of the captured CO2 into liquid or solid sink products and subsequent product storage (sDACCCS). Drawing on a novel explicit representation of CO2 removal in a state-of-the-art Earth system model, we find that these process chains can be renewably powered and have minimal implications for the climate and carbon cycle. However, to stabilize the planetary temperature two degrees above pre-industrial levels, CO2 capturing, conversion, and associated energy harvest demand up to 0.46% of the global land area in a high-efficiency scenario. This global land footprint increases to 2.82% when assuming present-day technology and pushing to the bounds of removal. Mitigating historical emission burdens within individual countries in this high-removal scenario requires converting an area equivalent to 40% of the European Union’s agricultural land. Scenarios assuming successful technological development could halve this environmental burden, but it is uncertain to what degree they could materialize. Therefore, ambitious decarbonization is vital to reduce the risk of land use conflicts if efficiencies remain lower than expected."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada972,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文介绍了一种名为FathomDEM的新型全球30米数字高程模型（DEM），它使用混合视觉Transformer模型来提高地形表示的准确性。该模型旨在消除现有DEM中存在的地表人工痕迹，使其更接近真实地形。论文重点介绍了FathomDEM在洪水建模中的应用，并表明其性能优于先前的全球DEM。该研究主要关注地形测绘和改进地理空间数据，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关系。,"['Digital Elevation Model (DEM)', 'Terrain mapping', 'Vision Transformer Model', 'Flood modeling']",Peter Uhe;Chris Lucas;Laurence Hawker;Malcolm Brine;Hamish Wilkinson;Anthony Cooper;Alex A Saoulis;James Savage;Christopher Sampson,FathomDEM: an improved global terrain map using a hybrid vision transformer model,"The Earth’s terrain is linked to many physical processes, and gaining the most accurate representation is key to work in many sectors from engineering to natural hazards modeling and ecology. Existing global digital elevation models (DEMs) are widely used, however often suffer from systematic biases caused by trees, buildings and instrumentation error, ultimately limiting their effectiveness. We present here, FathomDEM, a new global 30 m DEM produced using a novel application of a hybrid vision transformer model. This model removes surface artifacts from a global radar DEM, Copernicus DEM, aligning it more closely with true topography. In addition to improving on other global DEMs, FathomDEM also has reduced error compared to coastal-focussed DEMs such as the recent DeltaDTM. This demonstrates its impressive capacity to perform for specific landscapes, while being trained globally to model a wide range of terrain types. FathomDEM has been tested on the downstream task of flood modeling, showing increased accuracy compared to those run with the previous best global DEM, FABDEM, approaching the performance of LiDAR based flood modeling. This improvement is attributed to FathomDEM’s smaller error and substantial reduction in artifacts. This shows the suitability of FathomDEM for applied tasks and strengthens our evaluation compared to one based on vertical error alone."
10.1088/1748-9326/adac7b,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要探讨了生物炭作为一种碳移除策略的有效性评估问题。论文指出，目前评估生物炭碳移除耐久性的方法主要依赖于简化的化学指标（如H/C比），可能低估了生物炭的实际碳移除价值，并且没有充分考虑环境因素和生物炭原料的影响。论文建议改进评估方法，包括建立更全面的数据库，考虑不同原料和环境条件，并结合实地测量，以更准确地评估生物炭的碳移除潜力，并最大化其农业效益。该研究主要关注土壤改良和碳封存，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）的直接关联性不强。,"['carbon dioxide removal', 'biochar', 'soil amendment', 'durability', 'H/C ratio', 'feedstock', 'environmental drivers', 'agronomic co-benefits']",A J Ringsby;K Maher,Do oversimplified durability metrics undervalue biochar carbon dioxide removal?,"Soil amendment of biochar—the solid product of biomass pyrolysis—is one of few engineered strategies capable of delivering carbon dioxide removal (CDR) today. Quantifying CDR for biochar projects hinges critically on the durability of biochar materials once amended in soil. However, consensus on the definition of durability is still evolving, and as a result, standards developing organizations have generated a variety of different methodologies to assess the removal value of biochar projects. These methodologies primarily rely on single-parameter regression models to link the molar H/C ratio—an easily measurable bulk chemical metric—to the modeled durability of biochar materials. Specific deployment variables are not commonly considered. Thus, although H/C-based methodologies simplify project development and CDR assessment, questions remain as to how well they predict real project outcomes. Via a re-analysis of existing biochar incubation data and several case studies, we show that durability standards based on bulk compositional metrics are biased towards particular feedstocks and may not account for key environmental drivers. Without provisions for these factors, we find that existing assessment models appear to discount the removal value of biochar projects significantly. However, our conclusions rely on predictive models with important weaknesses and unknown uncertainty—pointing to a need to develop a use-aligned database. Limitations notwithstanding, our findings ultimately suggest the biochar ‘durability problem’ may be an artifact of the desire to simplistically define it. To reliably credit CDR, we propose a series of recommendations, including the creation of representative distributions for current feedstocks and environmental gradients to better align experimental data with real-world practices. Further, we suggest an approach to integrate in-field measurement protocols with existing strategies to evaluate CDR value, with potential to co-generate data to guide deployment, maximize agronomic co-benefits, and improve confidence in project integrity."

One under-researched factor that affects TC intensification is salinity, which is important for density stratification in certain ocean regions and can affect the surface enthalpy flux under a strengthening hurricane. To investigate the impact and efficacy of using salinity information in state-of-the-art forecasting, we use a statistical model consisting of a variety of machine learning (ML) methods. For salinity data, we use satellite measurements of pre-storm sea surface salinity (SSS) as a proxy for the salinity stratification. We train and test the model on various ocean basins, including the Atlantic, eastern North Pacific and western North Pacific. A calibrator is trained on top of the ML models to correct and enhance probability forecasts. The calibrator significantly improves probability forecasts relative to recent works. The ML model performance is improved with the addition of SSS in the Eastern North Pacific, western North Pacific, and the Caribbean subregion of the North Atlantic, and the overall model performance is better than previous studies. SSS decreases model skill for a model trained on the full Atlantic basin. In the Indian Ocean, SSS is also notably correlated with RI occurrence, but the TC samples are not sufficient to train ML models."

To gain more precise insights in how future climate change might lead to redistributing productive crop areas, we developed a new method to assess climatic crop suitability, which combines temperature and precipitation suitability through water balance calculations. We applied the method to evaluate the effects of climate change under two climatic scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5), using an ensemble of five general circulation models, for nine crops (Arabica coffee, cassava, common beans, common wheat, maize, plantain, rice, sorghum and sugarcane) for four periods of time: past (1995–2014), present day (2015–2034), medium term (2040–2059), long term (2080–2099). We observed that the fraction of area with optimal suitability might be on a downward trajectory for coffee, cassava, beans, wheat and plantain, and could be halved by the end of the century. The tropics and sub-tropics are negatively affected for all crops, while mid-latitudes see large decreases in suitability for beans, wheat and maize. Global patterns show that suitability decreases at local levels (in about 30% of the global area for bean and wheat) are not compensated by increases in suitability elsewhere (in about 19% of the area for bean and wheat). As relocation and expansion of production areas are constrained by available arable land, other strategies might be considered to improve suitability, such as irrigation, which would increase the area of optimal suitability from 5%–25% to 40%–50% of total arable land for the nine crops. Drainage could improve the optimal suitability area fivefold for maize and sorghum, while shading increases suitability for coffee (by up to 20% in both cases). The increased risk of food supply shortages led by climatic suitability loss may trigger increased deforestation if adaptation measures are not implemented."

However, a comprehensive analysis of the response of the apparent temperature sensitivity of RECO ( ) to rising temperature is lacking. This study leverages observational data from 254 sites from the FLUXNET2015 and AmeriFlux datasets to address this knowledge gap. We found a strong influence of non-temperature factors on the seasonality of RECO. The similar seasonality of this effect and temperature can lead to underestimating or overestimating .

In this study, we found lower values of Q10 and a lower decreasing rate of Q10 with rising temperature compared to previous studies. Our study suggests that might be systematically overestimated due to the confounding effect of non-temperature factors, potentially leading to overestimated simulation of RECO rate. Our study also emphasizes the necessity of developing a process-based model, rather than simply incorporating the influences of non-temperature factors into ."
10.1088/1748-9326/adae22,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要探讨了北极海冰（特别是巴伦支-喀拉海域）减少对中亚冬季气温异常的影响。论文使用因果网络分析方法，评估了海冰变化与中亚气温之间的关系，并发现长期来看，巴伦支-喀拉海域海冰的减少显著影响了中亚的冬季气温。该研究侧重于气候变化及其区域影响，而非直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['Arctic sea ice', 'Barents-Kara Seas', 'Eurasian winter', 'Central Asia temperature', 'Causal network analysis', 'Arctic Amplification']",Lara R Cosford;Rohit Ghosh;Marlene Kretschmer;Clare Oatley;Theodore G Shepherd,Estimating the contribution of Arctic sea-ice loss to central Asia temperature anomalies: the case of winter 2020/2021,"Arctic sea-ice cover has declined drastically in recent decades, notably in the Barents-Kara Seas (BKS). Previous research has linked low autumn BKS-ice cover to subsequent cold Eurasian winters. This lagged relationship was observed in 2020/2021. Using a causal network framework grounded in known physical mechanisms, we assess how strongly one factor directly influences another (i.e. the causal relationship) and apply this analysis to the anomalies from 2020/2021. We show that although year-to-year BKS-ice variations have only a minor impact on Central Asia temperatures, that causal effect becomes important for attribution and prediction when we consider the large long-term trend in BKS-ice cover. In particular, we find that Central Asia’s 2021 negative winter surface air temperature anomaly (relative to 1980–2020) can be fully explained by the BKS-ice anomaly. We further estimate that BKS-ice loss has more than halved the winter warming over Central Asia over the past 40 years. Hence rather than debating a cooling trend in Central Asia during winter, we propose shifting the focus to the influence of Arctic Amplification on anticipated warming trends. This study illustrates the efficacy of causal network analysis, which has implications for seasonal prediction and attribution of midlatitude winter anomalies."

This study aims to assess the quality of OSW resources with high temporal and spatial resolution and to elucidate the economically feasible deployment of OSW using advanced power system models with Japan as a case study. First, comprehensive evaluations of OSW resources were performed by integrating a geographic information system (GIS)-based resource assessment with simulated data for hourly resource availability and renewable power plant operation. Then, using the ‘SWITCH-Japan’ model developed in our previous study, four key policy scenarios (‘pathways’) were analyzed. Each scenario incorporated three technology cost sensitivities and was assessed on multiple criteria including affordability, energy security, and land-use change. Finally, the potential for hydrogen production in other sectors was explored. We found that the Least-Cost scenario, which accelerates renewable energy growth, reduces average system costs by 43% and increases energy self-sufficiency by 31 percentage point compared to the business-as-usual scenario. While it is a highly valuable resource, OSW nonetheless necessitates significant infrastructure development and potentially faces both stricter regulations and local opposition. In recognition of this, the Limited Onshore Resources scenario reduces direct land use by half but finds only a slight increase in overall costs. While the balance of OSW potential is utilized for power systems, the remainder can materially enhance energy security for entire economies. Ultimately, OSW energy presents a strategic opportunity for nations to achieve energy self-reliance and reduce import dependence, emphasizing the need for timely infrastructure development."

Additionally, long-term in situ measurements within soil columns are limited and associated with large uncertainties in microbial substrates (e.g. dissolved organic carbon, acetate, hydrogen). To better understand CH4 cycling dynamics, we first applied an advanced biogeochemical model, ecosys, to explicitly simulate methanogenesis, methanotrophy, and CH4 transport in a high-latitude fen (within the Stordalen Mire, northern Sweden). Next, to explore the vertical heterogeneity in CH4 cycling, we applied the PCMCI/PCMCI+ causal detection framework with a bootstrap aggregation method to the modeling results, characterizing causal relationships among regulating factors (e.g. temperature, microbial biomass, soil substrate concentrations) through acetoclastic methanogenesis, hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis, and methanotrophy, across three depth intervals (0–10 cm, 10–20 cm, 20–30 cm). Our results indicate that temperature, microbial biomass, and methanogenesis and methanotrophy substrates exhibit significant vertical variations within the soil column. Soil temperature demonstrates strong causal relationships with both biomass and substrate concentrations at the shallower depth (0–10 cm), while these causal relationships decrease significantly at the deeper depth within the two methanogenesis pathways. In contrast, soil substrate concentrations show significantly greater causal relationships with depth, suggesting the substantial influence of substrates on CH4 cycling. CH4 production is found to peak in August, while CH4 oxidation peaks predominantly in October, showing a lag response between production and oxidation. Overall, this research provides important insights into the causal mechanisms modulating CH4 cycling across different depths, which will improve carbon cycling predictions, and guide the future field measurement strategies."

For this study we developed new methods for informing DayCent-UV of growing season length and validating its plant productivity estimates for grasslands by utilizing a wide range of data sources at multiple scales, from field observations to remotely sensed satellite data. The model’s phenology was informed by the MODIS MCD12Q2 product, which showed good agreement with in-situ observations of growing season commencement and duration across different grassland ecosystems, and with observed historical trends. Model results from each simulated grid cell were compared to a remote-sensing estimate of grassland plant productivity offered by the Rangeland Analysis Platform (RAP). We determined that a modified RAP ANPP calculation that incorporated total annual precipitation instead of mean annual temperature to estimate the fraction of total productivity allocated to roots improved temporal correlations between RAP and field measurements and between RAP and DayCent-UV, We found that RAP provides a valuable data set for evaluating grassland ANPP predictions from ecosystem and other types of models because it provides estimates of grassland plant productivity over large spatial regions and a long historical period and captures temporal variablilty in plant production. This work provides the foundation for using the DayCent-UV model to predict climate change impacts on grassland cecosystem dynamics in the contiguous US."

Issues such as soil, water, and air pollution, greenhouse gas emissions, aquifer depletion, antimicrobial resistance genes, and zoonotic disease outbreaks have all been linked to livestock operations. While many studies have examined these issues at depth at local scales, it has been difficult to complete studies at regional or national scales due to the dearth of livestock data, hindering pollution mitigation or response time for tracing and monitoring disease outbreaks. In the U.S. the National Agricultural Statistics Service completes a Census once every 5 years that includes livestock, but data are only available at the county level leaving little inference that can be made at such a coarse spatiotemporal scale. While other data exist through some regulated permitting programs, there are significant data gaps in where livestock are raised, how many livestock are on site at a given time, and how these livestock and, importantly, their waste emissions, are managed. In this perspective, we highlight the need for better livestock data, then discuss the accessibility and key limitations of currently available data. We then feature some recent work to improve livestock data availability through remote-sensing and machine learning, ending with our takeaways to address these data needs for the future of environmental and public health management."

Decadal variability in TC genesis frequency (TCGF) has been linked to the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO), a major sea surface temperature (SST) pattern in the North Pacific. However, based on extended observation records, we show that the decadal variability of SE-WNP TCGF is mainly driven by the Victoria mode (VM), a secondary but prominent SST pattern in the North Pacific. During the positive VM phase, the SE-WNP TCGF is more than usual due to the anomalous large-scale environmental fields induced by the VM-related central North Pacific SST anomalies; conversely, the SE-WNP TCGF is less during the negative VM phase. This highlights the crucial role of the VM in modulating TC activity, challenging the traditional view that the PDO is the dominant factor, with important implications for SE-WNP TC climate predictions."

Levelt,SO2 emissions derived from TROPOMI observations over India using a flux-divergence method with variable lifetimes,"There is a lack of local SO2 top-down emission inventories in India. With the improvement in the divergence method and the derivation of SO2 local lifetime, gridded SO2 emissions over a large area can be estimated efficiently. This method can be applied to any region in the world to derive SO2 emissions. Especially for regions with high latitudes, our methodology has the potential to significantly improve the top-down derivation of SO2 emissions. 
 The rapid development of the economy and the implementation of environmental policies adapted in India have led to fast changes of regional SO2 emissions. We present a monthly SO2 emission inventory for India covering December 2018 to November 2023 based on the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) Level-2 COBRA SO2 dataset, using an improved flux-divergence method and estimated local SO2 lifetime, which includes both its chemical loss and dry deposition. We update the methodology to use the daily CAMS model output estimates of the hydroxyl-radical distribution as well as the measured dry deposition velocity to account for the variability in the tropospheric SO2 lifetime. It is the first effort to derive the local SO2 lifetime for application in the divergence method. The results show the application of the local SO2 lifetime improves the accuracy of SO2 emissions estimation when compared to calculations using a constant lifetime. Our improved flux-divergence method reduced the spreading of the point-source emissions compared to the standard flux-divergence method. Our derived averaged SO2 emissions covering the recent 5 years are about 5.2 Tg yr−1 with a monthly mean uncertainty of 40 %, which is lower than the bottom-up emissions of 11.0 Tg yr−1 from CAMS-GLOB-ANT v5.3. The total emissions from the 92 largest point-source emissions are estimated to be 2.9 Tg yr−1, lower than the estimation of 5.2 Tg yr−1 from the global SO2 catalog MSAQSO2LV4. We claim that the variability in the SO2 lifetime is important to account for in estimating top-down SO2 emissions."

In this study, we show in a clean environment, the shattering of freezing drops has the greatest effect on the charging rate, while in a polluted environment, both rime splintering and the shattering of freezing drops have a significant effect on cloud electrification. 
 Aerosol and secondary ice production (SIP) processes are both vital to charge separation in thunderstorms, but the relative importance of different SIP processes to electrification under different aerosol conditions is not well understood. In this study, using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, we investigate the role of four different SIP processes in charge separation with different aerosol concentrations, including the rime splintering (RS), the ice–ice collisional (IC) breakup, shattering of freezing drops (SD), and sublimational breakup (SK). It is found that as the aerosol concentration increases, more but smaller cloud droplets can be lofted to mixed-phase regions. The warm-rain process is suppressed, and the declined raindrop concentration leads to fewer graupel particles. In a clean environment (aerosol concentration <1000 cm−3), the SD process is the most important to ice production between 0 and −10 °C, while in a polluted environment (aerosol concentration ≥2000 cm−3), the RS process contributes the most between 0 and −10 °C. The IC process is important between −10 and −20 °C. The SIP processes and the increase in aerosol concentration both enhance the noninductive charging rate. However, aerosol and SIP processes have opposite impacts on the charging reversal, which implies they play different roles in controlling the charge structure. In a clean (polluted) environment, the SD (RS) process has the greatest effect on the charge structure. Both the SIP processes and the increase in aerosol concentration enhance the electric field, but the enhancement in the flash rate induced by increasing aerosol concentration is much greater than SIP."

However, due to computational constraints, the mixing state is challenging to accurately represent in large-scale models. In this study, we employ a particle-resolved model to simulate the evolution of BC mixing state based on field observation. Our result shows that aerosol compositions, coating thickness (CT) distribution, and optical properties of BC aerosols all exhibit a tendency toward a steady state with a characteristic timescale of less than 1 d, considerably shorter than the BC atmospheric lifetime.  The rapid attainment of a steady state suggests that it is reasonable to disregard this pre-steady-state period and instead concentrate on the average properties of BC across extensive spatial and temporal scales. The distribution of CT follows an exponential linear distribution and can be characterized by a single slope parameter k. This distribution is independent of the BC core's distribution. In the model simulation, the mean CT, equivalent to the 1/k, is 62 nm, which is consistent with the statistical results indicating a mean CT of 63 nm. Utilizing the slope parameter k, which effectively characterizes the CT distribution under the steady-state simplifying assumption, the BC absorption enhancement closely corresponds to the results obtained via the particle-resolved method. This study simplifies the BC mixing state description and yields a precise evaluation of the BC optical properties, which has the potential utility for modeling efforts in the refinement of the assessment of BC's radiative effects."

In this study, we introduce a new airborne eddy covariance platform (Schleicher ASK-16) and demonstrate that this platform is able to accurately measure turbulent fluxes and wind vectors. Data from this platform can help to build bridges between local tower measurements and remote-sensing-based products. 
 Airborne eddy covariance measurements can bridge the gap between local (tower-based) and regional (satellite/inversion-derived) flux data, as they provide information about the spatial distribution of turbulent fluxes for larger regions. Here, we introduce an airborne eddy covariance measurement platform based on an ASK-16 touring motor glider (TMG; also referred to as a power glider, hereafter referred to as motorized glider), which is equipped to measure the three-dimensional (3D) wind vector, and atmospheric conditions, and we derive airborne turbulent fluxes for the use of measurement campaigns over European landscapes. This study describes the measurement setup of the platform and explains the workflows that were used to calculate and calibrate the 3D wind vector, turbulent fluxes, and their associated source areas. The glider is equipped with an 858 AJ Rosemount five-hole probe, a Picarro G2311-f gas analyzer, a Novatel FlexPak G2-V2 GNSS–INS system, Vaisala temperature and humidity sensors (HMT311), and an OMEGA CHAL-003 thermocouple temperature sensor. Measurement data are processed with PyWingpod (Python) and eddy4R (R) software packages to calculate wind vectors and turbulent fluxes and assign footprints to the calculated fluxes. To evaluate the quality of the obtained fluxes, different quality assessments have been performed, including the determination of detection limits, spectral analysis, stationarity tests, the analysis of integral turbulence characteristics, and measurement noise and error evaluation. The uncertainty of w is between 0.15 and 0.27 m s−1  (median = 0.23 m s−1), and the uncertainty of u and v ranges between 0.16 and 0.55 m s−1 (median = 0.25 m s−1). Analysis of exemplary flux data from flight transects indicates that the platform is capable of producing spatially highly resolved turbulent fluxes over heterogeneous landscapes. Overall, results from our analysis suggest that the ASK-16 airborne platform can measure turbulent fluxes with a similar quality to earlier established high-quality platforms."

 Accurately quantifying global mass changes at the Earth's surface is essential for understanding climate system dynamics and their evolution. Satellite gravimetry, as realized with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) missions, is the only currently operative remote sensing technique that can track large-scale mass variations, making it a unique monitoring opportunity for various geoscientific disciplines. To facilitate easy accessibility of GRACE and GRACE-FO (GRACE/-FO in the following) results (also beyond the geodetic community), the Helmholtz Centre for Geosciences (GFZ) developed the Gravity Information Service (GravIS) portal (https://gravis.gfz.de, last access: 21 January 2025). This work aims to introduce the user-friendly mass anomaly products provided at GravIS that are specifically processed for hydrology, glaciology, and oceanography applications. These mass change data, available in both a gridded representation and as time series for predefined regions, are routinely updated when new monthly GRACE/-FO gravity field models become available. The associated GravIS web portal visualizes and describes the products, demonstrating their usefulness for various studies and applications in the geosciences. Together with GFZ's complementary information portal https://www.globalwaterstorage.info/ (last access: 21 January 2025), GravIS supports widening the dissemination of knowledge about satellite gravimetry in science and society and highlights the significance and contributions of the GRACE/-FO missions for understanding changes in the climate system.The GravIS products, divided into several data sets corresponding to their specific application, are available at https://doi.org/10.5880/GFZ.GRAVIS_06_L2B (Dahle and Murböck, 2019), https://doi.org/10.5880/COST-G.GRAVIS_01_L2B (Dahle and Murböck, 2020), https://doi.org/10.5880/GFZ.GRAVIS_06_L3_ICE (Sasgen et al., 2019), https://doi.org/10.5880/COST-G.GRAVIS.5880/GFZ.GRAVIS_01_L3_ICE (Sasgen et al., 2020), https://doi.org/10.5880/GFZ.GRAVIS_06_L3_TWS (Boergens et al., 2019), https://doi.org/10.5880/COST-G.GRAVIS_01_L3_TWS (Boergens et al., 2020a), https://doi.org/10.5880/GFZ.GRAVIS_06_L3_OBP (Dobslaw et al., 2019), and https://doi.org/10.5880/COST-G.GRAVIS_01_L3_OBP (Dobslaw et al., 2020a)."

 Timely and accurate high-resolution annual mapping of rice distribution is essential for food security, greenhouse gas emissions assessment, and support of sustainable development goals. East Asia (EA), a major global rice-producing region, accounts for approximately 29.3 % of the world's rice production.

GFEI v3 uses emissions as reported by countries in national inventories for 2020, and new infrastructure information, including a new dataset on coal mine locations. The goal of updating GFEI is to provide a more accurate spatial representation of the country-reported national inventories, allowing comparison with methane monitoring data. 
 The Global Fuel Exploitation Inventory (GFEI) is a global 0.1° x 0.1° resolution gridded inventory of methane emissions from oil, gas, and coal exploitation. Here, we present GFEI v3 with updated national emissions to 2020 using reports submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), leading to new global emissions of 23, 20, and 31 Tg a-1 for oil, gas, and coal, respectively. We also use new geospatial information from the Oil and Gas Infrastructure Mapping database (OGIM v1) for spatial distribution of global oil-gas methane emissions. We use coal mine locations from the Global Energy Monitor’s Global Coal Mine Tracker (GCMT), combined with our own estimates for mine-level methane emissions, to distribute national emissions between coal mine locations. Our mine-level methane emission estimates use country specific emission factors for top producing countries supplemented with modeled emission factors based on coal mine depth and grade. We see the greatest change in the spatial distribution of emissions in GFEI v3 compared to v2 in China due to the use of GCMT for coal mine locations. Large point source plumes (super-emitters) observed by the NASA EMIT instrument are co-located with infrastructure identified in GFEI v3, but the magnitude of the measured emissions is poorly correlated with the gridded emissions in GFEI. This may reflect missing or misrepresented sources in GFEI v3 but also the sporadic nature of the super-emitter measurements used here. By aligning GFEI v3 with national UNFCCC reports and using state-of-the-science geospatial information, the inventory can be confronted with satellite observations of atmospheric methane through inverse modeling to evaluate and improve the UNFCCC reports. We plan to continue updating GFEI to align with reported national emissions and new geospatial information, including assessment of GFEI spatial accuracy through comparison to super-emitter detections.

The distinct behavior in the different basins of the Spanish waters is reflected, and the need for further investment in experimental observations due to its great usefulness is also evidenced. 
 Ocean and atmosphere are directly communicated through air-sea interaction fluxes. These include heat exchange, by latent (LHFL) and sensible (SHFL) heat, and momentum (MOFL), by wind stress. They stand as the leading predictors of how ocean influences atmospheric variability, and vice versa. In this paper, meteorological and upper-ocean measurements collected during the period 2011–2023 aboard four research vessels over Spanish waters and adjacent seas, are used to study air-sea interaction fluxes. These research vessels are: Ramón Margalef (RM), Ángeles Alvariño (AJ) and Cornide de Saavedra (CS) belonging to Instituto Español de Oceanografía (IEO-CSIC); and Miguel Oliver (MO), from Secretaría General de Pesca of Spain. Recorded data are daily sent to the IEO Data Center on land, where quality control procedures are applied. Heat and momentum fluxes products are derived using the bulk aerodynamic approximation and are stored within a MEDAR/MedAtlas format alongside the meteorological and ocean variables used in the calculation. The data set generated and described here are publicly available at SEANOE. In order to study the behaviour of these air-sea fluxes, several marine regions subdivisions, based on the heterogeneity of the Spanish waters, are proposed. Additionally, some results within these regions context are shown."

O'Brien,Moving beyond post hoc explainable artificial intelligence: a perspective paper on lessons learned from dynamical climate modeling,"We draw from traditional climate modeling practices to make recommendations for machine-learning (ML)-driven climate science. Our intended audience is climate modelers who are relatively new to ML. We show how component-level understanding – obtained when scientists can link model behavior to parts within the overall model – should guide the development and evaluation of ML models. Better understanding yields a stronger basis for trust in the models. We highlight several examples to demonstrate. 
 AI models are criticized as being black boxes, potentially subjecting climate science to greater uncertainty. Explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has been proposed to probe AI models and increase trust. In this review and perspective paper, we suggest that, in addition to using XAI methods, AI researchers in climate science can learn from past successes in the development of physics-based dynamical climate models. Dynamical models are complex but have gained trust because their successes and failures can sometimes be attributed to specific components or sub-models, such as when model bias is explained by pointing to a particular parameterization. We propose three types of understanding as a basis to evaluate trust in dynamical and AI models alike: (1) instrumental understanding, which is obtained when a model has passed a functional test; (2) statistical understanding, obtained when researchers can make sense of the modeling results using statistical techniques to identify input–output relationships; and (3) component-level understanding, which refers to modelers' ability to point to specific model components or parts in the model architecture as the culprit for erratic model behaviors or as the crucial reason why the model functions well. We demonstrate how component-level understanding has been sought and achieved via climate model intercomparison projects over the past several decades. Such component-level understanding routinely leads to model improvements and may also serve as a template for thinking about AI-driven climate science. Currently, XAI methods can help explain the behaviors of AI models by focusing on the mapping between input and output, thereby increasing the statistical understanding of AI models. Yet, to further increase our understanding of AI models, we will have to build AI models that have interpretable components amenable to component-level understanding. We give recent examples from the AI climate science literature to highlight some recent, albeit limited, successes in achieving component-level understanding and thereby explaining model behavior. The merit of such interpretable AI models is that they serve as a stronger basis for trust in climate modeling and, by extension, downstream uses of climate model data."

Traditionally, DOM has been described as a collection of solvent-separated molecules or macromolecules. More recently, DOM has been depicted as a “supramolecular assembly”, a collection of individual molecules and associations of molecules held together by non-covalent interactions. The supramolecular assembly model has been broadly invoked to rationalize certain behaviors and properties of DOM, yet the complexity of DOM has made it difficult to fully unravel the nature and contributions of its intermolecular interactions. Discussed in this perspective is evidence regarding thermodynamic drivers of intermolecular associations, DOM molecular size, sorption of organic contaminants to DOM, and optical properties of DOM. While single observations may be rationalized by former structural models, such as the supramolecular assembly model, combined evidence shows that the 3D structure of DOM is best described by a mixed dynamic assembly model (MDAM). The MDAM depicts DOM as a collection of solvent-separated molecules and small, tightly knit assemblies held together by strong hydrogen bonds, which may form large assemblies  through weak intermolecular interactions only at specific pH values, high ionic strength, or high DOM concentration."

Rapid initial growth of the layer is also manifested in short-range bending/warping of nanocrystallites, resulting in multiple orientations of the same phases on the surface. The layer growth slowed down over time, indicating surface passivation. The formation of barringtonite and nesquehonite with 1:1 CO3/Mg ratio indicates an efficient carbonation when compared to other magnesium carbonate phases of lower ratio. Our results are essential for understanding surface passivation mechanisms and tackling the passivation issue of mineral looping DAC technology."

However, such general recognition is challenged by the unusual pH dependence observed in fluoride adsorption. Here, we selected hydrated zirconium oxide (HZO) as a representative metal oxide to revisit the fluoride adsorption mechanism. Multiple in situ microscopic analyses and thermodynamic simulations suggest that, unlike the adsorption of other anions that proceed exclusively via substituting protonated terminal hydroxyl (η-OH2+) groups of metal oxides, fluoride can displace both η-OH2+ and protonated bridging hydroxyl (μ-OH+) groups of HZO (i.e., Substitution). This distinctive displacement drives the leaching of Zr from HZO, generating aqueous polyfluorozirconium complexes (i.e., Leaching) which subsequently deposit onto HZO via outer-sphere complexation (i.e., Deposition). The adsorbed polyfluorozirconium gradually converts into a fluorozirconate (Na5Zr2F13) coating, resulting in a surface layer reconstruction of up to 100 nm in depth. The atypical pH dependency of fluoride adsorption can be explained by the processes of Substitution, Leaching, and Deposition (i.e., SLD processes). More attractively, the SLD-driven surface layer reconstruction is reversible in nature, ensuring the constant defluoridation capability of HZO during cyclic adsorption-desorption assays. This study advances our understanding of fluoride adsorption at water-metal oxide interfaces."

These parameters were calculated based on the reaction rates and online observations of VOCs, nitrogen dioxide, and O3 concentrations at Deyang, Chengdu, and Meishan in the Chengdu Plain, China, during summer 2019. The nighttime isoprene consumption was maximum at 2.03 ppbv at Meishan. The daytime acetaldehyde consumption was a maximum at 2.68 ppbv at Deyang, possibly due to its higher primary emissions and secondary production and its consumption by both OH radicals and photolysis. When the ratios of the total consumed VOC concentrations to the observed or initial NOx (NOx = NO + NO2) concentrations were 3.51 ppbv ppbv–1 or 2.22 ppbv ppbv–1, daytime O3 variations reached a maximum of 8.45 ppbv or 7.52 ppbv, respectively. The ratios delineated the VOC-sensitive and NOx-sensitive areas. Over 98% of hourly data were in VOC-sensitive areas at both Chengdu and Meishan, respectively, while over 14% of hourly data belonged to NOx-sensitive areas at Deyang. This provided a more accurate method for assessing real-time O3 sensitivity and thus implementing dynamic hierarchical control strategies."

Loss cone electrons are found with a high occurrence probability from the nightside to the dawnside at approximately L = 6. For 641 eV–88 keV electrons, the high‐occurrence region shifts toward later magnetic local times (MLTs) with increasing loss cone electron energy. The spatial distribution of the occurrence probability around MLT = 22–3 at L = 5–6 is consistent with the calculated average resonance energy distribution of whistler mode chorus waves near the magnetic equator. These results suggest that pitch angle scattering driven by chorus waves plays the main role in electron precipitation in this region."

Such waves are generally excited by wave‐particle interactions. In this article we show how resonant poloidal Alfvén waves can be excited by a fast mode (of large azimuthal scale) in a cold plasma. The key property that enables this is a three‐dimensional equilibrium, which facilitates the process of phasemixing in the azimuthal direction. We show that the classification of resonant Alfvén waves as high‐m $m$ and low‐m $m$ has limited applicability in 3D inhomogeneous media and suggest an alternative classification be based on the excitation mechanism."

Scollo,Ash and Ice Aggregation in Satellite Retrieval: The 15 January 2022 Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai Hydromagmatic Eruption,"Explosive volcanic eruptions inject volcanic particles, such as ash and water vapor, into the atmosphere. Ice enriched volcanic clouds can hide the presence of silicate particles, intensifying the fatal risks for aviation. In this scenario, satellite monitoring systems play a key role in volcanic hazard mitigation. Thanks to the full disk perspective over the Pacific Ocean, the GOES‐17 geostationary satellite observed the 15 January 2022 Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai hydromagmatic eruption. The explosive activity produced two volcanic clouds dispersing at different altitudes. In this work, we first focus on the altitude estimates of the two volcanic clouds, by means of volcanic cloud speed and wind components. Next, we study how the fine ash (< ${< } $64 μm diameter) total mass in atmosphere varies depending on the assumed fraction of ash and ice in an aggregate. Based on our estimates, the upper volcanic cloud disperses between 27.35 ± $\pm $ 3.01 and 29.13 ± $\pm $ 3.20 km altitude; the lower cloud between 14.02 ± $\pm $ 1.54 and 14.8 ± $\pm $ 1.63 km altitude. The estimated fine ash total mass doubles if we consider spherical aggregates instead of irregular aggregates, due to a tighter packing of coating particles. The highest estimated fine ash mass for the upper and lower clouds is of 3.81⋅108±1.41⋅108 $3.81\cdot 1{0}^{8}\pm 1.41\cdot 1{0}^{8}$ kg (12:40 UTC) and of 11.61⋅108±4.30⋅108 $11.61\cdot 1{0}^{8}\ \pm 4.30\cdot 1{0}^{8}$ kg (13:50 UTC), respectively. Estimating the exact amount of erupted fine ash mass, mainly during hydromagmatic eruptions, is challenging and further works should investigate aggregates where the ice fraction is higher than the ash fraction."

However, warm rain is rarely observed in urban polluted atmospheric environments due to high number concentrations of aerosols generally suppress the occurrence of warm rain. Three aircraft observation of clouds were used during summer in Beijing area. Here, we documented warm rain processes similar to shallow marine clouds in the urban (Beijing) atmospheric environment after cleansing air pollution by extensive precipitation observed on 11 September 2019. Our results showed that, compared with aircraft observations of similar cumulus clouds under polluted conditions, large‐scale precipitation can efficiently scavenge air pollution in Beijing and lead to marine‐like clouds with warm rain. The average aerosol concentration (Na) near the cloud base in these clean cases was only 225 cm−3 with cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) of 36 cm−3, (maximum of 142 cm−3) which led to enhanced coalescence. The warm rain was initiated at 600 m above the cloud base. Our results highlight the significance of pollution scavenging by precipitation in warm rain production in urban environment."

 Organic films containing unsaturated lipids are widespread, yet their oxidation pathways with associated impacts on contaminant lifetimes and human exposure remain poorly explored under indoor environmental conditions. This study demonstrates that UVA radiation and radical exposure drive rapid autoxidation of thin films of methyl linolenate (ML) and canola oil (which contains polyunsaturated triglycerides), primarily producing organic hydroperoxides. For ML films this fast chemistry occurs at the same rate under entirely dark, genuine indoor conditions as it does when the films are exposed to significantly higher •OH radicals in a flow reactor. Both •OH and organic radicals are detected within the oxidized films, propagating fast autoxidation in dark indoor environments with minimal sensitivity to the radical initiation rate. When mixed into the films, bisphenol A is hydroxylated, illustrating potential transformation pathways for toxic organic contaminants.

 The debate over the optimal orientation of Ag2Se thin films and its influence on thermoelectric performance remains ongoing. Here, we report a wet-chemical selenization-based anisotropy optimization technique to control the in-plane orientation of the Ag2Se thin film, steering it away from (002) nearly parallel planes that hinder charge carrier mobility. This approach enables us to achieve an impressive power factor of 30.8 μW cm−1 K−2 at 343 K. The as-fabricated Ag2Se thin film demonstrates remarkable durability, retaining over 90% of its power factor after six months of air exposure, and outstanding flexibility, with performance variation staying within 5% after 2000 bending cycles at a 5 mm radius. These attributes are attributed to the controlled film thickness, crystallinity, and strong adhesion to the polyimide substrate. Additionally, the as-assembled slotted thermoelectric device delivers an output power of 0.58 μW and a competitive power density of 807 μW cm−2 at a temperature difference of 20 K, alongside a high normalized power density of 1.8 μW cm−2 K−2, highlighting its potential for practical application.

 DNA nanotechnology and especially the DNA origami method are primal tools to create precise nanoscale objects. For DNA origami, a long ssDNA scaffold strand is folded by a multitude of smaller staple strands into base-pair accurate shapes, allowing for precise modification and incorporation of guest molecules. However, DNA origami are limited in size, and thus is the area that can be controlled with nanoscale precision. Prior methods of creating larger assemblies were either costly or lacked structural control. Here, we incorporate two methods of modularity into one exemplary modular DNA origami (moDON). The modularity allows for the creation of over 50,000 diverse monomers and subsequently the assembly of a plethora of fully addressable designer superstructures while keeping the construction cost very low. The here-introduced methods for modularity in DNA origami design offer an efficient, cost-effective solution for constructing precisely organized, and fully addressable structures on a variety of scales.

 Diverse, multi-stage phase transformations occur in many materials under extreme environments. In response to irradiation, some MAX phase compositions transform from an initial hexagonal structure to an intermediate γ-phase, then to a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure, while others instead become amorphous. To date, no comprehensive description of the associated transformation mechanisms, or of the influence of composition on this phase behavior, has been reported. In this work, we combine in situ ion irradiation, Transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and density-functional theory (DFT) calculations to demonstrate the distinct transformation pathways and corresponding energetics of the γ-to-fcc transformation in a series of MAX phases. We show that structural distortion and bond covalency of the intermediate γ-phase determine the outcome of the transformation process. This yields a generalized rule to predict the phase transition behaviors of MAX phases based on their atomic radii and electronegativity. These results provide an insight into the multi-stage phase transformation pathways along which MAX phase systems and related complex materials evolve in extreme environments.

Although such efforts reduce air-pollution-related premature mortality in disadvantaged communities, the relative disparity between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities increases. 
 Electrifying heavy-duty trucks reduces on-road diesel emissions but shifts the burden of supplying energy to power-generation facilities. The combined effect of Inflation Reduction Act investments in grid decarbonization and truck electrification will alter the magnitude and distribution of air pollution burdens across the United States. These investments are intended to facilitate a just energy transition, with 40% of the benefits flowing to disadvantaged communities per the Justice40 Initiative. Here we evaluate the combined effects of Inflation Reduction Act grid decarbonization and truck electrification investments on a national scale to determine whether the air pollution benefits would meet this 40% goal for both disadvantaged communities and the most exposed racial–ethnic groups. We find that truck electrification and decarbonization reduce air-pollution-related premature mortality in disadvantaged communities. However, the relative disparity between disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged communities increases, suggesting that a disproportionate share of benefits accrue to non-disadvantaged communities. Whereas absolute disparity in grid emissions decreases over time for all racial–ethnic groups, relative disparity remains largely unchanged, with Black populations being the most exposed. Electrifying drayage corridors would result in comparatively large health benefits for disadvantaged communities, suggesting that increasing targeted electrification investments in short-haul routes near urban areas (for example, ports) could be promising.

 Accelerated Arctic warming and wetting has global impacts, as the region’s glaciers and ice caps respond to variations in temperature and precipitation, impacting global sea-level change. But as the observations needed to calibrate models are scarce, predictions cannot confirm if increases in snowfall can help offset melt. Here, we analyze two 14,000-year-long glacier-fed lake sediment records from the Svalbard archipelago to examine the response of a resilient ice cap (Åsgardfonna) to warmer-than-present Holocene Thermal Maximum conditions. End-Member Modelling allowed us to unmix the diluted grain size signal of rock flour – a widely used proxy for past glacier change, and surface runoff – an indicator of hydrological intensification. Our findings reveal that Åsgardfonna survived and may have advanced despite warmer conditions, possibly due to enhanced snowfall driven by sea-ice loss. This suggests that future increases in precipitation could moderate glacier retreat in similar settings.

 Crop mapping is essential for agricultural management and food production monitoring, but challenges like limited crop labels and poor model generalization significantly hinder large-scale crop mapping. Here, we introduce a novel Contrastive Self-Training Network (CSTN), integrating a self-training strategy and contrastive domain adaptation (CDA) for cross-region crop mapping. CSTN uses pseudo-labels in the target region generated by the self-training strategy to assist supervised learning, and aligns features across regions using class-aware prototypes. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate that CSTN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a 12.29 % increase in average F1-score, particularly in maize identification. Moreover, CSTN also enables early-season crop classification for pre-harvest decision-making applications. The interpretability of the model is demonstrated through an in-depth analysis of feature map visualizations, attention map visualizations, and the effectiveness of the modules. This study provides a robust method for enhancing large-scale crop mapping and facilitating more accurate and timely agricultural practices."

 The increase of diffuse radiation fraction has been reported to greatly impact carbon uptake in agroecosystems. However, it is unclear how radiation components affected methane (CH4) emission. Based on eddy covariance measurement from six sites, the effects of sky conditions on gross primary productivity (GPP) and CH4 emission were investigated at half-hourly and daily scales. The results showed diurnal patterns of GPP were similar under all sky conditions, while CH4 emission displayed irregular unimodal curves with greater fluctuations under different sky conditions. GPP responded to the changing radiation more efficiently under overcast conditions than under sunny conditions, whereas CH4 emission under sunny conditions was higher at the same radiation levels. Parameters describing GPP and CH4 emission varied across sites and sky conditions. The maximum photosynthetic rate and CH4 rate at turning point under cloudy and overcast skies were lower than those under sunny conditions. The values of initial light use efficiency from GPP and CH4 emission were opposite with the increase of diffuse radiation fraction, respectively. Soil moisture, temperature (Ta), vapor pressure deficit, direct, and diffuse radiation (Rdif) were responsible for the variations of GPP and CH4 emission under different skies, CH4 emission depended heavily on GPP and Ta under the inhibition of Rdif. This study implies that the direct effects of sky conditions on GPP were greater than those on CH4 emission and should be paid more attention in ecosystem carbon cycle models."

The review summarized the prediction of urban air quality influenced by complicated on-road traffic conditions using various ML algorithms (e.g., tree-based and neural network algorithms). Additionally, we explored the sources of input datasets, feature applications and challenges associated with ML algorithms’ selection and application. Additionally, prospects were proposed for prioritizing interpretability in ML algorithms and the optimizing input metadata to improve the reliability and performance of ML-based TAQ models. Together with future research directions were also discussed, including real-time urban air quality evaluation and models facilitated concerned with health and economic effects.

 This study is focused on the unusual inhomogeneity of the seasonal distribution of genesis frequency of tropical cyclones (TCGF) over the western North Pacific (WNP), which tends to be linked to a significant phase reversal of TCGF anomaly. More active stage of tropical cyclones (TCs) shifting toward summer (autumn) corresponds to a positive (negative) TCGF anomaly in summer followed by a negative (positive) TCGF anomaly in autumn. The seasonal evolutions of middle-level humidity and vertical motions over the WNP are identified as the important factors contributing to the opposite signs of TCGF anomalies. Moist static energy budget analysis suggests that the advection of lower-level specific humidity by anomalous westerlies (northerlies) induces ascending (descending) motions over the WNP in summer (autumn), favoring (inhibiting) TC formation. Apart from the seasonal impact of El Niño-Southern Oscillation, the oceanic forcing beyond the tropical Pacific is involved in seasonal changes in atmospheric circulation. Both statistical analysis and numerical experiments show that the anomalous westerlies in summer are simultaneously related to the significant sea surface temperature cooling in the tropical Indian Ocean, while anomalous northerlies in autumn are simultaneously related to the significant cooling in the extratropical Pacific. The results obtained benefit a better understanding and prediction of WNP TC seasonality."
