10.1088/1748-9326/ad6f2b,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了中国东南和孟加拉地区春季降水与印度夏季风之间的关系。研究发现，春季降水与印度夏季风之间存在显著的联系，并受到东亚副热带急流和厄尔尼诺-南方涛动的影响。论文使用了树木年轮重建数据，并分析了春季降水的同步性，揭示了春季降水对印度夏季风的预测能力。论文的重点在于气候变化和季风预测，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。,[],Keyan Fang;Feifei Zhou;Hao Wu;Hui Tang;Zepeng Mei;Jinbao Li;Tinghai Ou;Zheng Zhao;Deliang Chen,Synchronous spring precipitation in Southeastern China and Bengal: a potential indicator for the Indian summer monsoon?,"Spring precipitation in southeastern China and Bengal, occurring during the transitional phase from winter to summer monsoons, serves as a critical window into the dynamics of large-scale circulations and the subsequent summer monsoon. While many studies have analyzed spring precipitation in southeastern China and Bengal, their interconnections and implications for the summer monsoon have remained relatively under explored. We utilized the Empirical Orthogonal Function of spring precipitation to reveal Synchronous Spring Precipitation (SSP) in southeastern China and Bengal. This synchronicity is bridged by the East Asian Subtropical Jet (EASJ) that extends from Bengal to southeastern China. The EASJ was predominantly correlated with precipitation in southeastern China prior to the 1990s, while it developed a more profound connection with precipitation in Bengal after the 1990s. Notably, SSP anomalies occurred during the developing phase of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The predictive capacity of SSP for the Indian summer monsoon (ISM) amplifies during periods of the intensified SSP-ENSO correlations and positive phase of the North Pacific Meridional Mode. Tree-ring based reconstructions spanning the past two centuries further corroborate the persistent linkages among the SSP, ISM, and ENSO. Our research sheds light on the intricate interplay of these factors and their significance in understanding and predicting the monsoon dynamics in the region."

Potential predictors were initially identified based on the relationships between the year-by-year variation (DY) of the TYFs and preseason (March–May) environmental factors. These predictors were subsequently further refined, resulting in the selection of eight key predictors. Prediction models were constructed using twenty machine learning algorithms, utilizing data from 1965 to 2010. These trained models were then applied to perform hindcasts of TYFs from 2011 to 2023. The forecasted DY was added to the observed TYF of the preceding year to obtain the current year’s TYF. The results indicate that the TYFs predicted by the multi-model ensemble (MME) closely align with the observation during the hindcast period. Compared to individual models, the MME improves the prediction skill for the DY by at least 5.56% and up to 56.92%. Furthermore, the mean bias of the MME for TYF is notably smaller than that of the ECMWF’s most recent seasonal forecasting system (SEAS5) in the years of 2017‒2023. The superior performance of the ensemble prediction approach was also validated through leave-one-out cross-validation. This research underscores the potential of ensemble prediction approach utilizing multiple machine learning algorithms to improve the forecasting skill of TYF over the WNP."

Traditionally, these influences are identified using numerical sensitivity experiments with numerical models like the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which require substantial computational resources. This study investigates the potential of the Artificial intelligence (AI)-based Pangu-Weather model to reveal these complex mechanisms by comparing its performance with the WRF model, focusing on Typhoon Khanun’s impact on the extreme rainfall event in North China from 29 July to 1 August 2023. Our analysis shows that Pangu-Weather effectively captures key atmospheric systems and TC positions, outperforming WRF. Specifically, WRF simulations excluding Khanun demonstrate a reduction in northward moisture transport on the eastern side of North China, but minimal impact on the extreme precipitation area for most of the period. Pangu-Weather successfully reproduces these processes, aligning closely with WRF at larger scales (e.g. greater than 300 km). However, Pangu-Weather struggles to discern and explain smaller-scale processes (e.g. less than 300 km). These findings highlight Pangu-Weather’s potential to advance meteorological research and disaster prevention, demonstrating AI’s capability to accurately depict complex large-scale physical processes."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad7040,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了气候变化对全球主要粮食产区（“面包篮”地区）作物产量的影响。研究者通过分析过去六十年来的作物产量数据，发现尽管极端高温对作物产量构成了越来越大的威胁，但降水、极端低温天数和平均生长季温度的变化在一定程度上抵消了这种影响。因此，总体而言，气候因素导致的作物产量波动在过去几十年中有所下降。然而，论文也指出，气候因素在近年来对作物产量波动的影响越来越大，这表明极端气候事件对全球粮食生产体系的稳定性至关重要。,"['crop yield', 'climate change', 'breadbasket regions', 'abiotic stress', 'statistical models']",Xuan Chen;Weston Anderson;Liangzhi You;Edward Pope,Observed trends in multiple breadbasket yield shocks,"Extreme climate events in breadbasket regions have become more frequent due to climate change, exposing crops to a greater frequency and intensity of abiotic stress. But by using observed crop yield statistics and an ensemble of statistical models, we demonstrate that over the last six decades the frequency of crop yield shocks in breadbasket regions has been decreasing due to both climate and non-climate factors. Here non-climate factors refer to interannual variability unrelated to abiotic stress, such as biotic stress and management decisions. We find that although the risk posed by extreme heat to crop yields has been increasing, this risk has been offset by changes to precipitation, extremely cold days, and average growing season temperature in many breadbaskets. As a result, total climate-related crop yield shocks have been decreasing for soybeans and wheat, while they have remained roughly constant for maize. Meanwhile, non-climate risks to crop yields have decreased in nearly every breadbasket region across crops. Because non-climate risks have decreased faster than climate risks, we find that the climate accounts for a greater proportion of crop yield shocks in the recent period (1991–2020) compared to an earlier period (1961–90). Our results indicate that extreme climate events are more important than ever to the relative stability of the food production system, even as the overall frequency of multiple breadbasket yield shocks decreases."

Traditionally, ENSO has been considered a phenomenon that is mostly influenced by the interactions between oceanic and atmospheric processes, i.e. by the internal variability in Earth’s ocean-atmosphere system. However, dendrochronological records of climate indices, ENSO among them, have statistically significant variance at periodicities related to solar activity (sunspots) and lunar precessions. Other studies indicate a modulation by the lunar nodal cycle of ocean’s mixing and its implications on water and air temperatures, steric sea levels, coastal flooding, rain, river discharge and heat transport. Those findings suggest that astronomic forces may influence ENSO. In fact, this study shows that a fit to well-established periodicities from lunar precessions, solar activity and their interactions explains 91% of the variance of an ENSO index smoothed at 5 years, and 67% of a 3 yr filtered ENSO index. Provided that the future Earth’s ocean-atmospheric system remains roughly within historical bounds under a changing climate in the next 2–3 decades, one can venture a projection into the future of 3- and 5 yr smoothed ENSO variability. Such projection is given here and might help in preparations for adaptation and mitigation measures caused by ENSO-related coastal hazards."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad6a27,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究了墨西哥的“Sembrando Vida”国家农业林业计划，该计划旨在通过向小农户支付种植农林复合系统的费用来减少贫困、森林砍伐和保护生物多样性。论文分析了该计划在招募参与者时是否达到了其目标，并发现该计划在一定程度上达到了减少贫困的目标，但在保护生物多样性和减少森林砍伐方面存在不足。论文并未涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,[],Pablo Gonzalez-Moctezuma;Jeanine M Rhemtulla,"National agroforestry program in Mexico faces trade-offs between reducing poverty, protecting biodiversity and targeting forest loss","National reforestation initiatives with ambitious targets and multiple objectives are becoming the norm across the Global South. The extent to which these large-scale initiatives are actually achieving their multiple and potentially conflicting objectives, however, is largely unknown. Sembrando Vida, a national initiative in Mexico implemented in 2019, pays smallholder farmers to plant agroforests in order to reduce poverty and forest loss, and protect biodiversity. We assessed to what degree program recruitment met its stated objectives via its selection of participating municipalities and households. Because program data are not publicly available, we consolidated and harmonized >14 million policy payments (totaling ∼$4 billion USD) to smallholder farmers, thus creating the first spatiotemporal dataset of program outcomes. We found that ∼450k rural households in ∼1000 municipalities across the country participated in the program consistently from 2019 to 2022. The program was reasonably well targeted to achieve its poverty reduction objectives. Significantly more households (ANOVA, p < 0.001) were enrolled in high-poverty (10.4%) than low-poverty (4.9%) municipalities, despite more money being transferred in absolute terms to low-poverty municipalities. The program did not reach some regions that best fit its three goals. Using a zero-inflated negative binomial model, we showed that the distribution of participating households was more likely to address poverty (coefficient = 0.51, p < 0.001 at household level) and forest cover loss (0.1, p = 0.01) than to restore areas important for biodiversity (−0.08, p = 0.02). Finally, we conducted a spatial analysis showing that there is technically sufficient rural land (4.29 Mha) and households (491k) to maximize the potential of all policy objectives simultaneously, but this would require that the program operate in only 83 municipalities across 10 states. Our results highlight the challenges in reaching high poverty regions while meeting multiple other objectives when scaling up forest landscape restoration."

Hurricanes incur substantial damage and economic losses because structures located near the coast tend to be high value as well as particularly exposed. To bolster disaster mitigation and community resilience, it is crucial to understand how hurricane hazards drive social and economic impacts. We integrate detailed hazard simulations, property data, and labor compensation estimates to comprehensively analyze hurricanes’ economic impacts. This study investigates the spatial distribution of probabilistic hurricane hazards, and concomitant property losses and labor impacts, pinpointing particularly hard hit areas. Relationships between capital and labor losses, social vulnerability, and asset values reveal the latter as the primary determinant of overall economic consequences."

The Yellow River Basin is an important ecological barrier and economic zone in our country. By predicting the distribution of wetland landscape and evaluating its evolutionary characteristics, strategies for wetland conservation and utilization in the Yellow River Basin can be formulated. Future land use simulation model can not only simulate the change of multiple land use types, but also reflect the uncertainty of real land use change. In this study, the model was improved and used to predict future wetland changes in the Yellow River Basin. Using the wetland distribution data in 2000 as the initial data, and the wetland distribution data in 2015 as the validation data, setting the parameters according to the land use data of the Yellow River Basin from 1980 to 2000 and the wetland type transfer matrix, after verifying the applicability of the model, the spatial distribution pattern of wetlands in the Yellow River Basin in 2030 was simulated. This research shows that the cost matrix setting method based on the wetland transfer matrix can effectively avoid the errors caused by subjective judgment assignment. By 2030, the wetland distribution in the Yellow River Basin will remain stable, with marshes, paddy fields, and beaches as the main types, similar to 2015. Of all the regions in the Yellow River Basin, Zhengzhou had the highest rate of wetland loss, down 31.94%. On the contrary, Sanmenxia had the highest growth rate of 24.44%."

This approach offers significant potential for both mitigating and adapting to the impacts of climate change. As a result, international collaboration on blue carbon initiatives has become a focal point in the worldwide response to the climate crisis. China, blessed with extensive blue carbon resources, recognizes the development of these ecosystems as a critical component in its efforts to make a substantial contribution to the global endeavor to curb climate change and achieve sustainable environmental goals.

Despite its vast potential, China faces significant hurdles, including the degradation of blue carbon ecosystems, a delayed start in implementing blue carbon practices, and inconsistencies in the blue carbon standard system. To enhance its participation in global blue carbon initiatives, China should pursue several key strategies, including preserving and restoring its blue carbon ecosystems, strengthening domestic protection and application mechanisms, promoting the construction of an international blue carbon system, establishing a scientific cooperation platform to facilitate capacity building and technology transfer and advocating for an international blue carbon market trading mechanism. By prioritizing these key areas, China can simultaneously foster domestic blue carbon conservation and development while solidifying its role as a pivotal contributor to global climate change mitigation efforts."

On 27 June 2023 a major upgrade, Cy48R1, became operational. Comparisons with in situ, surface remote sensing, aircraft, and balloon and satellite observations show that the new CAMS system is a significant improvement. The results quantify the skill of CAMS to forecast impactful events, such as wildfires, dust storms and air pollution peaks. 
 The Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)  provides daily analyses and forecasts of the composition of the atmosphere, including the reactive gases such as O3, CO, NO2, HCHO and SO2; aerosol species; and greenhouse gases. The global CAMS analysis system (IFS-COMPO) is based on the ECMWF Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) for numerical weather prediction (NWP) and assimilates a large number of composition satellite products on top of the meteorological observations ingested in IFS. The CAMS system receives regular upgrades, following the upgrades of IFS. The last upgrade, Cy48R1, operational since 27 June 2023, was major with a large number of code changes, both for IFS-COMPO and for NWP. The main IFS-COMPO innovations include the introduction of full stratospheric chemistry; a major update of the emissions; a major update of the aerosol model, including the representation of secondary organic aerosol; several updates of the dust life cycle and optics; updates to the inorganic chemistry in the troposphere; and the assimilation of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) aerosol optical depth (AOD) and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) CO. The CAMS Cy48R1 upgrade was validated using a large number of independent measurement datasets, including surface in situ, surface remote sensing, routine aircraft, and balloon and satellite observations. In this paper we present the validation results for Cy48R1 by comparing them with the skill of the previous operational system (Cy47R3), with the independent observations as reference, for the period October 2022 to June 2023, during which daily forecasts from both cycles are available. Major improvements in skill are found for the ozone profile in the lower–middle stratosphere and for stratospheric NO2 due to the inclusion of full stratospheric chemistry. Stratospheric trace gases compare well with the Atmospheric Chemistry Experiment Fourier Transform Spectrometer (ACE-FTS) observations between 10 and 200 hPa, with larger deviations between 1 and 10 hPa. The impact of the updated emissions is especially visible over East Asia and is beneficial for the trace gases O3, NO2 and SO2. The CO column assimilation is now anchored by the Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI) instead of the Measurements Of Pollution in The Troposphere (MOPITT) instrument, which is beneficial for most of the CO comparisons, and the assimilation of TROPOMI CO data improves the model CO field in the troposphere. In general the aerosol optical depth has improved globally, but the dust evaluation shows more mixed results. The results of the 47 comparisons are summarised in a scorecard, which shows that 83 % of the evaluation datasets show a neutral or improved performance of Cy48R1 compared to the previous operational CAMS system, while 17 % indicate a (slight) degradation.  This demonstrates the overall success of this upgrade."

Simpson;Kirk Ullmann;Armin Wisthaler,Using observed urban NOx sinks to constrain VOC reactivity and the ozone and radical budget  in the Seoul Metropolitan Area,"Ozone (O3) is a pollutant formed from the reactions of gases emitted from various sources. In urban areas, the density of human activities can increase the O3 formation rate (P(O3)), thus impacting air quality and health.  Observations collected over Seoul, South Korea, are used to constrain P(O3). A high local P(O3) was found;  however, local P(O3) was partly reduced due to compounds typically ignored. These observations also provide constraints for unmeasured compounds that will impact P(O3). 
 Ozone (O3) is an important secondary pollutant that impacts air quality and human health. Eastern Asia has high regional O3 background due to the numerous sources and increasing and rapid industrial growth, which also impacts the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA). However, the SMA has also been experiencing increasing O3 driven by decreasing NOx emissions, highlighting the role of the local in situ O3 production on the SMA. Here, comprehensive gas-phase measurements collected on the NASA DC-8 during the National Institute of Environmental Research (NIER)/NASA Korea–United States Air Quality (KORUS-AQ) study are used to constrain the instantaneous O3 production rate over the SMA. The observed NOx oxidized products support the importance of non-measured peroxy nitrates (PNs) in the O3 chemistry in the SMA, as they accounted for ∼49 % of the total PNs. Using the total measured PNs (ΣPNs) and alkyl and multifunctional nitrates (ΣANs), unmeasured volatile organic compound (VOC) reactivity (R(VOC)) is constrained and found to range from 1.4–2.1 s−1. Combining the observationally constrained R(VOC) with the other measurements on the DC-8, the instantaneous net O3 production rate, which is as high as ∼10 ppbv h−1, along with the important sinks of O3 and radical chemistry, is constrained. This analysis shows that ΣPNs play an important role in both the sinks of O3 and radical chemistry. Since ΣPNs are assumed to be in a steady state, the results here highlight the role that ΣPNs play in urban environments in altering the net O3 production, but ΣPNs can potentially lead to increased net O3 production downwind due to their short lifetime (∼1 h). The results provide guidance for future measurements to identify the missing R(VOCs) and ΣPN production."

The instrumentation enabled us to see elevated nucleation mode particle and SO2 concentrations at the surface when air masses transported from polluted areas are mixed in the boundary layer. 
 The optical, physical, and chemical properties of aerosol particles have been previously studied in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), but there is still a gap in the knowledge of particle sources and in the horizontal and vertical transport of aerosol particles and their precursors in the area. To investigate how aerosol particle and SO2 concentrations at the surface responded to changes in horizontal and vertical transport, we used data from a 1-year measurement campaign at a background site where local sources of SO2 were expected to be minimal. The measurement campaign provided a combination of in situ measurements at the surface and the boundary layer evolution from vertical and horizontal wind profiles measured by a Doppler lidar. The diurnal structure of the boundary layer in the UAE was very similar from day to day, with a deep, well-mixed boundary layer during the day transitioning to a shallow nocturnal layer, with the maximum boundary layer height usually being reached around 14:00 local time. Both SO2 and nucleation-mode aerosol particle concentrations were elevated for surface winds coming from the east or western sectors. We attribute this to oil refineries located on the eastern and western coasts of the UAE. The concentrations of larger cloud condensation nuclei (CCN)-sized particles and their activation fraction did not show any clear dependence on wind direction, but the CCN number concentration showed some dependence on wind speed, with higher concentrations coinciding with the weakest surface winds. Peaks in SO2 concentrations were also observed despite low surface wind speeds and wind directions unfavourable for transport. However, winds aloft were much stronger, with wind speeds of 10 m s−1 at 1 km common at night and wind directions favourable for transport; surface-measured concentrations increased rapidly once these particular layers started to be entrained into the growing boundary layer, even if the surface wind direction was from a clean sector. These conditions also displayed higher nucleation-mode aerosol particle concentrations, i.e. new particle formation events occurring due to the increase in the gaseous precursor."

Bailey,High-altitude balloon-launched uncrewed aircraft system measurements of atmospheric turbulence and qualitative comparison with infrasound microphone response,"This work summarizes measurements conducted in June 2021 using a small, uncrewed, stratospheric glider that was launched from a weather balloon to altitudes up to 30 km above sea level. The aircraft conducted measurements of wind speed and direction, pressure, temperature, and humidity during its descent as well as measurements of infrasonic sound levels. These data were used to evaluate the atmospheric turbulence observed during the descent phase of the flight. 
 This study investigates the use of a balloon-launched uncrewed aircraft system (UAS) for the measurement of turbulence in the troposphere and lower stratosphere. The UAS was a glider which could conduct an automated descent following a designated flight trajectory and was equipped with in situ sensors for measuring thermodynamic and kinematic atmospheric properties. In addition, this aircraft was equipped with an infrasonic microphone to assess its suitability for the remote detection of clear-air turbulence. The capabilities of the UAS and sensing systems were tested during three flights conducted in New Mexico, USA, in 2021. It was found that the profiles of temperature, humidity, and horizontal winds measured during descent were in broad agreement with those made by radiosonde data published by the US National Weather Service, separated by up to 380 km spatially and by 3 to 5 h temporally. Winds measured during controlled flight descent were consistent with the winds measured by global-positioning-system-derived velocity during balloon ascent. During controlled descent with this particular payload, a nominal vertical resolution on the order of 1 m was achieved for temperature, relative humidity, and pressure with a nominal vertical resolution of the wind velocity vector on the order of 0.1 m; the aircraft had a glide slope angle from 1 to 4° during this time. Analysis approaches were developed that provided turbulent kinetic energy and dissipation rate, but it was found that the corresponding Richardson number was sensitive to the methodology used to determine the vertical gradients from a single flight. The low-frequency content of the infrasonic microphone signal was observed to qualitatively align with long-wavelength wind velocity fluctuations detected at high altitude. Moreover, the microphone measured more broadband frequency content when the aircraft approached turbulence produced by the boundary layer."

This version predicts over 20 soil properties at six depths, providing accurate soil variation maps across China. It outperforms previous versions and global products, offering valuable data for hydrological, ecological analyses, and earth system modeling, enhancing understanding of soil roles in environmental processes. 
 Accurate and high-resolution spatial soil information is crucial for efficient and sustainable land use, management, and conservation. Since the establishment of digital soil mapping (DSM) and the GlobalSoilMap working group, significant advances have been made in spatial soil information globally. However, accurately predicting soil variation over large and complex areas with limited samples remains a challenge, especially for China, which has diverse soil landscapes. To address this challenge, we utilized 11,209 representative multi-source legacy soil profiles (including the Second National Soil Survey of China, World Soil Information Service, First National Soil Survey of China, and regional databases) and high-resolution soil-forming environment characterization. Using advanced Quantile Regression Forest algorithms and a high-performance parallel computing strategy, we developed comprehensive maps of 23 soil physical, chemical and fertility properties at six standard depth layers from 0 to 2 meters in China with a 90 m spatial resolution (China dataset of soil properties for land surface modeling version 2, CSDLv2). Data-splitting and independent samples validation strategies were employed to evaluate the accuracy of the predicted maps quality. The results showed that the predicted maps were significantly more accurate and detailed compared to traditional soil type linkage methods (i.e., CSDLv1, the first version of the dataset), SoilGrids 2.0, and HWSD 2.0 products, effectively representing the spatial variation of soil properties across China. The prediction accuracy of most soil properties at the 0–5 cm depth interval ranged from good to moderate, with Model Efficiency Coefficients for most soil properties ranging from 0.75 to 0.32 during data-splitting validation and from 0.88 to 0.25 during independent sample validation. The wide range between the 5 % lower and 95 % upper prediction limits may indicate substantial room for improvement in current predictions. The relative importance of environmental covariates in predictions varied with soil properties and depth, indicating the complexity of interactions among multiple factors in the soil formation processes. As the soil profiles used in this study mainly originate from the Second National Soil Survey of China during 1970s and 1980s, they could provide new perspectives of soil changes together with existing maps based on 2010s soil profiles. The findings make important contributions to the GlobalSoilMap project and can also be used for regional Earth system modeling and land surface modeling to better represent the role of soil in hydrological and biogeochemical cycles in China.

Using machine learning, it identifies the most influential factors affecting soil DOC levels and maps global patterns. The findings help guide soil management and climate strategies, with the dataset available for further research. 
 Dissolved organic carbon (DOC) is the most active carbon pool in soils, which plays critical roles in soil carbon cycling, plant productivity, and global climate change. An accurate assessment of the quantity of DOC in the soil is essential for the detailed elucidation of ecosystem functions and services. Nevertheless, the global driving factors and distribution of soil DOC remain inadequately quantified due to the scarcity of large-scale data. Here, a comprehensive global database of 12807 soil DOC concentrations derived from 975 target papers in the literature was compiled. Detailed geographic locations, climate, and soil properties were also recorded as predictors of soil DOC. Machine learning techniques were employed to assess the relative importance of various predictors in the determination of soil DOC concentrations, which were subsequently extended for their prediction on a global scale. The worldwide soil DOC concentration spanned a wide range (0.04 to 7859 mg kg-1), averaging 222.78 mg kg-1. The 12 selected variables (including soil properties, month, climate, and ecosystem) explained 65 % of the variance in soil DOC concentrations. Elevation, soil clay, and soil organic carbon were three of the most important predictors. Global soil DOC concentration increased from the equator to the poles. The soil DOC stocks in the topsoil layer (0–30 cm) amounted to 12.17 Pg, with significant variations observed across different continents. These results are instrumental for informing strategies on soil management practices, ecosystem services, and the mitigation of climate change. Furthermore, our database can be combined with other carbon pools to explore the total soil carbon turnover and constrain Earth carbon models.

It involves a stepwise approach to estimate the basin-level floodplain hydraulic geometry parameters that best respect the scaling law while approximating the global hydrodynamic flood maps. A ~90 m resolution global floodplain map, the Spatial Heterogeneity Improved Floodplain by Terrain analysis (SHIFT), is delineated with demonstrated superiority. 
 Floodplains are a vital part of the global riverine system. Among all the global floodplain delineation strategies empowered by remote sensing, digital elevation model (DEM)-based delineation is considered to be computationally efficient with relatively low uncertainties, but the parsimonious model struggles with incorporating the basin-level spatial heterogeneity of the hydrological and geomorphic influences into the map. In this study, we propose a globally applicable thresholding scheme for DEM-based floodplain delineation to improve the representation of spatial heterogeneity. Specifically, we develop a stepwise approach to estimate the floodplain hydraulic geometry (FHG) scaling parameters for river basins worldwide at the scale of the level-3 HydroBASINS to best respect the scaling law while approximating the spatial extent of two publicly available global flood maps derived from hydrodynamic modeling. The estimated FHG exponent exhibits a significant positive relationship with the basins' hydroclimatic conditions, particularly in 33 of the world's major river basins, indicating the ability of the approach to capture fingerprints from heterogeneous hydrological and geomorphic influences. Based on the spatially varying FHG parameters, a ∼ 90 m resolution global floodplain map named the Spatial Heterogeneity Improved Floodplain by Terrain analysis (SHIFT) is delineated, which takes the hydrologically corrected MERIT Hydro dataset as the DEM inputs and the height above nearest drainage (HAND) as the terrain attribute. Our results demonstrate that SHIFT validates better with reference maps than both hydrodynamic-modeling- and DEM-based approaches with universal parameters. The improved delineation mainly includes better differentiation between main streams and tributaries in major basins and a more comprehensive representation of stream networks in aggregated river basins. SHIFT estimates the global floodplain area to be 9.91×106 km2, representing 6.6 % of the world's total land area. SHIFT data layers are available at two spatial resolutions (90 m and 1 km), along with the updated parameters, at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.11835133 (Zheng et al., 2024). We anticipate that SHIFT will be used to support applications requiring boundary delineations of the global geomorphic floodplains."

 Early-life stages play a key role in the dynamics of bipartite life cycle marine fish populations. Difficult to monitor, observations of these stages are often scattered in space and time. While Mediterranean coastlines have often been surveyed, no effort has been made to assemble historical observations.

 Storm surges (SSs) cause massive loss of life and property in coastal areas each year. High spatial resolution and long-term SS records are the basis for deepening our understanding of this disaster. However, such global or quasi-global scale information could only be simulated by global numerical models until now due to the sparse and uneven distribution of tide gauge stations. In this paper, the all-site modeling framework for the data-driven model was implemented on a quasi-global scale within areas severely affected by SSs caused by tropical and extratropical cyclones. Compared to single-site modeling data-driven models, it can provide SS information for ungauged points. Compared to numerical models, it can reconstruct long-term SSs faster with fewer computational resources. We generated the first high spatial resolution (every 10 km per station along the coastline) hourly SS dataset ASM-SS (all-site modeling storm surge) within 45° S to 45° N, whose record length is over 80 years from 1940 to 2020. Assessments indicate that for 95th extreme SSs, the precision of this model (medians of correlation coefficients, root mean square errors, and mean biases are 0.66, 9 cm, and -4.4 cm, respectively) is slightly better than that of the state-of-the-art global hydrodynamic model (medians are 0.58, 10.8 cm, and -4.3 cm); for annual maximum SSs, our model is more stable than the numerical model with overall root mean square error and coefficient of determination optimizing by around 23.1 % and 14.8 %, respectively.

 Peatlands, which only cover 3 to 5 percent of the global land area, can store up to twice the amount of carbon as the world’s forests. Although recognised for their significant role in the global carbon cycle, discovering the global extent of peatlands and their carbon stock remains challenging. Referring to the UNEP's global peatland map, here we present PEATGRIDS, a data product containing global maps of peat thickness and carbon stock created created using the digital soil mapping approach. We compiled over 25,000 observations of peatland thickness, bulk density (BD) and carbon content (CC), globally. Using the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, we estimated peat thickness and peat BD and CC at ~1 km resolution at multiple depths (0–2 m) globally. The estimates were generated using 19 land surface covariates from digital maps and remote sensing images of land use, soil characteristics, topographical features, and climate parameters. The RF models for peat thickness were trained on 25,200 points grouped into six geographic regions. Validation of the peat thickness estimates showed a good performance, with the coefficient of determination (R2) ranging from 0.15 to 0.72. The prediction for peat BD and CC followed the same model architecture and were trained on 17,000 and 7,000 points, respectively. Overall, BD and CC models performed well and consistently across soil layers with average R2 values of 0.61 for BD and 0.48 for CC. Based on the estimated peat thickness, BD and CC, the carbon stock of global peatland was estimated to be 1,029 Pg C for peat dominated area of 6.57 million km2.

In this article, the first detailed stable isotope data of 359 ground ice samples are presented. This first data set provides a new basis for understanding the hydrological effects of permafrost degradation on the QTP. 
 Considered the Asian water tower, the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (QTP) processes substantial permafrost, and its hydrological environments are spatially different and can be easily disturbed by changing permafrost and melting ground ice. Permafrost degradation compels melting permafrost to become an important source of surface runoff, changes the storage of groundwater, and greatly influences the hydrological processes in permafrost regions. However, the evidence linking permafrost degradation and hydrological processes on the QTP is lacking, which increases the uncertainties in the evaluation of the results of changing permafrost on the water resources. Stable isotopes offer valuable information on the connections between changing permafrost (ground ice) and water components. It is therefore particularly important to observe the changes in the stable isotopes of different waterbodies which can vary over hourly to annual timescales and truly capture the thawing signals and reflect the influence of permafrost (ground ice) on the regional hydrological processes. The Beiluhe Basin (BLH) in the hinterland of the QTP was selected; it integrates all the water components related to hydrological cycles well and is an ideal site to study the hydrological effect of permafrost change. This paper presents the temporal data of stable isotopes (δ18O, δD, and d-excess) in different waterbodies (precipitation, stream water, thermokarst lake, and groundwater) in the BLH produced between 2017 and 2022. Here, the first detailed stable isotope data of ground ice at 17 boreholes and 2 thaw slumps are presented. A detailed description of the sampling processes, sample pretreating processes, and isotopic data quality control is given. The data first described the full seasonal isotope amplitude in the precipitation, stream, and thermokarst lakes and delineated the depth isotopic variability in ground ice. In total, 554 precipitation samples, 2402 lake/pond samples, 675 stream water samples, 102 supra-permafrost water samples, and 19 sub-permafrost water samples were collected during 6 years of continuous sampling work. Importantly, 359 ground ice samples at different depths from 17 boreholes and 2 profiles were collected. This first dataset provides a new basis for understanding the hydrological effects of permafrost degradation on the QTP. It also provides support for the cryospheric study on the Northern Hemisphere.

To accurately asses these impacts, we developed a machine learning model to downscale daily climate data to hourly Temperature Humidity Index (THI) values. We utilised historical weather data to train our model and applied it to future climate projections, under two climate scenarios. 
 Climate change poses a significant threat to agriculture, with potential impacts on food security, economic stability, and human livelihoods. Dairy cattle, a crucial component of the livestock sector, are particularly vulnerable to heat stress, which can adversely affect milk production, immune function, feed intake, and in extreme cases, lead to mortality. The Temperature Humidity Index (THI) is a widely used metric to quantify the combined effects of temperature and humidity on cattle. However, most studies estimate THI using daily-level data, which fails to capture the full extent of daily thermal load and cumulative heat stress, especially during nights when cooling is inadequate. To address this limitation, we developed a machine learning approach to temporally downscale daily climate data to hourly THI values. Utilizing historical ERA5 reanalysis data, we trained an XGBoost model and generated hourly THI datasets for 12 NEX-GDDP-CMIP6 climate models under two emission scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5) extending to the end of the century. This high-resolution THI data provides a more accurate assessment of heat stress in dairy cattle, enabling better predictions and management strategies to mitigate the impacts of climate change on this vital agricultural sector."

Our study created a comprehensive Alaska inventory combining various data sources with which we improved infrastructure classification and data on contaminated sites. This resource is presented as a GeoPackage allowing planning of infrastructure damage and possible implications for Arctic communities facing permafrost challenges. 
 The Arctic region has undergone warming at a rate more than 3 times higher than the global average. This warming has led to the degradation of near-surface permafrost, resulting in decreased ground stability. This instability not only poses a primary hazard to Arctic infrastructure and human-impacted areas but can also lead to secondary ecological hazards from infrastructure failure associated with hazardous materials. This development underscores the need for a comprehensive inventory of critical infrastructure and human-impacted areas. The inventory should be linked to environmental data to assess their susceptibility to permafrost degradation as well as the ecological consequences that may arise from infrastructure failure. Here, we provide such an inventory for Alaska, a vast state covering approximately 1.7 × 106 km2, with a population of over 733 000 people and a history of industrial development on permafrost. Our Synthesized Inventory of CRitical Infrastructure and HUman-Impacted Areas in AlaSka (SIRIUS) integrates data from (i) the Sentinel-1/2-derived Arctic Coastal Human Impact dataset (SACHI); (ii) OpenStreetMap (OSM); (iii) the pan-Arctic Catchment Database (ARCADE); (iv) a dataset of permafrost extent, probability and mean annual ground temperatures; and (v) the Contaminated Sites Database and reports to create a unified new dataset of critical infrastructure and human-impacted areas as well as permafrost and watershed information for Alaska. The integration process included harmonizing spatial references, extents and geometries across all the datasets as well as incorporating a uniform usage type classification scheme for the infrastructure data. Additionally, we employed text-mining techniques to generate complementary geospatial data from textual reports on contaminated sites, including details on contaminants, cleanup duration and the affected media. The combination of SACHI and OSM enhanced the detail of the usage type classification for infrastructure from 5 to 13 categories, allowing the identification of elements critical to Arctic communities beyond industrial sites. Further, the new inventory integrates the high spatial detail of OSM with the unbiased infrastructure detection capability of SACHI, accurately representing 94 % of the  polygonal infrastructure and 78 % of the linear infrastructure, respectively. The SIRIUS dataset is presented as a GeoPackage, enabling spatial analysis and queries of its components, either as a function of or in combination with one another.

Pendergrass;Michael P. Byrne;Oliver Watt-Meyer;Penelope Maher;Mark J. Webb,Impact of ITCZ width on global climate: ITCZ-MIP,"The width of the tropical rain belt affects many aspects of our climate, yet we do not understand what controls it. To better understand it, we present a method to change it in numerical model experiments. We show that the method works well in four different models. The behavior of the width is unexpectedly simple in some ways, such as how strong the winds are as it changes, but in other ways, it is more complicated, especially how temperature increases with carbon dioxide. 
 The width of the Inter-Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) affects tropical rainfall, Earth's albedo, large-scale circulation, and climate sensitivity. To better understand the ITCZ width and its effects on global climate, we present a protocol to force changes in ITCZ width in climate models. Starting from an aquaplanet configuration with a slab ocean, adding surface heat fluxes in the deep tropics forces the ITCZ to narrow, and subtracting them causes it to widen. The protocol successfully generates changes in ITCZ width in all four climate models used in this study. ITCZ width in each model responds linearly to forcing magnitude and sign. Comparing across the four climate models, a response to varying ITCZ width that is remarkably consistent among models is the ITCZ strength, which is greater the narrower the ITCZ. On the other hand, the effect of varying ITCZ width on climate sensitivity is divergent among our four models, varying even in sign. Results from this pilot study highlight the connections between surface fluxes, ITCZ width, and the wider climate. A comprehensive model intercomparison project (MIP) has the potential to advance understanding of both the physical processes shaping ITCZ width and its influence on remote atmospheric circulations and global climate."

The method locally adjusts resolution in regions which are most relevant to modelling, based on the properties of the plasma. The runs testing this method show that adaptive refinement manages to highlight the desired regions with manageable performance overhead. Performance in larger-scale production runs and mitigation of overhead are avenues of further research. 
 Automatically adaptive grid resolution is a common way of improving simulation accuracy while keeping computational efficiency at a manageable level. In space physics, adaptive grid strategies are especially useful as simulation volumes are extreme, while the most accurate physical description is based on electron dynamics and hence requires very small grid cells and time steps. Therefore, many past global simulations encompassing, for example, near-Earth space have made tradeoffs in terms of the physical description and laws of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) used that require less accurate grid resolutions. Recently, using supercomputers, it has become possible to model the near-Earth space domain with an ion-kinetic hybrid scheme going beyond MHD-based fluid dynamics. These simulations, however, must develop a new adaptive mesh strategy beyond what is used in MHD simulations.We developed an automatically adaptive grid refinement strategy for ion-kinetic hybrid-Vlasov schemes, and we implemented it within the Vlasiator global solar wind–magnetosphere–ionosphere simulation. This method automatically adapts the resolution of the Vlasiator grid using two indices: one formed as a maximum of dimensionless gradients measuring the rate of spatial change in selected variables and the other derived from the ratio of the current density to the magnetic field density perpendicular to the current. Both these indices can be tuned independently to reach a desired level of refinement and computational load. We test the indices independently and compare the results to a control run using static refinement.The results show that adaptive refinement highlights relevant regions of the simulation domain and keeps the computational effort at a manageable level. We find that the refinement shows some overhead in the rate of cells solved per second. This overhead can be large compared to the control run without adaptive refinement, possibly due to resource utilization, grid complexity, and issues in load balancing. These issues lay out a development roadmap for future optimizations."

The current study explored the potential of deploying a coupled modelling framework for the estimation and forecasting of this parameter. The framework showed promising potential in addressing the challenge of estimating and forecasting the under-ice discharge. 
 Year-round river discharge estimation and forecasting is a critical component of sustainable water resource management. However, in cold climate regions such as Canada, this basic task gets intricated due to the challenge of river ice conditions. River ice conditions are dynamic and can change quickly in a short period of time. This dynamic nature makes river ice conditions difficult to forecast. Moreover, the observation of under-ice river discharge also remains a challenge since no reliable method for its estimation has been developed till date. It is therefore an active field of research and development. The integration of river ice hydraulic models in forecasting systems has remained relatively uncommon. The current study has two main objectives: first is to demonstrate the development and capabilities of a river ice forecasting system based on coupled hydrological and hydraulic modelling approach for the Chaudière River in Québec; and second is to assess its functionality over selected winter events. The forecasting system is developed within a well-known operational forecasting platform: the Delft Flood Early Warning System (Delft-FEWS). The current configuration of the systems integrates (i) meteorological products such as the Regional Ensemble Prediction System (REPS); (ii) a hydrological module implemented through the HydrOlOgical Prediction LAboratory (HOOPLA), a multi-model based hydrological modelling framework; and (iii) hydraulic module implemented through a 1D steady and unsteady HEC-RAS river ice models. The system produces ensemble forecasts for discharge and water level and provides flexibility to modify various dynamic parameters within the modelling chain such as discharge timeseries, ice thickness, ice roughness as well as carryout hindcasting experiments in a batch production way. Performance of the coupled modelling approach was assessed using “Perfect forecast” over winter events between 2020 and 2023 winter seasons. The root mean square error (RMSE) and percent bias (Pbias) metrics were calculated. The hydrologic module of the system showed significant deviations from the observations. These deviations could be explained by the inherent uncertainty in the under-ice discharge estimates as well as uncertainty in the modelling chain. The hydraulic module of the system performed better and the Pbias was within ±10 %."

The coded equation terms in the governing equations that are sensitive (or insensitive) to the precision level have been identified. The performance of mixed-precision computing in weather and climate simulations was analyzed. 
 Atmosphere modelling applications are becoming increasingly memory-bound due to the inconsistent development rates between processor speeds and memory bandwidth. In this study, we mitigate memory bottlenecks and reduce the computational load of the Global–Regional Integrated Forecast System (GRIST) dynamical core by adopting a mixed-precision computing strategy. Guided by an application of the iterative development principle, we identify the coded equation terms that are precision insensitive and modify them from double to single precision. The results show that most precision-sensitive terms are predominantly linked to pressure gradient and gravity terms, while most precision-insensitive terms are advective terms. Without using more computing resources, computational time can be saved, and the physical performance of the model is largely kept. In the standard computational test, the reference runtime of the model's dry hydrostatic core, dry nonhydrostatic core, and the tracer transport module is reduced by 24 %, 27 %, and 44 %, respectively. A series of idealized tests, real-world weather and climate modelling tests, was performed to assess the optimized model performance qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, in the long-term coarse-resolution climate simulation, the precision-induced sensitivity can manifest at the large scale, while in the kilometre-scale weather forecast simulation, the model's sensitivity to the precision level is mainly limited to small-scale features, and the wall-clock time is reduced by 25.5 % from the double- to mixed-precision full-model simulations."

This advancement reduces false alarms and enhances global tsunami warning systems' accuracy and efficiency. 
 We introduce a tsunami warning technology towards a global real-time analysis. The technology is based on the analysis of acoustic signals generated together with the tsunami, due to the compression of the water layer.

 uDALES is an open-source multi-physics microscale urban modelling tool, capable of performing large-eddy simulation (LES) of urban airflow, heat transfer, and pollutant dispersion. We present uDALES v2.0, which has two main new features: (1) an improved parallelisation that prepares the codebase for conducting exascale simulations and (2) a conservative immersed boundary method (IBM) suitable for an urban surface that does not need to be aligned with the underlying Cartesian grid. The urban geometry and local topography are incorporated via a triangulated surface with a resolution that is independent of the fluid grid. The IBM developed here includes the use of wall functions to apply surface fluxes, and the exchange of heat and moisture between the surface and the air is conservative by construction. We perform a number of validation simulations, ranging from neutral, coupled internal–external flows and non-neutral cases. We observe close agreement with the relevant literature, both in cases in which the buildings are aligned with the Cartesian grid and when they are at an angle. We introduce a validation case specifically for urban applications, for which we show that supporting non-grid-aligned geometries is crucial when solving surface energy balances, with errors of up to 20 % associated with using a grid-aligned geometry."

Compared to other S2S models, the IAP-CAS model has its benefits but also biases, i.e., underdispersive ensemble, overestimated amplitude, and faster propagation speed when forecasting MJO. We provide a reason for these biases and prospects for further improvement of this system in the future. 
 The Madden–Julian Oscillation (MJO) is a crucial predictability source on a subseasonal-to-seasonal (S2S) timescale. Therefore, the models participating in the World Weather Research Programme and the World Climate Research Programme (WWRP/WCRP) S2S prediction project focus on accurately predicting and analyzing the MJO. This study provides a detailed description of the configuration within the Institute of Atmospheric Physics at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (IAP-CAS) S2S forecast system. We assess the accuracy of the IAP-CAS model's MJO forecast using traditional Real-time Multivariate MJO (RMM) analysis and cluster analysis. Then, we explain the reasons behind any bias observed in the MJO forecast. Comparing the 20-year hindcast with observations, we found that the IAP-CAS ensemble mean has a skill of 24 d. However, the ensemble spread still has potential for improvement. To examine the MJO structure in detail, we use cluster analysis to classify the MJO events during boreal winter into four types: fast-propagating, slow-propagating, standing, and jumping patterns of MJO. The model exhibits biases of overestimated amplitude and faster propagation speed in the propagating MJO events. Upon further analysis, it was found that the model forecasted a wetter background state. This leads to stronger forecasted convection and coupled waves, especially in the fast MJO events. The overestimation of the strength and length of MJO-coupled waves results in a faster MJO mode and quicker dissipation in the IAP-CAS model. These findings show that the IAP-CAS skillfully forecasts signals of MJO and its propagation, and they also provide valuable guidance for improving the current MJO forecast by developing the ensemble system and moisture forecast."

Hilmar Gudmundsson,Numerical stabilization methods for level-set-based ice front migration,"We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the stabilization and reinitialization techniques currently employed in ISSM and Úa for solving level-set equations, specifically those related to the dynamic representation of moving ice fronts within numerical ice sheet models. Our results demonstrate that the streamline upwind Petrov–Galerkin (SUPG) method outperforms the other approaches. We found that excessively frequent reinitialization can lead to exceptionally high errors in simulations. 
 Numerical modeling of ice sheet dynamics is a critical tool for projecting future sea level rise. Among all the processes responsible for the loss of mass of the ice sheets, enhanced ice discharge triggered by the retreat of marine-terminating glaciers is one of the key drivers. Numerical models of ice sheet flow are therefore required to include ice front migration in order to reproduce today's mass loss and to be able to predict their future. However, the discontinuous nature of calving poses a significant numerical challenge for accurately capturing the motion of the ice front. In this study, we explore different stabilization techniques combined with varying reinitialization strategies to enhance the numerical stability and accuracy of solving the level-set function, which tracks the position of the ice front. Through rigorous testing on an idealized domain with a semicircular and a straight-line ice front, including scenarios with diverse front velocities, we assess the performance of these techniques. The findings contribute to advancing our ability to model ice sheet dynamics, specifically calving processes, and provide valuable insights into the most effective strategies for simulating and tracking the motion of the ice front."

Wing;Levi G. Silvers;Kevin A. Reed,RCEMIP-II: mock-Walker simulations as phase II of the radiative–convective equilibrium model intercomparison project,"This paper presents the experimental design for a model intercomparison project to study tropical clouds and climate. It is a follow-up from a prior project that used a simplified framework for tropical climate. The new project adds one new component – a specified pattern of sea surface temperatures as the lower boundary condition. We provide example results from one cloud-resolving model and one global climate model and test the sensitivity to the experimental parameters. 
 The radiative–convective equilibrium (RCE) model intercomparison project (RCEMIP) leveraged the simplicity of RCE to focus attention on moist convective processes and their interactions with radiation and circulation across a wide range of model types including cloud-resolving models (CRMs), general circulation models (GCMs), single-column models, global cloud-resolving models, and large-eddy simulations. While several robust results emerged across the spectrum of models that participated in the first phase of RCEMIP (RCEMIP-I), two points that stand out are (1) the strikingly large diversity in simulated climate states and (2) the strong imprint of convective self-aggregation on the climate state. However, the lack of consensus in the structure of self-aggregation and its response to warming is a barrier to understanding. Gaining a deeper understanding of convective aggregation and tropical climate will require reducing the degrees of freedom with which convection can vary. Therefore, we propose phase II of RCEMIP (RCEMIP-II) that utilizes a prescribed sinusoidal sea surface temperature (SST) pattern to provide a constraint on the structure of convection and move one critical step up the model hierarchy. This so-called “mock-Walker” configuration generates features that resemble observed tropical circulations. The specification of the mock-Walker protocol for RCEMIP-II is described, along with example results from one CRM and one GCM. RCEMIP-II will consist of five required simulations: three simulations with the same three mean SSTs as in RCEMIP-I but with an SST gradient and two additional simulations at one of the mean SSTs with different values of the SST gradients. We also test the sensitivity to the imposed SST gradient and the domain size. Under weak SST gradients, unforced self-aggregation emerges across the entire domain, similar to what was found in RCEMIP. As the SST gradient increases, the convective region narrows and is more confined to the warmest SSTs. At warmer mean SSTs and stronger SST gradients, low-frequency variability in the convective aggregation emerges, suggesting that simulations of at least 200 d may be needed to achieve robust equilibrium statistics in this configuration. Simulations with different domain sizes generally have similar mean statistics and convective structures, depending on the value of the SST gradient. The prescribed SST boundary condition is the only difference in the set-up between RCEMIP-II and RCEMIP-I, which enables comparison between the two; however, we also welcome participation in RCEMIP-II from models that did not participate in RCEMIP-I."

To analyze their physiology, diversity, and evolution in the ocean, we developed a model that treats phytoplankton as individual particles. Moreover, our model considers phytoplankton size, temperature, and light traits, and allows for mutations in phytoplankton cells. Thus, our model provides a valuable tool for advancing the study of phytoplankton physiology, diversity, and evolution. 
 Phytoplankton is a diverse group of photosynthetic organisms and accounts for almost half of global primary production. However, most existing marine ecosystem models incorporate limited phytoplankton diversity, overlook phytoplankton evolution, and treat phytoplankton as concentrations instead of particles. Here we present an individual-based phytoplankton model that captures three dimensions of phytoplankton traits (size, temperature, and light affinities) and allows phytoplankton cells to mutate in a one-dimensional (1D) water column. Other components of this ecosystem include dissolved inorganic nitrogen, twenty size classes of zooplankton, and detritus, all modelled as Eulerian fields. This hybrid plankton model can reproduce the general seasonal patterns of nutrients, chlorophyll, and primary production in the subtropical ocean. We expect that this model will be a useful tool for studying phytoplankton physiology, diversity and evolution in the ocean."

DCESS II has considerably greater spatial resolution than DCESS I while retaining the fine, 100 m vertical resolution in the ocean. It contains modules for the atmosphere, ocean, ocean sediment, land biosphere and lithosphere and is designed to deal with global change simulations on scales of years to millions of years while using limited computational resources. Tracers of the atmospheric module are temperature, nitrous oxide, methane (12,13C isotopes), carbon dioxide (12,13,14C isotopes) and atmospheric oxygen. For the ocean module, tracers are conservative temperature, absolute salinity, water 18O, phosphate, dissolved inorganic carbon (12,13,14C isotopes), alkalinity and dissolved oxygen. Furthermore, the ocean module considers simplified dynamical schemes for large-scale meridional circulation and sea-ice dynamics, stratification-dependent vertical diffusion, a gravity current approach to the formation of Antarctic Bottom Water and improvements in ocean biogeochemistry. DCESS II has two hemispheres with six zonal-averaged atmospheric boxes and twelve ocean boxes distributed across the Indian-Pacific, the Atlantic, the Arctic and the Southern Oceans.

This parameterization captures the effect of finite-amplitude, mixed layer eddies as an overturning streamfunction and has the primary function of restratification. Herein, we outline the changes to the mean climate state of E3SM that were introduced by the addition of this parameterization. Overall, the presence of the submesoscale parameterization improves the fidelity of the v2.1 simulation by reducing the North Atlantic ocean surface biases present in v2, as illustrated by changes to the climatological sea surface temperature and salinity, as well as Arctic sea-ice extent. Other impacts include a slight shoaling of the mixed layer depths in the North Atlantic, as well as a small improvement to the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC). We note that the expected shoaling due to the parameterization is regionally dependent in our coupled configuration. In addition, we investigate why the parameterization and its impacts on mixed layer depth have little impact on the simulated AMOC: despite increased dense water formation in the Norwegian Sea, only a small fraction of the water formed makes its way south into the North Atlantic basin.

Python, as the ultimate glue language, enables the use of codes from nearly any programming language like Fortran, C++, Rust, and others. FINAM is designed to simplify the integration of various models with minimal effort, as demonstrated through various examples ranging from simple to complex systems. 
 In this study, we present a new coupling framework named FINAM (short for ""FINAM Is Not A Model""). FINAM is designed to facilitate the coupling of independently developed source codes and enable seamless model extensions by wrapping existing models into components with well-specified interfaces. Positioned between a coupling library and a full-fledged framework, FINAM allows users to couple preexisting wrapped models or to build models from scratch using its components. The primary goal of FINAM is to leverage the power of Python, facilitating rapid prototyping and ease of use for complex workflows while offloading computationally intensive parts to native models. FINAM supports bidirectional coupling of spatial models, enabling fast in-memory data exchange, and provides a consistent interface for flexible coupling. The main assumption for a successful coupling is that every model operates with a time loop at its core. This design of FINAM allows for straightforward model extensions written in Python without altering the original model source code. Python's robust interoperability features further enhance FINAM's capabilities, allowing interfaces with various programming languages including Fortran, C, C++, Rust, and others. This paper describes the main principles and modules of FINAM and presents example workflows to demonstrate its features. These examples range from simple toy models to well-established models like OpenGeoSys and Bodium covering features like bidirectional dependencies, complex model coupling, and spatio-temporal regridding."

Despite the importance of these lakes, there is increasing concern about the presence of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)─among the most prevalent contaminants of our time─due to the ability of PFAS to bioaccumulate and persist in the environment, as well as to its linkages to detrimental human and animal health effects. In this study, PFAS exposure on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is examined at the molecular level, focusing on the impact of PFAS binding on the alpha (α) and beta (β) estrogen receptors (ERs) using molecular dynamics simulations, binding free energy calculations, and structural analysis. ERs are involved in fundamental physiological processes, including reproductive system development, muscle regeneration, and immunity. This study shows that PFAS binds to both the estrogen α and estrogen β receptors, albeit via different binding modes, due to a modification of an amino acid in the binding site as a result of a reorientation of residues in the binding pocket. As ER overactivation can occur through environmental toxins and pollutants, this study provides insights into the influence of different types of PFAS on protein function."

As a novel alternative to BPA, 4-hydroxy-4′-isopropoxydiphenylsulfone (BPSIP) is frequently detected in breast milk and placental barrier systems, suggesting potential transmission from the mother to offspring and increased risk of exposure. Gestation and lactation are critical periods for central nervous system development, which are vulnerable to certain environmental pollutants. Herein, we investigated the behavioral impacts and neurobiological effects of early-life exposure to BPSIP (0.02, 0.1, and 0.5 mg/kg body weight/day) in mice offspring. Behavioral studies indicated that BPSIP exposure induced ASD-like behaviors, including elevated anxiety-related behavior and decreased spatial memory, in both male and female pups. A distinct pattern of reduced social novelty was observed only in female offspring, accompanied by significant alterations in antioxidant levels. Transcriptome analysis demonstrated that differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly enriched in pathways related to behaviors and neurodevelopment, which were consistent with the observed phenotype. Besides, a decrease in the protein levels of complex IV (COX IV) across all tested populations suggests a profound impact on mitochondrial function, potentially leading to abnormal energy metabolism in individuals with autism. Additionally, changes in synaptic proteins, evidenced by alterations in synapsin 1 (SYN1) and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) levels in the cerebellum and hippocampus, support the notion of synaptic involvement.

This study presents a systematic and intuitive picture of Cu toxicity induced by exogenous acidification in phytoplankton Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We first showed that acidification reduced the algal resistance to environmental Cu stress with a decreased growth rate and increased Cu bioaccumulation. To further investigate this phenomenon, we employed specific fluorescent probes to visualize the intracellular labile Cu pools in different algal cells. Our findings indicated that acidification disrupted the intracellular labile Cu trafficking, leading to a significant increase in labile Cu(I) pools. At the molecular level, Cu toxicity resulted in the inhibition of the Cu(I) import system and activation of the Cu(I) export system in acidic algal cells, likely a response to the imbalance in intracellular labile Cu trafficking. Subcellular analysis revealed that Cu toxicity induced extensive mitochondrial dysfunction and impacted the biogenesis and assembly of the respiratory chain complex in acidic algal cells. Concurrently, we proposed that the activation of polyP synthesis could potentially regulate disrupted intracellular labile Cu trafficking.

However, the bioavailability and fate of the immobilized metal(loid)s in SS-derived biochar (SSB) following land application remain largely unknown. Here, the speciation and bioavailability evolution of SSB-borne Cr and Zn in soil were systematically investigated by combining pot and field trials and X-ray absorption spectroscopy. Results showed that approximately 58% of Cr existing as Cr(III)-humic complex in SS were transformed into Fe (hydr)oxide-bound Cr(III), while nano-ZnS in SS was transformed into stable ZnS and ferrihydrite-bound species (accounting for over 90% of Zn in SSB) during pyrolysis. All immobilized metal(loid)s, including Cr and Zn, in SSB tended to be slowly remobilized during aging in soil. This study highlighted that SSB acted as a dual role of source and sink of metal(loid)s in soil and posed potential risks by serving a greater role of a metal(loid) source than a sink when applied to uncontaminated soils. Nevertheless, SSB could impede the translocation of metal(loid)s from soil to crop compared to SS, where coexisting elements, including Fe, P, and Zn, played critical roles.

The typical degradation route on titanium-based catalysts, “toluene–benzaldehyde–carbon dioxide”, necessitates the oxidation of the methyl group as a prerequisite for photocatalytic toluene oxidation. However, the inherent planar adsorption configuration of toluene molecules, dominated by the benzene rings, leads to significant steric hindrance for the methyl group. This steric hindrance prevents the methyl group from contacting the active species on the catalyst surface, thereby limiting the removal of toluene under indoor conditions. To date, no effective strategy to control the steric hindrance of the methyl group has been identified. Herein, we showed a B–Ti–O interface that exhibits significantly enhanced toluene removal efficiency under indoor conditions. In-depth investigations revealed that, compared to typical Ti-based photocatalysts, the steric hindrance between the methyl group and the catalyst surface decreased from 3.42 to 3.03 Å on the designed interface. This reduction originates from the matching of orbital energy levels between Ti 3dz2 and C 2pz of the benzene ring. The decreased steric hindrance improved the efficiency of toluene being attacked by surface active species, allowing for rapid conversion into benzaldehyde and benzoic acid species for subsequent reactions. Our work provides novel insights into the steric hindrance effect in the elimination of aromatic volatile organic compounds."

Results revealed that, in the presence of 2.0 mM S(IV), both As(V) and As(III) were selectively converted into scorodite at pH0 3.0–7.0, while As(III) oxidation and As(V) immobilization were impressed over pH0 8.0–10.0. Batch experiments, radical quenching experiments, and electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements demonstrated that ZVI initially boosted S(IV) activation to generate SO4•–, •OH, and protons, and in turn, ZVI was further oxidized more intensely by these radicals than by oxygen. Concurrently, substantial protons derived from S(IV) oxidation neutralized hydroxyls produced by ZVI oxidation, maintaining an acidic environment conducive to the generation of scorodite rather than iron (hydr)oxides. Characterizations of X-ray diffraction (XRD), Raman, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) confirmed that scorodite was formed in situ and then exfoliated from the surface of ZVI, and approximately 75% of ZVI could still be recovered, which contributed to efficient As removal in successive runs and real As-polluted wastewater. The application of S(IV) achieved a balance among ZVI reactivity improvement, As(V)/As(III) removal, and raw material consumption, making it a promising approach for addressing arsenic contamination in wastewater treatment."

Herein, we designed a nanoconfined FeCo2O4-embedded ceramic membrane (FeCo2O4−CM) under flow-through pattern for PMS activation. Confining PMS and FeCo2O4 within nanochannels (3.0−4.7 nm) enhanced adsorption interactions (−7.84 eV vs −2.20 eV), thus boosting mass transfer. Nanoconfinement effect regulated electron transfer pathways from PMS to FeCo2O4−CM by modulating the active site transformation to ≡Co(III) in nanoconfined FeCo2O4−CM, enabling selectively generating 1O2. The primary role of 1O2 in the nanoconfined system was confirmed by kinetic solvent isotope experiments and indicative anthracene endoperoxide (DPAO2). The system enabled 100% removal of atrazine (ATZ) within a hydraulic retention time of 2.124 ms, demonstrating a rate constant over 5 orders of magnitude higher than the nonconfined system (3.50 × 103 s−1 vs 0.42 min−1). It also exhibited strong resilience to pH variations (3.3−9.0) and coexisting substances, demonstrating excellent stability indicated by consistent 100% ATZ removal for 14 days. This study sheds light on regulating electron transfer pathways to selectively generate 1O2 through the nanoconfinement effect, boosting the practical application of PMS-based AOPs in environmental remediation and potentially applying them to various other AOPs."

Here, we propose an electrochemical acid–base transport limitation (eABTL) principle for inertness-based sensing, offering a new insight into generating ES signals from an interfacial transport process rather than electron transfer. This principle enables potential ES application for various weak acids and bases (WABs) without reactions themselves. We established an eABTLP method for detecting orthophosphate in solutions as a proof of concept, demonstrating commendable accuracy and precision, and a wide detection range from 10 μM to over 300 mM. Endogenous interferences were identified using 23 weak acids, indicating no significant endogenous interfering factors in typical wastewaters. Of them, volatile fatty acids are the main interference, but their effect can be eliminated by adjusting pH above 6.0. Exogenous factors like anions, cations, ion strength, temperature, organic load, and dissolved oxygen were examined, and most of their effects can be ignored by maintaining consistent analytical procedures between calibration curve and sample. Furthermore, measurement of wastewater samples confirmed the applicability toward domestic wastewater and demonstrated its wide applicability when combined with digestion pretreatment. Given the merits of inertness-based sensing, the eABTL-based methods have the potential to be a crucial part of ES techniques for environmental and industrial monitoring."

Here, we used hydrogen cyanide (HCN), which reacts with carbonyls to form photochemically inert cyanohydrins, as a probe to re-examine the role of carbonyls in CO photoproduction. Adding HCN to low-absorbance euphotic zone seawater decreased CO photoproduction. Modeling [HCN] (∼5 to 364 μM) vs the percent decrease in CO photoproduction (%CO↓) yielded carbonyl-cyanohydrin dissociation equilibrium constants, KD, and maximum %CO↓, %CO↓max values. Four Atlantic and Pacific seawater KDs (66.7 ± 19.6 μM) overlap aqueous aliphatic but not aromatic aldehyde KDs. Phenylacetaldehyde (PA) and other β,γ-unsaturated aldehydes are proposed as prototypical CO precursors. Direct photolysis of ∼10 nM PA can supply the measured daily production of HCN-sensitive CO at an open-ocean site near Bermuda. HCN’s %CO↓max was 31 ± 2.5% in North Atlantic seawater vs the 13 ± 2.5% inhibition of CO photoproduction by borohydride, a dilemma since only borohydride affects most ketones. Borohydride also decreased CDOM absorption much more than did HCN. This puzzle probably reflects differing steric and solvation requirements in HCN- and borohydride-CDOM reactions. This study demonstrates cyanophilic aldehydes to be a significant source of open-ocean CO and reveals new clues regarding CDOM photochemistry mechanisms."

Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonic acid emerged as the dominant PFAS, constituting 49% and 13% of the total PFAS concentrations, respectively. Notably, nine CF3-containing emerging PFAS were identified by the high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based screening. Specifically, hexafluoroisopropanol and bistriflimide (NTf2) were consistently identified across all the samples, with quantified concentrations reaching up to 854 and 90 ng/g dw, respectively. This suggests their potential association with electronic manufacturing and recycling processes. Furthermore, except for NTf2, all the identified emerging PFAS were confirmed as precursors of TFA with molar yields of 8.87–40.0% by the TOP assay validation in Milli-Q water.

To date, 53 African countries have submitted their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), and four have committed to a net-zero target. However, many of Africa’s NDCs are vaguely expressed and without specific focus on explicit sectoral decarbonization targets. Furthermore, Africa’s huge land-based carbon dioxide removal (CDR) potential remains unclear in the context of enabling net-zero emissions within the continent. This study achieves two objectives: Under a NZ GHG emission trajectory in Africa, we uncover the implications of a targeted zero-emission electricity sector by 2030, on the energy landscape and other sustainability factors.  This study also features the role of land-based biological removal methods─bioenergy carbon capture and storage (BECCS) and afforestation/reforestation (A/R)─in net zero actualization in Africa. Our results reveal a unified but disparate actualisation of the mid-century net zero emission goal across the continent, as all regions except North Africa achieve carbon neutrality. The industrial sector  faces significant difficulties in transitioning and contributes  substantially to positive emissions on the continent, with its share of total residual emissions reaching 49–64% by 2050. This difficulty persists even with targeted sectoral decarbonization of the electricity sector, although it is significantly reduced by the availability of BECCS as a CDR option. Under thezero-emission electricity pathway, emissions in buildings and transport sectors are reduced due to rapid electrification. A trade-off emerges in the net zero pathway concerning land allocation for negative emissions versus other land use activities. A key result shows that achieving a net zero target in Africa leads to a cumulative loss of $102 billion in fossil fuel infrastructure within the electricity sector by mid-century, which doubles when the zero-emission electricity goal is achieved."

However, our understanding of their foliar uptake, translocation, and trophic transfer profiles is limited due to a lack of quantitative analytical tools to effectively probe mechanisms of action. Here, using synthesized deuterium (2H) stable isotope-labeled polystyrene nanoplastics (2H-PSNPs), the foliar accumulation and translocation of NPs in lettuce and the dynamics of NP transfer along a lettuce–snail terrestrial food chain were investigated. Raman imaging and scanning electron microscopy demonstrated that foliar-applied NPs aggregated on the leaf surface, entered the mesophyll tissue via the stomatal pathway, and eventually translocated to root tissues. Quantitative analysis showed that increasing levels of foliar exposure to 2H-PSNPs (0.1, 1, and 5 mg/L in spray solutions, equivalent to receiving 0.15, 1.5, and 7.5 μg/d of NPs per plant) enhanced NP accumulation in leaves, with concentrations ranging from 0.73 to 15.6 μg/g (dw), but only limited translocation (<5%) to roots. After feeding on 5 mg/L 2H-PSNP-contaminated lettuce leaves for 14 days, snails accumulated NPs at 0.33 to 10.7 μg/kg (dw), with an overall kinetic trophic transfer factor of 0.45, demonstrating trophic dilution in this food chain. The reduced ingestion rate of 3.18 mg/g/day in exposed snails compared to 6.43 mg/g/day can be attributed to the accumulation of 2H-PSNPs and elevated levels of chemical defense metabolites in the lettuce leaves, which decreased the palatability for snails and disrupted their digestive function.

The loss of redox sites and competitive adsorption of H2O prevalent in the treatment of industrial exhaust gases are the main reasons for the weak mineralization ability and poor water vapor resistance of V-based catalysts. In this work, platinum (Pt) is selected to combine with the V/CeO2 catalyst, which provides more redox sites and H2O dissociative activation sites and further enhances its catalytic performance. The results show that PtV/CeO2 achieves 90% of the CO2 yield at 318 °C and maintains excellent catalytic activity rather than continuous deactivation within 15 h after water vapor injection. The formation of Pt–O–V bonds enhances the redox ability and promotes deep oxidation of polychlorinated intermediates, accounting for the significantly improved mineralization ability of PtV/CeO2.

In this study, we tackled this challenge through a series of column experiments involving fine (100–300 μm) and coarse (1.0–1.4 mm) sand particles coated with birnessite (MnO2) under variable saturation degrees. Dynamic flow experiments in sand columns revealed that desaturation altered the ability of MnO2 in removing tetracycline (TTC), a redox-active antibiotic, yet the effect depends on the sand type and then on the saturation degree. Moderate saturation degrees in fine-grained sand columns promoted fractional and preferential water flow which favored a more acidic pH and increased dissolved oxygen levels. These conditions enhanced TTC removal, despite the reduced physical accessibility of reactive phases. In contrast, lower saturation degrees in coarse-grained sand columns induced stronger flow heterogeneity with a very small fraction of the water content participating in flow. The mobility behavior of all the columns was predicted using transport models that consider TTC adsorption and transformation, as well as dual porosity under variable water saturation degrees. This research offers valuable insights into predicting the fate and transport of redox-active contaminants in unsaturated soils and subsurface environments."

Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that TBC exposure reduced estrogen receptor alpha (ERα) expression and increased nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB) expression, while E2 treatment rebalanced the expression levels of ERα and NF-κB to their normative states. Our findings indicate that TBC, as an antiestrogenic agent, may contribute to the pathogenesis of COPD through an ERα-mediated inflammatory pathway, but that E2 treatment could reverse the impairment, providing a potentially promising remedial treatment. Given the lung status as a primary target of air pollution, the presence of antiestrogenic compounds like TBC in atmospheric particulates presents a significant concern, with the potential to exacerbate respiratory conditions such as COPD and pneumonia."

Here, 24 targeted PFAS in seawater, sediments, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and plankton in the offshore region adjacent to this estuary were investigated. The three dominant PFAS in all phases were perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, 23.8–61.9%), perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA, 23.6–42.8%), and perfluoro(2-methyl-3-oxahexanoic) acid (HFPO-DA, 6.1–12.1%), and perfluoro-1-butane sulfonamide (FBSA, 0.1–7.3%) was first detected. The horizontal distributions of PFAS were dependent on salinity and disturbed by multiple water masses, while the vertical variations could be explained by their different partitioning characteristics in the water-SPM-sediment system (partition coefficients, Log Kd and Log Koc) and plankton (bioaccumulation factors, Log BAF). Although physical mixing was the major driver for PFAS settling (>83.7%), the absolute settling amount caused by the biological pump was still high (150.00–41994.65 ng m–2 day–1). More importantly, we found unexpected high Log Kd values of PFBA (2.24–4.55) and HFPO-DA (2.26–4.67), equal to PFOA (2.28–4.72), which brought concerns about their environmental persistence.

However, the role of crystal water, incorporated into minerals through hydration during rock cycles, in O2 activation remains largely unexplored. Here, we construct tungstite models containing oxygen vacancies to elucidate the modulation of mineral-based ROS dynamics by the synergy between oxygen vacancy and crystal water. Crystal water promotes the protonation process of superoxide anion radicals to produce hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and alleviates its decomposition. This mineral-based H2O2 photosynthesis system efficiently eliminates organic pollutants in a sequential light–dark reaction. Furthermore, this synergy effect can extend to other metal oxide minerals such as TiO2, SnO2, CuO, ZnO, and Bi2O3.

We herein demonstrate more effective removal of 28 halogenated aromatic DBPs in the UV/H2O2 AOP at 222 nm (UV222) than in the conventional UV/H2O2 AOP at 254 nm. Direct photolysis of 28 halogenated aromatic DBPs was greatly enhanced at 222 nm with fluence-based photodecay rate constants of 4.31 × 10–4–1.53 × 10–2 cm2 mJ–1, which was mainly attributed to the higher molar absorption coefficients of halogenated aromatic DBPs at 222 nm than 254 nm. Generally, quantum yields of halogenated aromatic DBPs at both 222  and 254 nm followed the order of halophenols > halohydroxybenzaldehydes > halonitrophenols.

The UV fluence required to achieve 90% loss of halogenated aromatic DBPs in the UV222/H2O2 AOP was 75–95% lower than that in the UV254/H2O2 AOP, and 90% removal of most tested halogenated aromatic DBPs can be achieved in the UV222/H2O2 AOP within the UV fluence levels commonly applied in potable reuse (700–1000 mJ cm–2)."

Employing maize, wheat, pea, and water spinach, we conducted a thorough investigation utilizing a multispecies, multiparameter, and multitechnique approach to assess the pollution characteristics and ecotoxicological effects of lithium. The findings suggested that lithium might persist in an amorphous state, altering surface functional groups and chemical bonds, although semiquantitative analysis was unattainable. Notably, lithium demonstrated high mobility, with a mild acid-soluble fraction accounting for 29.66–97.02% of the total, while a minor quantity of exogenous lithium tended to be a residual fraction. Plant analysis revealed that in 10–80 mg Li/kg soils lithium significantly enhanced certain growth parameters of maize and pea, and the calculated LC50 values for aerial part length across the four plant species varied from 173.58 to 315.63 mg Li/kg. Lithium accumulation in the leaves was up to 1127.61–4719.22 mg/kg, with its inorganic form accounting for 18.60–94.59%, and the cytoplasm fraction (38.24–89.70%) predominantly harbored lithium. Furthermore, the model displayed that growth stimulation might be attributed to the influence of lithium on phytohormone levels.

Subcritical hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) as an emerging green technology has demonstrated remarkable promise in environmental remediation. However, there is limited research on the remediation of highly toxic Cr(VI) using HTL. This study reveals that the HTL reaction of biomass enables the simultaneous reduction and precipitation of Cr(VI). At 280 °C, the reduction of Cr(VI) was nearly complete, with a high reduction rate of 98.9%. The reduced Cr as Cr(OH)3 and Cr2O3 was primarily enriched in hydrochar, accounting for over 99.9% of the total amount. This effective enrichment resulted in the removal of Cr(VI) from the aqueous phase while simultaneously yielding clean liquid compounds like organic acids and furfural. Furthermore, the elevated temperature facilitated the formation of Cr(III) and enhanced its accumulation within hydrochar. Notably, the resulting hydrochar and small oxygenated compounds, especially aldehyde, served as electron donors for Cr(VI) reduction. Additionally, the dissolved Cr facilitated the depolymerization and deoxygenation processes of macromolecular compounds with lignin-like structures, leading to more small oxygenated compounds and subsequently influencing Cr(VI) reduction.

However, the transport pathways and storm responses of different nitrogen forms remain elusive. We used high-frequency chemical and isotopic sampling to partition sources of stormwater runoff and determine transport pathways of multiple nitrogen forms in an agricultural catchment. Bayesian mixing modeling reveals shallow subsurface water as the dominant source of stormwater runoff, contributing 74% of the water flux and 72, 71, and 79% of total nitrogen (TN), total dissolved nitrogen (TDN), and nitrate (NO3-N), respectively. Groundwater, by contrast, contributed 11% of stormwater runoff and 21, 22, and 17% of TN, TDN, and NO3-N, respectively. The remaining 14% of stormwater runoff can be attributed to rainwater, which contains much less TN, TDN, and NO3-N. Surprisingly, during storm events, the dominant nitrogen form was NO3-N rather than dissolved organic nitrogen. Antecedent conditions and runoff characteristics have an important influence on nitrogen loads during storm events.

Humans inevitably ingest FLCMs via food and the environment. However, there are limited studies on internal exposure biomonitoring of FLCMs. Herein, we evaluated the estimated daily intakes (EDIs) of FLCMs in the general population based on serum residue levels. For the first time, 38 FLCMs were detected in 314 serum samples from the general population in Beijing, with a median value of 132.48 ng/g of lipid weight (lw). BDPrB is a predominant FLCM in serum. The median EDI of ∑38FLCMs in the general residents was 37.96 pg/kg bw/day. The residual levels of most FLCMs were higher in urban than in suburban areas (p < 0.05). The concentrations of EFPEB, EDPrB, EDFPBB, and PDTFMTFT in serum showed positive associations with blood glucose (GLU) (r = 0.126–0.275, p < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis showed that FLCMs were significantly positively correlated with dyslipidemia, with an odds ratio of 2.19; BDPrB was significantly positively correlated with hyperglycemia (OR: 2.48).

However, the potential environmental health impacts of BAC on fish remain poorly explored. In this study, we show that BAC and TCS can induce the gut dysbiosis in zebrafish (Danio rerio), with substantial effects on health. Breeding pairs of adult zebrafish were exposed to environmentally relevant concentrations of BAC and TCS (0.4–40 μg/L) for 42 days. Both BAC and TCS exposure perturbed the gut microbiota, triggering the classical NF-κB signaling pathway and resulting in downstream pathological toxicity associated with inflammatory responses, histological damage, inhibited ingestion, and decreased survival. These effects were dose-dependent and sex-specific, as female zebrafish were more susceptible than male zebrafish. Furthermore, we found that BAC induced toxicity to a greater extent than the restricted TCS at environmentally relevant concentrations, which is particularly concerning. Our results suggest that environmental exposure to antimicrobial chemicals can have ecological consequences by perturbing the gut microbiota, a previously underappreciated target of such chemicals.

However, their adsorption behaviors are usually compromised at ambient conditions, attributed to the competitive VOCs adsorption with water vapor. In this study, we demonstrated that the selectivity for toluene than water of carbon can be effectively enhanced by introducing more sp2-carbon with two-dimensional nanosheets stacked. The multilayer carbon nanosheets enriched with sp2-carbon (CNS-MCA) exhibit a 151° H2O-contact angle, indicating hydrophobicity. Dynamic adsorption behaviors revealed that CNS-MCA retain 71% of their toluene adsorption capacity (91 mg/g) even at 60% relative humidity. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations, static adsorption studies, in situ Raman spectroscopy, and time-resolved in situ nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy collectively indicate that toluene exhibits enhanced adsorption and selectivity due to π–π* interactions between its aromatic rings and the sp2-carbon. Conversely, water adsorption is attenuated, attributed to the reduced availability of surface-exposed hydrogen bonds associated with sp2-carbon and the inherent hydrophobic nature of multilayer graphene.

Our results showed that approximately 37–79% of Cd in rice grains was contributed by atmospheric deposition through root and foliar uptake during the rice growing season, while the deposited Cd accounted for a small proportion of the soil pools. The highly bioavailable metals in atmospheric deposition significantly increased the soil DGT-measured bioavailable fraction; yet, this fraction rapidly aged following a first-order exponential decay model, leading to similar percentages of the bioavailable fraction in soils exposed for 1–3 years. The enrichment of light Cd isotopes in the atmospheric deposition resulted in a significant shift toward lighter Cd isotopes in rice plants. Using a modified isotopic mass balance model, foliar and root uptake of deposited Cd accounted for 47–51% and 28–36% in leaves, 41–45% and 22–30% in stems, and 45–49% and 26–30% in grains, respectively.

Machine learning has been previously used to identify compounds based on SERS spectral data. However, utilization of SERS to quantify concentrations, with or without machine learning, has been difficult due to the spectral intensity being sensitive to confounding factors such as the substrate parameters, orientation of the analyte, and sample preparation technique. Here, we demonstrate an approach for predicting the concentration of sample pollutants from SERS spectra using machine learning. Frequency domain transform methods, including the Fourier and Walsh–Hadamard transforms, are applied to spectral data sets of three analytes (rhodamine 6G, chlorpyrifos, and triclosan), which are then used to train machine learning algorithms. Using standard machine learning models, the concentration of the sample pollutants is predicted with >80% cross-validation accuracy from raw SERS data. A cross-validation accuracy of 85% was achieved using deep learning for a moderately sized data set (∼100 spectra), and 70–80% was achieved for small data sets (∼50 spectra). Performance can be maintained within this range even when combining various sample preparation techniques and environmental media interference. Additionally, as a spectral pretreatment, the Fourier and Hadamard transforms are shown to consistently improve prediction accuracy across multiple data sets. Finally, standard models were shown to accurately identify characteristic peaks of compounds via analysis of their importance scores, further verifying their predictive value."

Generally, concentrations of OPEs in the SML were higher than in the underlying waters. Concentrations in the SML were correlated with the chlorophyll α content for some OPEs, consistent with biogenic surfactants at the SML. The enrichment factors (ratio of concentrations in SML over concentrations in underlying waters) were 5.84 ± 8.97 and 9.10 ± 9.48 for the Atlantic and Southern Oceans, respectively. The average enrichment factors in sea spray aerosols (SSA), estimated using previously reported aerosol-phase concentrations, ranged from 3.69 × 104 to 3.33 × 106.

However, the underlying mechanisms for this are still unclear. In this study, we conducted a comprehensive comparative analysis of hydrochar and pyrochar, examining the soil N2O mitigation potential from denitrification, electron shuttle functionality, soil microbial composition, and denitrification genes dynamics. Our results conclusively establish that hydrochar outperforms pyrochar due to its exceptional electron transfer capacity, characterized by higher electron exchange capacity (EEC), abundance of electron-donating moieties and more prevalent electron transfer components. Notably, the lower concentration of persistent free radicals (PFRs) in hydrochar results in unimpeded expression of the nosZ gene, promoting complete denitrification and resulting in reduced N2O emissions. These findings highlight hydrochar’s potential as an electron shuttle and underscore its promise as a superior soil amendment for mitigating N2O emissions compared to pyrochar."

Lacking an obviously oxidizable functional group, alcohols are tacitly assumed to be inert with respect to common water treatment oxidants and favored for their low cost, low toxicity, and miscibility with water. While attempting to duplicate a previous result reporting formaldehyde as a product of dimethylamine chlorination, we found that a substantial amount of formaldehyde was generated when the dimethylamine dosing solution was prepared in methanol but not when it was prepared in water. We further found that under conditions typical of chlorination kinetics experiments, aqueous methanol concentrations as low as 0.4% (v/v) could significantly deplete chlorine compared to methanol-free controls. In the presence of increasing methanol concentrations, chlorine depletion half-lives decreased to ∼4 h at 2% methanol. Finally, we examined the chlorination of five primary alcohols and one secondary alcohol, which all formed the corresponding carbonyls at comparable rates. These findings raise doubts about the routine use of alcohols as carrier solvents for the preparation of stock solutions in research on aqueous chlorination reactions and highlight alcohols as a potential source of aldehyde formation during chlorination."

With a revised National Ambient Air Quality Standard (NAAQS, at 9 μg/m3) for particulate matter (PM) in the United States (U.S.), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will likely classify new non-attainment areas due primarily to emissions from RWH. Agencies will use emissions factors (EFs) to develop attainment strategies. Many will rely on EPA modeling platforms based on data from the National Emissions Inventory (NEI). The NEI uses RWH EFs based on data from mid-1990’s in-situ studies and a speciation profile from a 2001 study of fireplace emissions. The NEI does not include greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for this sector, which plays a key role when assessing climate reduction strategies for the buildings sector. Here, we tested seven wood stoves to determine EFs, representing various vintages and control technologies, using a novel test method that reflects in-use operational settings called the Integrated Duty Cycle. The study measured multiple pollutants concurrently: criteria pollutants (particulate matter [PM], CO, and NOx), nonmethane total hydrocarbons (NMTHCs), GHGs, black carbon (eBC), brown carbon (BrC), and multiple hazardous air pollutants (HAPs). We found no significant difference in PM EFs between uncertified and non-catalytic stove technologies. RWH EF results from this study exceeded 2020 NEI RWH EFs for NMTHC and multiple HAPs. Applying our study’s EFs to the 2020 NEI suggests that RWH, compared to all other sources, ranks as the 2nd largest source category of formaldehyde; the 3rd largest of benzene, 1,3-butadiene, and acrolein; and the 4th largest of Pb emissions. RWH also emits more methane compared to natural gas or oil residential heating, raising questions about substitution of wood as a climate neutral heating fuel. However, compared to uncertified stoves, pellet stove EFs (except toxic metals) were significantly lower (p < 0.01). In summary, RWH appears to be an underestimated source of PM (non-catalytic technology), methane, NMTHC, toxic metals, and other HAPs, which has important implications for climate and public health policy in the U.S. and globally."

Abbatt,The Role of Indoor Surface pH in Controlling the Fate of Acids and Bases in an Unoccupied Residence,"The chemical composition of indoor air is strongly driven by the composition and properties of indoor surfaces. At the Chemical Assessments of Surfaces and Air (CASA) campaign, we performed controlled additions of ammonia (reaching up to 297 ppb to 662 ppb) to investigate the impacts of changing surface basicity on the fate of gaseous and particulate acids and bases in an unoccupied house. In response to ammonia injections, nitrogen-containing compounds (C2–7H3–11N1O0–3) were emitted from surfaces to the gas phase with signals increasing 101% to 104% compared to their signals prior to ammonia addition. At the same time, oxygen-containing compounds (C1–7H2–6O2–3) were removed from the gas phase by indoor surface partitioning. Indoor surface pH and aerosol pH likely increased during these controlled ammonia injections relative to their baseline conditions. We estimate indoor surface pH to be nearly 5 and indoor aerosol pH to range from 2 to 4 during this experiment. At each ammonia injection, we observed ammonium and nitrate concentrations in the aerosol phase to increase due to gas-particle partitioning of ammonia and nitric acid. This gas-particle-surface exchange showed strong dependence on relative humidity; evaporation of gaseous bases was more pronounced at lower relative humidity when surface-associated water volume was reduced, while gas-to-particle partitioning of inorganic species was greater in the presence of more aerosol liquid water at higher relative humidity. From cooking experiments, which represent realistic sources of acids and bases to the indoor environment but which emit 10 times less ammonia than was introduced to the house via pure ammonia injection experiments, we predict that surfaces may still be important sources of these basic gases to indoor air."

These infections are highly prevalent and are often linked to waterborne diseases. Due to the absence of regulations for monitoring these protozoa at the discharge points of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), the effluents reaching surface waters contribute to waterborne transmission. This underscores the significance of the removal capacities of WWTPs in reducing the spread of these infectious parasites. Therefore, this study examined five different types of WWTPs in Ankara, Turkey, over a year to assess their capacities to remove E. histolytica and B. hominis. The seasonal abundances of genes specific to these protozoa in both the influents and effluents of each WWTP were measured using a quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The reduction in the number of protozoan rDNA copies between the influent and effluent samples was evaluated as the removal capacity, expressed in log10 reduction (LRV) values. The results elucidated that the removal of E. histolytica and B. hominis was highly affected by the process used. Membrane bioreactor systems displayed the highest removal capacity with LRV > 3. Therefore, discharges of WWTPs with other processes could need further monitoring to minimize the potential risk for public health."

Nonetheless, how prenatal exposure to metals eventually results in long-term effects on the gut microbiome, leading to subclinical intestinal inflammation, particularly during late childhood, has not been studied. It is also unknown whether such an interactive effect drives a specific subgroup of children toward elevated susceptibility to intestinal inflammation. We used an amalgamation of machine-learning techniques with a regression-based framework to explore if children with distinct sets of gut microbes and certain patterns of exposure to metals during pregnancy (metal–microbial clique signature) had a higher likelihood of intestinal inflammation, measured based on fecal calprotectin (FC) in late childhood. We obtained samples from a well-characterized longitudinal birth cohort from Mexico City (n = 108), Mexico. In the second and third trimesters of pregnancy, 11 metals were measured in whole blood. Gut microbial abundances and FC were measured in stool samples from children 9–11 years of age. Elevated FC was defined as having FC above 100 μg/g of stool. We identified subgroups of children in whom microbial and metal–microbial clique signatures were associated with elevated FC (false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.05). In particular, we found two metal–microbial clique signatures significantly associated with elevated FC: (1) low cesium (Cs) and copper (Cu) in the third trimester and low relative abundance of Eubacterium ventriosum (OR [95%CI]: 10.27 [3.57,29.52], FDR < 0.001) and (2) low Cu in the third trimester and high relative abundances of Roseburia inulinivorans and Ruminococcus torques (OR [95%CI]: 7.21 [1.81,28.77], FDR < 0.05). This exploratory study demonstrates that children with specific gut microbes and specific exposure patterns to metals during pregnancy may have higher fecal calprotectin levels in late childhood, denoting an elevated risk of intestinal inflammation."

We searched three databases up to January 31, 2024, for eligible original studies to ultimately include 37 studies from eight countries with a total of 28 911 participants. DEHP exposure was evaluated with urinary metabolites. Since the main types, production sites, blood concentrations, and functions of reproductive hormones differ between men and women, we reported the combined effect values by gender. Subgroup analyses were conducted by age, subfertility status, and the national sociodemographic index (SDI) level. Furthermore, the effect of maternal exposure during pregnancy on children’s reproductive hormone levels was analyzed separately. Overall, in general, in men, DEHP was positively correlated with sex hormone binding-globulin (SHBG) and adversely correlated with total testosterone (TT), free androgen index (FAI), and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). Results indicated that among men of reproductive age, DEHP exposure was associated with more significant hormonal suppression in infertile men compared with fertile men. Notably, age subgroup analysis among women revealed that postmenopausal women were more vulnerable to DEHP, which was related to lower TT and estradiol (E2). However, this study did not observe a significant association between prenatal DEHP metabolites and reproductive hormone levels in children.

However, epidemiological evidence on the mediating role of maternal thyroid hormones is limited. Therefore, this study, based on the Compliance Birth Cohort, aimed to reveal the potential mediating function of maternal thyroid hormones during pregnancy between phthalic acid ester (PAE) exposure and neonatal birth weight. The study included 1274 mother–infant pairs. Linear regression analysis revealed a negative association between MIBP and neonatal birth weight (β = −62.236; 95% CI: −118.842, −5.631). Bayesian kernel-machine regression (BKMR) indicated a nonlinear negative association between PAE metabolites (PAEs) and birth weight. Linear regression analysis revealed a positive association between neonatal birth weight and FT3 (β = 41.605; 95% CI: 2.631, 80.380). The BKMR model also found a positive association between thyroid hormones and birth weight but in a nonlinear manner. Additionally, linear regression analyses showed that TSH, TT3, TT4, FT3, and FT4 were associated with PAEs. The BKMR model revealed an inverted U-shaped association of PAEs with TT3 and FT3 and a nonlinear association with TSH, TT4, and FT4. Structural equation modeling revealed that MMP, MIBP, MBP, MEHP, MOP, MBZP, and MEOHP contributed to a net reduction in neonatal birth weight of 32 g through the TT3, FT3, TT4, and FT4 pathways. The findings suggest that exposure to PAEs during pregnancy leads to a reduction in neonatal birth weight, possibly due to the involvement of maternal thyroid hormones as mediators. Controlling maternal thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy may be a viable method to reduce the harmful effects of phthalate exposure on the developing fetus."

However, identifying the main constituents of chemical mixtures that pose ecological threats is challenging due to the necessity of an integrated workflow for comprehensive identification and toxicological prioritization of pollutants. Here, an all-in-one mass spectrometric strategy integrating target, suspect, and nontarget analysis was used to investigate organic pollutants of concern in fishing port sediments, with 355 pollutants (32 from target analysis, 118 from suspect screening and 205 from nontarget analysis) identified in 11 categories. The chemical classes of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pesticides, and intermediates were the extensively detected chemical classes. The ecological risks of absolutely quantified pollutants (i.e., 16 parent PAHs, 7 organophosphate esters (OPEs), 10 pesticides and 4 benzotriazole ultraviolet absorbers) were assessed using toxicity-weighted concentration ranking, with o,p’-DDT being the major contributor. Under the toxicological priority index (ToxPi) framework, an extended ranking of all identified pollutants was achieved by combining instrument response and detection frequency, with a priority control list of 15 pollutants obtained, of which benzo[ghi]perylene (BghiP) and p,p’-DDE had the highest risk priority. Due to frequent detection rates and significant environmental risks, routine monitoring of petroleum pollutants is considered essential.

The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between dioxin andgestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), calculate the benchmark dose (BMD) of dioxin in coexposure scenarios, and derive a daily exposure threshold using an optimized physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model. Based on a nested case-control study including 77 cases with GDM and 154 controls, serum levels of 29 dioxin-like compounds (DLCs) along with 10 perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), seven polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and five non-dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (ndl-PCBs) were measured at 9–16 weeks of gestation. Bayesian machine kernel regression (BKMR) was employed to identify significant chemicals, and probit and logistic models were used to calculate BMD adjusted for significant chemicals. A physiologically based toxicokinetic (PBTK) model was optimized using polyfluorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PFDD/Fs) data by the Bayesian–Monte Carlo Markov chain method and was used to determine the daily dietary exposure threshold. The median serum level of total dioxin toxic equivalent (TEQ) was 7.72 pg TEQ/g fat. Logistic regression analysis revealed that individuals in the fifth quantile of total TEQ level had significantly higher odds of developing GDM compared to those in the first quantile (OR, 8.87; 95% CI 3.19, 27.58). The BKMR analysis identified dioxin TEQ and BDE-153 as the compounds with the greatest influence. The binary logistic and probit models showed that the BMD10 (benchmark dose corresponding to a 10% extra risk) and BMDL10 (lower bound on the BMD10) were 3.71 and 3.46 pg TEQ/g fat, respectively, when accounting for coexposure to BDE-153 up to the 80% level. Using the optimized PBTK model and modifying factor, it was estimated that daily exposure should be below 4.34 pg TEQ kg–1 bw week–1 in order to not reach a harmful serum concentration for GDM. Further studies should utilize coexposure statistical methods and physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBTK) models in reference dose calculation."

The lipophilic HOPs included polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and dechlorane plus (DPs), while the proteinophilic HOPs included perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). The results revealed that most of lipophilic HOPs exhibit lower depuration rate (kd) than PFCAs. The kd of lipophilic HOPs correlated with the octanol–water partition coefficient (log KOW) values in a V-shaped curve, whereas that of PFCAs correlated with the protein–water partition coefficient (log KPW) values in an inverted V-shaped curve. The depuration rate, rather than the uptake rate, was a leading factor in determining the bioaccumulation potential of HOPs in hens. Although the dominant factors determining the tissue distribution of the two types of compounds were explicit (fats vs phospholipids), chemical-specific tissue distribution was still observed. The egg-maternal concentration ratio was dependent on the exposure status, concentration, and maternal tissue choice. Using a single maternal tissue may not be an appropriate method for assessing chemical maternal transfer potential. PFCAs have a greater maternal transfer potential (>80% of the total body burden) than lipophilic HOPs (approximately 30% for BDE209 and DPs, and less than 10% for the others). Their lipophilic and partly proteinophilic nature makes the toxicokinetics and maternal transfer characteristics of BDE209 and DPs different from those of other lipophilic HOPs.

Understanding the mechanistic and quantitative aspects of OC delivery and preservation in marine sediments is critical for predicting the role of the oceans in modulating global climate. Yet, estimates of the global OC sedimentation in marginal settings span an order of magnitude, and the primary controls of OC preservation remain highly debated. Here, we provide the first global bottom‐up estimate of OC sedimentation along the margins using a synthesis of literature data. We quantify both terrestrial‐ and marine‐sourced OC fluxes and perform a statistical analysis to discern the key factors influencing their magnitude. We find that the margins host 23.2 ± 3.5 Tmol of OC sedimentation annually, with approximately 84% of marine origin. Accordingly, we calculate that only 2%–3% of OC exported from the euphotic zone escapes remineralization before sedimentation. Surprisingly, over half of all global OC sedimentation occurs below bottom waters with oxygen concentrations greater than 180 μM, while less than 4% occurs in settings with <50 μM oxygen. This challenges the prevailing paradigm that bottom‐water oxygen (BWO) is the primary control on OC preservation. Instead, our statistical analysis reveals that water depth is the most significant predictor of OC sedimentation, surpassing all other factors investigated, including BWO levels and sea‐surface chlorophyll concentrations. This finding suggests that the primary control on OC sedimentation is not production, but the ability of OC to resist remineralization during transit through the water column and while settling on the seafloor."

The hydrated, sulfate‐bearing mudstone has the highest potential to preserve organic matter and biosignatures, whereas the carbonate‐bearing sandstones can be used to constrain when and for how long Jezero crater contained liquid water.

The largest amplitude arrivals are linked to scattering at small‐scale lowermost mantle structure, but because these arrivals traverse both source and receiver sides of the mantle, it is unknown which side of the path the energy is scattered from. To address this ambiguity, we apply a new seismic array method to analyze PKP waveforms from 58 earthquakes recorded in North America that allows localization of the origin of the PKP precursors at the core‐mantle boundary (CMB). We compare these measurements with high frequency 2.5‐D synthetic predictions showing that the PKP precursors are most likely associated with ultra‐low velocity zone structures beneath the western Pacific and North America.

This study quantified tree growth, water use efficiency, and carbon‐water tradeoffs of young versus mature/old‐growth forest in three small (13–22 ha) watersheds in the H.J. Andrews Experimental Forest, Oregon, USA. To quantify and scale carbon‐water tradeoffs from trees to watersheds, tree‐ring records and greenness and wetness indices from remote sensing were combined with long‐term vegetation, climate, and streamflow data from young forest watersheds (trees ∼45 years of age) and from a mature/old‐growth forest watershed (trees 150–500 years of age). Biomass production was closely related to water use; water use efficiency (basal area increment per unit of evapotranspiration) was lower; and carbon‐water tradeoffs were steeper in young forest plantations compared with old‐growth forest for which the tree growth record begins in the 1850s. Greenness and wetness indices from Landsat imagery were not significant predictors of streamflow or tree growth over the period 1984 to 2017, and soil C and N did not differ significantly among watersheds. Multiple lines of evidence show that mature and old‐growth forest watersheds store and accumulate more carbon, are more drought resistant, and better sustain water availability compared to young forests. These results provide a basis for reconstructions and predictions that are potentially broadly applicable, because first‐order watersheds occupy 80%–90% of large river basins and study watersheds are representative of forest history in the Pacific Northwest region."

However, the coevolution of permafrost, river dynamics, and vegetation in Arctic environments remains poorly understood. As rivers meander, they erode the floodplain at cutbanks and build new land through bar deposition, creating sequences of landforms with distinct formation ages. Here we mapped these sequences along the Koyukuk River floodplain, Alaska, analyzing permafrost occurrence, and landform and vegetation types. We used radiocarbon and optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating to develop a floodplain age map. Deposit ages ranged from modern to 10 ka, with more younger deposits near the modern channel. Permafrost rapidly reached 50% areal extent in all deposits older than 200 years then gradually increased up to ∼85% extent for deposits greater than 4 Kyr old. Permafrost extent correlated with increases in black spruce and wetland abundance, as well as increases in permafrost extent within wetland, and shrub and scrub vegetation classes. We developed an inverse model to constrain permafrost formation rate as a function of air temperature. Permafrost extent initially increased by ∼25% per century, in pace with vegetation succession, before decelerating to <10% per millennia as insulating overbank mud and moss slowly accumulated. Modern permafrost extent on the Koyukuk floodplain therefore reflects a dynamic balance between widespread, time‐varying permafrost formation and rapid, localized degradation due to cutbank erosion that might trigger a rapid loss of permafrost with climatic warming."

Presently, measures of the in‐situ distribution of fault damage remain limited and along‐strike studies are rare. This study focuses on an offshore section Palos Verdes Fault damage zone that spans 28 km, near Los Angeles, California. To investigate the previously unresolved shallow (∼400 m below the seafloor) fault damage zone we use densely spaced (∼500 m line separation) newly collected sparker multichannel seismic lines and sub‐bottom profiles. The combination of high‐resolution acquisition methods and specialized seismic processing workflows provide improved imaging of shallow faulting. We apply a multi‐trace similarity technique to identify discontinuities in the seismic data that may be attributed to faults and fractures. This fault detection approach reveals diverse fault damage patterns on adjacent seismic profiles. However, a discernible damage zone pattern emerges by stacking multiple damage detection profiles along strike. We find that peak damage identified in this way corresponds to the active main fault strand, confirmed in this study, and thus the technique may be useful for identifying active fault strands elsewhere. Additionally, we observe that the variable width of the damage zone along strike is controlled by fault obliquity. Furthermore, our observations reveal a correlation between fault damage and seafloor fluid seeps visible in the water column, suggesting that damage plays a role in controlling fluid flow around the fault."

Reconstructions of present‐day subduction zone thermal structures using time‐invariant geodynamic models indicate relatively minor hydration, in contrast to many geophysical and geologic observations. We pair a dynamic, time‐evolving thermal model of subduction with phase equilibria modeling to investigate how variations in slab and forearc temperatures from subduction infancy through to maturity contribute to mantle wedge hydration. We find that thermal state during the intermediate period of subduction, as the slab freely descends through the upper mantle, promotes extensive forearc wedge hydration. In contrast, during early subduction the forearc is too hot to stabilize hydrous minerals in the mantle wedge, while during mature subduction, slab dehydration dominantly occurs beyond forearc depths. In our models, maximum wedge hydration during the intermediate phase is 60%–70% and falls to 20%–40% as quasi‐steady state conditions are approached during maturity. Comparison to global forearc H2O capacities reveals that consideration of thermal evolution leads to an order of magnitude increase in estimates for current extents of wedge hydration and provides better agreement with geophysical observations.

We show that six seamounts located in and around the Magellan Seamount chain—north of the Ontong‐Java Plateau (OJP)—have ages (87–106 Ma), geochemistry, and locations consistent with absolute plate motion model reconstructions of the Samoan hotspot track in the late Cretaceous, and three additional seamounts have geochemistry and locations consistent with a Samoan origin. However, a large segment of the Samoan hotspot (24–87 Ma) remains unidentified. Absolute plate motion models show that, from ∼60 to 30 Ma, the OJP passed over the Samoan plume. The exceptional thickness of the OJP lithosphere may have largely suppressed Samoan plume melting because the inferred volcanic trace of the Samoan hotspot wanes, and then disappears, on the OJP. Fortunately, 44 Ma volcanism at Malaita Island, located on the southern margin of the OJP, has a location, age, and geochemistry consistent with a Samoan plume origin, and provides a “missing link” bridging the younger and older segments of the Samoan hotspot. Our synthesis of geochemical, geochronological, and plate motion model evidence reveals that Samoa exhibits a clear hotspot age progression for over 100 Myr. Passage of ancient plateaus over young plumes—here called “plume‐plateau” interaction—may be relatively common: the OJP also passed over the putative Rarotonga hotspot, and the Society and Pitcairn hotspots were overtopped by the Manihiki Plateau."

Increased resolution may help simulate realistic tropical cyclone intensification. We examined fully coupled, global storm‐resolving models run at resolutions in the range 28–2.8 km in the atmosphere and 28–5 km in the ocean. Simulated tropical cyclone activity, peak intensity, intensification rate, and horizontal wind structure are all more realistic at a resolution of ∼5 km compared with coarser resolutions. Rapid intensification, which is absent at typical climate model resolutions, is also captured, and exhibits sensitivity to how, and if, deep convection is parameterized. Additionally, the observed decrease in inner‐core horizontal size with increasing intensification rate is captured at storm‐resolving resolution. These findings highlight the importance of global storm‐resolving models for quantifying risk and understanding the role of intense tropical cyclones in the climate system."

While semi-synthetic methods leveraging the functional groups found in polar and aromatic amino acids have been extensively explored, highly selective and general approaches to transform unactivated C–H bonds in aliphatic amino acids remain less developed4,5 Here, we disclose a stepwise dehydrogenative method to convert aliphatic amino acids into structurally diverse analogs. The key to the success of this approach lies in the development of a selective catalytic acceptorless dehydrogenation method driven by photochemical irradiation, which provides access to terminal alkene intermediates for downstream functionalization. Overall, this strategy enables the rapid synthesis of new amino acid building blocks and suggests possibilities for the late-stage modification of more complex oligopeptides."

 Numerous correlated many-body phases, both conventional and exotic, have been reported in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG)1–24. However, the dynamics associated with these correlated states, crucial for understanding the underlying physics, remain unexplored. Here we combine exciton sensing and optical pump–probe spectroscopy to investigate the dynamics of isospin orders in MATBG with WSe2 substrate across the entire flat band, achieving sub-picosecond resolution. We observe remarkably slow isospin dynamics in a broad filling range around ν = 2 and between ν = −3 and −2, with lifetimes of up to 300 ps that decouple from the much faster cooling of electronic temperature (about 10 ps). This non-thermal behaviour demonstrates the presence of abnormally long-lived modes in the isospin degrees of freedom. This observation, not anticipated by theory, implies the existence of long-range propagating collective modes, strong isospin fluctuations and memory effects and is probably associated with an intervalley coherent or incommensurate Kekulé spiral ground state. We further demonstrate non-equilibrium control of the isospin orders previously found around integer fillings. Specifically, through ultrafast manipulation, it can be transiently shifted away from integer fillings. Our study demonstrates a unique probe of collective excitations in MATBG and paves the way for actively controlling non-equilibrium phenomena in moiré systems.

Here, we report the magnetic field response of vortex bound states in superconducting topological crystalline insulator SnTe (001) films. Several MZMs were predicted to coexist in a single vortex due to magnetic mirror symmetry. Using a scanning tunnelling microscope equipped with a three-axis vector magnet, we found that the zero-bias peak (ZBP) in a single vortex exhibits an apparent anisotropic response even though the magnetic field is weak. The ZBP can robustly extend a long distance of up to approximately 100 nm at the (001) surface when the magnetic field is parallel to the (

 Alzheimer’s disease (AD) has recently been associated with diverse cell states1–11, yet when and how these states affect the onset of AD remains unclear. Here we used a data-driven approach to reconstruct the dynamics of the brain’s cellular environment and identified a trajectory leading to AD that is distinct from other ageing-related effects. First, we built a comprehensive cell atlas of the aged prefrontal cortex from 1.65 million single-nucleus RNA-sequencing profiles sampled from 437 older individuals, and identified specific glial and neuronal subpopulations associated with AD-related traits. Causal modelling then prioritized two distinct lipid-associated microglial subpopulations—one drives amyloid-β proteinopathy while the other mediates the effect of amyloid-β on tau proteinopathy—as well as an astrocyte subpopulation that mediates the effect of tau on cognitive decline. To model the dynamics of cellular environments, we devised the BEYOND methodology, which identified two distinct trajectories of brain ageing, each defined by coordinated progressive changes in certain cellular communities that lead to (1) AD dementia or (2) alternative brain ageing. Thus, we provide a cellular foundation for a new perspective on AD pathophysiology that informs personalized therapeutic development, targeting different cellular communities for individuals on the path to AD or to alternative brain ageing.

 Romantic engagement can bias sensory perception. This ‘love blindness’ reflects a common behavioural principle across organisms: favouring pursuit of a coveted reward over potential risks1. In the case of animal courtship, such sensory biases may support reproductive success but can also expose individuals to danger, such as predation2,3. However, how neural networks balance the trade-off between risk and reward is unknown. Here we discover a dopamine-governed filter mechanism in male Drosophila that reduces threat perception as courtship progresses. We show that during early courtship stages, threat-activated visual neurons inhibit central courtship nodes via specific serotonergic neurons. This serotonergic inhibition prompts flies to abort courtship when they see imminent danger. However, as flies advance in the courtship process, the dopaminergic filter system reduces visual threat responses, shifting the balance from survival to mating. By recording neural activity from males as they approach mating, we demonstrate that progress in courtship is registered as dopaminergic activity levels ramping up. This dopamine signalling inhibits the visual threat detection pathway via Dop2R receptors, allowing male flies to focus on courtship when they are close to copulation. Thus, dopamine signalling biases sensory perception based on perceived goal proximity, to prioritize between competing behaviours.

 Spatial learning in teleost fish requires an intact telencephalon1, a brain region that contains putative analogues to components of the mammalian limbic system (for example, hippocampus)2–4. However, cells fundamental to spatial cognition in mammals—for example, place cells (PCs)5,6—have yet to be established in any fish species. In this study, using tracking microscopy to record brain-wide calcium activity in freely swimming larval zebrafish7, we compute the spatial information content8 of each neuron across the brain. Strikingly, in every recorded animal, cells with the highest spatial specificity were enriched in the zebrafish telencephalon. These PCs form a population code of space from which we can decode the animal’s spatial location across time. By continuous recording of population-level activity, we found that the activity manifold of PCs refines and untangles over time. Through systematic manipulation of allothetic and idiothetic cues, we demonstrate that zebrafish PCs integrate multiple sources of information and can flexibly remap to form distinct spatial maps. Using analysis of neighbourhood distance between PCs across environments, we found evidence for a weakly preconfigured network in the telencephalon. The discovery of zebrafish PCs represents a step forward in our understanding of spatial cognition across species and the functional role of the early vertebrate telencephalon.

 Early expansion and long-term persistence predict efficacy of chimeric antigen receptor T cells (CARTs)1–7, but mechanisms governing effector versus memory CART differentiation and whether asymmetric cell division induces differential fates in human CARTs remain unclear. Here we show that target-induced proximity labelling enables isolation of first-division proximal-daughter and distal-daughter CD8 CARTs that asymmetrically distribute their surface proteome and transcriptome, resulting in divergent fates. Target-engaged CARs remain on proximal daughters, which inherit a surface proteome resembling activated-undivided CARTs, whereas the endogenous T cell receptor and CD8 enrich on distal daughters, whose surface proteome resembles resting CARTs, correlating with glycolytic and oxidative metabolism, respectively. Despite memory-precursor phenotype and in vivo longevity, distal daughters demonstrate transient potent cytolytic activity similar to proximal daughters, uncovering an effector-like state in distal daughters destined to become memory CARTs. Both partitioning of pre-existing transcripts and changes in RNA velocity contribute to asymmetry of fate-determining factors, resulting in diametrically opposed transcriptional trajectories. Independent of naive, memory or effector surface immunophenotype, proximal-daughter CARTs use core sets of transcription factors known to support proliferation and effector function. Conversely, transcription factors enriched in distal daughters restrain differentiation and promote longevity, evidenced by diminished long-term in vivo persistence and function of distal-daughter CARTs after IKZF1 disruption. These studies establish asymmetric cell division as a framework for understanding mechanisms of CART differentiation and improving therapeutic outcomes.

 Sterile inflammation after myocardial infarction is classically credited to myeloid cells interacting with dead cell debris in the infarct zone1,2. Here we show that cardiomyocytes are the dominant initiators of a previously undescribed type I interferon response in the infarct borderzone. Using spatial transcriptomics analysis in mice and humans, we find that myocardial infarction induces colonies of interferon-induced cells (IFNICs) expressing interferon-stimulated genes decorating the borderzone, where cardiomyocytes experience mechanical stress, nuclear rupture and escape of chromosomal DNA. Cardiomyocyte-selective deletion of Irf3 abrogated IFNIC colonies, whereas mice lacking Irf3 in fibroblasts, macrophages, neutrophils or endothelial cells, Ccr2-deficient mice or plasmacytoid-dendritic-cell-depleted mice did not. Interferons blunted the protective matricellular programs and contractile function of borderzone fibroblasts, and increased vulnerability to pathological remodelling. In mice that died after myocardial infarction, IFNIC colonies were immediately adjacent to sites of ventricular rupture, while mice lacking IFNICs were protected from rupture and exhibited improved survival3. Together, these results reveal a pathological borderzone niche characterized by a cardiomyocyte-initiated innate immune response. We suggest that selective inhibition of IRF3 activation in non-immune cells could limit ischaemic cardiomyopathy while avoiding broad immunosuppression.

 Faithful DNA replication is essential for genome integrity1–4. Under-replicated DNA leads to defects in chromosome segregation, which are common during embryogenesis5–8. However, the regulation of DNA replication remains poorly understood in early mammalian embryos. Here we constructed a single-cell genome-wide DNA replication atlas of pre-implantation mouse embryos and identified an abrupt replication program switch accompanied by a transient period of genomic instability. In 1- and 2-cell embryos, we observed the complete absence of a replication timing program, and the entire genome replicated gradually and uniformly using extremely slow-moving replication forks. In 4-cell embryos, a somatic-cell-like replication timing program commenced abruptly. However, the fork speed was still slow, S phase was extended, and markers of replication stress, DNA damage and repair increased. This was followed by an increase in break-type chromosome segregation errors specifically during the 4-to-8-cell division with breakpoints enriched in late-replicating regions. These errors were rescued by nucleoside supplementation, which accelerated fork speed and reduced the replication stress. By the 8-cell stage, forks gained speed, S phase was no longer extended and chromosome aberrations decreased. Thus, a transient period of genomic instability exists during normal mouse development, preceded by an S phase lacking coordination between replisome-level regulation and megabase-scale replication timing regulation, implicating a link between their coordination and genome stability.

 Superconductivity in a highly correlated kagome system has been theoretically proposed for years (refs. 1–5), yet the experimental realization is hard to achieve6,7. The recently discovered vanadium-based kagome materials8, which exhibit both superconductivity9–11 and charge-density-wave orders12–14, are nonmagnetic8,9 and weakly correlated15,16. Thus these materials are unlikely to host the exotic superconductivity theoretically proposed. Here we report the discovery of a chromium-based kagome metal, CsCr3Sb5, which is contrastingly featured with strong electron correlations, frustrated magnetism and characteristic flat bands close to the Fermi level. Under ambient pressure, this kagome metal undergoes a concurrent structural and magnetic phase transition at 55 K, with a stripe-like 4a0 structural modulation. At high pressure, the phase transition evolves into two transitions, possibly associated with charge-density-wave and antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave orderings. These density-wave-like orders are gradually suppressed with pressure and, remarkably, a superconducting dome emerges at 3.65–8.0 GPa. The maximum of the superconducting transition temperature, Tcmax = 6.4 K, appears when the density-wave-like orders are completely suppressed at 4.2 GPa, and the normal state exhibits a non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, reminiscent of unconventional superconductivity and quantum criticality in iron-based superconductors17,18. Our work offers an unprecedented platform for investigating superconductivity in correlated kagome systems. The emergence of superconductivity under pressure is reported in a chromium-based kagome metal, CsCr3Sb5, which has strong electron correlations, frustrated magnetism and characteristic flat bands close to the Fermi level."

 Early plant responses to different stress situations often encompass cytosolic Ca2+ increases, plasma membrane depolarization and the generation of reactive oxygen species1–3. However, the mechanisms by which these signalling elements are translated into defined physiological outcomes are poorly understood. Here, to study the basis for encoding of specificity in plant signal processing, we used light-gated ion channels (channelrhodopsins). We developed a genetically engineered channelrhodopsin variant called XXM 2.0 with high Ca2+ conductance that enabled triggering cytosolic Ca2+ elevations in planta. Plant responses to light-induced Ca2+ influx through XXM 2.0 were studied side by side with effects caused by an anion efflux through the light-gated anion channelrhodopsin ACR1 2.04. Although both tools triggered membrane depolarizations, their activation led to distinct plant stress responses: XXM 2.0-induced Ca2+ signals stimulated production of reactive oxygen species and defence mechanisms; ACR1 2.0-mediated anion efflux triggered drought stress responses. Our findings imply that discrete Ca2+ signals and anion efflux serve as triggers for specific metabolic and transcriptional reprogramming enabling plants to adapt to particular stress situations. Our optogenetics approach unveiled that within plant leaves, distinct physiological responses are triggered by specific ion fluxes, which are accompanied by similar electrical signals. Using new optogenetic tools to induce distinct ion fluxes, a study shows that these discrete signals trigger different metabolic and transcriptional pathways that allow plants to respond to specific types of stress."

 Crystallographic phase engineering plays an important part in the precise control of the physical and electronic properties of materials. In two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (2D TMDs), phase engineering using chemical lithiation with the organometallization agent n-butyllithium (n-BuLi), to convert the semiconducting 2H (trigonal) to the metallic 1T (octahedral) phase, has been widely explored for applications in areas such as transistors, catalysis and batteries1–15. Although this chemical phase engineering can be performed at ambient temperatures and pressures, the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood, and the use of n-BuLi raises notable safety concerns. Here we optically visualize the archetypical phase transition from the 2H to the 1T phase in mono- and bilayer 2D TMDs and discover that this reaction can be accelerated by up to six orders of magnitude using low-power illumination at 455 nm. We identify that the above-gap illumination improves the rate-limiting charge-transfer kinetics through a photoredox process. We use this method to achieve rapid and high-quality phase engineering of TMDs and demonstrate that this methodology can be harnessed to inscribe arbitrary phase patterns with diffraction-limited edge resolution into few-layer TMDs. Finally, we replace pyrophoric n-BuLi with safer polycyclic aromatic organolithiation agents and show that their performance exceeds that of n-BuLi as a phase transition agent. Our work opens opportunities for exploring the in situ characterization of electrochemical processes and paves the way for sustainably scaling up materials and devices by photoredox phase engineering.

 The brain functions as a prediction machine, utilizing an internal model of the world to anticipate sensations and the outcomes of our actions. Discrepancies between expected and actual events, referred to as prediction errors, are leveraged to update the internal model and guide our attention towards unexpected events1–10. Despite the importance of prediction-error signals for various neural computations across the brain, surprisingly little is known about the neural circuit mechanisms responsible for their implementation. Here we describe a thalamocortical disinhibitory circuit that is required for generating sensory prediction-error signals in mouse primary visual cortex (V1). We show that violating animals’ predictions by an unexpected visual stimulus preferentially boosts responses of the layer 2/3 V1 neurons that are most selective for that stimulus. Prediction errors specifically amplify the unexpected visual input, rather than representing non-specific surprise or difference signals about how the visual input deviates from the animal’s predictions. This selective amplification is implemented by a cooperative mechanism requiring thalamic input from the pulvinar and cortical vasoactive-intestinal-peptide-expressing (VIP) inhibitory interneurons. In response to prediction errors, VIP neurons inhibit a specific subpopulation of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory interneurons that gate excitatory pulvinar input to V1, resulting in specific pulvinar-driven response amplification of the most stimulus-selective neurons in V1. Therefore, the brain prioritizes unpredicted sensory information by selectively increasing the salience of unpredicted sensory features through the synergistic interaction of thalamic input and neocortical disinhibitory circuits. Experiments in mice show that a cortico-thalamic circuit generates prediction-error signals in primary visual cortex that amplify visual input that deviates from animals’ expectations."

 Hundreds of millions of people now interact with language models, with uses ranging from help with writing1,2 to informing hiring decisions3. However, these language models are known to perpetuate systematic racial prejudices, making their judgements biased in problematic ways about groups such as African Americans4–7. Although previous research has focused on overt racism in language models, social scientists have argued that racism with a more subtle character has developed over time, particularly in the United States after the civil rights movement8,9. It is unknown whether this covert racism manifests in language models. Here, we demonstrate that language models embody covert racism in the form of dialect prejudice, exhibiting raciolinguistic stereotypes about speakers of African American English (AAE) that are more negative than any human stereotypes about African Americans ever experimentally recorded. By contrast, the language models’ overt stereotypes about African Americans are more positive. Dialect prejudice has the potential for harmful consequences: language models are more likely to suggest that speakers of AAE be assigned less-prestigious jobs, be convicted of crimes and be sentenced to death. Finally, we show that current practices of alleviating racial bias in language models, such as human preference alignment, exacerbate the discrepancy between covert and overt stereotypes, by superficially obscuring the racism that language models maintain on a deeper level. Our findings have far-reaching implications for the fair and safe use of language technology. Despite efforts to remove overt racial prejudice, language models using artificial intelligence still show covert racism against speakers of African American English that is triggered by features of the dialect."

 Human mutations in neuropeptide Y (NPY) have been linked to high body mass index but not altered dietary patterns1. Here we uncover the mechanism by which NPY in sympathetic neurons2,3 protects from obesity. Imaging of cleared mouse brown and white adipose tissue (BAT and WAT, respectively) established that NPY+ sympathetic axons are a smaller subset that mostly maps to the perivasculature; analysis of single-cell RNA sequencing datasets identified mural cells as the main NPY-responsive cells in adipose tissues. We show that NPY sustains the proliferation of mural cells, which are a source of thermogenic adipocytes in both BAT and WAT4–6. We found that diet-induced obesity leads to neuropathy of NPY+ axons and concomitant depletion of mural cells. This defect was replicated in mice with NPY abrogated from sympathetic neurons. The loss of NPY in sympathetic neurons whitened interscapular BAT, reducing its thermogenic ability and decreasing energy expenditure before the onset of obesity. It also caused adult-onset obesity of mice fed on a regular chow diet and rendered them more susceptible to diet-induced obesity without increasing food consumption. Our results indicate that, relative to central NPY, peripheral NPY produced by sympathetic nerves has the opposite effect on body weight by sustaining energy expenditure independently of food intake.

 Severe defects in human IFNγ immunity predispose individuals to both Bacillus Calmette–Guérin disease and tuberculosis, whereas milder defects predispose only to tuberculosis1. Here we report two adults with recurrent pulmonary tuberculosis who are homozygous for a private loss-of-function TNF variant. Neither has any other clinical phenotype and both mount normal clinical and biological inflammatory responses. Their leukocytes, including monocytes and monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) do not produce TNF, even after stimulation with IFNγ. Blood leukocyte subset development is normal in these patients. However, an impairment in the respiratory burst was observed in granulocyte–macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)-matured MDMs and alveolar macrophage-like (AML) cells2 from both patients with TNF deficiency, TNF- or TNFR1-deficient induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived GM-CSF-matured macrophages, and healthy control MDMs and AML cells differentiated with TNF blockers in vitro, and in lung macrophages treated with TNF blockers ex vivo. The stimulation of TNF-deficient iPS-cell-derived macrophages with TNF rescued the respiratory burst. These findings contrast with those for patients with inherited complete deficiency of the respiratory burst across all phagocytes, who are prone to multiple infections, including both Bacillus Calmette–Guérin disease and tuberculosis3. Human TNF is required for respiratory-burst-dependent immunity to Mycobacterium tuberculosis in macrophages but is surprisingly redundant otherwise, including for inflammation and immunity to weakly virulent mycobacteria and many other infectious agents.

 Fertilization introduces parental genetic information into the zygote to guide embryogenesis. Parental contributions to postfertilization development have been discussed for decades, and the data available show that both parents contribute to the zygotic transcriptome, suggesting a paternal role in early embryogenesis1–6. However, because the specific paternal effects on postfertilization development and the molecular pathways underpinning these effects remain poorly understood, paternal contribution to early embryogenesis and plant development has not yet been adequately demonstrated7. Here our research shows that TREE1 and its homologue DAZ3 are expressed exclusively in Arabidopsis sperm. Despite presenting no evident defects in sperm development and fertilization, tree1 daz3 unexpectedly led to aberrant differentiation of the embryo root stem cell niche. This defect persisted in seedlings and disrupted root tip regeneration, comparable to congenital defects in animals. TREE1 and DAZ3 function by suppression of maternal RKD2 transcription, thus mitigating the detrimental maternal effects from RKD2 on root stem cell niche. Therefore, our findings illuminate how genetic deficiencies in sperm can exert enduring paternal effects on specific plant organ differentiation and how parental-of-origin genes interact to ensure normal embryogenesis. This work also provides a new concept of how gamete quality or genetic deficiency can affect specific plant organ formation.

 Life-threatening thrombotic events and neurological symptoms are prevalent in COVID-19 and are persistent in patients with long COVID experiencing post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection1–4. Despite the clinical evidence1,5–7, the underlying mechanisms of coagulopathy in COVID-19 and its consequences in inflammation and neuropathology remain poorly understood and treatment options are insufficient. Fibrinogen, the central structural component of blood clots, is abundantly deposited in the lungs and brains of patients with COVID-19, correlates with disease severity and is a predictive biomarker for post-COVID-19 cognitive deficits1,5,8–10. Here we show that fibrin binds to the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, forming proinflammatory blood clots that drive systemic thromboinflammation and neuropathology in COVID-19. Fibrin, acting through its inflammatory domain, is required for oxidative stress and macrophage activation in the lungs, whereas it suppresses natural killer cells, after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Fibrin promotes neuroinflammation and neuronal loss after infection, as well as innate immune activation in the brain and lungs independently of active infection. A monoclonal antibody targeting the inflammatory fibrin domain provides protection from microglial activation and neuronal injury, as well as from thromboinflammation in the lung after infection. Thus, fibrin drives inflammation and neuropathology in SARS-CoV-2 infection, and fibrin-targeting immunotherapy may represent a therapeutic intervention for patients with acute COVID-19 and long COVID.

 Artificial intelligence-guided closed-loop experimentation has emerged as a promising method for optimization of objective functions1,2, but the substantial potential of this traditionally black-box approach to uncovering new chemical knowledge has remained largely untapped. Here we report the integration of closed-loop experiments with physics-based feature selection and supervised learning, denoted as closed-loop transfer (CLT), to yield chemical insights in parallel with optimization of objective functions. CLT was used to examine the factors dictating the photostability in solution of light-harvesting donor–acceptor molecules used in a variety of organic electronics applications, and showed fundamental insights including the importance of high-energy regions of the triplet state manifold. This was possible following automated modular synthesis and experimental characterization of only around 1.5% of the theoretical chemical space. This physics-informed model for photostability was strengthened using multiple experimental test sets and validated by tuning the triplet excited-state energy of the solvent to break out of the observed plateau in the closed-loop photostability optimization process. Further applications of CLT to additional materials systems support the generalizability of this strategy for augmenting closed-loop strategies. Broadly, these findings show that combining interpretable supervised learning models and physics-based features with closed-loop discovery processes can rapidly provide fundamental chemical insights.

 The rapid evolution of viruses generates proteins that are essential for infectivity and replication but with unknown functions, due to extreme sequence divergence1. Here, using a database of 67,715 newly predicted protein structures from 4,463 eukaryotic viral species, we found that 62% of viral proteins are structurally distinct and lack homologues in the AlphaFold database2,3. Among the remaining 38% of viral proteins, many have non-viral structural analogues that revealed surprising similarities between human pathogens and their eukaryotic hosts. Structural comparisons suggested putative functions for up to 25% of unannotated viral proteins, including those with roles in the evasion of innate immunity. In particular, RNA ligase T-like phosphodiesterases were found to resemble phage-encoded proteins that hydrolyse the host immune-activating cyclic dinucleotides 3′,3′- and 2′,3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP). Experimental analysis showed that RNA ligase T homologues encoded by avian poxviruses similarly hydrolyse cGAMP, showing that RNA ligase T-mediated targeting of cGAMP is an evolutionarily conserved mechanism of immune evasion that is present in both bacteriophage and eukaryotic viruses. Together, the viral protein structural database and analyses presented here afford new opportunities to identify mechanisms of virus–host interactions that are common across the virome.

 Seafloor anomalies along mid-ocean ridges with exceptionally thick and compositionally distinct basaltic crust, for example, at Iceland, suggest that the underlying mantle is hotter and chemically different from the adjacent subridge mantle. Here we present hafnium and neodymium isotope ratios of peridotites from the Charlie Gibbs Transform Zone, which is located at the southern end of the Reykjanes Ridge south-west of Iceland. These peridotites are strongly depleted in incompatible elements with extremely high hafnium isotope ratios, suggesting that they had already melted to a large extent before being incorporated into the plume, at least 1 billion years ago, and thereby also became less dense. We argue that seismic velocity anomalies, geodynamic models and geochemical affinities of ridge basalts connect the peridotites from the Charlie Gibbs Transform Zone to the ‘Iceland plume’. The thermochemical buoyancy of the moderately hot Iceland plume, but also that of other plumes worldwide, may therefore be strongly influenced by composition. Variable peridotite depletion along the rising Iceland plume could also cause the transient, density-driven pulses in plume flux, which have formed the V-shaped Reykjanes Ridge south of Iceland. Overall, expansion of a ridge-centred plume along adjacent ridges and melting of heterogeneous plume material explains the topographic swell, the seismic anomaly and the formation of V-shaped ridges, as well as the regional distribution of basalts with Icelandic affinity. The upwelling mantle beneath Iceland underwent melt depletion at least 1 billion years ago and is therefore compositionally buoyant, according to a study of neodymium and hafnium isotope ratios in peridotites from the Charlie Gibbs Transform Zone."

Palmer,Solid Earth forcing of Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events,"Enhanced chemical weathering following continental breakup may have driven a succession of Mesozoic oceanic anoxic events, according to tectonic and biogeochemical modelling. 
 Oceanic anoxic events are geologically abrupt phases of extreme oxygen depletion in the oceans that disrupted marine ecosystems and brought about evolutionary turnover. Typically lasting ~1.5 million years, these events occurred frequently during the Mesozoic era, from about 183 to 85 million years ago, an interval associated with continental breakup and widespread large igneous province volcanism. One hypothesis suggests that anoxic events resulted from enhanced chemical weathering of Earth’s surface in a greenhouse world shaped by high volcanic carbon outgassing. Here we test this hypothesis using a combination of plate reconstructions, tectonic–geochemical analysis and global biogeochemical modelling. We show that enhanced weathering of mafic lithologies during continental breakup and nascent seafloor spreading can plausibly drive a succession of anoxic events. Weathering pulses collectively gave rise to substantial releases of the nutrient phosphorus to the oceans, stimulating biological primary production. This, in turn, enhanced organic carbon burial and caused widespread ocean deoxygenation on a scale sufficient to drive recurrent anoxia. This model complements volcanic outgassing-centred hypotheses for triggering these events by demonstrating well-quantified basaltic sources of phosphorus release during periods of intense weathering related to climate warmth.

Ho,Global ocean carbon uptake enhanced by rainfall,"About 6% of the total uptake of carbon dioxide by the ocean is due to rainfall, according to an analysis of satellite observations and ERA5 reanalysis data from 2008 to 2018. 
 Rain alters local sea surface physical and biogeochemical properties but its spatiotemporal variability has led to its overlook in global ocean carbon uptake studies. Different physical and chemical processes in the gaseous and liquid phases control the transfer of carbon dioxide (CO2) between the atmosphere and ocean. Rain impacts the interfacial flux by (1) increasing turbulence in the ocean and (2) modulating the air–sea CO2 concentration gradient. Concurrently, raindrops inject CO2 absorbed during their fall into the ocean through wet deposition. Here this study presents a comprehensive estimate of these effects on the global ocean carbon uptake over 2008–2018 based on observational products (satellite and in situ) and reanalysis. Using various representations of the ocean surface response to rainfall and different rain products, we show that rain increases the ocean carbon sink by +0.14–0.19 PgC yr−1 over 2008–2018, representing an increase of 5–7% of the ocean carbon uptake (2.66 PgC yr−1). Rain-induced interfacial flux and wet deposition have comparable orders of magnitude. The former mainly increases the CO2 sink in the tropics because strong rain rates and weak winds induce noticeable salinity and CO2 dilution. The latter is important in the tropics, storm track regions and the Southern Ocean. About 6% of the total uptake of carbon dioxide by the ocean is due to rainfall, according to an analysis of satellite observations and ERA5 reanalysis data from 2008 to 2018."

 The Pacific Walker circulation—the tropical Pacific zonal overturning circulation of the atmosphere—and the associated sea surface temperature distribution in the tropical Pacific significantly impact global climate. However, climate model historical simulations cannot capture the observed Walker circulation enhancement since around 1980. Although a number of mechanisms have been proposed to explain the observed change, quantitative discussion and clues for reconciling the model-observation discrepancy have not yet been settled. Here we show that the Walker circulation strengthening between 1980 and 2020 can be quantitatively explained by the remote influence of subtropical and extratropical sea surface temperature changes. This conclusion is obtained from climate model pacemaker experiments in which sea surface temperature anomalies outside the tropics are restored towards observations. Influence from the southeastern Pacific, which cools the eastern tropical Pacific, is especially crucial for the Walker circulation strengthening. This equatorward influence occurs mostly through the atmosphere and its thermal coupling with the ocean. We further show that current generation climate models have biases in southeastern Pacific surface temperature changes, which may cause the failure in reproducing the Walker circulation trend. Our results suggest that improved representation of air–sea coupling in this region could enable better projections of future climate. Subtropical and extratropical sea surface temperature changes can explain recent observed Walker circulation strengthening, according to climate model experiments."

 Glaciers archive time-structured information on climates and ecosystems, including microorganisms. However, the long-term ecogenomic dynamics or biogeography of the preserved viruses and their palaeoclimatic connections remain uninvestigated. Here we use metagenomes to reconstruct viral genomes from nine time horizons, spanning three cold-to-warm cycles over the past >41,000 years, preserved in an ice core from Guliya Glacier, Tibetan Plateau. We recover genomes of 1,705 approximately species-level viral operational taxonomic units. Viral communities significantly differ during cold and warm climatic conditions, with the most distinct community observed ~11,500 years ago during the major climate transition from the Last Glacial Stage to the Holocene. In silico analyses of virus–host interactions reveal persistently high viral pressure on Flavobacterium (a common dominant glacier lineage) and historical enrichment in the metabolism of cofactors and vitamins that can contribute to host adaptation and virus fitness under extreme conditions. Biogeographic analyses show that approximately one-fourth of Guliya viral operational taxonomic units overlap with the global dataset, primarily with the Tibetan Plateau metagenomes, suggesting regional associations of a subset of the Guliya-preserved viruses over time. We posit that the cold-to-warm variations in viral communities might be attributed to distinct virus sources and/or environmental selections under different temperature regimes.

Here, the authors show that linkers connecting these domains control the carrier’s conformational space and thus its function. 
 Uptake of nucleobases and ascorbate is an essential process in all living organisms mediated by SLC23 transport proteins. These transmembrane carriers operate via the elevator alternating-access mechanism, and are composed of two rigid domains whose relative motion drives transport. The lack of large conformational changes within these domains suggests that the interdomain-linkers act as flexible tethers. Here, we show that interdomain-linkers are not mere tethers, but have a key regulatory role in dictating the conformational space of the transporter and defining the rotation axis of the mobile transport domain. By resolving a wide inward-open conformation of the SLC23 elevator transporter UraA and combining biochemical studies using a synthetic nanobody as conformational probe with hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that interdomain-linkers control the function of transport proteins by influencing substrate affinity and transport rate. These findings open the possibility to allosterically modulate the activity of elevator proteins by targeting their linkers.

Here authors compare B cells from young and elderly donors and see immunometabolic changes and assess the impact of increased lactate production on the immune responses at different ages. 
 Aging is characterized by chronic systemic inflammation and metabolic changes. We compare the metabolic status of B cells from young and elderly donors and found that aging is associated with higher oxygen consumption rates, and especially higher extracellular acidification rates, measures of oxidative phosphorylation and of anaerobic glycolysis, respectively. Importantly, this higher metabolic status, which reflects age-associated expansion of pro-inflammatory B cells, is found associated with higher secretion of lactate and autoimmune antibodies after in vitro stimulation. B cells from elderly individuals induce in vitro polarization of CD4+ T cells from young individuals into pro-inflammatory CD4+ T cells through metabolic pathways mediated by lactate, which can be inhibited by targeting lactate enzymes and transporters, as well as signaling pathways supporting anaerobic glycolysis. Lactate also induces immunosenescent B cells that are glycolytic, express transcripts for multiple pro-inflammatory molecules, and are characterized by a higher metabolic status. These results altogether may have relevant clinical implications and suggest alternative targets for therapeutic interventions in the elderly and patients with inflammatory conditions and diseases.

Here, the authors present a dynamic characterization of mGlu5, an obligate dimeric class C GPCR, suggesting an asymmetric, stepwise allosteric activation mechanism. 
 Two-thirds of signaling hormones and one-third of approved drugs exert their effects by binding and modulating the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) activation. While the activation mechanism for monomeric GPCRs has been well-established, little is known about GPCRs in dimeric form. Here, by combining transition pathway generation, extensive atomistic simulation-based Markov state models, and experimental signaling assays, we reveal an asymmetric, stepwise millisecond allosteric activation mechanism for the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 receptor (mGlu5), an obligate dimeric class C GPCR. The dynamic picture is presented that agonist binding induces dimeric ectodomains compaction, amplified by the precise association of the cysteine-rich domains, ultimately loosely bringing the intracellular 7-transmembrane (7TM) domains into proximity and establishing an asymmetric TM6-TM6 interface. The active inter-domain interface enhances their intra-domain flexibility, triggering the activation of micro-switches crucial for downstream signal transduction. Furthermore, we show that the positive allosteric modulator stabilizes both the active inter-domain 7TM interface and an open, extended intra-domain ICL2 conformation. This stabilization leads to the formation of a pseudo-cavity composed of the ICL2, ICL3, TM3, and C-terminus, which facilitates G protein coordination. Our strategy may be generalizable for characterizing millisecond events in other allosteric systems. Activation mechanism of GPCRs in dimeric form remains enigmatic.

 Day-Night imaging technology that obtains full-color and infrared images has great market demands for security monitoring and autonomous driving. The current mainstream solution relies on wide-spectrum silicon photodetectors combined with Infrared Cutfilter Removal, which increases complexity and failure rate. Here, we address these challenges by employing a perovskite photodetector based on Pb−Sn alloyed single crystal with a vertical bandgap-graded structure that presents variable-spectrum responses at different biases and extends the infrared detection range close to 1100 nm. Taking advantage of the Pb−Sn gradients in mobility and built-in field, the perovskite photodetector shows a large linear dynamic range of 177 dB. In addition, the optoelectronic characteristics feature long-term operational stability over a year. We further develop an imaging module prototype without Infrared Cutfilter Removal that exhibits excellent color fidelity with RGB color differences ranging from 0.48 to 2.46 under infrared interference and provides over 26-bit grayscale resolution in infrared imaging.

In the United States, 16% of its electricity sector’s carbon budget could be spent within ten years due solely to the stranded asset effect. 
 Will power plants emit less or more CO2 in anticipation of stronger climate policies that would strand fossil fuel reserves? Here, using a worldwide data source on individual power plants’ CO2 emissions and the value of countries’ at-risk fossil fuel assets, we show that between 2009 and 2018, plants emitted more CO2 in countries where more assets would be devalued under a 1.5 °C scenario, which we theorize is due to these countries’ regulatory leniency and plants’ vested interest in long-term fossil fuel contracts. Although the extra amount of carbon emitted each year trigged by imperiled assets is relatively small, it would exhaust a sizable portion of the electricity sector’s remaining carbon budget when added up over time. This is especially true in the U.S. and Russia where up to 16% and 12% of their budgets, respectively, could be spent within ten years due solely to the stranded asset effect.

The carriers are shown to have the Long QT Syndrome phenotype with incomplete penetrance. 
 Rare genetic diseases are typically studied in referral populations, resulting in underdiagnosis and biased assessment of penetrance and phenotype. To address this, we develop a generalizable method of genotype inference based on distant relatedness and deploy this to identify undiagnosed Type 5 Long QT Syndrome (LQT5) rare variant carriers in a non-referral population. We identify 9 LQT5 families referred to a single specialty clinic, each carrying p.Asp76Asn, the most common LQT5 variant. We uncover recent common ancestry and a single shared haplotype among probands. Application to a non-referral population of 69,819 BioVU biobank subjects identifies 22 additional subjects sharing this haplotype, which we confirm to carry p.Asp76Asn. Referral and non-referral carriers have prolonged QT interval corrected for heart rate (QTc) compared to controls, and, among carriers, the QTc polygenic score is independently associated with QTc prolongation. Thus, our innovative analysis of shared chromosomal segments identifies undiagnosed cases of genetic disease and refines the understanding of LQT5 penetrance and phenotype.

Here, the authors reveal the landscapes of the activation process of OSCA/TMEM63 channels. 
 OSCA/TMEM63 channels, which have transporter-like architectures, are bona fide mechanosensitive (MS) ion channels that sense high-threshold mechanical forces in eukaryotic cells. The activation mechanism of these transporter-like channels is not fully understood. Here we report cryo-EM structures of a dimeric OSCA/TMEM63 pore mutant OSCA1.1-F516A with a sequentially extracellular dilated pore in a detergent environment. These structures suggest that the extracellular pore sequential dilation resembles a flower blooming and couples to a sequential contraction of each monomer subunit towards the dimer interface and subsequent extrusion of the dimer interface lipids. Interestingly, while OSCA1.1-F516A remains non-conducting in the native lipid environment, it can be directly activated by lyso-phosphatidylcholine (Lyso-PC) with reduced single-channel conductance. Structural analysis of OSCA1.1-F516A in lyso-PC-free and lyso-PC-containing lipid nanodiscs indicates that lyso-PC induces intracellular pore dilation by attracting the M6b to upward movement away from the intracellular side thus extending the intracellular pore. Further functional studies indicate that full activation of MS OSCA/TMEM63 dimeric channels by high-threshold mechanical force also involves the opening of both intercellular and extracellular pores. Our results provide the fundamental activation paradigm of the unique transporter-like MS OSCA/TMEM63 channels, which is likely applicable to functional branches of the TMEM63/TMEM16/TMC superfamilies.

 Timber and agricultural production must both increase throughout this century to meet rising demand. Understanding how climate-induced shifts in agricultural suitability will trigger competition with timber for productive land is crucial. Here, we combine predictions of agricultural suitability under different climate change scenarios (representative concentration pathways RCP 2.6 and RCP 8.5) with timber-production maps to show that 240–320 Mha (20–26%) of current forestry land will become more suitable for agriculture by 2100. Forestry land contributes 21–27% of new agricultural productivity frontiers (67–105 Mha) despite only occupying 10% of the surface of the land. Agricultural frontiers in forestry land occur disproportionately in key timber-producing nations (Russia, the USA, Canada and China) and are closer to population centres and existing cropland than frontiers outside forestry land. To minimize crop expansion into forestry land and prevent shifting timber harvests into old-growth tropical and boreal forests to meet timber demand, emissions must be reduced, agricultural efficiency improved and sustainable intensification invested in.

This study updates current approaches to ecological zoning of the world to ensure that consistent data are provided for such sustainability-related policy and studies. 
 As climate change accelerates, nations are moving towards meeting their nationally determined contributions and reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Reporting of this from the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector relies on data related to land use and management, climate and soil type. Where such data are unavailable, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) provides a set of default factors, based on an extensive literature review of likely GHG emission factors and carbon stock changes disaggregated by the Food and Agriculture Organization’s global ecological zones. As understanding of global ecological zones under environmental change improves, it becomes necessary to reassess such ecological zoning approaches to enable reporting of GHG emissions to support nationally determined contributions and global change studies. Here we propose a globally consistent ecological zoning approach based on Holdridge life zones using climatic data from the Climate Research Unit on a 0.5° grid, which tackles certain limitations found in the existing guidance provided by the IPCC. A set of three global ecological zone maps based on Holdridge life zones were devised using increasing levels of aggregation, which could support sustainability studies of global environmental change, specifically climate change, and be used as a zoning approach by the IPCC. Climate change policy and global change studies rely on maps that classify the world into different ecological zones.

Here the authors report air-stable naphthalene-based redox-active molecules for scaled-up aqueous flow batteries. 
 The growing global capacity for renewable energy generation necessitates the deployment of energy storage technologies with a combination of low cost, good performance and scalability. With these advantages, aqueous organic flow batteries have the potential to be the system of choice because they could store energy from organic redox-active molecules. Here we report naphthalene derivatives as organic redox-active molecules that exhibit high solubility (~1.5 M) and a stable redox-active framework with no obvious capacity decay over 40 days (50 Ah l−1) in an air atmosphere in flow batteries. We report a battery that runs smoothly even under continuous airflow without obvious capacity decay for ~22 days (more than 600 cycles). A series of spectral analyses and theoretical calculations reveal that the dimethylamine scaffolds improve the water solubility and protect the active centre, ensuring the stability of the molecules during the charge and discharge process. Owing to the success in kilogramme-scale molecular synthesis, pilot-scale stack expansion with notable cycling stability over 270 cycles (~27 days) is attained. The cost benefit evidenced by technoeconomic analysis together with the stability even under open-air conditions indicates the practical value of the present molecular system in grid-scale energy storage.

Here the authors develop a membrane-free electrochemical system that allows efficient and robust ammonia recovery from real nitrate-rich wastewater. 
 Electrocatalytic nitrate reduction has great potential for simultaneously achieving ammonia recovery and nitrate-rich wastewater treatment. However, the complexity of wastewater matrices has long hampered its implementation and commercialization in the wastewater treatment industry. Here we develop a membrane-free electrochemical system, called electrochemical NO3− conversion synchronized with NH3 recovery (ECSN), which synchronizes nitrate reduction with ammonia recovery for treating real nitrate-rich wastewater. Key components of this system include a 3D-printed metallic glass decorated Cu–Ni (MPCN) working electrode bearing good corrosion resistance and a UV-assisted stripping unit. When treating real electroplating wastewater, the ECSN system converts over 70% of nitrate into high-purity ammonia chloride. Long-term stability test demonstrates the robustness of the ECSN system in treating real wastewater. Further, the economic feasibility and environmental benefits of this system are evidenced by technoeconomic analysis and life-cycle analysis. Overall, this work brings the electrocatalytic nitrate reduction process one step closer to practical application, contributing to both environmental protection and the circularity of anthropogenic nitrogen flow.

This study evaluates the impact of pesticide use on wild bee populations across the contiguous United States. 
 The decline of many wild bee species has major consequences for pollination in natural and agro-ecosystems. One hypothesized cause of the declines is pesticide use; neonicotinoids and pyrethroids in particular have been shown to have pernicious effects in laboratory and field experiments, and have been linked to population declines in a few focal species. We used aggregated museum records, ecological surveys and community science data from across the contiguous United States, including 178,589 unique observations from 1,081 bee species (33% of species with records in the United States) across six families, to model species occupancy from 1995 to 2015 with linked land use data. While there are numerous causes of bee declines, we discovered that the negative effects of pesticides are widespread; the increase in neonicotinoid and pyrethroid use is a major driver of changes in occupancy across hundreds of wild bee species. In some groups, high pesticide use contributes to a 43.3% decrease in the probability that a species occurs at a site. These results suggest that mechanisms that reduce pesticide use (such as integrative pest management) can potentially facilitate pollination conservation. Bees provide important pollination ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes, but the extent to which they are affected by pesticide use on a continental scale has yet to be explored.

 Wastewater treatment is a major source of anthropogenic nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. However, the current emission estimations rely on a uniform emission factor (EF) proposed by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change based on a limited database suffering from large uncertainties and inaccuracies. To address this limitation, this study expands the database 12-fold and develops a tier-based approach. Our method considers emission variations across spatial scales, treatment processes and monitoring techniques, enabling more-precise estimations. Here, applying this approach to the US database, we highlight the limitations of current estimations based on uniform EFs and quantified the mean wastewater N2O emission in the United States to be 11.6 MMT CO2-eq. The results also reveal the diverse nature of wastewater N2O emissions and underscore the need for a customized approach to inform facility-level N2O emission estimation as well as inform national- and sector-wide greenhouse gases inventories with emphasis on site-specific considerations.

This study assessed the impact of such global change drivers on tree species distributions across Southeast Asian forests. 
 The forests of Southeast Asia harbour high levels of species diversity, providing a plethora of ecosystem services. However, this biodiversity is threatened by both climate and land-use change, the impacts of which are poorly understood. We modelled 1,498 tree species distributions under four shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) with varying global change intensities, and classified species into 11 spatially associated groups. We found both global changes to cause severe losses in tree distributions. Only under SSP1–2.6, the sustainable pathway with low intensities in both global changes, were distribution losses mitigated. Unexpectedly, losses were overall greatest under intermediate climate change pathways SSP2–4.5 and SSP3–7.0 rather than under the most extreme pathway, SSP5–8.5. This was because, although climate-driven losses were greatest under SSP5–8.5, land-use-driven losses were much more extensive under SSP2–4.5 and SSP3–7.0 than under SSP5–8.5. Crucially, other than SSP1–2.6, each SSP led to worst-case scenarios for several species groups. Our findings highlight that to most effectively conserve Southeast Asian tree distributions, policymakers need to prioritize a sustainable pathway that mitigates both global changes. Global change drivers such as climate and land-use change can impact biodiverse regions and damage the ecosystem services they provide.

 Understanding the causes for discrepancies between modelled and observed regional climate trends is important for improving present-day climate simulation and reducing uncertainties in future climate projections. Here, we analyse the performance of coupled climate models in reproducing regional precipitation trends during the satellite era. We find statistically significant observed drying in southwestern North America and wetting in the Amazon during the period 1979–2014. Historical climate model simulations do not capture these observed precipitation trends. We trace this discrepancy to the inability of coupled simulations to capture the observed Pacific trade wind intensification over this period. A linear adjustment of free running historical simulations, based on the observed strengthening of the Pacific trade winds and modeled ENSO teleconnections, explains the discrepancy in precipitation trends. Furthermore, both the Pacific trade wind trends and regional precipitation trends are reproduced in climate simulations with prescribed observed sea surface temperatures (SST), underscoring the role of the tropical Pacific SST patterns."

 Spring Central Asian precipitation (SCAP) holds significant implications for local agriculture and ecosystems, with its variability mainly modulated by El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The ENSO–SCAP relationship has experienced pronounced interdecadal shifts, though mechanisms remain elusive. Based on observations and climate model simulations, these shifts may result from transitions in ENSO-induced meridional circulation and Rossby wave trains triggered by North Atlantic (NA) sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. During high (low) correlation periods, ENSO induces strong (weak) vertical motion anomalies over Central Asia, while NA SST anomalies exert a weak (strong) counteracting effect, modulated by the Pacific decadal oscillation (PDO). In the positive (negative) phase of PDO, a slow (fast) decaying ENSO triggers a strong (weak) NA horseshoe-like SST anomaly in the post-ENSO spring, affecting the ENSO–SCAP relationship. Our study identifies a strengthening trend in the ENSO–SCAP relationship since the 2000s, indicating improved predictability for SCAP in recent decades."

 Eocene hyperthermal events reflect profound perturbations of the global carbon cycle. Most of our knowledge about their onset, timing, and rates originates from marine records. Hence, the pacing and magnitude of hyperthermal continental warming remains largely unaccounted for due to a lack of high-resolution climate records. Here we use terrestrial biomarkers and carbon isotopes retrieved from varved lake deposits of the UNESCO World Heritage site ‘Messel Fossil Pit’ (Germany) to quantify sub-millennial to millennial-scale temperature and carbon isotope changes across hyperthermal event C21n-H1 (47.2 million years ago). Our results show maximum warming of ca. 3.5 °C during C21n-H1. We propose that two components are responsible for the warming pattern across the hyperthermal: (1) the massive release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere-ocean system and (2) half-precession orbital forcing indicated by ~12.000-year temperature cycles. The carbon isotope record of bulk organic matter indicates a sharp, 7‰ decrease at the peak of the hyperthermal, corresponding to increased organic carbon content and a shift in the lake algal community. Collectively, our proxy data reveal the structure of continental temperature response during the hyperthermal event that is characterized by overall warming with a superimposed pattern of sub-orbital scale temperature fluctuations.

 Shifts in the magnesium to calcium ratio of seawater in the geological history are thought to have profoundly affected biomineralization of marine invertebrates, including some echinoderms, which changed their skeletal mineralogy from high-magnesium to low-magnesium calcite and vice versa. Here we report on experiments that aimed to investigate the effect of ambient seawater magnesium to calcium ratio on magnesium to calcium ratio and nanomechanical properties in the spines of two echinoid species (Arbacia lixula and Paracentrotus lividus). We found that echinoids cultured in seawater with a low magnesium to calcium ratio produced a skeleton with lower both magnesium content and nanohardness than those of the control specimens incubated under normal (high) magnesium to calcium ratio conditions. These results may suggest that at certain times in the geological past (during the so-called calcite seas) sea urchins with decreased skeletal magnesium contents were more susceptible to damage due to physical disturbances, predation and post-mortem taphonomic processes. Increased skeletal hardness of echinoids from the so-called aragonite seas is expected to enhance their taphonomic potential, thus, to some extent, mitigates the preservation bias related to increased solubility of high-magnesium calcite.

The spatial configuration of large-scale heterogeneity in the mantle is not random4,5, but the timing and mechanisms that caused such heterogeneity are still debated2,6,7. We compiled radiogenic isotope data of mid-ocean ridge and plume-induced basalts from both present-day and past oceans for the past 900 million years of the relatively isotopically enriched African mantle domain. Our analysis shows that oceanic rocks of the African mantle domain exhibit a relatively homogenous composition similar to the prevalent mantle estimates (PREMA8) until ca. 350 million years ago when plume-derived rocks started becoming isotopically enriched with maximum enrichment reached in the mid-Cretaceous. From that point in time, plume-derived rocks shift toward depletion, getting closer to the prevalent mantle value. The enrichment trend is interpreted to have resulted from the recycling of crustal material during the assembly and the early stage of a break-up of Gondwana and Pangea, whereas the subsequent depletion trend is due to the outward retreat of the subduction girdle during the break-up of Pangea, thus both are legacies of geodynamic processes related to the supercontinent cycle.

 Organic food systems are recognised as an important component in meeting United Nations’ (UN) Sustainable Development Goals. A leverage points perspective can help to identify approaches which have the potential to facilitate transformative systemic change towards organic and sustainable farming. Using fuzzy cognitive maps developed from expert stakeholder opinions, we modelled a system of drivers of organic food production and consumption in the United Kingdom, according to the UN Sustainability Assessment of Food and Agriculture systems framework. The most influential concepts in the uptake of organic systems were related to system norms and values and social structures, such as short-term economic thinking, landowner engagement, and relationships with certification bodies. However, in a scenario analysis, organic stakeholders identified relatively shallower leverage points as more likely to change under a sustainable future, resulting in limited systemic change.

 Accurate spatio-temporal information on rice cropping patterns is vital for predicting grain production, managing water resource and assessing greenhouse gas emissions. However, current automated mapping of rice cropping patterns at regional scale is heavily constrained by insufficient training samples and frequent cloudy weathers in major rice-producing areas. To tackle this challenge, we proposed a Phenology domain Optical-SAR feature inTegration method to Automatically generate single (SC-Rice) and double cropping Rice (DC-Rice) sample (POSTAR) for efficient and refined rice mapping. POSTAR includes three major steps: (1) generating a potential rice map using a phenology- and object-based classification method with optical data (Sentinel-2 MSI) to select candidate rice samples; (2) employing K-means to identify SC- and DC-Rice candidate samples according to unique SAR-based (Sentinel-1 SAR) phenological features; (3) implementing a two-step refinement strategy to filter high-confidence SC- and DC-Rice samples, maintaining a balance between intraclass phenological variance and sample purity. Test areas selected for validation include the Dongting Lake plain and Poyang Lake plain in South China, as well as Fujin county located in the Sanjiang plain of North China. POSTAR proved effective in producing reliable SC- and DC-Rice samples, achieving a high spectral correlation similarity (>0.85) and low dynamic time wrapping distance (<8.5) with field samples. Applying POSTAR-derived samples to random forest classifier yielded an overall accuracy of 89.6%, with F1 score of 0.899 for SC-Rice and 0.938 for DC-Rice in the Dongting Lake plain. Owing to the incorporation of knowledge-based optical and SAR phenological features, POSTAR exhibited strong spatial transferability, achieving an overall accuracy of 96.0% in the Poyang Lake plain and 97.8% in the Fujin county. These results demonstrated the effectiveness of the POSTAR method in accurately mapping rice cropping patterns without extensive field visits, providing valuable insights for crop monitoring in large, diverse, and cloudy regions through the integration of optical and SAR data."

 Mesoscale dipoles compose two counter-rotating mesoscale eddies. They are observed in oceans worldwide and significantly impact the biogeochemical cycle, marine ecosystems, and ocean water transport. This study investigates the evolution of asymmetric dipole eddies based on the satellite altimeter data for the period January 1993–December 2020. The coupling and decoupling of eddy dipoles impact various eddy properties. When the movement of eddies has a dipolar structure, a gentle convergence in parameters (rotational speed, amplitude, eddy kinetic energy, propagation speed, and advective nonlinearity) between the asymmetric dipole eddies is observed–this study refers to it as the “gear-like” process. Kinematic characteristics further indicate that the stronger dipole eddies generally drive the weaker ones to revolve during the “gear-like” process. The revolution direction remains consistent with the rotation direction of stronger dipole eddies. Additionally, eddy size remains relatively stable during the “gear-like” process. The composites of sea level anomaly (SLA) demonstrate that dipole eddies are compressed into a kidney-like shape along the line through their centers. This shape is confirmed by the composites of sea surface temperature anomalies, which closely correspond to the structure of SLA. These findings augment the knowledge regarding the evolution of asymmetric dipole eddies and provide a novel perspective for studying dipoles and eddy-eddy interactions."

 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) is a unique remote sensing instrument imaging ocean surface waves in two dimensions with high spatial resolution regardless of sunlight and weather conditions. However, due to the nonlinear imaging process, the ocean wave spectra cannot be retrieved directly from SAR data. The emergence of deep learning (DL) techniques provides a new paradigm for addressing this challenge. In this paper, a deep-learning-based model, called Wave-Spec-CNN, is proposed for retrieving omni-directional ocean wave spectra from SAR data. This model is constructed using approximately 21,000 collocations of Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide swath mode images matched with global in-situ buoy data. The model adapts the convolution neural network (CNN) to accommodate the multi-valued nature of omni-directional ocean wave spectra, enhances performance by integrating a calibration branch and further incorporates physical characteristics into the training process. The results demonstrate consistency with buoy measurements for significant wave height (SWH) in the range of 0.5 m to 6 m, yielding a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 0.51 m on the validation dataset, comparable to traditional physical-based methods. In terms of mean wave period (MWP) and peak frequency (PF), the achieved RMSEs are of 1.24 s and 0.03 Hz, respectively. The retrieved omni-directional ocean wave spectra also allow to separate swell and windsea components for respective comparisons with those derived by in-situ buoy data. The RMSEs of respective SWH comparisons are of 0.46 m and 0.42 m. This research represents an initial endeavor into utilizing DL for the long-standing challenge of SAR inversion for ocean wave spectra, as well as providing valuable insights for employing DL in multi-parameter inversion tasks in remote sensing."

 This study focuses on advancing individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation in lidar data, developing a sensor- and platform-agnostic deep learning model transferable across a spectrum of dense laser scanning datasets from drone (ULS), to terrestrial (TLS), and mobile (MLS) laser scanning data. In a field where transferability across different data characteristics has been a longstanding challenge, this research marks a step towards versatile, efficient, and comprehensive 3D forest scene analysis.Central to this study is model performance evaluation based on platform type (ULS vs. MLS) and data density. This involved five distinct scenarios, each integrating different combinations of input training data, including ULS, MLS, and their augmented versions through random subsampling, to assess the model's transferability to varying resolutions and efficacy across different canopy layers. The core of the model, inspired by the PointGroup architecture, is a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with dedicated prediction heads for semantic and instance segmentation. The model underwent comprehensive validation on publicly available, machine learning-ready point cloud datasets. Additional analyses assessed model adaptability to different resolutions and performance across canopy layers.Our results reveal that point cloud random subsampling is an effective augmentation strategy and improves model performance and transferability. The model trained using the most aggressive augmentation, including point clouds as sparse as 10 points m−2, showed best performance and was found to be transferable to sparse lidar data and boosts detection and segmentation of codominant and dominated trees. Notably, the model showed consistent performance for point clouds with densities >50 points m−2 but exhibited a drop in performance at the sparsest level (10 points m−2), mainly due to increased omission rates. Benchmarking against current state-of-the-art methods revealed boosts of up to 20% in the detection rates, indicating the model's superior performance on multiple open benchmark datasets. Further, our experiments also set new performance baselines for the other public datasets. The comparison highlights the model's superior segmentation skill, mainly due to better detection and segmentation of understory trees below the canopy, with reduced computational demands compared to other recent methods.In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that it is indeed feasible to train a sensor-agnostic model that can handle diverse laser scanning data, going beyond current sensor-specific methodologies. Further, our study sets a new baseline for tree segmentation, especially in complex forest structures. By advancing the state-of-the-art in forest lidar analysis, our work also lays the foundation for future innovations in ecological modeling and forest management."

 Information on tree species across various spatial scales, from an individual tree to a forest stand and the broader landscape, contributes to an accurate and thorough understanding of forest conditions either as an individual characteristic or as an input of species-dependent models. However, tree species recognition is one of the most challenging tasks in forest remote sensing studies, due to the complexity of species compositions and canopy structures of forests, e.g., both cross-species similarities and intra-species variations commonly exist in spectral-, texture-, and structure- domains. Over the past two decades, the interest in using close-range sensing for tree species recognition has been rapidly growing. Recent research has highlighted the needs to further develop species recognition methods to elevate their performance in comparison with established remote sensing approaches, and to address new questions arising from spatial resolutions, data coverages, viewing geometries, and other data characteristics. This work provides an overview of the state-of-the-art of tree species recognition from close-range sensing data. The work summarizes the research works in the past decade, reviews the state of research, discusses prominent challenges, investigates impact factors, research gaps, and new potentials. Specifically, data from various sources, the features derived from each type of data, methodologies applied, and the targeted species are reviewed in detail. Relevant machine learning (ML) approaches are grouped into conventional ML and deep-learning (DL) categories. In each category, the reported studies/results are reviewed with respect to the spectral, spatial, and temporal domains of the used data sources, e.g., sensor and platform. Despite significant efforts in the field, the issues of automation, reliability, and robustness of the algorithms have only been partially resolved. The crucial elements in algorithm design what this work found and is worth careful consideration include forest types and stand conditions, seasonal variability and phenology, data characteristics and the corresponding feature selections, and the methodology. Future studies are recommended to focus on the fusion of multi-source data including passive and active multispectral data to integrate the spectral and structural information, the use of time-series data to enhance the role of phenological variances in species recognition, and the development of unsupervised DL techniques to improve the recognition accuracy and efficiency. It is also crucial to promote data sharing and open standards to facilitate international cooperation and communication."

 Terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) and groundwater storage anomaly (GWSA) data are of great importance for hydrological research and water resource management. However, products derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) mission and its Follow-On mission (GRACE-FO) are constrained by the satellite design and variation in processing strategies among different institutions, resulting in multiple suboptimal products. These products not only have a coarse spatial resolution but also suffer from a continuous 11-month gap from July 2017 to May 2018, which represent significant limitations for related research. To address these challenges, the Bayesian-based three-cornered hat (BTCH) method was initially employed to fuse low-uncertainty GRACE-derived TWSA and GWSA products with a coarse resolution (0.5°). Subsequently, based on the fused TWSA/GWSA products and multi-source datasets, a machine learning downscaling framework based on a physically constrained sliding window (MLDF-PCSW) was developed. This framework not only enhanced the spatial resolution of the products but also filled the data gap, ultimately producing a high-resolution water storage anomaly product (HWSA v1.0), a long-term, continuous dataset on a global scale (excluding Greenland and Antarctica; variables: TWSA and GWSA; spatial resolution: 0.05°; temporal resolution: monthly; period: April 2002 to December 2022). The results of uncertainty analysis using the three-cornered hat (TCH) method indicated that the TWSA derived from the Center for Space Research (CSR) exhibited the lowest uncertainty (23.91 mm) of the three original products, and the uncertainty decreased by 35.42% (15.44 mm) after data fusion using the BTCH method. The HWSA v1.0 dataset based on MLDF-PCSW exhibited high correlation coefficients (CCs) (0.999 and 0.999 for TWSA and GWSA, respectively) and a low root mean square error (RMSE) (0.68 mm and 1.24 mm for TWSA and GWSA, respectively) with the original TWSA and GWSA products, while also providing more detailed TWSA and GWSA spatial information. Independent validation for TWSA_DYY based on the water balance method has been done across six basins and the results are great, with the CCs between 0.69 and 0.92. The GWSA from the MLDF-PCSW demonstrated acceptable correspondence with global in-situ groundwater observations, with a mean CC of 0.27. The other four previously released gap-filled TWSA products also exhibited outstanding performance, with the average CC reaching 0.98 for the 11-month gap. Collectively, these results suggest that the HWSA v1.0 dataset based on the MLDF-PCSW has significant potential as a robust data foundation for related research."

 As one of the most important staple foods globally, rice sustains nearly half of the world's population. Accurate and timely paddy rice mapping is, thus, essential for rice-related policy-making to ensure food security in the context of anthropogenic, environmental and climate changes. However, paddy rice mapping remains a challenging task since it usually has similar spectral characteristics to other land covers. In this research, for the first time, an entirely new approach, called RiceTColour, was proposed for mapping rice fields within the Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage (CIE) colour space based on their unique spectra during the rice transplanting period as observed in remotely sensed imagery. We demonstrate that transplanted rice fields, representing a mixture of soil, water and rice seedlings, consistently exhibit relatively low spectral values in both SWIR and NIR bands across various geographical locations, leading to their unique dark green colours in the false-colour image composed of SWIR, NIR and Red bands. Based upon this, we transformed these three spectral bands into the CIE colour space where paddy rice was found to be readily and completely separated from the other land covers. Straightforward, but specific classification criteria were established within the CIE colour space to differentiate paddy rice from the other land covers. The proposed RiceTColour, thus, represents a new approach for paddy rice identification, that is mapping paddy rice using the CIE colour space based upon the previous underexplored remotely sensed spectra of paddy fields during the transplanting season. The effectiveness of the proposed method was investigated over five rice-planting regions distributed across different geographical regions, characterised by different climates, rice cropping intensities, irrigation schemes and cultural practices. Specifically, the mapping criteria established in a training site (S1) were directly generalised to the other four sites (S2 to S5) for paddy rice mapping. Experimental results demonstrated that the RiceTColour method consistently achieved the most accurate and balanced classifications across all five sites compared with four benchmark comparators: a SAR-based method, an index-based method and two supervised classifier-based methods. In particular, the RiceTColour method performed relatively stable, producing an overall accuracy exceeding 95% in the training site (S1) as well as the four generalised sites (S2 to S5), which is an encouraging result. Such efficient yet stable rice mapping results across various rice-planting regions suggest a very strong generalisation capability of the proposed RiceTColour method. In consideration of the relatively large planting area of paddy rice fields globally, the proposed parameter-free, efficient, and generalisable RiceTColour method, thus, holds great potential for widespread application in various rice-planting areas worldwide."

 Spaceborne lidar (light detection and ranging) instruments such as the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation (GEDI) provide a unique opportunity for global forest inventory by generating broad-scale measurements sensitive to the vertical arrangement of plant matter as a supplement to in situ measurements. Lidar measurables are not directly relatable to most physical attributes of interest, including biomass, and therefore must be related through statistical models. Further, GEDI observations are not spatially complete, necessitating methods to convert the incomplete samples to predictions of area averages/totals. Such methods can face challenges in equatorial and persistently cloudy areas, such as Indonesia, where the density of quality observations is diminished. We developed and implemented a hierarchical model to produce gap-free maps of aboveground biomass density (AGBD) at various resolutions within the lowlands of Jambi province, Indonesia. A biomass model was trained between local field plots and a metric from GEDI waveforms simulated with coincident airborne laser scanning (ALS) data. After selecting a locally suitable ground-finding algorithm setting, we trained an error model depicting the discrepancies between the simulated and GEDI-observed waveforms. Finally, a geostatistical model was used to model the spatial distribution of the on-orbit GEDI observations. These three models were nested into a single hierarchical model, relating the spatial distribution of GEDI observations to field-measured AGBD. The model allows spatially complete predictions at arbitrary resolutions while accounting for uncertainties at each stage of the relationship. The model uncertainties were low relative to the predicted biomass, with a median relative standard deviation of 8% at the 1 km resolution and 26% at the 100 m resolution. The spatially consistent information on AGBD provided by our model is beneficial in support of sustainable forest management, carbon sequestration initiatives and the mitigation of climate change. This is particularly relevant in a dynamic tropical landscape like Jambi, Indonesia in order to understand the impacts of land-use transformations from forests to cash crops like oil palm and rubber. More generally, we advocate for the use of hierarchical models as a framework to account for multiple stages of relationships between field and sensor data and to provide reliable uncertainty audits for final predictions."

 Effective monitoring of soil and vegetation properties on a global scale is essential for better understanding climate changes, hydrological dynamics, and ecological processes. Passive microwave remote sensing at C-band radio frequency, with long observation period and relatively high penetration capability, has been widely used to retrieve soil moisture (SM) and vegetation optical depth (C-VOD). The retrieval process is generally achieved by inversion of the τ-ω radiative transfer model, which depends on crucial parameters such as effective scattering albedo (ω) and soil roughness (HR) for accurate retrievals. Current SM/C-VOD retrieval algorithms, such as the Land Parameter Retrieval Model (LPRM), predominantly rely on globally-constant ω and HR values, ignoring the inherent sensitivity of those parameters to varying soil conditions and vegetation types. To evaluate the impact of ω and HR variables on SM and C-VOD retrievals and to improve their accuracy, this study proposed and evaluated a novel retrieval approach from AMSR2 C-band observations during 2017–2020 using the C-band Microwave Emission of the Biosphere (C-MEB) model. We evaluated two new retrieval algorithms, considering either a globally-constant calibration or a land cover-based calibration of ω and HR. As a benchmark for the calibration, we optimized the values of ω and HR by evaluating the retrieved SM against in situ measurements from the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) and OzNet hydrological monitoring networks. The main originality compared to previous algorithms is that i) it includes a comprehensive calibration exploring the optimal values of ω and HR, applicable globally or tailored to specific land cover; ii) field SM measurements were leveraged to constrain the calibrated value of ω and HR.For the globally-constant calibration, the optimal values of ω = 0.05 and HR = 0.1 were found to yield the best results. For the land cover-based calibration, an inverse relationship between ω/HR and canopy height was observed, with ω ranging from 0.04 to 0.06 and HR ranging from 0.1 to 0.7 for heights between 0 and 30 m. The algorithm employing a land cover-based calibration (INRAE Bordeaux 2, IB2) exhibited better performance than the one utilizing a globally-constant calibration (INRAE Bordeaux 1, IB1) in evaluating retrieved SM against in situ measurements, as well as in evaluating C-VOD vs various vegetation variables including aboveground biomass (AGB), tree cover, canopy height and several optical vegetation indices. Comparison with LPRM suggested that our IB2 C-VOD retrievals present improved performances in terms of both spatial and temporal results with all considered vegetation variables (spatial correlation (R) between various vegetation variables and C-VOD of 0.76–0.83 for IB2 vs 0.69–0.79 for LPRM), and exhibited lower saturation effects when compared with AGB. In addition, the IB2 SM produced lower root mean squared error (RMSE) (0.147 vs 0.217 m3/m3), bias (−0.03 vs 0.09 m3/m3), and ubRMSE (0.066 vs 0.067 m3/m3) when compared with in situ measurements, although it showed a lower R compared to LPRM SM."

 A dataset of sub-daily C-band data, acquired with a ground-based synthetic aperture radar, has been used to study soil and vegetation dynamics during a complete growing season in a controlled agricultural test site. The data have been exploited to analyse the rate and sources of decorrelation in the scene, as well as the consequences of the observation conditions of a sub-daily satellite (with either low, medium or geosynchronous orbit): short revisit times, availability of multiple acquisitions during a single day, and shallow observations at some incidence angles. Repeat-pass coherence is found to be less affected by temporal decorrelation when the primary image is acquired during nighttime or the last hours predawn. Regarding the incidence angle, VV has increased sensitivity to certain phenological stages as the incidence angle increases.

The enhanced water boundary detection, incorporating preprocessing steps such as image filtering, resampling, and polarization multiplication, was applied to achieve sub-pixel precision in detecting water boundaries. The water boundary pixels located in layover and shadow regions, which could be misidentified due to distortion error, are eliminated based on backward geolocation. Ambiguous water boundaries, potentially indicating land with low intensity, were defined by computing their absolute derivatives, and removed. Finally, to enhance water level precision, the model computed water levels by averaging the altitudes of boundary pixels with weighting factors of local incidence angle, derivatives of detected water boundaries, and altitude distribution. Compared with the previous studies utilizing water boundaries, the proposed model demonstrated outstanding performance in improving the accuracy, up to 1/40th smaller than the spatial resolution of SAR images in Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The validation was executed over the results from >700 Sentinel-1 against the in-situ measurements obtained from multiple reservoirs and streams with significant water level fluctuations in the Korean peninsula. In this process, we found that the water boundaries located on the layover and shadow regions significantly influence the dispersion of altitude of reliable water boundary pixels. This study demonstrates the proposed model relying on remote sensing data without in-situ measurements, which holds potential applicability under situations where in-situ data are unavailable."

 Mapping and monitoring groundwater-dependant vegetation (GDV) and springs is essential for understanding the dynamics of shallow groundwater systems and for developing ecosystem conservation strategies. While large-scale identification of GDV and springs often relies on mapping excess evaporation, it is low resolution, and it can be prone to false detections over some types of soils and in areas of runoff accumulation. Here a simple, more direct approach for large scale, high resolution GDV mapping is proposed, which is designed to be cost and time efficient. The approach is tested over three catchments of Northern Australia, totalling 290,000 km2. The approach relies on constraining the selection of optical and radar imagery products from Sentinel-1/2 with GRACE Terrestrial Water storage change time-series. GRACE identifies periods of water scarcity across the landscape, which corresponds to higher contrast between the healthy, green GDV and other vegetation populations suffering from droughts. Via an additive masking approach, several combinations of dry-condition vegetation indices are tested, and the effort/efficiency trade-off of using one or a combination of up to four vegetation indices is assessed. Combining InSAR coherence and NDVI is particularly efficient, allowing validation of 80% of datapoints within citizen science records by considering as little as 2.7% of the surface area. While the combination of InSAR coherence and NDWI can also be efficient in some cases, all fully optical or radar combinations of indices are significantly less performant. The different sensitivities of radar and optical sensors allows masking of false positives inherent to each sensing strategy. By combining citizen science, GRACE time-variable gravity data and optical/radar-derived vegetation indices, it is now possible to map GDV even where direct in situ observations are impossible."

 P-band (0.3–1 GHz) radiometry shows promise in enhancing the next generation of radiometer missions for global soil moisture and vegetation optical depth (VOD) monitoring, particularly in moderately to densely vegetated areas, which remain challenging for current L-band (1.4 GHz) missions such as Soil Moisture and Ocean Salinity (SMOS) and Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP). However, the superiority of P-band over L-band in this regard has not been experimentally verified, and the quantitative differences remain unexplored. To address this gap, the P-band Radiometer Inferred Soil Moisture (PRISM) tower-based experiment was conducted, pioneering a comprehensive evaluation of P- (0.75 GHz) and L-band (1.4 GHz) radiometry in densely vegetated areas with vegetation water content (VWC) up to 20 kg/m2. The results revealed that P-band VOD was consistently lower than L-band VOD, suggesting reduced vegetation attenuation and thus a higher VWC threshold for reliable soil moisture sensing at P-band. The VWC thresholds for P- and L-band were estimated at 7.7 kg/m2 and 4.0 kg/m2, respectively, suggesting that P-band radiation could go through the vegetation approximately twice as effectively as L-band radiation. Additionally, the Microwave Polarization Difference Index (MPDI) was identified as a strong predictor of retrieval performance because it established a good link between retrieval errors and VWC. Regarding VOD retrieval, robust logarithmic relationships (R2 > 0.9) between VOD and VWC were established for both bands within the 0–20 kg/m2 VWC range, challenging the previously assumed linear relationship. Moreover, P-band demonstrated greater retrieval robustness as its dual-polarized TB observations contain more independent information than those of L-band. This research establishes the foundation for a successful passive microwave mission at P-band, aiming to improve the quality of global VOD and soil moisture datasets."

 Accurate estimation of sub-surface properties such as moisture content and depth of soil and vegetation layers is crucial for applications spanning sub-surface condition monitoring, precision agriculture, and effective wildfire risk assessment. Soil in nature is often covered by overlaying vegetation and surface organic material, making its characterization challenging. In addition, the estimation of the properties of the overlaying layer is crucial for applications like wildfire risk assessment. This study thus proposes a Bayesian model-updating-based approach for ground penetrating radar (GPR) waveform inversion to predict moisture contents and depths of soil and overlaying material layer. Due to its high correlation with moisture contents, the dielectric permittivity of both layers were predicted with the proposed method, along with other parameters, including depth and electrical conductivity of layers. The proposed Bayesian model updating approach yields probabilistic estimates of these parameters that can provide information about the confidence and uncertainty related to the estimates. The methodology was evaluated for a diverse range of experimental data collected through laboratory and field investigations. Laboratory investigations included variations in soil moisture values, depth of the overlaying surface layer, and coarseness of surface material. The field investigation included measurement of field soil moisture for sixteen days. The results demonstrated predictions consistent with time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements and conventional gravimetric tests. The correlation coefficient between predicted soil permittivity and that measured by TDR ranged from 0.84 to 0.99 for the presence of up to 10 cm of overlaying surface layer. The depth of the surface layer could also be accurately predicted for up to 10 cm, while at higher depths, prediction outliers could be reasonably identified from the obtained probability distributions and uncertainty. Hence, the proposed method provides a promising approach for uncertainty-aware sub-surface parameter estimation that can enable decision-making for risk assessment across a wide range of applications."

 Rock glaciers, unique creeping periglacial landforms, have garnered research interest for their valuable insights into hydrological resources and representing potential geological hazards in the context of climate warming. However, owing to the scarcity of high-spatiotemporal-resolution kinematic observations, the mechanisms driving rock glacier movements remain poorly understood. This study introduces a strategy for estimating three-dimensional (3D) velocities of rock glaciers by combining ascending and descending interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) observations with a surface parallel flow model. We mapped the 3D surface creeping velocities of 1084 rock glaciers in Daxueshan, southwest Tibetan Plateau, from January 2019 to December 2020. Subsequently, we employed the generalized boosted model (GBM), a machine learning approach, to link rock glacier creep to environmental factors. The rock glaciers in Daxueshan exhibited spatially heterogeneous creep, with maximum and average annual velocities of 307.86 mm∙a−1 and 40.37 mm∙a−1, respectively. About 92% of rock glaciers crept with a two-peak seasonal rhythm characterized by “spring acceleration, summer deceleration, autumn acceleration, and winter deceleration”. GBM modeling suggested that precipitation and snowmelt were the predominant environmental factors controlling the kinematics of rock glaciers, with relative importance of 32.6% and 31.7%, respectively. Land surface temperature (LST) was the third significant driver at 17.1% of the relative importance. Slope angle and topographic wetness index (TWI) had the least impact. The modeling also quantitatively revealed the distinct nonlinear responses of rock glacier creep to environmental changes. Rock glaciers initiate acceleration at precipitation and snowmelt levels of about 2 mm, LST close to −2 °C, slope angle and TWI higher than 12° and 4.6, and stabilize when these factors reach certain thresholds. Furthermore, the seasonal variations in rock glacier creeping velocity can be primarily attributed to hydrological changes. Our study highlights the value of combining InSAR and machine learning to elucidate the environmental controls on mass-wasting phenomena in mountainous regions."

 Managing unregulated dumpsites in urban environments is a pressing issue, but determining their locations presents persistent challenges due to their irregular distribution. Recently, researchers have begun employing aerial view remote sensing imagery coupled with deep learning detection to identify open dumpsites. However, due to interference from scenes with similar visual features in the satellite imagery, the false alarm rate remains high. A model named CascadeDumpNet is proposed by this study, which integrates deep learning and automated machine learning for open dumpsite detection, effectively combining the visual characteristics of open dumpsites with the features of the surrounding environment to eliminate erroneous detection and improve detection precision. Notably, the model is equipped with a novel Contextual Feature Synthesis (CFS) module that was specifically designed to enhance object detection in bird-view remote sensing imagery. This module is adept at leveraging remote sensing contextual information, thereby significantly refining the detection process by considering the broader environmental features of dumpsites. The performance of the model was compared with six advanced object detection architectures to demonstrate its superiority. High-resolution multispectral satellite imagery from the Pléiades satellite, featuring a spatial resolution of 0.5 m, was utilized to analyze the dumpsite distribution in Shenzhen, China. The model was applied to this densely urbanized area, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting open dumpsites within such environments. Additionally, the transferability of the model was verified through successful applications in two other major Chinese cities, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Furthermore, the distribution pattern of dumpsites was analyzed, which revealed that the density of dumpsites is predominantly concentrated in highly urbanized areas, which are characterized by high population densities, and a strong correlation was observed between the locations of these dumpsites and proximities to forests, elevated highways, and industrial zones. Overall, the development of the CascadeDumpNet model provides new insights into urban waste management, offering a novel, efficient, and precise approach to the detection and analysis of open dumpsites."

 Plant adaxial (upper) and abaxial (lower) leaf sides have different reflectances and transmittances, and this r-t dorsiventrality has been explored and modeled in several studies. The emitted chlorophyll fluorescence is also not identical when different leaf sides are illuminated; although this f dorsiventrality has already been discovered, its effects on canopy-level fluorescence have not been explored, and there is a lack of models for explaining this phenomenon. This study develops two radiative transfer models, LFD (Leaf chlorophyll Fluorescence with Dorsiventrality) and CFD (Canopy chlorophyll Fluorescence with leaf Dorsiventrality), to model leaf dorsiventrality (including r-t and f dorsiventrality) at the leaf and canopy scales, respectively, and to explore its influence on canopy fluorescence. Evaluation of LFD against the measured spectra revealed that the proposed model accurately simulated leaf fluorescence with an RMSE of 0.056 W/m2/µm/sr, an NRMSE of 3.3%, and an R2 of 0.963. Evaluation of CFD under various conditions via comparison with the ray-tracing discrete anisotropic radiative transfer (DART) model revealed that CFD is consistent with DART, with an RMSE of 0.031 W/m2/µm/sr, an NRMSE of 1.0%, and an R2 of 0.998. The influences of leaf dorsiventrality are then analyzed based on the developed models and measured spectra. The results show that neglecting both r-t and f dorsiventrality induces a maximum relative error above 30% and a maximum NRMSE of 15.7%. In contrast, neglecting only the f dorsiventrality induces a maximum relative error of more than 30% and a maximum NRMSE of 9.3%. It is concluded that leaf dorsiventrality is an important influencing factor in canopy chlorophyll fluorescence, and the proposed models can accurately and efficiently simulate this dorsiventrality."

 Geo-text data, which combine geographical locations with textual information (e.g., geo-tagged tweets), are typically visualized using tag maps. Since tags are rich in attribute information, tag maps are an intuitive method of visualizing how attribute domains carried by tags vary across space. However, users may be interested not only in the overall spatial distribution of tags but also in exploring detailed attributes-in-space analyses, such as examining how a subclass of attribute domains is distributed globally or checking whether all attribute subclasses exhibit the same global distribution pattern. To date, the methods for representing tags with visual encoding (e.g., size, color) to extend various attributes-in-space tasks to support exploratory analysis remain unclear. In this work, we extended tag maps to support exploratory analysis by distinguishing space searching into local or global spaces and attribute domains into within or between attribute classes, supporting four types of attributes-in-space tasks: global-within, local-within, global-between, and local-between tasks. We evaluated our exploratory tag map through two case studies: investigating major disaster occurrences from 1981 to 2020 and examining the leading causes of death in 2000 and 2019 for Spain, France, Germany and Italy.

 The resolution of ambiguity (AR) is of paramount importance for the precise point positioning (PPP) technique, as it enables the reduction of convergence duration and the improvement of positioning accuracy.

We investigate the difference between different scale UPD estimates which are obtained from MGEX and YNCORS stations in PPP-AR performance during quiet and geomagnetic storm periods.

 In this study, hyperspectral data of two geographically distant study areas in Germany were analyzed to find the most effective spectral wavelengths for red-edge-based vegetation indices to differentiate bark beetle-infested Norway spruce into three infestation classes, including green-attack. Considering that the relationship between red-edge position (REP) and reflection shoulder position (RESP) is crucial for the relative quantification of chlorophyll concentration and LAI and their changes due to bark beetle infestation, we tested normalized difference red-edge indices (NDRE) formed from these parameters. Using combinations of 75 spectral bands in the range 685 nm to 850 nm, we analyzed 1187 different NDREs, and two additional vegetation indices, and show that the sorted, normalized Kruskal-Wallis H-value, followed by a frequency analysis of the RESP and REP bands of the 10 % of the highest ranked NDREs is an effective way to identify the global optima of these parameters. The optimal REP and RESP estimated using this approach were determined at 714 nm and 758 nm, respectively. The derived normalized difference red-edge index NDRE758_714 could be successfully applied to both test sites. Moreover, we found that aggregating hyperspectral bands into broader bands – 703 nm to 729 nm for a REP band and 741 nm to 767 nm for a RESP band – did not degrade model accuracy when used in a multispectral NDRE, suggesting that a hyperspectral camera is not required to perform the task.

The predictive accuracies of the models for the test data indicated MNLR to be more robust than the RF.

 Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) 3D point clouds reconstruction can eliminate the problems of layover in 2D SAR image projections, the recognition of the reconstructed point cloud can significantly enhance target identification and information extraction. Current SAR 3D point cloud segmentation methods, based on traditional machine learning clustering approaches, suffer from poor automation and accuracy. However, the absence of publicly labeled SAR datasets impedes the progress of deep learning-based SAR 3D point cloud segmentation methods. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we introduce, for the first time, an alternative training approach for SAR 3D point cloud segmentation using LiDAR annotated data, which offers a more abundant sample pool, thus alleviating the lack of training sets. Nevertheless, a segmentation model trained on LiDAR point clouds exhibits a significant decline in performance when directly applied to SAR 3D reconstructed point clouds due to the cross-domain discrepancy. This research presents a pioneering domain adaptation 3D semantic segmentation framework to implement cross-modal learning for SAR point clouds. In our scheme, a simple yet effective technique is developed to achieve segmentation of SAR double-bounce scattering regions called SARDBS-Mix, which employs a mixing strategy, to capture the distinctive reflection characteristics of SAR data. Furthermore, we implement approaches including center alignment and normalization, local augmentation, and weighted cross entropy to mitigate LiDAR and SAR domain gap and class imbalances. The experimental results validate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method for SAR 3D reconstructed point cloud segmentation."

 Amid the escalating conflicts between urban demography, resource availability, and environmental constraints, there is an accelerating demand for emergency medical services prompted by a spectrum of factors including diseases, natural calamities, and unforeseen events. This growth is further accentuated by an imbalance in the allocation of emergency facilities, amplifying public anxiety and underscoring the urgent necessity for scientifically informed optimization of pre-hospital emergency facilities. To this end, the present study articulates specific optimization goals for facility deployment and introduces a nuanced set coverage optimization model that integrates spatiotemporal determinants of emergency service requirements. The model is fortified with a constellation of constraints, including spatial constraint, temporal constraint, and coverage constraint. For spatial constraints, we use the Monte Carlo simulation to predict the spatial distribution of emergency demands. Temporal constraints involve determining the actual travel time matrix from predicted demand points to candidate sites. Coverage constraints specify the effective demand coverage rate. This study uses Nanjing as a case example, utilizing multisource big data, including ambulance GPS logs from June 2016 to May 2017, Amap traffic congestion indicators, and survey data on existing emergency facilities in Nanjing City. By preprocessing and analyzing the existing data, this study thoroughly investigates the spatiotemporal distribution of emergency demands and the impact of traffic congestion on emergency service effectiveness. Consequently, the model incorporates constraints that ensure, under the specified planning and actual traffic conditions, 95 % of the simulated emergency demands can be met within an 8-minute on-route time. Locations for pre-hospital emergency stations are optimized using a genetic algorithm, achieving the best solution at the 120th iteration. Verification confirms 134 optimal sites; after excluding 52 existing sites, 82 potential sites are identified. The new layout plan has reduced Nanjing’s average emergency response time from 18.6 min to 12 min. Additionally, under peak and average traffic conditions, emergency demand coverage rates improved from 76.92 % and 83.18 % at 15 min to 95.61 % and 98.10 % at 12 min, respectively. These results demonstrate that the new layout significantly enhances practical application effectiveness. The approach presented in this paper addresses the previously overlooked randomness of emergency incidents and traffic conditions, offering innovative strategies for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of emergency station planning and site selection models."

 The analysis of association rules within ecosystems is crucial for monitoring, managing, and conserving natural resources. As widely adopted approaches for this task, geospatial methods involving spatial co-location pattern mining can reveal distribution rules and inherent associations among diverse geographical elements. Rooted in Tobler’s first law of geography, these methods focus on the impact of spatial proximity. However, apart from proximity, heterogeneity of environmental attributes such as elevation, temperature and precipitation are also essential for the formation of associations. For environmental co-location (Eco-location) pattern detection, we propose a method based on the Geo-Eco Knowledge Graph (GEKG) to mine multi-impact association rules. Firstly, we introduce the Adaptive Threshold (AT) to constrain the Delaunay triangular network, dynamically regulating adjacency relationships to generate geo-eco knowledge graph’s skeleton. For comprehensive ecosystem representation, various environmental attributes are integrated as semantic information into GEKG. In the reasoning of Eco-location patterns, we innovate beyond the traditional co-location paradigm by considering both spatial proximity and semantic similarity. Under the impact of various environmental information, sub-sets of geographically proximate entities are extracted to detect Eco-location patterns. For effective management and efficient computation, we utilize the Neo4j graph database to manage large-scale GEKG and mine Eco-location patterns with its graph search function. Experiments conducted on simulated and real-world ecological datasets show that, compared to existing techniques, our GEKG-based method can detect Eco-location patterns with greater accuracy and efficiency."

 Land subsidence is recognized as one of the hazards that threaten Metro Manila, Philippines, and other major urban areas worldwide. It has become a significant global issue caused by excessive groundwater extraction, rapid urbanization, and natural sediment compaction, exacerbated by climate change through rising sea levels. This paper presents vertical ground motion rates in Philippine metropolitan cities using Sentinel-1 InSAR time series analysis from 2014 to 2020 through UK COMET’s LiCSAR products and the LiCSBAS package of Morishita et al. (2020). The results revealed a maximum subsidence rate of 109 mm/yr in Bulacan Province in Greater Manila. For the first time, this paper also presents ground motion estimates and the following maximum subsidence rates for other Philippine metropolitan cities: 11 mm/yr in Metro Cebu, 38 mm/yr in Metro Davao, 9 mm/yr in Metro Iloilo, and 29 mm/yr in Legazpi City. Areas with remarkably high subsidence rates are observed as circular to elliptical deformation features in vertical motion maps. Sinking areas mostly coincide with industrial and commercial complexes evident as a contiguous distribution of large and expansive man-made structures with distinct radar reflections. Monitoring this hazard is crucial as it increases the risk of floods, building and infrastructure damage, and economic loss, and exposes residents along the coast to worsening tidal incursions and storm surges due to climate change. InSAR is proposed here as a targeted, long-term deformation monitoring tool, especially related to groundwater usage."

 The automatic extraction of inspection points for pylons is essential for intelligent Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) power inspections, especially in generating inspection route. However, current researches primarily focus on power scene perception and power component fault detection, with little attention paid to the inspection point detection. The primary reason are the lack of public pylon datasets for keypoint detection and the neglect of distinguish the inspection points from the keypoints used in feature extraction. Regarding that, this paper proposes a two-stage unsupervised pylon keypoint detection (UPKD) method to improve the efficiency of power inspections. In the first stage, the UPKD Network processes the point cloud to generate candidate keypoints, which comprises two main components: a data normalization module and an unsupervised keypoint detection network (UKD-Net). The data normalization module compresses information based on the symmetric structure of pylons, thereby reducing instability in inspection point detection. The UKD-Net incorporates a Point Transformer layer that uses self-attention mechanisms to extract features from the point cloud. In the second stage, a convex optimization strategy is applied to filter and acquire inspection points. These inspection points are then interconnected using a shortest-path strategy to generate the UAV inspection route. Our dataset is obtained using the Riegl VUX-1 laser measurement system and comprises 3,296 pylons of 10 types. Each pylon’s point cloud contains up to 25,000 points, with a high point density of 100 pts/m2. Extensive experiments show that the UPKD Network achieved state-of-the-art performance on our dataset, with repeatability achieving 90.39%, effectiveness (the ratio of effective keypoints to annotation points) achieving 69.95%, and completeness (the ratio of detected annotation points to keypoints) achieving 79.55%."

 Building models are important for urban studies. Remote sensing multi-spectral (MS) images are widely used for its rich semantic information. The lack of geometry features is fulfilled by introducing photogrammetry derived digital surface models (DSMs), resulting in pairs of DSMs and MS images. Utilizing such pairs and a convolutional neural network, level of detail (LoD) 2.2 building models, which contain roof planes and major roof elements (e.g. dormers), are reconstructed in this work. Leveraging both raster and vector predictions, 3-D building models with straight edges and sharp corners are obtained. The proposed two-stage method first extracts vectorized roof lines from pairs of DSMs and RGB images, followed by generation of detailed 2-D and 3-D polygonal building models. We conducted our experiments based on two datasets: a custom dataset in Landsberg am Lech in Germany, and an open dataset named Roof3D.

 As an important part of the geological environment assessment in recent years, mine interpretation has attracted broad attention in the area of sustainable development. As an object that can be captured by remote sensing of multispectral imageries, the open-pit (OP) mine environment has the characteristics of irregular distribution, diverse shapes, and varied textures and colors, which makes interpretation a challenge and limits the accuracy of OP mine mapping. Moreover, the development of computational vision technology enables efficient and fast interpretation. However, there is a lack of open semantic segmentation datasets for OP mining areas. In this paper, we introduce a dataset for OP mining areas in the West Hubei metallogenic belt (DOWHM) for OP mine element interpretation. DOWHM includes 24 active OP mining zones in China’s Hubei Province, with a total of 1875 satellite images of 224×224 pixels at a resolution of 0.6 m. Second, we design a ConvFormer model for fine classification and mapping in OP mining areas. The ConvFormer model adopts an encoder featuring a large convolutional kernel. The decoder of the ConvFormer model employs a multi-branch approach, integrating modules of convolutional neural network (CNN) and self-attention mechanism. In this manner, ConvFormer effectively captures both global–local information. This solves the problem of the misclassification of elements in the prediction results, and especially has advantages in road classification. In the experiments, ConvFormer achieved mIoU of 68.18% on DOWHM. Compared to other popular semantic segmentation models, ConvFormer improved the overall mIoU by 2%, which is advantageous in the fine classification of OP mining regions, and it can be applied to the mapping of entire mining regions.

 Supervoxels provide a more natural and compact 3D point cloud representation, which is a fundamental problem in point cloud processing and has attracted extensive attention from many scholars. At present, although the supervoxel segmentation has achieved significant results, the processing efficiency still restricts its further processing in the face of large-scale point cloud processing. Therefore, this paper proposes a new supervoxel segmentation method for point clouds to achieve fast supervoxel over-segmentation of large-scale point clouds while maintaining good boundaries and accuracy. Firstly, the supervoxel segmentation is formulated as a subset selection problem. With the idea of greedy strategy, the interval quick sorting and region growing methods is designed to realize the rapid merging of subsets in the iterative process. Secondly, the Manhattan distance metric and the seed point median simulation method are proposed to enhance the precision of iterative optimization and improve the efficiency of point cloud supervoxel segmentation.

 Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) is pivotal for precise positioning and mapping. However, visual data from crowd-sourced datasets often contains deficiencies that may lead to positioning errors. Despite existing optimization techniques, current algorithms do not adequately adapt to varied data in vehicle driving scenarios. To address this gap, this study introduces a novel SLAM framework (SLG-SLAM). This framework refines trajectories by integrating semantic information, laser point cloud, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data into V-SLAM. Initial trajectory estimates are made after filtering out dynamic targets and are subsequently refined with matched laser point clouds, then corrected for scale and direction using GNSS. The efficacy of this approach is assessed using four public datasets and one self-collected dataset, showing significant enhancements across all datasets. The proposed method reduces the mean absolute trajectory error by 43.50% on the KITTI dataset and 14.91% on the MVE dataset compared to the baseline. Unlike the baseline, which fails on three other datasets, the proposed method successfully performs localization and mapping. Additionally, compared to three other single-source methods (DynaSLAM, MCL, MVSLAM), the proposed method consistently outperforms, demonstrating its superior adaptability and effectiveness."

 Modern forestry relies on an extensive network of well-maintained forest roads. However, the trafficability of forest roads can be limited by poor construction or by insufficient load-bearing capacity caused by, for example, weather conditions. In all forestry operations, the forest roads should be able to support heavy vehicles during the transport of roundwood and harvesting machinery, so logistics must be carefully planned to ensure good road trafficability. To facilitate this planning, it is necessary to know the various characteristics of the forest road in terms of its width, structure and load-bearing capacity. Obtaining such information using remote sensing data would be beneficial. In this study, we used airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to assess the width of the roadway on forest roads. We developed several algorithms that were used to assess roadway width based on the cross-sectional data (derived with ALS) of the roads in 8-m long segments. The ALS echoes within the segments were classified into 20 cm wide strips which the algorithms then analyzed in a stepwise manner. Both height and intensity information from the ALS data were utilized. The algorithm results were then used as predictors in linear models to predict the roadway width. The main focus was on the road level, i.e., aggregated values from 25 different roads were used in model fitting. In terms of root mean square error (RMSE) values, accuracies of approximately 20–30 cm (or 7–10 %) were obtained for the predicted roadway widths with a separate validation data. This level of accuracy can be considered adequate given the characteristics of the ALS data used in the modelling. The results indicate that the presented approach has potential for practical applications to predict the width attributes of forest roads."

 Recent research has shown that deep learning (DL) faces physical realism challenges in predicting runoff responses under climate change, mainly due to DL’s data dependence and lack of process understanding. In this study, a physics-encoded neural network model (dNN) was developed to adress this. dNN enables a fully process-based way to training and prediction by encoding process-based modeling knowledge into the DL architecture, including the water balance principle and causal linkages of catchment hydrological processes. To examine whether dNN can produce reliable runoff responses under warming scenarios, we first conducted regional training for dNN on daily runoff in 29 catchment in California. Two process-based models, EXP-HYDRO and HBV, were then developed as benchmarks. Both dNN and a pure data-driven LSTM were forced under warming scenarios, and the monthly hydrographs and total runoff ratios metrics were evaluated relative to the benchmarks. The results demonstrated: (1) For monthly hydrographs, dNN exhibited advantages in capturing cold-season runoff increase and warm-season recession than LSTM, effectively predicting the changes and trends in monthly runoff under warming scenarios; (2) For total runoff ratios, dNN predicted fewer catchments with increased runoff, indicating it can better maintain the total water budget under warming scenarios; (3) Through the synergy with physics, dNN was able to reasonably infer unobserved snowpack dynamics under warming scenarios. These results highlight the credibility and necessity of considering physics for DL in predicting runoff responses under climate change.

 Early identification of rubber plantations holds significant importance for both optimal plantation management and scientific studies. Even though remote sensing techniques for mapping rubber plantations have evolved considerably since the 2000s, current methods are highly effective in detecting mature rubber plantations (MRPs), which have distinctive forest characteristics, but often fail to identify immature rubber plantations (IRPs) in a timely manner. This leads to an estimated lag of at least five years in the resulting rubber plantation maps. This paper presents a novel algorithm aimed at promptly pinpointing IRPs in the early planting stage by harnessing a composite of multi-source time series satellite imagery on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Twelve scenarios with different time intervals (3 months, 6 months, and 12 months) and datasets (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1) were tested to determine the most efficient strategy for identifying IRPs using a random forest algorithm. The results demonstrate that the data cube constructed from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 with 3-month time intervals yields the most accurate identification accuracy. Specifically, it achieves a remarkable overall accuracy of 0.78, 0.87, and 0.93 for plantations established during the second, third, and fourth years, respectively. When implemented on Hainan Island, China’s second-largest natural rubber producing base, the algorithm unveiled a significant decline trend in rubber plantation areas since 2015. Additionally, the spatial distribution exhibited pronounced heterogeneity: while the western and northern regions saw dense immature plantation clusters, the eastern coastal regions hosted only sparse plantations. These up-to-date maps of IRPs are valuable in predicting rubber production, enhancing the monitoring and management practices, and promoting the sustainable development of natural rubber industry."

 Post-wildfire vegetation cover damage and loss can escalate the risks of secondary disasters such as flood, landslide, and water contamination, particularly in a major wildfire affected region where human settlements are situated. In assessments of the secondary disaster risks, the post-wildfire vegetation cover change plays a key role in influencing the distribution and intensity of the risks. In this work, a processing framework for mapping post-wildfire vegetation cover changes through information fusion has been generated and tested using Landsat8 and WorldView imagery data. The test site was the boreal forest region surrounding Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, affected by a massive wildfire in May 2016. The derived map results indicate that the fusion process in the framework is effective for generation of post-wildfire vegetation cover change information. The use of WorldView data revealed more variation details in distribution of the vegetation cover burn damages than use of Landsat data. Moreover, the uncertainty in vegetation burn severity using Landsat-based Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) index exists in the areas with low dNBR reading values due to the sub-pixel effect. The forest burn severity measured with dNBR index can be underestimated due to the quick herbaceous cover recovery after wildfire. These uncertainties in the post-wildfire vegetation cover mapping should be taken into consideration when the derived information is being used for risk assessments."

 Forest fragmentation is a significant issue in China; however, a comprehensive understanding and assessment of the temporal trends and spatial modes of forest fragmentation remain lacking. For the first time, this study employs an object-based morphological image processing method to conduct multiscale spatiotemporal identification and analysis of China’s forest landscape from 1985 to 2023. Observations reveal an overall improvement in the integrity of China’s forest landscape from 1985 to 2023, with 79 % of counties showing a positive trend in forest landscape integrity and 5 % experiencing forest fragmentation. The forest core area in China has almost tripled from 1985 to 2023, expanding from 0.57 to 1.53 million km2. Nevertheless, 32.04 % of forests in China remain within 100 m of a non-forest edge, significantly higher than the global average (∼20 %). From 1985 to 2023, out of the 0.33 million km2 of newly planted forests, 29.5 % became forest cores, while the remaining 70.5 % constituted forest edges. This underscores the need for government planning to focus not only on expanding forest areas but also on enhancing the integrity of forest landscapes, thereby creating more ecologically valuable forest ecosystems. Analysis indicates that 25 % of forest fragmentation in China is associated with agriculture (16 %) and urbanization (9 %), while the remaining portion is linked to local topography, climate, and other natural boundaries for forest distribution. Although natural boundaries play a predominant role in forest fragmentation, there is a growing trend of agricultural activities and urbanization encroaching upon the edges. It is recommended that government policies prioritize strategic planning for forest landscape integrity, considering both quantitative expansion and qualitative optimization, to ensure the sustainable development of China’s forest ecosystems."

 Accurate delineation of agricultural parcels is crucial for ensuring food security and implementing precision agriculture practices. However, one of the primary challenges in parcel delineation revolves around the accurate extraction of parcel edges due to the diverse morphologies of these parcels. Current deep learning models for agricultural parcel delineation often produce unclosed or incomplete edges, highlighting the need to enhance the edge-awareness of the model. In this study, we proposed a refined edge-aware U-Net (REAUNet) to extract accurate agricultural parcel boundaries from Sentinel-2 images and GF-2 images. REAUNet integrates four innovative components for edge enhancement, i.e., the deep supervision, the edge detection block, the dual attention block and the refine module. The edge detection block and the dual attention block strengthen the ability of capturing spatial contextual information, and the deep supervision constrains parcel delineation across multiple scales, and the refine module further refines the parcel edges. Together, these components enhance the edge-awareness of the model, resulting in more accurate agricultural parcel delineation. From the ablation experiment, REAUNet with all four components reached the higher accuracy than the scenarios that only three out of four components were retained, which suggested that the inclusion of all four components was essential. The comparative evaluation showed that our proposed model surpassed the representative deep learning models for both thematic and geomantic accuracy. REAUNet demonstrated an increase of 2.0 % in F1-score and a decrease of 3.4 % in GTC (Global Total-Classification) compared to the SEANet, and exhibited a 0.8 % increase in IoU and a 2 % decrease in GTC relative to the MPSPNet. We also assessed the capability of the REAUNet model transferred for a new geographic region, and reported that a pre-train REAUNet model with only a small number of local samples could achieve a satisfactory accuracy. To conclude, the newly proposed REAUNet model reaches a high mapping accuracy for delineating agricultural parcels from the high-resolution images. With the powerful edge-aware capability, REAUNet can effectively utilize limited training samples to transfer a deep learning model for a new region, facilitating the generation of agricultural parcel products and a large-scale agricultural parcel mapping in practical applications."

 Remote sensing of optically complex inland waterbodies is challenging due to the complex nonlinear correlation between water quality parameters and water optical properties. However, integration of deep learning techniques and representative datasets offers the potential to address these challenges effectively. This study aims to develop robust deep learning models, utilizing limited but highly representative dataset of in-situ water quality and radiometrically corrected hyperspectral remote sensing reflectance (Rrs) measurements collected from optically diverse lakes of China, for independent and simultaneous retrieval of Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a), Secchi Disk Depth (SDD), and Total Suspended Solids (TSS) using Sentinel-2 analysis ready products. The GLObal Reflectance community dataset for Imaging and optical sensing of Aquatic environments (GLORIA) provides over 400 such measurements for Chinese lakes, which are simulated to Sentinel-2 Rrs with its spectral response function to build a representative dataset. Using this dataset, Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based Deep Neural Network (DNN) models are developed and compared with eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGB), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithms. The DNN models outperformed in effective evaluation of Chl-a (Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) = 14.18 mg/m3), TSS (RMSE=7.23 g/m3) and SDD (RMSE=0.12 m) on test datasets and Chl-a (RMSE=14.42 mg/m3) and SDD (RMSE=0.07 m) against Sentinel-2A validation dataset of Liangzi lake. Mixed Density Network (MDN) model showed less accuracy for Chl-a (RMSE=16.76 mg/m3) on same validation dataset. Impact of different atmospheric correction processors is also assessed and DNN models achieved their accuracy on Sentinel-2 Atmospheric Correction (Sen2Cor) processor. Finally, water quality maps for various lakes in China are produced showing realistic ranges.

 The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is one of the most widely used socioeconomic indicators, serving as an integral component for climate change impact analysis. However, a national scale assessment may induce considerable bias because it conceals any internal variations within a country. The lack of a long-term sub-national scale GDP data is a substantive hinderance. Leveraging the close relationship between nighttime lights and GDP, we address this gap by developing a novel methodological framework in two steps. First, under the modeling philosophy of spatial statistics, we developed a novel approach based on deep and machine learning techniques to establish a complex mapping between two inconsistent nighttime lights (NTL) datasets: the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP) and the National Polar-Orbiting Partnership’s Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The models achieve accuracies ranging from 0.945 to 0.980 (correlation coefficients). By taking the estimations ensemble of the two techniques, the time series of DMSP data was extended to 2021. Next, a novel modeling strategy based on multi-layer perceptron was developed to derive the non-linear relationship between NTL and GDP per capita at sub-national scale to alleviate scale effects at this granularity, while explicitly capturing regional heterogeneity effect. The trained models achieve average accuracies of 0.967, 0.959, and 0.959 on the training, validation, and test sets, respectively. We evaluate the developed dataset at the global, national, and sub-national scales from various perspective, and the results offer solid evidence on the reliability of the estimated economic data. By linking to historical global climate change data, we quantify global economic losses attributed to extreme heat to demonstrate how the estimated GDP data can be useful in the climate change impact analysis."

 The semantic segmentation of land use and land cover (LULC) is a crucial and widely employed remote sensing task. Conventional convolutional neural networks and vision transformers have been extensively utilized for LULC segmentation. However, high-resolution remote sensing images contain a wealth of spatial and color texture information, which is not fully exploited by traditional deep learning approaches. The information bottleneck of CNNs and transformers results in the loss of a significant amount of texture detail information during the feature extraction process, which further limits the performance of LULC segmentation. We present DDPM-SegFormer, a new framework that merges a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) and vision transformer for LULC segmentation. The aim is to address the difficulties arising from extraction in complex geographic landscapes and to alleviate information bottlenecks. The framework utilizes the ability of a DDPM to generate refined semantic features and that of vision transformer to model the global image context. Our framework introduces two main innovations. First, we use a DDPM for the first time in LULC segmentation to generate highly refined multiscale semantic features. This approach alleviates the information bottleneck caused by relying solely on a CNN or transformer architecture. Second, we develop an effective feature-level fusion strategy that utilizes multihead cross-attention between the DDPM and Transformer. This approach achieves the harmonious fusion of fine-scale semantic features, generating continuous and highly refined semantic features that enhance the segmentation accuracy. The results indicate that DDPM-SegFormer achieves an MIOU of 83.72% and an F1-score of 90.97% for the large-scale LoveDA dataset and an MIOU of 90.91% and an F1score of 93.30% for the Tarim Basin LULC dataset in a desert scenario. The research demonstrated that the refined and continuous semantic features produced by DDPM-SegFormer can significantly enhance LULC segmentation performance."

 Deep learning has significantly advanced hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, primarily due to its robust nonlinear feature extraction capabilities. The vision transformer has achieved notable performance but is limited by the quadratic computational burden of its self-attention mechanism. Recently, a network based on state space model named Mamba, has attracted considerable attention for its linear complexity and commendable performance. Nevertheless, Mamba was originally designed for one-dimensional causal sequence modeling, and its effectiveness in inherent non-causal HSI classification remains to be fully validated. To address this issue, we propose a novel Local Enhanced Mamba (LE-Mamba) network for hyperspectral image classification, which mainly comprises a Local Enhanced Spatial SSM (LES-S6), a Central Region Spectral SSM (CRS-S6), and a Multi-Scale Convolutional Gated Unit (MSCGU). The LES-S6 improves non-causal local feature extraction by incorporating a multi-directional local spatial scanning mechanism. Additionally, the CRS-S6 employs a bidirectional scanning mechanism in the spectral dimension to capture fine spectral details and integrate them with spatial information. The MSCGU utilizes a convolutional gating mechanism to aggregate features from diverse scanning routes and extract high-level semantic information. The overall accuracies of LE-Mamba on Indian Pines, WHU-Hi-HanChuan, WHU-Hi-LongKou, and Pavia University datasets are 99.16 %, 98.16 %, 99.57 %, and 99.63 %, respectively. Extensive experimental results on these four public datasets demonstrate that the LE-Mamba outperforms eight mainstream deep learning models in classification performance."

Concomitantly, the size of targets in the remote sensing images is diverse and the network cannot balance their segmentation. This paper introduces a network, Transformer-based Multi-modal Fusion Network (TMFNet), which fuses the multi-modal features and incorporates height features from the digital surface model (DSM) to supplement the extra different features between each category. Particularly, we introduce two parallel encoders to extract the features from different modalities, a Multi-Modal fusion model based on the Transformer (MMformer) to complete the multi-modal fusion, and a Border Region Attention based multi-level Fusion Module (BRAFM) to integrate the cross-level features and enhance the small target segmentation by utilizing the details around the border.

 Recently, deep learning methods have shown outstanding performance in remote sensing change detection (CD). To improve the accuracy of edge regions, researchers have introduced edge information as prior knowledge into CD methods. However, there is still room for improvement in utilizing edge information. In this study, an edge-guided multi-scale foreground attention network (EMAF) with an innovative and effective strategy is proposed. Our edge-guided strategy focuses on incorporating edge information into the feature fusion process at all levels. EMAF firstly employs a Siamese Resnet-34 as the encoder, producing four levels of bi-temporal features. Secondly, the Foreground Module (FM) is introduced to separate foreground and background at each level, resulting in foreground change features. Then, the Edge Fusion Module (EFM) is introduced to fuse the features of two adjacent levels with the edge probability map obtained by the Edge Extraction Module (EEM). Finally, after performing EFM and EEM in the three levels, EMAF generates the final change map and edge probability map. During the deep supervision training, the Dynamic Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (DWBCE) loss is calculated as the edge loss. The comparison testing results on WHU-CD, SYSU-CD, and LEVIR-CD datasets validate the effectiveness of EMAF.

 Automatic crop mapping is essential for various agricultural applications. Although fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have shown effectiveness in crop mapping, they rely on labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods offer a solution by enabling pixel-level segmentation with less costly annotations, such as point, bounding box (bbox), and image-level annotations. However, these weak annotations often lack complete object information, leading to reduced accuracy. Moreover, there is limited exploration of WSSS methods in medium-resolution satellite imagery, such as Sentinel-2. Therefore, this study proposes SAMWS, a WSSS method based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for crop mapping using Sentinel-2 time series images. Leveraging SAM, our method can generate high-quality pseudo labels and accommodate various weak annotations without extensive adjustments. SAMWS comprises three stages: 1) finetuning SAM with adapters; 2) generating pseudo labels using weak annotations and finetuned SAM; and 3) training a segmentation network using pseudo labels for crop mapping. Experiments conducted on PASTIS and Munich datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. After SAM was finetuned with adapters, the F1-scores for parcel segmentation using point and bbox prompts increased by 75.0 % and 14.4 %, respectively, reaching 0.880 and 0.931. Additionally, our method achieves classification results closest to fully supervised learning when using point, bbox, and image-level annotations, with F1-scores of 0.810, 0.817, and 0.779, respectively. Our approach offers valuable insights into leveraging foundation models in the remote sensing domain and contains significant potential for crop monitoring.

 Extracting road network maps for high-resolution remote sensing images is a critical and challenging remote sensing topic, with significant importance for traffic navigation, disaster management, autonomous driving, and urban planning. Although deep learning has demonstrated its powerful feature extraction capabilities in image processing tasks, including road extraction, existing road extraction algorithms still have some limitations. In particular, semantic segmentation-based methods often lack supervision of the connection relationships between roads and topological correctness constraints, resulting in fragmented and poorly connected road network graphs. Moreover, graph-based methods lack effective supervision strategies for vertex misdetection issues. To deal with these issues, we propose a deeply supervised vertex network (DSVNet) for road network graph extraction. First, to effectively supervise road vertices, we design a road vertex supervision module that yields improved vertex prediction accuracy. Second, to merge the benefits of segmentation-based methods and graph-based methods, we establish a parallel semantic segmentation branch based on the vertex querying task, thereby achieving enhanced road extraction accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce deformable attention into the model to boost its performance and computational efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of DSVNet on two large-scale public datasets. A large number of experimental results show that our research approach achieves the best road detection performance."

 The fusion of remote sensing and artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, offers substantial opportunities for developing innovative methods in rapid disaster mapping and damage assessment. However, current models for wildfire burnt area detection and mapping are mostly constrained in handling imbalanced training samples with non-burnt areas oversampled, boundary areas with a mix of burnt and unburnt pixels, and regions with varying environmental contexts, leading to poor model generalizability. In response, this paper proposes a novel U-Net based model, known as BiAU-Net, which incorporates attention mechanisms and a well-designed loss function, enabling the model to focus on burnt areas and improve accuracy and efficiency, especially in detecting edges and small areas. Unlike traditional single-input U-Net models for image segmentation, the proposed BiAU-Net considers and incorporates temporal changes with two inputs, pre- and post-fire Sentinel-2 imagery, enhancing performance across diverse environmental areas. Five independent areas from different continents are selected as study cases, one for training the model and all five for testing, to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed model. We used the Fire Disturbance Climate Change Initiative v5.1 product from the European Space Agency as a baseline for model evaluation.

 The frequent occurrence of urban floods (UFs) poses significant threats to citizens’ lives and the national economy. Utilizing machine learning to assess urban flood susceptibility (UFS) provides valuable decision support for UF management. However, the precision of current studies is usually influenced by the variability of temporal factors like extreme rainfall, which limits the accurate identification of urban flood-susceptible regions (UFSRs). To address this issue, we present a novel approach that leverages the spatiotemporal distribution and characteristics of UFS to accurately identify UFSRs. In our case study of the Greater Bay Area (GBA) in China, we employed the Random Forest to assess the spatiotemporal distribution of UFS. We then used the Savitzky-Golay filter to correct UFS data based on the UFS time series from 2011 to 2020. The Theil-Sen median slope, Mann-Kendall test, and Hurst analysis were used to explore the spatiotemporal patterns of UFS. Shapley additive explanation was applied to quantify the contribution of selected variables.

 Nowadays, embedding-based pan-sharpening networks aimed at fusing panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images are abundant, yet their results still show spectral distortion and spatial fuzziness. In this paper, we design a multi-scale fusion structure to minimize the gap between the pan-sharpened image and the reference image progressively. Specifically, we proposed a method based on the scale difference between PAN and MS images, using a convolutional neural network embedding pixel difference enhanced module (PDEM) to obtain the pan-sharpened image and minimizing the losses from each scale. The network includes three scales, each scale contains the PDEM to generate the intermediate results until to the last scale which obtains the final pan-sharpened result. The designed PDEM extracts deep features from PAN and MS images, using different kernel sizes and receptive field scales to diversify the extracted information. Three-direction pixel difference convolutions (PDCs) are utilized to maintain and enhance the edge details of spatial information. The loss function is to sum up the mean square error and mean absolute error between the pan-sharpened image and the reference image at three scales. Extensive experiments suggest the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods from visual and quantitative perspectives, and confirm the effectiveness of PDEM in extracting and retaining image information and edge enhancement. The high-level vision task experiments also show our method has good practical value for further applications."

The network demonstrates superior performance in detecting weak and small targets in complex ground environments, achieving significant improvements over baseline methods and showcasing the potential of the group target detection approach. 
 Small target detection in remote sensing is integral to a range of applications, including smart city systems and emergency rescue operations. However, the challenges posed by weak features and complex backgrounds in remote sensing images have hindered the efficacy of detection. Current models tend to focus on identifying individual targets, resulting in algorithms with larger parameters, slower detection efficiency, and difficulty in striking a balance between false positives and negatives. Given that many tasks do not require precise target location, a more efficient approach involves swiftly predicting target areas with models involving fewer parameters. This paper introduces the concept of group target distribution detection, gathering targets with similar distances and semantic similarities for clustered detection. A Gaussian probability map, formed from target density, is used to train a probability prediction model. We propose a new metric for evaluating this innovative group target distribution detection paradigm and provide a comparative assessment with traditional single-object detection models. In experimental evaluation, our proposed DenseUGE network — employing ResNet34 and ResNet50 as its backbone — surpasses the best baseline method by 3.37% on the AI-TOD dataset using our metrics. Additionally, visualizations demonstrate the ability of our proposed methodology to effectively identify the concentrated distribution of small target groups."

 Understanding soil moisture dynamics is crucial for crop growth. The digital mapping of field soil moisture distribution provides valuable information for agricultural water management. The optical satellite data provides fine scale soil moisture information for a region. However, these data are greatly limited due to cloud contamination and revisit period. Despite the reported beneficial effects of spatiotemporal fusion methods, the accurate estimates of high-resolution soil moisture through spatiotemporal fusion data are still unclear, particularly when using Sentinel-2/3 fusion images. This study introduces a new soil moisture estimation framework integrating spatio-temporal spectral information from Sentinel-2/3 fusion images and machine learning algorithm,and thus provide spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture estimation. The framework includes four fusion methods (ESTARRFM, Fit-FC, FSDAF and STFMF) and four machine learning models (PLSR, SVM, RF and GBRT). The feasibility of the framework was validated in the Hetao Irrigation Area of Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that the Sentinel-2/3 fused image generated by Fit-FC was visually the closest to the true image, followed by ESTARFM, FSDAF, and STFMF. The spatiotemporal fusion-machine learning estimation framework provided reliable estimation for multi-layer (0 ∼ 20, 20 ∼ 40 and 40 ∼ 60 cm) soil water in the irrigation area. The dense time series of soil water generated by the framework facilitated the detection of irrigation events in the irrigated farmland. Our findings highlighted the effectiveness of Sentinel-2/3 fused images in providing high-resolution continuous daily monitoring of farmland soil water on a large scale. These high spatial–temporal resolution time series are valuable for monitoring crop growth and water resource management, contributing to further expanding the application of satellite remote sensing in precision agriculture."

 Analyzing spatially varying effects is pivotal in geographic analysis. However, accurately capturing and interpreting this variability is challenging due to the increasing complexity and non-linearity of geospatial data. Recent advancements in integrating Geographically Weighted (GW) models with artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies offer novel approaches. However, these methods often focus on single algorithms and emphasize prediction over interpretability. The recent GeoShapley method integrates machine learning (ML) with Shapley values to explain the contribution of geographical features, advancing the combination of geospatial ML and explainable AI (XAI). Yet, it lacks exploration of the nonlinear interactions between geographical features and explanatory variables. Herein, an ensemble framework is proposed to merge local spatial weighting scheme with XAI and ML technologies to bridge this gap. Through tests on synthetic datasets and comparisons with GWR, MGWR, and GeoShapley, this framework is verified to enhance interpretability and predictive accuracy by elucidating spatial variability. Reproducibility is explored through the comparison of spatial weighting schemes and various ML models, emphasizing the necessity of model reproducibility to address model and parameter uncertainty.

 Existing deep learning-based hyperspectral anomaly detection methods typically perform anomaly detection by reconstructing a clean background. However, for the deep networks, there are many parameters that need to be adjusted. To reduce parameters of network and improve the performance of anomaly detection, a light CNN based on residual learning and background estimation was proposed. Different from traditional methods, the proposed method could directly learn anomaly features rather than background features. First, during the training stage, a background estimation method based on non-central convolution kernels was used to obtain the pseudo-background. Second, to purify the pseudo-background, a pair down-sampling method and a joint loss that combines cross-approximation background loss and consistency loss were proposed. Third, the anomaly matrix was obtained by the difference between the hyperspectral image (HSI) and the pseudo-background. Fourth, a light CNN with three layers was proposed to extract features of the anomaly matrix. Finally, during the prediction stage, anomaly detection results were calculated from the predicted anomaly matrix obtained by light CNN through the Mahalanobis distance.

 To reduce the high redundancy of band information in hyperspectral data, various band optimization methods have been adopted, which could be divided into two types namely band extraction (e.g., principal component analysis, PCA) and band selection (e.g., Spearman correlation coefficient, SRC). However, the applicability and effectiveness of different band optimization methods were rarely reported in the literature. Therefore, based on the rock sample data of the Baixintan deposit, we compare the performance of two band optimization algorithms (principal component analysis−based band extraction and SRC-based band selection) in inverting metal elements (Cu, Fe, Ni, Cr, Mg) using the adaptive genetic algorithms-gradient boosting regression tree (AGA-GBRT) algorithm. Two band optimization methods have shown different effects in improving the accuracy of target metal elements. The five models with the highest accuracy in metal elements include LT-R-Cu, LT-PCA-Fe, ORI-PCA-Ni, SDT-PCA-Cr, and LT-PCAMg. In the established model, the inversion accuracy of the Cu element is the lowest, possibly due to the high variability of the data itself (coefficient of variation is 3.55). Fe and Ni highly correlated with Cu elements were used to indirectly invert Cu element. Compared with the direct inversion model, the accuracy of the indirect inversion model has increased by 11%. Overall, PCA is more effective than SRC in predicting the content of metal elements in rocks. The conclusion presented in this article provides a ground experimental basis and technical support for future optimization of hyperspectral bands and inversion methods of metal element content in rocks."

 Agricultural drought is a major natural disaster affecting biomass accumulation and causing food loss, exacerbated by the increasing frequency of flash droughts and compounded drought-heatwave events. Traditional optical remote sensing indices cannot directly represent the water content of vegetation, resulting in a limited understanding of crop response to drought. To address this gap, we investigated the responsiveness of microwave Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) with four bands (L-, C-, X-, KU-) and four emerging VOD-derived products to drought conditions in crops in the Midwest US. These products include the normalized Difference Between Night and Day VOD (nVOD), Slope of the Regression of Day and Night VOD (σ), Standardized VOD Index (SVODI), and VOD to estimate Gross Primary Productivity (VOD2GPP). They employ different theoretical modeling approaches to crop growth and water use strategies. We comprehensively analyzed the trend, seasonality, and residual of VODs, using Leaf Area Index (LAI) for comparison, and further assessed the lagged and cumulative effects, quantified drought sensitivity, and captured responsiveness to cumulative drought using thresholds. The results showed a time lag in the response of VOD series to drought as indicated by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). VODs achieved faster responses and higher correlations compared to LAI. Among them, VOD_L exhibited the most statistically significant pixels (39.84%) and positive Rmax-lag with 96.81% of all pixels. For cumulative effects, VOD_L, VOD_C, VOD_X, VOD_KU, and SVODI were highly correlated in the early stages of droughts. We also found that crops in Iowa exhibited medium to high drought sensitivity (average values of 0.55 to 0.74), with the highest drought sensitivity calculated using the isohydricity indicator, σ. Based on threshold comparison, σ showed a timely response in the first month of drought (average of −0.62), whereas VOD_L and VOD_C performed best in the second month (both averaging −1.85), and VOD2GPP (−2.94) was the most responsive in the third month. Due to water use strategy, maize responded more quickly to the onset of drought compared to soybeans. Overall, the results demonstrated that VOD is promising for crop phenology and drought research.

 Climate change, particularly extreme weather events, has significantly affected various sectors, including agriculture, human health, water resources, sea levels, and ecosystems. It is anticipated that the intensity, duration, and frequency of these extremes will escalate in the future. This study aims to discover the association between temperature extremes and agricultural yield and to project these extremes using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models with CMIP6 (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6) data under two SSPs (Shared Socioeconomic Pathways). A bi-wavelet coherence technique is employed to investigate the association, providing detailed information in both the frequency and time domains for the period of 1980–2014. Various ML and DL models are trained and tested for the periods of 1985–2004 and 2005–2014, respectively, with gradient boosting machine chosen for projecting temperature extremes based on its superior performance. Mann-Kendall test is used for trend analysis in the projected temperature extremes. The results indicate strong negative and positive associations between TN10p (Cold nights) and TN90p (Warm nights), respectively, with wheat production. Additionally, there is a long-term negative association of CSDI (Cold Spell Duration Indicator) and strong positive association of WSDI (Warm Spell Duration Indicator) with rice yield. Projected results show an increase and decrease under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5, respectively, in DTR (Diurnal Temperature Range) at most stations. TN10p will increase in the future at most stations, with exceptions such as Muree station where it decreases during 2025–2049 and then increases under both SSPs.

 Accurate mapping of irrigated croplands is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of agricultural practices and land management. Despite recent advancements, there remains room for further exploration of the effective fusion of temporal information from multitemporal remote sensing images, which is essential for capturing the dynamic nature of agricultural landscapes. Many existing irrigation mapping methods concatenate multitemporal images in a direct way and thus neglect the temporal relationships within the image time series, especially the sequence and interdependencies of the temporal dimension. To address this gap, a novel deep learning model, named the attention-enhanced spatial–temporal high-resolution network (AEST-HRNet), which incorporates parallel processing and a fusion mechanism of multiresolution information streams, three-dimensional (3D) spatial–temporal convolution, and temporal attention modules, was proposed. When applied to irrigated regions in Washington and California, USA, AEST-HRNet effectively extracted irrigated areas using multitemporal Sentinel-2 images obtained with the Google Earth Engine (GEE). To validate the results, 208 representative sample patches were selected, and the AEST-HRNet maps were compared against third-party ground reference data and statistics from the United States National Agricultural Statistics Survey (NASS). Quantitative assessment revealed an impressive F1-score of 0.956, an intersection over union (IoU) value of 0.867, and an overall accuracy (OA) value of 0.973 in Washington, outperforming publicly released maps.

 Vegetation is one of the most crucial components of terrestrial ecosystems, and monitoring vegetation change as well as studying the factors that drive its formation provide significant guidance for restoring ecological biodiversity. The choice of driving indicators for vegetation change in previous studies has not been comprehensive enough, and particularly groundwater depth has not been considered. Therefore, 10 natural factors and 5 human factors were chosen for our study. We adopted the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to measure vegetation growth. In this study, we utilized trend analysis, the Mann-Kendall test, and the Hurst index to investigate the spatiotemporal variance of NDVI in the YDRB. The geographical detector model (Geodetector) was employed to examine vegetation change attributed to human and natural variables. As a result of the study, we found that over the past 22 years, the NDVI in the basin increased from 0.62 to 0.70, with an increase of +0.0040/yr. Land use type is the most significant driver affecting NDVI changes. The interaction of two factors has a greater effect on vegetation change more than a single factor. The relationship between land use type and annual mean precipitation explained 34.5 % of the change in vegetation. Groundwater depth contributed 4.1 % to the explanation of vegetation change. Furthermore, we have determined the optimal range of specific variables conducive to vegetation growth. The results help us further understand the potential driving mechanism of vegetation cover change in the YDRB and provide a theoretical reference for relevant managers to formulate the ecological restoration measures in the basin."

Firstly, there was a significant increase in vegetation coverage, accompanied by a reduction in soil erosion intensity. Secondly, approximately 64 % of cropland was converted, leading to an expansion of forest and grassland areas. Thirdly, the focus of vegetation restoration was primarily on converting cropland to grassland, indicating its suitability for the county compared to forestation. Lastly, the conversion of steep cropland (>25°) was influenced by the density of less steep cropland (<25°). This study emphasizes the importance of guiding farmers in selecting appropriate vegetation restoration strategies and finding a balance between erosion control and agricultural production within the Grain for Green Project. Furthermore, the study recognizes that the project’s significant effects are not solely attributed to land use conversion but also to the self-restoration of vegetation. This shift towards a self-restoration perspective is crucial for the future high-quality development of the Grain for Green Project."

 Sea breeze front (SBF) is one of the important weather systems affecting the occurrence and development of severe convective weather in the Bohai Bay region (BBR). 226 cases of merger-type SBFs (MSBFs) merged with gust fronts (GFs) and convective systems (CSs), respectively, were identified based on Doppler weather radar data and ground-based automatic weather station data from May to September during 2009–2018 in the BBR, and their basic tempo-spatial characteristics and associated atmospheric circulation backgrounds are documented for the first time.The number of MSBFs cases merged with GFs (MSBF-GFs) and that of MSBFs merged with CSs (MSBF-CSs) were 172 and 54, respectively. The number of MSBFs varied significantly in each year, with 37 (13) in the most (least) frequent year, and with an average number of 22.6 per year. More than 93.8 % of the MSBFs occurred from June to August, especially most frequent (37.2 %) in July. The merging locations of the MSBFs were mainly distributed in the central-northern Tianjin and the southeastern Hebei province, and the horizontal scales of MSBFs were mainly distributed in the range of 130–309 km. About 29.6 % (51.9 %) of the MSBF-CSs cases resulted in significantly (slightly) enhanced convections, while 51.4 % (23.8 %) of the MSBF-GFs bring about significantly (slightly) enhanced convections. About 72.1 % of the MSBF-GFs cases are merged in near “face-to-face” form, and their 49.2 % (23.4 %) proportion lead to significantly (slightly) enhanced convections. The atmospheric circulation patterns of MSBFs identified using objective classification method showed that, the major two patterns (occupied 56.6 % cases) have similar dynamic, thermodynamic, and water vapor characteristics including westerlies or southwesterlies with intensity about 8–10 m/s at 500 hPa, showing significant warm and moist air delivered from the south and relatively weak vertical wind shear along with intense water vapor convergence at 850 hPa."

 Shallow-water benthic habitat classification of coral reefs based on satellite remote sensing is an important part of coral reef monitoring. Leveraging its potent capacity for feature learning, and generalization, deep learning emerges as a robust method for coral reef benthic habitat classification. Due to the complexity of the marine environment, it is difficult to produce high-quality pixel-by-pixel labels for deep learning-based methods, which makes it challenging to recover structural details of coral reef benthic habitats. Bathymetry data can provide spatial contextual information and geometric features, serving as auxiliary features to provide abundant structural information for benthic classification models. However, how to use bathymetry and what kind of bathymetry features to employ for assisting model learning remains to be explored. Therefore, a bathymetry feature fusion-weakly supervised coral reef benthic habitat classification model (BFFBHCM) is proposed. BFFBHCM is supervised by sparse benthic habitat samples with bathymetry and can generate dense, multi-scale bathymetry features. With the robust bathymetry-benthic feature fusion module (B-BFFM), BFFBHCM can consider both semantic and structural details of the benthic habitats, thus generating highly accurate benthic habitat classification results. Experiments were conducted using the NJUReef + dataset containing 10 coral reefs in the Spratly Islands, China, constructed based on in-situ data. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BFFBHCM is insensitive to the vertical error in bathymetry, with an average mIoU 22.54 % higher than state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, it outperforms the weakly-supervised method that excludes bathymetry by 10.14 %, and still exhibits generalization to coral reefs in different regions around the world."

 The rapid progression of the intelligent grid requires continuous vigilance in monitoring and maintaining extensive powerline corridors to ensure their safety. In this context, LiDAR technology, renowned for its exceptional precision and reduced vulnerability to external interference, emerges as a valuable alternative for monitoring powerline corridors. This contrasts with conventional methods such as manual field inspections and imprecise sensors. However, the vast amount of data generated by LiDAR presents significant challenges, including scene noise, diverse scenarios, and unwanted objects proximate to powerlines or pylons. These factors complicate the accurate extraction and analysis of relevant data from point clouds produced by LiDAR. This review examines recent methodologies aimed at overcoming these challenges. It begins with a brief exploration of data collection systems for powerline corridors, including TLS, MLS, UAVLS, ALS, and CIR, highlighting their respective merits and drawbacks. The subsequent sections of the review provide a comprehensive overview of three methodological categories: tracking and detection-based approaches, machine learning-based techniques, and deep learning-based methods. Within each category, representative techniques are delineated, elucidating their potential, limitations, and applicable domains. This review incorporates qualitative analysis to enhance researchers' comprehension of current studies and to providea nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques. In a departure from previous research, this review extends its focus beyond powerline extraction to include the extraction of pylons and single wires. It identifies a notable oversight in the lack of emphasis on individual wire extraction, attributing this to challenges posed by wire proximity, and highlights limited attention to pylon extraction near vegetation. While machine learning and deep learning methods offer heightened automation, persistent issues such as the requirement for extensive labeled samples and inadequate model generalization, underscore the need for continued efforts to address these challenges. This discussion emphasizes the necessity of overcoming these hurdles to boost ongoing advancements in powerline and pylon extraction techniques."

 High-quality surface reconstruction and texture reconstruction of large-scale scene play a pivotal role in the domains of ancient architecture, cultural heritage preservation, and 3D urban modeling. Given that point cloud data has emerged as a crucial medium for representing three-dimensional spatial information, its utilization for surface and texture reconstruction becomes indispensable. In this research, we propose a novel framework for reconstructing surface and texture from unstructured colorful point clouds without normal information to restore large-scale real-world scenes. Specifically, we first introduce an automatic virtual viewpoint selection method to generate virtual views by rendering the point cloud from multiple viewpoints. Subsequently, we construct a two-step network to facilitate accurate visibility prediction and texture inpainting for each virtual view. Then, the visibility information from multiple perspectives is integrated to solve an optimization problem incorporating visibility constraints, resulting in the generation of a 3D mesh. Subsequently, texture information from various perspectives is integrated, filtering techniques are applied to determine the optimal perspective for texturing, and a texture atlas is generated. Precise texture mapping is then performed, ultimately leading to the production of a comprehensive textured model. In contrast to alternative learning-based methodologies, our framework exclusively learns from two-dimensional images, encompassing the prediction of both visible and invisible points as well as the execution of image inpainting tasks. This approach exhibits exceptional versatility in managing large-scale point clouds while effectively leveraging the color and intensity attributes of the data for precise texture reconstruction. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant improvement of 2.06% in F-scores for outdoor surface reconstruction compared to the current state-of-the-art learning-based methods, while also outperforming them in texture reconstruction."

 Equipped with the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) of 532 nm, the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) is enabled to penetrate the water surface to retrieve water depth information at certain depths. However, signal photon extraction is significantly impacted by noise and varying terrain conditions, particularly in deep water regions with weaker signal photons. To address these challenges, this study proposed a novel bathymetric signal extraction method for ICESat-2/ATLAS data based on adaptive rotating ellipse and B-spline curve iterative filtering. First, raw photons are segregated into water surface and bottom photons using the specular return removal algorithm and combined with the RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to derive water surface elevation. Second, our method employs the modified Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) with adaptive variable ellipse and B-spline curve iterative filtering to detect bottom signal photons. Following refraction and tidal corrections, water depth is computed. Finally, the bathymetric accuracy of the proposed algorithm is evaluated using manually labeled photons and airborne bathymetric LiDAR data. The experimental results indicate the proposed algorithm’s superior F_score value, which increased by about 6.6 % and 4.1 % compared with the high-confidence photons and Adaptive Variable Ellipse Filtering Bathymetric Method (AVEBM). Moreover, the Mean Absolute Deviation (MAE) of bathymetric accuracy is 0.47 m, the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) is 0.55 m, and Coefficient of Determination (R2) of bathymetric accuracy is 0.93. The proposed method effectively extracts signal photons and provides accurate water depth for nearshore bathymetry estimation."

 Three-dimensional laser scanning technology is widely employed in various fields due to its advantage in rapid acquisition of geographic scene structures. Achieving high precision and automated semantic segmentation of three-dimensional point cloud data remains a vital challenge in point cloud recognition. This study introduces a Multilevel Intuitive Attention Network (MIA-Net) designed for point cloud segmentation. MIA-Net consists of three key components: local trigonometric function encoding, feature sampling, and intuitive attention interaction. Initially, trigonometric encoding captures fine-grained local semantics within disordered point clouds. Subsequently, a multilayer perceptron addresses point-cloud feature pyramid construction, and feature sampling is performed using the point offset mechanism in the different levels. Finally, the multilevel intuitive attention(MIA) mechanism facilitates feature interactions across different layers, enabling the capture of both local attention features and global structure. The point-offset attention scheme introduced in this study significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional attention mechanisms, enhancing computational efficiency while preserving the advantages of attention mechanisms. To evaluate the results of MIA-Net, the ISPRS Vaihingen benchmark, LASDU and GML airborne datasets were tested. Experiments show that our network can achieve state-of-art performance in terms of Overall Accuracy(OA) and average F1-score(e.g., reaching 96.2% and 66.7% for GML datasets, respectively)."

 Accurate mapping of terrain elevations at a large scale and fine resolution can characterize the detailed surface height and geomorphic changes and is very critical for the studies of the internal motions and external forces of the earth. The emergence of the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) offers unprecedented possibilities for global elevation mapping with high vertical accuracy using three-dimensional photon points. However, the ICESat-2 photon points are still sparse in terms of spatial/horizontal resolution, making it unable to satisfy the high-resolution demand of terrain elevation mapping and digital elevation model production. A few previous studies have attempted to estimate elevations/topography in regions with single landscape and landcover (e.g., forest, shallow water, and polar regions) by combining ICESat-2 data with other passive satellite remotely sensed data. However, the potential and capability of ICESat-2 for mapping elevations for spatially continuous large regions with multiple complicated land cover types remains unknown. In this study, a spatially continuous large-scale terrain elevation estimation method is developed under multiple land covers based on the random forest model and the freely accessed satellite data of ICESat-2, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. The core principle is to construct a random forest model that can characterize the complicated relationships of the ICESat-2 ATL03 terrain elevations and their corresponding land cover related polarization characteristics and spectral variables from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, respectively. Integrating the superiorities of the data of these three different satellites enables the proposed method to extrapolate the terrain elevations with decimeter-level vertical accuracy and 10 m spatial/horizontal resolution simultaneously without any prior in situ data or manually set parameters. The proposed method is tested using the elevations from 2021 to 2022 at the third largest island (Chongming Island, Shanghai) in China. The estimated terrain elevations are locally validated with the airborne LiDAR-derived elevations. Moreover, they are compared with the ICESat-2 ATL08 height_terrain_bestfit data and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation L2A elev_lowestmode data from the global perspectives. The predicted elevations exhibit a high correlation with the measured elevations from the two airborne LiDAR validation regions with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.34 and 0.59 m. The averaged RMSEs of the predicted elevations at different land covers are 1.26 and 1.18 m when compared with those derived from ATL08 and GEDI L2A, respectively. No remarkable abnormal predicted elevations are observed. This finding suggests the satisfactory robustness performance of the proposed method under different land covers and a relatively good consistency between the predicted elevations and the actual terrain of the entire island. As far as we know, the present work is the first to map elevations at 10 m resolution based only on the newly available satellite active and passive remotely sensed data without any ground truth surveys, manual intervention, and prior knowledge. Different with existing studies for terrain elevation mapping only at single landcovers, the proposed method demonstrates the capability and effectiveness of ICESat-2 for any landforms and landcovers and shows great potential for high-accuracy and high-resolution time-series terrain elevation estimation and updating at regional/national/global scales."

 Accurate detection of changes in buildings is crucial for the understanding of urban development. The growing accessibility of remote sensing imagery has enabled urban scale change detection (CD) in both 2D and 3D. However, existing methods have not yet fully exploited the fusion of feature information in multi-temporal images, resulting in insufficient accuracy in 2D changed regions or in elevation changes. To this end, a Cross-temporal and Spatial Context Learning Network (CSCLNet) aimed at multi-task building CD from dual-temporal optical images is proposed, capturing both 2D and 3D changes simultaneously. It leverages a CNN network to extract multi-layer semantic features. Subsequently, two modules, Cross-temporal Transformer Semantic Enhancement (CTSE) and Multi-layer Feature Fusion (MFF), are developed to refine the feature representations. CTSE enhances temporal information by cross attention of dual-temporal features to enable interactions and MFF fuses multi-layer features and enhances attention to global and local spatial context. Finally, two prediction heads are introduced to separately handle 2D and 3D change prediction, identifying changed building objects and their elevation changes. Experiments conducted with two public datasets, 3DCD and SMARS, show that the CSCLNet achieves state-of-the-art for both 2D and 3D CD tasks. In particular, the change-specific RMSE of elevation changes has been reduced to 4.52 m in real world scenes. The code is available at: https://github.com/Geo3DSmart/CSCLNet."

 Efficient prediction and precise depiction of heavy metal concentrations in urban soil are essential for mitigating non-point source pollution and safeguarding public health. Therefore, this research investigated the estimation of soil heavy metal concentrations derived from Gaofen-5 (GF-5) hyperspectral images calibrated by the direct standardization (DS) algorithm. The inversion strategy for soil heavy metal concentrations in response to the two-dimensional soil spectral index (2D-SSI) was proposed by coupling Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and competitive adaptive reweighting algorithm (CARS) for feature selection.

 Plastic greenhouses (PGs) are integral to modern agricultural practices, enhancing crop yields but also raising environmental concerns. Consequently, comprehending their widespread distribution is essential. Although deep learning has been extensively used for land use/cover classification and extraction with satellite data, the large number of labels limits its application due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual labeling. This study introduces a novel approach coupling Prior Knowledge and Deep Learning methods for PG Mapping (PGMPK+DL) using Sentinel-1/2 data. We use an automatic labeling strategy guided by prior knowledge from Sentinel-2 optical data to construct PG labels in six small regions. Moreover, to overcome the cloud contamination issue of optical data, the potential of Sentinel-1 time-series SAR data for PG extraction is analyzed. Deep learning methods are further utilized to capture more abstract and generalized temporal and spatial features from time-series radar data to accommodate complex scenes for large-scale PG extraction. The U-Net model emerges as superior from rigorous comparisons among FCN, SegNet, U-Net, DeepLabV3 + and U-Net3 + deep learning models. Finally, the U-Net model harnessed prior knowledge-based PG labels and Sentinel-1 time-series SAR data to generate a precise map depicting PG distribution across Shandong province, China. Remarkably, it accurately identifies approximately 238,000 ha of PG areas. This PGMPK+DL approach presents a groundbreaking solution for label construction, enabling the achievement of large-scale PG extraction.

 Chlorophyll is both a cornerstone of plant photosynthesis and an important indicator for assessing crop growth and health. Although many previous studies have explored the use of remote sensing to retrieve chlorophyll content, there is room for improvement in the proposed retrieval models, especially the hybrid model, and its performance in combination with multi-angle remote sensing remains unknown. To this end, we developed a hybrid chlorophyll retrieval model by coupling PROSAIL, Gaussian process regression, and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) based on multi-angle (−60° to 60°) hyperspectral observations of maize. The CWT converts PROSAIL-modeled and measured spectral reflectance into wavelet features (WF) that finely capture signals due to chlorophyll changes, making WF-based hybrid models (HMWF) promising for enhanced chlorophyll retrieval. Our results show that for leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) retrieval, combining low and medium scale WFs (scales3-5) with hybrid models is more advantageous than using other scale WFs. The accuracy of the HMWF based on the best-scale WF was significantly higher than that of the hybrid model based on original spectrum or vegetation indices. Additionally, our evaluation of the effect of viewing zenith angles (VZAs) on HMWF showed that the accuracies of HMWF acquired at non-nadir angles were generally higher than those acquired at nadir angle. Among all models, the HMWF based on the scale3 WF had the highest accuracy at −10°, with R2 = 0.85 and RMSE=3.55 for LCC retrievals, and R2 = 0.78 and RMSE=0.22 for CCC retrievals. Furthermore, the HMWF showed the least sensitivity to changes in VZAs, especially in the range of −10° to −40°.

 Accurate estimation of crown fire potential (CFP) can improve guidance on crown fire control and management. However, robust simulations of crown fire behavior are still challenging, limiting the accuracy of regional-scale CFP mapping. This study aims to incorporate fire spread simulation and machine learning algorithms to improve CFP mapping at a regional scale. First, we built a crown fire dataset using the fire simulations from the FARSITE model, as well as multi-source data, including fuel, weather, and topography variables. Fuel model parameters were optimized with four metaheuristic algorithms for robust fire simulations. Then, the hybrid models of CFP estimation (TBA-ML) were established by coupling with the transfer AdaBoost (TrAdaBoost) algorithm and three machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., Bayesian Network (BN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to estimate CFP for crown fire danger assessment spatially. Results showed that the TBA-BN model performed best in estimating CFP with higher accuracy (AUC>0.9 and F1 score > 0.8) than the RF- and SVM-based CFP models. The variable importance and causal analysis showed that fuel and topography variables have major contributions to crown fire occurrence. Finally, we mapped monthly average passive and active CFP at regional scales and qualitatively demonstrated that our CFP time-series products successfully captured the dynamic change of crown fire danger. The above results suggest the potential of integrating fire spread simulation and machine learning algorithms to accurately estimate CFP to improve crown fire management."

 The production of wild fish has remained relatively stable in the last two decades, whereas aquaculture organism production has increased to the point where it has exceeded wild catches. In this context, accurate and up-to-date information about the current usage of marine areas for aquaculture is crucial for the planning of marine activities. However, this data is often limited to national authorities, and discrepancies between planned and real practices can arise in available data. In this study, a novel methodology to automatically map and verify the current activity of aquaculture crops across European regions based on freely available satellite data is proposed. The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Sentinel-1 mission provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, which serve as the basis for the analysis. Multiple SAR images of the same locations are processed using ESA Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software and merged to remove temporal noise-like artifacts caused by factors such as ships and waves. Next, the iDPolRAD algorithm is employed to detect potential aquaculture sites, which initially include noise from coastal zones and unwanted human and natural structures that pass through the filter. The aquaculture sites are classified using a ResNet18 model with 93% of the sites correctly classified. This implies that it is feasible to monitor marine areas using satellite radar data to track aquaculture areas. However, generalization power across regions is poor likely due to the diversity of types of structures used and species cultivated. Further studies are needed to investigate factors influencing the detectability of different aquaculture sites such as cage geometry or SAR image resolution in order to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the mapping process. This study highlights the potential of SAR data, coupled with image processing and classification techniques, as a viable means to map large marine areas dedicated to aquaculture."

 Rapid generation of tree models from point clouds of tree canopies holds wide-ranging applications in the field of earth sciences, including forest ecology research, environmental monitoring, and forest management. Traditional tree modeling methods rely on procedural models to simulate tree growth, which are time-consuming due to their extensive manual parameterization. Furthermore, existing deep learning methods struggle to generate visually realistic tree models because of the complex branch structures and specific natural patterns of trees. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based method for rapidly generating tree models that align with the shape of the tree canopy. Different from traditional methods, we use deep neural networks to build branch graphs for generating tree models. Our method consists of two main steps: i) the 3D coordinates of each tree node are generated from the canopy point cloud by the designed node coordinate generation network; ii) a graph neural network is proposed to predict node attributes and the adjacency relationship between nodes. To form the tree structure, the discrete nodes are connected by using the minimum spanning tree algorithm combined with the adjacency relationship. The attributes of the node include width, whether it is a leaf node, and leaf node size, which are used for subsequent construction of the tree’s mesh. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, a large-scale dataset containing 10 forests with 3216 tree canopies is constructed and open sourced for the study of generating tree models from point clouds of tree canopies. Experimental results demonstrate our method’s efficiency in generating tree models quickly (reducing the average canopy-to-tree reconstruction time from 7 min to less than 0.5 s) while preserving visual authenticity and accurately matching tree canopy shapes, making it suitable for a wide range of forest reconstructions."

 As global land cover/ land use change (LULCC) threatens the human’s well-being, accurate detection and characterization of LULCC is of paramount importance. The increasing availability of dense satellite image time series (SITS), together with the ever-improving change detection algorithms, has allowed significant progress to be made. However, much remains to be done in its characterization.This study aims to uncover potential relationships between changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) SITS patterns and their drivers. It distinguishes itself by representing phenological changes not only as transitions between specific patterns, but also by examining the nature of these changes—whether abrupt, gradual, or seasonal. For seasonal changes, it further refines the analysis to determine their impact on the amplitude, number of seasons (NOS), or length of seasons (LOS) components. Our focus is to provide insights into the land dynamics and drivers of change in Senegal using an RGB (red, green, blue) composite change map. This map is derived from three MODIS NDVI time series change metrics detected by BFASTm-L2 within the MODIS NDVI 2000–2021 SITS: magnitude of change, direction of change, and dissimilarity of time series shape. The 250-meter resolution MODIS data served as an optimal data source for this analysis due to its high temporal resolution (near daily) and extensive coverage over 20 years.The sensitivity of each metric to different types of change was first tested on a simulated dataset before being applied to the MODIS SITS. The RGB change map enabled visualization of different “signatures” of change, which, combined with ground information, rainfall data, NDVI time series analysis, and Google Earth imagery, helped link these signatures to various drivers of change. Climatic and anthropogenic changes, such as those induced by Large Scale Agricultural Investments (LSAI) or mining, were visually inferred from the RGB map.This approach demonstrates the usefulness of integrating the type of change, especially seasonal change, into the characterization of land change. This method has the advantage of being fast, interpretable, robust to noise and easily transferable to different regions."

 A timing and precise diagnosis of crop nutrient status is essential for optimizing management practices that promote environmentally friendly and enhanced crop yields. Although plant tissue analysis has conventionally been employed to evaluate the nutritional status of crops, this method cannot capture the spatial variability of crop nutrients. In contrast, satellite-based remote sensing can monitor the nutrient status of crops across expansive areas. This study explored the capability of multi-source satellite images (PlanetScope-4: 3 m, 4 bands; PlanetScope-8: 3 m, 8 bands; Sentinel-2: 10–60 m, 13 bands; PRISMA: 30 m, 239 bands) in mapping 12 foliar nutrients in cranberries. Three machine learning approaches, including partial least squared regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), were used to relate foliar nutrients to different types of satellite-derived features (SR: surface reflectance; VI: vegetation indices; TF: texture features) or their combinations (SR+VI, VI+TF and SR+VI+TF). Model performance was compared across different foliar nutrients, modelling approaches and combinations of model input features using R2 (the coefficient of determination) and RRMSE (relative root mean square error, = root mean square error/nutrient range × 100 %). Input features that were important to foliar nutrient modelling were identified. The model performance difference among nutrients was consistent between Planet-4 and Sentinel-2, as well as between Planet-8 and PRISMA. In the Planet-4 and Sentinel-2 derived models, N was best predicted (average R2 = 0.77, average RRMSE=15 %), followed by macronutrients S (0.60–0.63, 11 %), Mg (0.58–0.65, 10–11 %), Ca (0.49–0.51, 9 %), Na (0.69, 22 %), P (0.49, 9 %) and K (0.20, 8 %), and then by all micronutrients(i.e., Fe, Mn, B, Cu and Zn: R2 = 0.04–0.61; RRMSE=16–28 %). In the Planet-8 and PRISMA derived models, macronutrients (i.e., N, P, K, Mg, Ca, S and Na) had lower R2 and RRMSE (R2 = 0.06–0.59; RRMSE=7–57 %) than micronutrients (i.e., Fe, Mn, B, Cu and Zn: R2 = 0.18–0.60; RRMSE=19–66 %). The successful retrieval of foliar nutrients from satellite imagery was influenced by many factors, including the intercorrelation between nutrients and model input features, the data availability at critical growth stages, and satellite images characteristics (e.g., spatial and spectral resolutions). Except for foliar nitrogen, foliar nutrients typically do not exhibit distinct absorption features associated with C, H, N, or O molecular bonds in the 400–2500 nm range. Our results indicate that their successful retrieval can be primarily attributed to the association between foliar nutrients and other leaf components (e.g., pigments, water, and dry matter) that do display spectral features within this range. Our study demonstrated the potential of integrating multi-source satellite data for precise nutrient monitoring over large scales."

 High-throughput phenotypic analysis plays an increasingly important role in crop breeding. In such research, the breeder usually establishes hundreds to thousands of plots, with each plot having its independent genetic breeding sources. The breeding plot extraction of genetic sources is usually outlined manually on RGB UAV imagery, which is time-consuming and subject to human bias. Therefore, a rapid method to extract the breeding plot for each genetic source in high-throughput phenotypic analysis would be very significant. In this paper, we propose a transferable method for extracting breeding plots from UAV RGB imagery. We utilized the fully convolutional neural network model A-UNet with an attention gate. After obtaining binary raster data from deep learning, we introduced post-processing. Subsequently, the raster data after post-processing were converted to vector data to obtain geographical coordinates. Finally, the UAV imagery was masked by the vector data to obtain the extraction results for each plot. The results showed that A-UNet achieved accuracies of over 90 % in precision, recall, and F1 score. Post-processing resulted in a 93 % average IoU in breeding plot extraction in the main study area. The average IOU achieved over 86 % in different spatial resolutions (1.6 cm and 0.4 cm), plot sizes (1 m × 1.5 and 2 m × 5 m), and crop types (rice). In summary, this study developed a method for extracting breeding plots in high-throughput phenotype analysis, which would help to be used as a high-throughput screening technique for accelerating crop breeding."

 The point-based 3D object detection method is highly advantageous due to its lightweight nature and fast inference speed, making it a valuable asset in engineering fields such as intelligent transportation and autonomous driving. However, current advanced methods solely focus on learning features from the provided point cloud, neglecting the active role of unoccupied space. This results in the problem of discontinuous receptive field (DRF), leading to the loss of semantic and geometric information of the objects. To address this issue, we propose a new end-to-end single-stage point-based model, DRF-SSD, in this paper. DRF-SSD utilizes a PointNet++-style 3D backbone to maintain fast inference capability. Then, point-wise features are projected onto a plane in the Neck structure, and local and global information are aggregated through the designed Hierarchical Encoding–Decoding (HED) and Hybrid Transformer (HT) modules. The former fills in features for unoccupied space through convolutional layers, enhancing local features by interacting with features in occupied space during the learning process. The latter further expands the receptive field using the global learning ability of transformers. The spatial transformation and learning processes in HED and HT only involve key points, and HED is designed to have a special structure that maintains the sparsity of feature maps, preserving the efficiency of the model’s inference. Finally, query features are back-projected onto points for feature enhancement and input into the detection head for prediction. Extensive experiments on the KITTI datasets demonstrate that DRF-SSD achieves superior detection accuracy compared to previous methods, with significant improvements. Specifically, the approach obtains 2.25%, 0.66%, and 0.42% improvement for the metric of 3D Average Precision (AP3D) under the easy, moderate, and hard settings, respectively. Additionally, the method enables other point-based detectors to achieve substantial gains, demonstrating its effectiveness.

 Accurate and non-destructive estimation of leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) is crucial for optimizing cotton production. This study enhances the SCOPE model by integrating unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-derived multispectral data with leaf area index (LAI) from LiDAR data, significantly improving precision of LCC estimation, particularly during crucial growth stages of cotton. We construct and analyze three cost functions: COST1, which relies solely on spectral data; COST2, which incorporates direct LAI inputs; and COST3, which adjusts for LAI measurement uncertainties by combining spectral term with an error term representing the squared relative error between measured and model-estimated LAI. Our findings indicate that while COST1 establishes a baseline, COST2 and COST3 provide more accurate LCC estimations. COST3, validated against theoretical data, field-measured cotton datasets, and an additional maize dataset, proves most robust, maintaining consistent accuracy across all growth stages especially when considering input data uncertainties. This highlights the importance of integrating appropriate forms of LAI in cost functions to refine LCC estimation. Future research should focus on improving data acquisition quality and developing more advanced cost functions to advance LCC estimation further."

 Treatment of land-to-ocean leakage is crucial in modeling the mass-term sea level (MSL) using the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) satellite gravity measurements. In this study, we utilized the Spherical Slepian functions (SSFs) to determine MSL variations in the South China Sea. A sensitivity simulation in terms of trend, annual amplitude, and phase revealed that the SSF solution with a 1° coastal buffer zone provides a better land-to-ocean leakage correction than traditionally used Spherical Harmonics (SH). It was also found that an additional smoothing procedure for SSF with low concentrating energy could significantly reduce the high-frequency noise in GRACE (e.g., the north–south strips). The spatiotemporal characteristics of the true MSL were further compared among GRACE SH and Mascon solutions, model-predicted ocean bottom pressure, and steric-corrected altimetric data (i.e., satellite-altimetric sea level minus steric effect). Results revealed that despite the SSF-inverted regional MSL solution being generally similar to other results, this technique notably recovered the realistic magnitude of detailed features. The apparent MSL signal was, for instance, precisely recovered in the central part of the Gulf of Thailand and the Sunda Shelf by the SSF, while the SH significantly underestimated it due to smoothing. In addition to the seasonality, the interannual signal decomposed from the SSF-inverted residual MSL (by removing the trend and periodic signals) was the strongest and well cross-correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index. With more detailed spatial patterns revealed by MSL from GRACE SSF, our findings demonstrate that SSF is more suitable for regional-scale studies."

 Campi Flegrei caldera is an Italian high-risk volcano experiencing a progressively more intense long-term uplift, accompanied by increasing seismicity and geochemical emissions over the last two decades. Ground deformation shows an axisymmetric bell-shaped pattern, with a maximum uplift of about 120 cm, from 2005, in the caldera central area. We analyzed Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed Multi-Temporal DInSAR measurements and GNSS data to reveal and investigate a geodetic anomaly that has clearly manifested since 2021, locally deviating from the typical bell-shaped deformation pattern. This anomaly is located east of Pozzuoli town, in the Mt. Olibano–Accademia area, covers an area of about 1.3 km2 and shows, in comparison to surrounding areas, a maximum uplift deficit of about 9 cm between 2021 and 2023. To investigate the anomaly causes, we analyzed the caldera seismicity and inverted the DInSAR data to determine the primary source of the ground deformation pattern, which is consistent with a penny-shaped source located approximately 3800 m beneath the Pozzuoli town, with a radius of about 1200 m. We also found that the time evolution of the uplift deficit in the geodetic anomaly area correlates well with the earthquake occurrence, with the greater magnitude events clustering in this area. These considerations suggest the geodetic anomaly is a local response to the tensile stress regime produced by the inflating primary deformation source. This phenomenon can be influenced by the Mt. Olibano–Accademia lava domes lithological heterogeneities that may induce a localized reaction to ground deformation during the inflationary phase. Our interpretation aligns with the concentration of earthquakes and hydrothermal fluid emissions in this area, indicating the presence of faults, fractures, and fluid circulation. Accordingly, the geodetic anomaly area represents a zone of crustal weakness that requires careful monitoring and study."

 Human health is directly impacted by trace components found in soil, for which hyperspectral remote sensing technology offers a novel way to rapidly assess dynamic soil environmental quality. In most studies, the premise of quantitative inversion on soil elements is that the known target elements will cause growth stress. However, such stress is unusual in non-polluted areas. Consequently, broad-area soil trace element monitoring in non-contaminated areas remains challenging. Spectral inversion of plant material has a longer time window and is more sensitive to elemental changes than soil spectral inversion (bare soil period). In this work, we conducted a wheat pot experiment with concentration gradients of four trace elements (Fe, B, Mo, and Zn), analyzed leaf (jointing stage) and spike (maturity period) samples using spectral measurements and chemical tests, and filtered the characteristic positions and inverse modeling using the spectra of the element-accumulating preference organs in plant canopies. The canopy aggregation sites differed for each element, and both simple linear regression (SLR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models based on the spectra of canopy aggregation sites achieved high accuracy. The results of this study enable the construction of an inverse model of plant spectra-plant element content-elements in soil, which can serve as a reference for soil monitoring and assessment in typical crop cover areas."

 Under the dual pressures of rapid urbanization and global warming, the management of solar radiation has become an urgent issue to address. In this context, the potential regulatory role of urban street networks on solar radiation has garnered widespread attention. However, existing research lacks an understanding of the impact of street direction. By utilising street view data and solar trajectory simulation technology, it becomes possible to facilitate the revelation of spatiotemporal differences in solar radiation across streets with different direction. The results show that solar radiation is generally lower on north–south streets than on east–west streets. In terms of spatial differences, the average solar radiation in the fifth ring of Beijing is 25.38% higher than that in the second ring. Temporally, the average solar radiation in August, the highest month, is 15.98% greater than in October, the lowest month. Additionally, solar radiation on east–west street direction shows more intense variations in summer. A periodic variation in solar radiation was also discovered in relation to street angles, with different frequencies and amplitudes at 30° and 180°.

 Wetland system is one of the most important ecosystems on the earth’s surface. It is significant important to monitor wetland ecosystem using remote sensing technology. However, the complexity, fuzziness, and spatial heterogeneity of wetlands increase the difficulty of wetland classification, leading to the problem that the classification accuracy is not high enough to satisfy the needs of in-depth research. At present, the classification of wetlands is mainly based on pixel based- and image object based- methods. Addressing the problems of traditional pixel based- and image object based- methods, this study proposes to utilize fuzzy geospatial objects to express wetland objects. By synthesizing the spectral features, shape features, texture features, fuzziness and other features of wetland objects, a hierarchical classification method based on fuzzy geospatial objects is proposed. Taking Tianjin Binhai New Area as the study area, Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing images are utilized for verification. The main contents of this study and its results are as follows: (1) Extract the fuzzy geospatial objects of wetlands and construct the classification feature sets. (2) To simplify the classification problem, a hierarchical classification framework based on optimizing multiple attributes using Random Forest is proposed. By this method, the problems of difficulty in distinguishing wetlands and low classification accuracy caused by similarity of spectral features of wetland objects in the traditional single layer classification method are solved. Three experiments are designed in the study to verify the effects of the fuzzy geospatial objects of wetlands and the hierarchical classification method on the classification accuracy of wetlands, respectively. The results show that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the proposed hierarchical wetland classification method based on fuzzy geospatial objects are 94.35% and 0.899, respectively, which are 12.35% and 0.183 higher than those of the traditional image object based- methods."

 Lunar lava tube caves, due to their unique geographical structure and potential as shelters, have repeatedly emerged as prime candidates or priority areas during discussions on lunar base site selection. However, owing to current technological limitations and the complexities of lunar exploration, obtaining detailed data directly from the interiors of lunar lava tubes poses a significant challenge. Hence, the study of terrestrial lava tubes assumes critical importance. By delving into Earth’s lava tubes, we can gain insights into crucial aspects such as their formation mechanisms, geological characteristics, and stability, which can then inform and guide research on lava tubes found on extraterrestrial bodies like the Moon and Mars. During the data acquisition process for lava tubes, given their intricate spatial configurations and dim lighting conditions, we have opted to employ LiDAR technology to collect point cloud data, revealing the internal structural information of the lava tubes. Consequently, this paper thoroughly explores a method for extracting lava tube parameters and constructing models using this point cloud data. This approach encompasses four key steps: data preprocessing, axis construction of the lava tube, cross-sectional feature extraction, and 3D model reconstruction. Initially, raw data is refined through the creation of point cloud voxels to mitigate noise interference. Subsequently, an iterative algorithm is utilized to obtain the L1-medial skeleton, enabling precise capture of the lava tube’s axis information. Using this extracted axis, we proceed with sampling at fixed intervals to derive cross-sectional points of the lava tube. These points are then utilized to extract fundamental geometric parameters such as cross-sectional area, length, and width. Ultimately, by integrating all these cross-sectional point cloud data, a comprehensive 3D model of the lava tube is constructed. Remarkably, this method achieves a high degree of accuracy, with 99 % of the extracted cross-sectional points exhibiting an error of less than 0.12 m, and 99 % of the model’s positional errors falling within 0.15 m. This not only enhances the precision of parameter extraction but also provides significant technical support for in-depth studies of extraterrestrial volcanic activities and lava tube formation mechanisms. Furthermore, it offers a valuable tool for parameter extraction and research on other irregular natural tunnels."

 Due to its advantages of high spatiotemporal resolution, long-term stable observation, and historical retrospective data, satellite remote sensing has extensive application in the dynamic monitoring of water quality in coastal and inland waters. However, constructing generic satellite inversion models for water quality indicators, especially non-optically active parameters such as nutrients, remains challenging due to the varying pollution sources in different inland waters. This study aims to address this challenge from a data-driven perspective. Based on Sentinel-2 satellite images and in situ data from 311 automatic monitoring stations in Zhejiang Province, China, a large volume of matchups between satellite-derived water spectra and in situ water quality parameter concentrations were constructed, including the permanganate index (CODMn, N=8760, from 0.08 to 9.88 mg/L), total nitrogen (TN, N=7434, from 0.01 to 9.30 mg/L), total phosphorus (TP, N=8845, from 0.001 to 0.991 mg/L), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N, N=8642, from 0.001 to 1.980 mg/L) and water turbidity (TUB, N=7913, from 0.1 to 1994 NTU). Satellite retrieval models for the five water quality parameters were constructed utilizing the extreme gradient boosting tree algorithm (XGBoost), which can be applied to diverse inland waters. The models showed robust performance on the additional independent dataset, with correlation coefficients (r) of 0.74, 0.79, 0.84, 0.72, and 0.87, and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.73 mg/L, 0.56 mg/L, 0.18 mg/L, 0.24 mg/L, and 0.29 NTU for CODMn, TN, TP, NH3-N, and TUB, respectively. Comparisons between satellite-retrieved and in situ values showed good consistency in both spatial and temporal distributions. By applying these models to inland waters in Zhejiang Province, the monthly distributions of major rivers and reservoirs with a 10 m resolution for the five water quality parameters were obtained. The patterns of the five water quality parameters across the rivers typically indicated elevated values in the downstream regions and diminished values in the upstream areas, except for those of the Yongjiang River and Cao’e River. Compared to rivers, reservoirs had good water quality. However, for some water quality parameters, the temporal variations in the average values over the whole reservoir and the values at specific sites had opposite trends. Our research provides a practical reference for the construction of satellite retrieval models for determining the water quality parameters of inland waters, as well as robust technical support for dynamic remote sensing surveillance of inland water quality."

 Protected areas play a crucial role in safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, they face mounting challenges from environmental pressures. This study examines the Oshtorankooh Protected Area (OPA) in Iran, evaluating its vulnerability to various environmental hazards from 2010 to 2020.A comprehensive set of variables, including physiographic, climatic, geological, edaphic, vegetative, hydrological, and socio-economic factors, were utilized to compute 45 vulnerability indicators across three dimensions: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity for 2010 and 2020. Maps of these indicators were created and standardized, with weights assigned using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). Composite indices for exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity were then developed by integrating these weighted and standardized maps.The vulnerability indices for grid cells within the OPA enabled the identification of spatial vulnerability patterns, highlighting heightened vulnerability in the northern and western sectors influenced by factors such as drought variability, social vulnerability, evapotranspiration rates, spring discharge, and runoff dynamics. Results indicate a notable increase in vulnerability over the study period, with index values rising from 0.76 in 2010 to 2.04 in 2020. This spatially explicit vulnerability assessment underscores the dynamic nature of vulnerabilities within protected areas, emphasizing the necessity for adaptive management strategies. The findings stress the importance of tailored, evidence-based management approaches to mitigate risks and preserve ecological and socio-economic values.

 Semantic segmentation is key in analyzing urban mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds. In recent years, the Transformer mechanism, known for capturing long-range contextual relationships, has attracted significant research attention in the field of 3D vision. However, computing global self-attention for 3D scenes incurs high computational costs and the loss of local details. Our work introduces a Dual Domain Transformer network (D2T-Net), adept at processing complex urban MLS point clouds. It operates efficiently in spatial and channel dimensions, enabling efficient semantic segmentation while maintaining detailed scene elements like small urban objects. We introduce a Local Spatial-wise Transformer (LST) block to enrich local semantics through an improved self-attention mechanism that incorporates relative embeddings and transfers spatial information across various representation subspaces in parallel. Based on a feature pyramid framework that fuses and refines features from LST, we introduce a Global Channel-wise Transformer (GCT) block, which efficiently captures global context by focusing on feature channel inter-relationships with a controlled flow gate employed for selective information transfer. D2T-Net utilizes Transformers in both spatial and channel domains to review and fuse features from multiple layers, effectively summarizing semantic contexts and enriching spatial details with multi-scale information. Experiments conducted on three challenging benchmark MLS datasets, the Oakland 3-D, Toronto-3D, and Paris-Lille-3D have confirmed D2T-Net’s accuracy, achieving 98.2%, 83.9%, and 83.8% mIoU respectively."

 Rapeseed cultivation on winter-fallow fields enables a seasonal switch between agricultural and bioenergy output. In view of the spectral features during the rapeseed flowering period (RFP), numerous remote sensing studies identified and produced the maps of rapeseed fields. The RFP is frequently identified by field surveys, visual imagery interpretation, or empirical crop knowledge in a specific region, none of which is appropriate for large-scale rapeseed identification and mapping.

 Deep learning is widely applied in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target recognition. However, the high cost of collecting real SAR target data leads to insufficient data volume and diversity of SAR target datasets, making it challenging to support deep learning models. Therefore, it is necessary to expand SAR target datasets through data generation. However, existing SAR target data generation methods do not fully utilize the SAR imaging geometric information of targets. This results in generating image data that does not conform to SAR physical imaging laws. To address this problem, this paper proposes a SAR vehicle data generation method that integrates deep imaging geometric information. Compared to SAR, optical data, which contains rich geometric structural information of targets, is relatively easy to collect. Therefore, the proposed method computes the dominant scattering edge (DSE) of targets under different radar incident angles with optical data. Then, based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), a SAR vehicle target data generation model is constructed. To guide the model in learning SAR imaging geometric laws of targets, the computed DSE is integrated into the generation network with multi-scale attention mechanism modules. Compared to existing SAR target data generation methods, our proposed method can generate SAR vehicle target data with distinct dominant scattering edges, and effectively addresses the issue of generated target data not conforming to SAR imaging physical laws. Metrics such as Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), scattering intensity difference, and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) are adopted for evaluation. The SSIM between the generated and the real SAR target data reaches 0.834, the FID minimum of 96.98, and the scattering intensity difference minimum of 0.37 dB, all indicating that the SAR target data generated by the proposed method is similar to real ones in terms of deep feature, scattering intensity, and image structure. Finally, the SAR target data generated by the proposed method is verified through target recognition experiments with VGG16 and ResNet50 as backbone network. The average recognition accuracy increases by 2.80% and 2.14%, respectively. The target recognition results demonstrate that the generated SAR data can help improve target recognition accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of data generated by the proposed method."

 Human visual attention is the basis of target recognition, change detection and classification in remote sensing images. However, the human visual attention of remote sensing images during target detection remains uninvestigated. In this study, we simultaneously collected eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) data of 40 experts during target detection in 1000 remote sensing images. We quantified their attention in different phases of target detection (i.e., target search, selection, and identification) from their eye movements and brain activities. The eye-tracking results indicated that hue and lightness were crucial visual features that guided visual search for remote sensing images. The size of the target also affected the allocation of human attention resources. Particularly, participants tended to miss the targets that were smaller than 3.9 % of the whole image area. The fixation event-related potentials (FRPs) in temporal and parietal brain regions further distinguished the attention of targets and distractors, which could be attributed to the process of memory and processing.

 Ocean loading deformation is one of the key processes in geodesy, geophysics, and Isostasy, and is also important for assessment of future coastal environmental changes. Traditionally, the ocean tide loading has been considered the only contributor to the ocean loading deformation by most previous InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) studies. In this study, we quantify the non-tidal ocean loading deformation using the multi-temporal InSAR-derived deformation data from the Chaoshan coast in southern China and explore its driving mechanisms. Our results show that InSAR deformation anomalies in the Chaoshan coastal area exhibit a distinct deformation gradient from the coast to inland. A strong scale- and direction-dependent pattern in InSAR data, with significant seasonality, is unveiled by the second-order spatial structure function. To explore the driving mechanism behind this deformation, we conduct a correlation analysis between spatial pattern of land deformation and sea level changes. The results indicate that ocean loading is the predominant driving factor behind the Chaoshan coastal deformation. Analysis using the MERRA2 model demonstrates that terrestrial water storage loading deformation is negligible in comparison. Furthermore, by applying the FES2014b tide model, we find that the contributions of the non-tidal and tide-induced ocean loading deformation to the total deformation anomaly are 50–70% and 30–50%, respectively. Lastly, we have uncovered that the non-tidal ocean loading is primarily attributed to the monsoon-induced seasonal sea level changes, with a time lag ranging from one to two months.

 Northern peatland vegetation exhibits fine-scale spatial and spectral heterogeneity that can potentially be captured with uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) data due to their ultra-high spatial resolution (<10 cm). From this perspective, the contribution of different spectral sensors in mapping various vegetation characteristics has not been thoroughly investigated. We delineated spatial patterns of plant community clusters, plant functional types (PFTs), and selected plant species with UAV hyperspectral (HS), UAV multispectral (MS), and airborne LiDAR (light detection and ranging) topography (TP) data in two northern peatlands. We conducted random forest (RF) regressions in a geographic object-based image analysis (GEOBIA) framework and compared the relative contributions of the different datasets. In the best regression models, the percentage of explained variance was 24–74 % (RMSE:0.24–0.31), 40–90 % (RMSE:0.12–0.41), and 18–90 % (RMSE:0.03–0.40) for plant community clusters, PFTs, and plant species, respectively.

 The tremendous improvement for satellite remote sensing has provided mankind with the feasibility of observing large-scale ocean phenomena from space. Passive remote sensing of ocean color has delivered continuous records of ocean surface information, although there are inherent limitations to this natural light-dependent measurement. The development of spaceborne lidars breaks through the restrictions of passive techniques that are unavailable for obtaining the vertical characteristics of water column, and provides a new approach to the detection of ocean subsurface. In this study, the active spaceborne lidar ICESat-2 and passive optical satellite are fused, to establish an inversion method of lidar equation and semi-analytical model. The diffuse attenuation coefficient (kd) was estimated in various areas of the global oceans, and vertical profiles of chlorophyll-a concentration (Chla) were further obtained. The results showed that Mean Absolute Errors (MAE) of Chla derived by the proposed method with BGC-Argo data were in the range of 0.003–0.14 mg/m3, and the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) was between 12.5 % and 26.9 %; Comparison with ocean color products indicated that R2 of Chla was in the range of 0.84–0.98, and MAE of kd was in the range of 0.004–0.021 m−1. The multiple validation approaches have demonstrated the effectiveness of water column profile detection with ICESat-2 lidar and passive satellite, which contributes to the enhanced understanding of ocean subsurface phytoplankton and their spatial or temporal variations."

 With the escalating global climate changes and rapid urbanization, urban flood disasters have become more frequent and severe, hindering progress toward global sustainability goals. The rapid growth of information technology provides abundant data for disaster monitoring, but transitioning from static to dynamic and structured to heterogeneous data poses challenges for organized flood disaster information analysis. This study conducts an in-depth analysis of flood disaster components and spatiotemporal characteristics, exploring qualitative information expression in diverse contexts and quantitative dynamic analysis. Using dimensions like spatiotemporal, semantic, and hierarchical correlations, we introduce a multi-level, multi-dimensional “circumstance-event” model for flood disaster events. Leveraging proximity and semantic relationships, we establish a dynamic semantic association network among geographical units, supporting disaster circumstance division using semantic correlation graphs. Introducing bidirectional relationship discrimination, we enhance the traditional group evolution discovery method to determine the evolution of circumstances in consecutive time windows. Taking the “7·20” heavy rain in Zhengzhou, China as a case study, we observe significant improvement in circumstance division based on semantic correlation graphs, with an average modularity exceeding 0.745. Our bidirectional community evolution method reveals the evolution sequences of circumstances throughout the flood disaster period in Zhengzhou. This approach effectively organizes the entire flood disaster event lifecycle and dynamically analyzes event evolution, offering vital support for comprehensive disaster management."

Analysis of calls from multiple monkeys revealed that family members use similar calls and acoustic features to label others and perform vocal learning. These findings shed light on the complexities of social vocalizations among nonhuman primates and suggest that marmoset vocalizations may provide a model for understanding aspects of human language, thereby offering new insights into the evolution of social communication."

Attempts to understand how localized stress leads to widespread repression have been limited by difficulties in resolving translation rates at the subcellular level. Here, using live-cell imaging of reporter mRNA translation, we unexpectedly found that during ER stress, active translation at mitochondria was significantly protected. The mitochondrial protein ATPase family AAA domain-containing protein 3A (ATAD3A) interacted with protein kinase RNA–like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and mediated this effect on localized translation by competing for binding with PERK’s target, eukaryotic initiation factor 2 (eIF2). PERK-ATAD3A interactions increased during ER stress, forming mitochondria-ER contact sites. Furthermore, ATAD3A binding attenuated local PERK signaling and rescued the expression of some mitochondrial proteins. Thus, PERK-ATAD3A interactions can control translational repression at a subcellular level, mitigating the impact of ER stress on the cell."

Mechanistically, proximity of micronuclei to mitochondria led to oxidation-driven homo-oligomerization of p62, limiting endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT)–dependent micronuclear envelope repair by triggering autophagic degradation.

Although the amplification of excitatory signals by local voltage-dependent cation channels has been extensively studied, their spatiotemporal dynamics in elaborate dendritic branches remain obscure owing to technical limitations. Using fluorescent voltage imaging throughout dendritic arborizations in hippocampal pyramidal neurons, we demonstrate a unique chloride ion (Cl−)–dependent remote computation mechanism in the distal branches. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials triggered by local laser photolysis of caged glutamate spread along dendrites, with gradual amplification toward the distal end while attenuation toward the soma. Tour de force subcellular patch-clamp recordings from thin branches complemented by biophysical model simulations revealed that the asymmetric augmentation of excitation relies on tetrodotoxin-resistant sodium ion (Na+) channels and Cl−conductance accompanied by a more hyperpolarized dendritic resting potential. Together, this study reveals the cooperative voltage-dependent actions of cation and anion conductance for dendritic supralinear computation, which can locally decode the spatiotemporal context of synaptic inputs."

How such inputs affect retinal processing has remained unknown. We confirmed brain-to-retina projections of histaminergic neurons from the mouse hypothalamus. Histamine application ex vivo altered the activity of various retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), including direction-selective RGCs that gained responses to high motion velocities. These results were reproduced in vivo with optic tract recordings where histaminergic retinopetal axons were activated chemogenetically. Such changes could improve vision of fast-moving objects (e.g., while running), which fits with the known increased activity of histaminergic neurons during arousal. An antihistamine drug reduced optomotor responses to high-speed moving stimuli in freely moving mice. In humans, the same antihistamine nonuniformly modulated visual sensitivity across the visual field, indicating an evolutionary conserved function of the histaminergic system. Our findings expose a previously unappreciated role for brain-to-retina projections in modulating retinal function."

Unraveling the complex mechanisms governing chilling tolerance in rice is crucial for molecular breeding of cold-tolerant varieties. Here, we identify an APETALA2/Ethylene Responsive Factor (AP2/ERF) transcription factor, OsERF52, as a positive modulator in response to low temperatures. OsERF52 directly regulates the expression ofC-Repeat Binding Factor(CBF) genes in rice. In addition, Osmotic Stress/ABA-Activated Protein Kinase 9–mediated phosphorylation of OsERF52 at S261 enhances its stability and interaction with Ideal Plant Architecture 1 and OsbHLH002/OsICE1. This collaborative activation leads to the expression ofOsCBFs, thereby initiating the chilling response in rice. Notably, plants with base-editedOsERF52S261D-3HAexhibit enhanced chilling resistance without yield penalty.

Despite over 30 years of numerous computational studies on magnetorotational turbulence, the properties of fluctuations in the inertial range—where cross-scale energy transfer dominates over energy injection—have remained elusive, primarily due to insufficient numerical resolution. Here, we report the highest-resolution simulation of magnetorotational turbulence ever conducted. Our simulations reveal a constant cross-scale energy flux, a hallmark of the inertial range. We found that as the cascade proceeds to smaller scales in the inertial range, the kinetic and magnetic energies tend toward equipartitioning with the same spectral slope, and slow magnetosonic fluctuations dominate over Alfvénic fluctuations, having twice the energy. These findings align remarkably with the theoretical expectations from the reduced magnetohydrodynamic model, which assumes a near-azimuthal mean magnetic field. Our results provide important implications for interpreting the radio observations by the Event Horizon Telescope."

The molecular mechanism by which de novo DNA methyltransferase(s) [DNMT(s)] catalyze CpG methylation at PRC-regulated regions remains unclear. Here, we report a cryo–electron microscopy structure of the DNMT3A long isoform (DNMT3A1) amino-terminal region in complex with a nucleosome carrying PRC1-mediated histone H2A lysine-119 monoubiquitination (H2AK119Ub). We identify regions within the DNMT3A1 amino terminus that bind H2AK119Ub and the nucleosome acidic patch. This bidentate interaction is required for effective DNMT3A1 engagement with H2AK119Ub-modified chromatin in cells. Further, aberrant redistribution of DNMT3A1 to Polycomb target genes recapitulates the cancer-associated DNA hypermethylation signature and inhibits their transcriptional activation during cell differentiation. This effect is rescued by disruption of the DNMT3A1–acidic patch interaction. Together, our analyses reveal a binding interface critical for mediating promoter CpG island DNA hypermethylation, a major molecular hallmark of cancer."

Our research focused on unraveling the mechanisms governing the specification of these two distinct cell fates following the stem cell division. For this purpose, we used the model organismPhyscomitrium patens, which features a singular pluripotent stem cell known as the gametophore apical cell. We show that the activity of cytokinins, critical stem cell regulators, is restricted to the gametophore apical cell due to the specific localization of PpLOG, the enzyme responsible for cytokinin activation. In turn, PpTAW, which promotes differentiating cell identity of the merophyte, is excluded from the gametophore apical cell by the action of cytokinins. We propose a cytokinin-based model for the establishment of asymmetry in the pluripotent stem cell division."

To explore this phenomenon, we set up mouse lymphoma models activating or not activating NK cells. Both tumor types elicited type I interferon production, leading to the expression of a T cell exhaustion-like signature in NK cells, which included immune checkpoint proteins (ICPs). However, NK cell dysfunction occurred exclusively in the tumor model that triggered NK cell activation. Moreover, ICP-positive NK cells demonstrated heightened reactivity compared to negative ones. Furthermore, the onset of NK cell dysfunction was swift and temporally dissociated from ICPs induction, which occurred as a later event during tumor growth. Last, NK cell responsiveness was restored when stimulation was discontinued, and interleukin-15 had a positive impact on this reversion. Therefore, our data demonstrate that the reactivity of NK cells is dynamically controlled and that NK cell dysfunction is a reversible process uncoupled from the expression of ICPs."

However, a recent study reported the existence ofmrc1+microglia in zebrafish embryos, which are seemingly independent of Pu.1 and reliant on lymphatic vessels, sparking great interest in the possibility of lymphatic-originated microglia. To address this, we took advantage of apu.1knock-in zebrafish allele for a detailed investigation. Our results conclusively showed that almost all zebrafish embryonic microglia (~95% on average) expresspu.1.

Further investigation suggests that TaWAK2 directly interacts with and phosphorylates TaNAL1, a trypsin-like serine/cysteine protease. The phosphorylated TaNAL1 is then involved in the degradation of the zinc finger transcription factor TaDST, which acts as a repressor of leaf expansion by activating the expression of the cytokinin oxidase geneTaCKX9and triggering in vivo cytokinin degradation. Therefore, our findings elucidate a signaling cascade involving TaWAK2-TaNAL1-TaDST that sheds light on the regulation of wheat leaf development."

Here, we identify the inaugural noncanonical strigolactone, 4-oxo-methyl carlactonoate (4-oxo-MeCLA), in rice root exudate. Comprehensive, cross-species coexpression analysis allowed us to identify a cytochrome P450, OsCYP706C2, and two methyl transferases as candidate enzymes for this noncanonical rice strigolactone biosynthetic pathway. Heterologous expression in yeast andNicotiana benthamianaindeed demonstrated the role of these enzymes in the biosynthesis of 4-oxo-MeCLA, which, expectedly, is derived from carlactone as substrate.

We find that loss of all three TETs during NSC specification is dispensable for neural induction and neuronal differentiation but critical for astrocyte and oligodendrocyte formation, demonstrating a selective loss of glial competence. Mechanistically, TET-mediated demethylation was essential for commissioning neural-specific enhancers in proximity to master neurodevelopmental and glial transcription factor genes and for induction of these genes. Consistently, loss of all three TETs in embryonic NSCs in mice compromised glial gene expression and corticogenesis. Thus, TET-dependent developmental demethylation is an essential regulatory mechanism for neural enhancer commissioning during NSC specification and is a cell-intrinsic determinant of NSC identity and gliogenic potential."

Grace;Tanja Mittag;Kresten Lindorff-Larsen,Design of intrinsically disordered protein variants with diverse structural properties,"Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) perform a broad range of functions in biology, suggesting that the ability to design IDPs could help expand the repertoire of proteins with novel functions. Computational design of IDPs with specific conformational properties has, however, been difficult because of their substantial dynamics and structural complexity. We describe a general algorithm for designing IDPs with specific structural properties. We demonstrate the power of the algorithm by generating variants of naturally occurring IDPs that differ in compaction, long-range contacts, and propensity to phase separate. We experimentally tested and validated our designs and analyzed the sequence features that determine conformations. We show how our results are captured by a machine learning model, enabling us to speed up the algorithm. Our work expands the toolbox for computational protein design and will facilitate the design of proteins whose functions exploit the many properties afforded by protein disorder."

Similar to the interference of itinerant electrons scattered by defects in normal metals, these resonances reveal a periodic texture around the magnetic impurity. The wavelength of these resonances is, however, often too short to be resolved even by methods capable of atomic resolution, i.e., scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). We combine a CO molecule with a superconducting cluster pre-attached to an STM tip to maximize both spatial and energy resolution, thus demonstrating the superior properties of such double-functionalized probes by imaging the spatial distribution of YSR states. Our approach reveals rich interference patterns of the hybridized YSR states of two Fe atoms on Nb(110), previously inaccessible with conventional STM probes. This advancement extends the capabilities of STM techniques, providing insights into superconducting phenomena at the atomic scale."

The emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) ESKAPE pathogens (particularly Gram-negative bacteria) accounts for high risk of mortality and increased resource utilization in health care. Worse still, there has been no new class of antibiotics approved for exterminating the Gram-negative bacteria for more than 50 years. Therefore, it is urgent to develop novel antibacterial agents with low resistance and potent killing efficacy against Gram-negative ESKAPE pathogens. Herein, we present a class of fluoropolymers by mimicking the amphiphilicity of cationic antimicrobial peptides. Our optimal fluoroamphiphilic polymer (PD45HF5) displayed selective antimicrobial ability for all MDR Gram-negative ESAKPE pathogens, low resistance, high in vitro cell selectivity, and in vivo curative efficacy. These findings implied great potential of fluoroamphiphilic cationic polymers as promising antibacterial agents against MDR Gram-negative ESKAPE bacteria and alleviating antibiotic resistance."

Our understanding of this period is hindered by limited written sources and few archaeogenetic studies. We analyzed 33 individuals from Las Gobas, a necropolis in northern Spain, spanning the 7th to 11th centuries. By combining archaeological and osteological data with kinship, metagenomics, and ancestry analyses, we investigate conflicts, health, and demography of these individuals. We reveal intricate family relationships and genetic continuity within a consanguineous population while also identifying several zoonoses indicative of close interactions with animals. Notably, one individual was infected with a variola virus phylogenetically clustering with the northern European variola complex between ~885 and 1000 CE. Last, we did not detect a significant increase of North African or Middle East ancestries over time since the Islamic conquest of Iberia, possibly because this community remained relatively isolated."

However, existing tools are either invasive or too large for sampling liquids in tortuous and narrow spaces. Here we report a fundamental liquid sampling mechanism that enables millimeter-scale soft capsules for sampling liquids in confined spaces. The miniature capsule is enabled by flexible magnetic valves and superabsorbent polymer, fully wirelessly controlled for on-demand fluid sampling. A group of miniature capsules could navigate in fluid-filled and confined spaces safely using a rolling locomotion. The integration of on-demand triggering, sampling, and sealing mechanism and the agile group locomotion allows us to demonstrate precise control of the soft capsules, navigating and sampling body fluids in a phantom and animal organ ex vivo, guided by ultrasound and x-ray medical imaging.

We present pneumaOCT, the first pneumatic OCT endoscope, comprising a steerable catheter with a soft pneumatic actuator and an imaging probe with a miniature pneumatic turbine. With a diameter of 2.8 mm, pneumaOCT allows for a bending angle of up to 237°, facilitating navigation through narrow turns. The pneumatic turbine enables adjustable imaging speeds from 51 to 446 revolutions per second.

This property has well-established implications in statistical physics but remains underexplored in biological networks, especially for bacteria and other prokaryotes whose regulation of gene expression occurs predominantly at the transcriptional level. Focusing on the reconstructed regulatory network ofEscherichia coli, we examine network responses to transient single-gene perturbations. We predict irreversibility in numerous cases and find that the incidence of irreversibility increases with the proximity of the perturbed gene to positive circuits in the network. Comparison with experimental data suggests a connection between the predicted irreversibility to transient perturbations and the evolutionary response to permanent perturbations."

This spatially specific, morphological change over the life span in humans is also found in chimpanzees, and the comparison between these great ape species provides a unique evolutionary perspective on human brain aging. Here, we present a data-driven, comparative framework to explore the relationship between gray matter atrophy with age and recent cerebral expansion in the phylogeny of chimpanzees and humans. In humans, we show a positive relationship between cerebral aging and cortical expansion, whereas no such relationship was found in chimpanzees. This human-specific association between strong aging effects and large relative cortical expansion is particularly present in higher-order cognitive regions of the ventral prefrontal cortex and supports the “last-in-first-out” hypothesis for brain maturation in recent evolutionary development of human faculties."
