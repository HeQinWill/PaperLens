We developed a global 30 m 23-year (2000–2022) daily seamless data cube (SDC) of surface reflectance based on Landsat 5, 7, 8, and 9 and MODIS products. The SDC exhibits enhanced capabilities for monitoring land cover changes and robust consistency in both spatial and temporal dimensions, which are important for global environmental monitoring. 
 The Landsat series constitutes an unparalleled repository of multi-decadal Earth observations, serving as a cornerstone in global environmental monitoring. However, the inconsistent coverage of Landsat data due to its long revisit intervals and frequent cloud cover poses significant challenges to land monitoring over large geographical extents. In this study, we developed a full-chain processing framework for the multi-sensor data fusion of Landsat 5, 7, 8, and 9 and MODIS Terra surface reflectance products. Based on this framework a global 30 m resolution daily seamless data cube (SDC) of land surface reflectance was generated, spanning from 2000 to 2022. A thorough evaluation of the SDC was undertaken using a leave-one-out approach and a cross-comparison with NASA's Harmonized Landsat and Sentinel-2 (HLS) products. The leave-one-out validation at 425 global test sites assessed the agreement between the SDC with actual Landsat surface reflectance values (not used as input), revealing an overall mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.014 (the valid range of surface reflectance values is 0–1). The cross-comparison with HLS products at 22 Military Grid Reference System (MGRS) tiles revealed an overall mean absolute deviation (MAD) of 0.017 with L30 (Landsat 8-based 30 m HLS product) and a MAD of 0.021 with S30 (Sentinel-2-based 30 m HLS product). Moreover, experimental results underscore the advantages of employing the SDC for global land cover classification, achieving a sizable improvement in overall accuracy (2.4 %–11.3 %) over that obtained using Landsat composite and interpolated datasets. A web-based interface has been developed for researchers to freely access the SDC dataset, which is available at https://doi.org/10.12436/SDC30.26.20240506 (Chen et al., 2024)."

Here we construct a global database on actual nitrogen loss rates, covering over 30 years of observations, measured in coastal and marine sediments. This work provides a global overview of the biogeography and potential controlling factors of denitrification and anammox, and highlights the potential applications of this database. 
 Denitrification and anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) convert reactive nitrogen to invert N2, and play vital roles in nitrogen removal in coastal and marine ecosystems, weakening the adverse effects caused by terrestrial excessive nitrogen inputs. Given the importance of denitrification and anammox in nitrogen cycle, lots of studies has measured denitrification and anammox through intact core incubations across different systems, and nitrogen loss processes are affected by a series of environmental factors such as organic carbon, nitrate, dissolved oxygen and temperature. However, a global synthesis of actual nitrogen loss rates is lacking and how environmental factors regulate nitrogen loss remains unclear. Therefore, we have compiled a database of nitrogen loss rates, including denitrification and anammox in coastal and marine systems from published literatures. This database includes 473, 466, and 255 measurements for total nitrogen loss denitrification and anammox, respectively. This work deepens our understanding of the spatial and temporal distribution of denitrification, anammox and the relative contribution of anammox to total nitrogen loss and their corresponding environmental controls. To our knowledge, the constructed database for the first time offers a comprehensive overview of actual nitrogen loss rates in coastal and marine ecosystems on a global scale. This database can be utilized to compare nitrogen loss rates of different regions, identify the key factors regulating these rates, and parameterize biogeochemical models in the future.

The model was developed using multi-directional mean sea surface data, providing detailed coverage of ocean gravity variations at a 1'×1' resolution. Freely available on Zenodo, SDUST2023VGGA serves as a valuable dataset for marine geophysics and oceanography research, offering insights into seafloor structures and ocean mass distribution. 
 Satellite altimetry is a vital tool for global ocean observation, providing critical insights into ocean gravity and its gradient. Over the past six years, satellite data from various space agencies have nearly tripled, facilitating the development of high-precision ocean gravity anomaly and ocean vertical gradient of gravity anomaly (VGGA) models. This study constructs a global ocean VGGA model named SDUST2023VGGA using multi-directional mean sea surface data. To address computational resource limitations, the global ocean is divided into ten sub-regions. In each sub-region, the DTU21 Mean Sea Surface (MSS) model and the CNES-CLS22 Mean Dynamic Topography (MDT) model are used to derive the geoid. To mitigate the influence of long-wavelength signals on the calculations, the study subtracts the long-wavelength geoid derived from the XGM2019e gravity field model from the original geoid, resulting in a residual geoid (short-wavelength). To ensure the accuracy of the VGGA calculations, a weighted least-squares method is employed using residual geoid data from a 17′ × 17′ area surrounding the computation point. This approach effectively accounts for the actual ocean environment, thereby enhancing the precision of the calculation results. After combining the VGGA models for all sub-regions, the model's reliability is validated against the SIO V32.1 VGGA (named curv) model. The comparison between the VGGA and the SIO V32.1 model shows a mean of -0.08 Eötvös (E) and an RMS of 8.50 E, indicating a high degree of consistency across the global scale. Analysis of the differences reveals that the advanced data processing and modeling strategies employed in the DTU21 MSS model enable SDUST2023VGGA to maintain stable performance across varying ocean depths, unaffected by ocean dynamics. The effective use of multi-directional mean sea surface data allows for the detailed capture of ocean gravity field information embedded in the MSS model. Analysis across diverse ocean regions demonstrates that the SDUST2023VGGA model successfully reveals the internal structure and mass distribution of the seafloor.

It can be a benchmark for testing mesoscale ocean large eddy simulation (MOLES) methods in ocean models. We build an idealized Southern Ocean model using MITgcm to generate a type of MODNS. We also illustrate the diversity of multiscale eddy interactions. 
 We describe an idealized Southern Ocean model (ISOM 1.0) that contains simplified iconic topographic features in the Southern Ocean and conduct a fully mesoscale-resolving simulation with the horizontal resolution of 2 km, based on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation model. The model obtains a fully developed and vigorous mesoscale eddying field with a k−3 eddy kinetic energy spectrum and captures the topographic effect on stratification and large-scale flow. To make a natural introduction of large eddy simulation (LES) methods to ocean mesoscale parameterization, we propose the concept of mesoscale ocean direct numerical simulation (MODNS). A qualified MODNS dataset should resolve the first baroclinic deformation radius and ensure that the affected scales by the dissipation schemes are sufficiently smaller than the radius. Such datasets can serve as the benchmark for a priori and a posteriori tests of LES schemes or mesoscale ocean large eddy simulation (MOLES) methods in ocean general circulation models. The 2 km simulation can meet the requirement of MODNS and also capture submesoscale effects. Therefore, its output can be a type of MODNS and provide reliable data support for relevant a priori and a posteriori tests. We demonstrate the diversity of multiscale eddy interactions, validate the crucial role of mesoscale-related strain in submesoscale processes, and uncover the bridge effect of submesoscale processes between mesoscale entities and in the eddy–jet interaction. In addition, we use the model to conduct multipassive tracer experiments and reveal guidelines for the initial settings of passive tracers to delay the homogenization process and ensure the mutual independence of tracers over a long period."

In this study, Fe-doped graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) nanomaterials were used to construct Fe–Nx sites, and the electronic structure was tuned by boron nitride quantum dots (BNQDs), thereby optimizing PAA activation for the degradation of antibiotics. The BNQDs-modified Fe-doped g-C3N4 catalyst (BNQDs-FCN) achieved an excellent reaction rate constant of 0.0843 min–1, marking a 21.6-fold improvement over the carbon nitride (CN)-based PAA system. DFT calculations further corroborate the superior adsorption capacity of the Fe–Nx sites for PAA, facilitating its activation. Charge transfer mechanisms, with PAA serving as an electron acceptor, were identified as the source of high-valent iron-oxo species. Moreover, the BNQDs-FCN system preferentially targets oxygen-containing functional groups in antibiotic structures, elucidating the selective attack patterns of these highly electrophilic species.

The hazard assessment leveraged 113 data sets from peer-reviewed studies, addressing aquatic ecotoxicity across 26 species, by performing probabilistic species sensitivity distributions (SSD).

We investigated the clastogenicity and mutagenicity of benzo[b]fluoranthene (BbF), one of 16 priority PAHs, in MutaMouse males after a 28 day oral exposure. BbF causes robust dose-dependent increases in micronucleus frequency in peripheral blood, indicative of chromosome damage. Duplex sequencing (DS), an error-corrected sequencing technology, reveals that BbF induces dose-dependent increases in mutation frequencies in bone marrow (BM) and liver. Mutagenicity is increased in intergenic relative to genic regions, suggesting a role for transcription-coupled repair of BbF-induced DNA damage. At higher doses, the maximum mutagenic response to BbF is higher in liver, which has a lower mitotic index but higher metabolic capacity than BM; however, mutagenic potency is comparable between the two tissues. BbF induces primarily C:G > A:T mutations, followed by C:G > T:A and C:G > G:C, indicating that BbF metabolites mainly target guanines and cytosines. The mutation spectrum of BbF correlates with cancer mutational signatures associated with tobacco exposure, supporting its contribution to the carcinogenicity of combustion-derived PAHs in humans.

Focusing on a typical mariculture region in the coastal waters of China, we examined the combined effects of topography, hydrodynamics, and biogeochemical processes. A high-resolution three-dimensional physical–biogeochemical coupled model, validated against observational data from three summer cruises in 2020, accurately captured key drivers of hypoxia. Results reveal that hypoxic zones exhibit an uneven distribution, driven by persistent offshore jets at specific locations. Nearshore deployment of oxygenation devices upstream of hypoxic zones significantly improves oxygen delivery and is more cost-efficient due to reduced construction and maintenance requirements. Uncertainty analysis explored the impacts of varying water mass properties, oxygen concentration, injection flow rates, and biogeochemical content. The influence varies depending on the deployment site. Particularly, buoyant plumes can notably reduce the effectiveness of hypoxia mitigation. Artificial oxygenation may lead to unintended ecological impacts, including increased nutrient release and enhanced primary production, which can prolong the duration of hypoxia.

We quantified water scarcity risks and resilience at the city level, since fine-grained studies can better capture the highly varied water resource availability, demand and socio-economic development across China. To do this, we used an income-based multiregional input-output approach between 2007 and 2017, which allows the economic impacts of water scarcity along supply chains to be comprehensively assessed. The results show that supply chains amplify potential local economic risks by three times nationally, with the amplification effect reaching ten times in some cities. The resilience to water scarcity, taking into account multiple dimensions including the impact of physical water transfer, varies across different cities and is negatively correlated to water scarcity risks. This suggests the importance of addressing correlated risk and resilience dimensions to enhance hydro-economic security of cities.

However, at high concentrations, it can be toxic to animals and plants. This study investigated the interactions of Mo(VI) with iron oxyhydroxides during ferrihydrite bioreduction in the presence of Fe(III)-reducing Geobacter sulfurreducens. Here, we showed that Mo concentration controlled ferrihydrite phase transformation, leading to Mo release. With the biotic reduction of ferrihydrite and Fe(II) production, Mo(VI) reduction and Mo(IV)O2 formation were observed for the first time, which further immobilized Mo after surface adsorption of Mo(VI). At low Mo levels (Mo/Fe molar ratios of 1–2%), sufficient Fe(II) adsorption onto ferrihydrite resulted in its transformation into magnetite nanoparticles (>80%, ∼25 nm), which catalyzed the reduction of Mo(VI) to form Mo(IV)O2 and immobilized Mo. Contrastingly, at high Mo concentrations (Mo/Fe molar ratios of 5–10%), Mo(VI)O42– adsorption onto ferrihydrite limited Fe(II) adsorption; subsequently, less magnetite (<8–12%) formed while more goethite (∼30–50%, width and length >15 and 100 nm, respectively) and siderite (∼20–30%, width and length >100 and 200 nm, respectively) with larger particle sizes formed instead, causing Mo(VI) release due to lower Mo adsorption. This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the interaction mechanisms among Geobacter sulfurreducens, Mo(VI), and iron oxyhydroxides, enabling predictions and controls of long-term Mo mobility and Fe mineral transformation under a variety of biogeochemical scenarios."

However, the contribution of trace gas oxidizers to soil carbon fixation and the driving environmental factors remain unclear, especially on large scales. Here, we utilized biogeochemical and genome-resolved metagenomic profiling, assisted by machine learning analysis, to estimate the contributions of trace gas oxidizers to soil carbon fixation and to predict the key environmental factors driving this process in soils from five distinct ecosystems. The results showed that phylogenetically and physiologically diverse H2 and CO oxidizers and chemosynthetic carbon-fixing microbes are present in the soil in different terrestrial ecosystems. The large-scale variations in soil carbon fixation were highly positively correlated with both the abundance and the activity of H2 and CO oxidizers (p < 0.05–0.001). Furthermore, soil pH and moisture-induced shifts in the abundance of H2 and CO oxidizers partially explained the variation in soil carbon fixation (55%). The contributions of trace gas oxidizers to soil carbon fixation in the different terrestrial ecosystems were estimated to range from 1.1% to 35.0%. The estimated rate of trace gas carbon fixation varied from 0.04 to 1.56 mg kg–1 d–1. These findings reveal that atmospheric trace gas oxidizers may contribute to soil carbon fixation driven by key soil environmental factors, highlighting the non-negligible contribution of these microbes to terrestrial carbon cycling."

Technology advancements, e.g., vacuum tubing sap collection systems, reverse osmosis (RO), and electric evaporators have changed the way syrup is produced, resulting in widespread variability in processing equipment and sugar-making operational decisions. This paper evaluates these complex operations through a cradle-to-retail gate carbon footprinting model and by capturing variability in a series of producer archetypes. By isolating energy and emissions impacts, we find that implementing RO has the largest reduction effect on energy (54–77%) and emissions (57–82%), depending on both production size and evaporator fuel (wood, fuel-oil, or electricity). Results also demonstrate the effect of production scale on cumulative energy demand (CED) and emissions per gallon of syrup, with small producers ranging from 333–1,425 MJ/gal and 27–118 kg CO2e/gal (61–90% biogenic on-site) for wood-fired operations and 18–65 kg CO2e/gal for oil-fired operations. Large producers ranged from 90–131 MJ and 3.5–7 kg CO2e/gal (electricity to oil-fired operations).

However, since the 1970s, saltmarsh wetlands in coastal China have been seriously threatened by the invasive Spartina alterniflora. Although the Chinese government has initiated a nationwide S. alterniflora removal project, the potential benefits and risks of this project remain unknown. Here, we focus on the Yangtze River Estuary Saltmarsh Wetland (YRESW) and simulate its future ecosystem structure, function, and quality under three scenarios based on remote sensing and field investigation data. The simulation scenarios include the absence of a removal project, natural regeneration postproject (NRP), and planted restoration postproject. The results show that the removal project will reverse the escalating invasion trend of S. alterniflora in the YRESW. Compared to the baseline year of 2022, there is a remarkable increase in ecosystem structure (composition: +107%, configuration: +27%) and ecosystem quality (+10.5%) under the NRP scenario. Although blue carbon storage sharply decreases under both scenarios involving project implementation, planted restoration can restore YRESW’s carbon sequestration capacity to 0.19 Tg C per year, achieving 87% of the carbon storage present before the project. This study underscores the necessity of comprehensive and detailed risk assessments in ecological projects, particularly when dominant species are involved.

Concentrations of PFPrS and perfluoroethanesulfonic acid (PFEtS) ranged from <0.02 to 8000 ng/L. Ultrashort-chain perfluoroalkane sulfonamides (FASAs) and perfluoroalkane sulfates (PFA-OS) were predominantly found in wastewater.

Here, direct formation of the same DMPO adduct as that formed by genuine radical trapping of •OH is discovered, while quinones (i.e., 1,4-benzoquinone (BQ), methyl-BQ (2-Me-BQ, 2,5-Me-BQ, 2,6-Me-BQ), and chlorinated-BQ (2-Cl-BQ, 2,5-Cl-BQ, 2,6-Cl-BQ)) meet with the spin trap 5,5-dimethyl-1-pyrroline N-oxide (DMPO), independent of peroxides. According to differences in alcohol-derived adducts (e.g., DMPO-CH2OH or DMPO-OCH3) while alcohol is attacked by •OH or DMPO•+, a nonradical mechanism is proposed for the BQ/DMPO system. This is further evidenced by the mass spectrometry data in which DMPO-OCH3 has been identified in BQ (or chlorinated-BQ)/DMPO systems. 17O incorporation experiments verify that hydroxyl oxygen in DMPO-OH originates from water. The DMPO-OH adduct might be formed via direct oxidation and water substitution or one-electron oxidation and nucleophilic addition.

The olfactory pathway provides a promising shortcut to the brain, which bypasses the blood–brain barrier for PM2.5. However, direct evidence is lacking, and the translocation mechanism is still unclear. This study used the primary murine olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) as an in vitro model to explore the translocation mechanism of PM2.5 in the olfactory system. We found that PM2.5 can be internalized into the OSNs via vesicle transportation. This process responds only to the water-insoluble compositions of PM2.5 (WIS-PM2.5) and cannot be affected by the water-soluble compositions of PM2.5 (WS-PM2.5). PM2.5 can further disrupt the integrity of the barrier constituted by the OSNs, and WS-PM2.5 plays a heightened role in inducing the damages.

Magmatic processes at the crust‐mantle boundary (i.e., Moho) are commonly studied post facto at fossil ophiolites, oceanic core complexes, or inferred from the compositions of crystals or melt inclusions. The 2021 eruption at Fagradalsfjall on the Reykjanes Peninsula, Iceland, was supplied from magma bodies near the Moho and offers a unique opportunity to study the timescales, structure, and syn‐eruptive processes of near‐Moho magmatic systems at ∼15 km depth. Here, we present a comprehensive petrological and geochemical investigation of the full 183 day eruption that is based on frequent sampling of the eruption. Lavas erupted in the first 45 days displayed significant and sudden changes in geochemistry, followed by lower amplitude fluctuations until the end of the eruption. This variability can be explained by contribution from multiple magma bodies, as best distinguished using Sr‐Nd‐Hf‐Pb isotope systematics. The lavas display unusual trace element and radiogenic isotope compositions compared to other Icelandic basalts, but are similar to other rare, highly incompatible element enriched lavas on the Reykjanes Peninsula, and thus these lavas may represent a distinct suite of Reykjanes Peninsula basalts. Our geochemical and petrological observations show that numerous, compositionally variable bodies of magma must exist in the lowermost crust or at the crust‐mantle boundary. These near‐Moho magma bodies transfer magma between one another on timescales as short as days‐to‐months, but partially crystallize over longer time periods, and periodically inject into the overlying crust."

Results show that the direct global hydrological sensitivity (for land plus ocean precipitation) to CO2 increase only is −0.09 ± 0.07% (100 ppm) −1 and to CO2‐induced warming alone is 1.54 ± 0.24% K−1.

Herein, a ligand evolution (LE) strategy with p-toluenesulfonyl hydrazide (PTSH) is employed to regulate film formation and eliminate deep traps in inorganic narrow bandgap (NBG) perovskite, enabling the successful development of 2T IPTSCs. Accordingly, the 1.31 eV CsPb0.4Sn0.6I3:LE device delivers a record efficiency of 17.41%.

Additionally, IPTSCs are engineered to deliver remarkable durability under maximum power point (MPP) tracking, maintaining 80% of the initial efficiency at 65 °C for 1510 h and at 85°C for 800 h, respectively. We elucidate that LE deliberately leverages multiple roles for inorganic NBG perovskite growth and anticipate our study provides insightful guideline for developing high-efficiency and stable IPTSCs."

 The ability to flexibly switch our response to external stimuli according to contextual information is critical for successful interactions with a complex world. Context-dependent computations are necessary across many domains1–3, yet their neural implementations remain poorly understood. Here we developed a novel behavioral task in rats to study context-dependent selection and accumulation of evidence for decision-making4−6. Under assumptions supported by both monkey and rat data, we first show mathematically that this computation can be supported by three dynamical solutions, and all networks performing the task implement a combination of these solutions. These solutions can be identified and tested directly with experimental data. We further show that existing electrophysiological and modeling data are compatible with the full variety of possible combinations of these solutions, suggesting that different individuals could use different combinations. To study variability across individual subjects, we developed automated, high-throughput methods to train rats on our task, and we trained many subjects on it. Consistent with theoretical predictions, neural and behavioral analyses revealed substantial heterogeneity across rats, despite uniformly good task performance. Our theory further predicts a specific link between behavioral and neural signatures, which was robustly supported in the data. In summary, our results provide a new experimentally-supported theoretical framework to analyze individual variability in biological and artificial systems performing flexible decision-making tasks, they open the door to cellular-resolution studies of individual variability in higher cognition, and they provide insights into neural mechanisms of context-dependent computation more generally.

 Quantum scars refer to eigenstates with enhanced probability density along unstable classical periodic orbits. First predicted 40 years ago1, scars are special eigenstates that counterintuitively defy ergodicity in quantum systems whose classical counterpart is chaotic2,3. Despite the importance and long history of scars, their direct visualization in quantum systems remains an open field4–10. Here we demonstrate that, by using an in situ graphene quantum dot (GQD) creation and a wavefunction mapping technique11,12, quantum scars are imaged for Dirac electrons with nanometre spatial resolution and millielectronvolt energy resolution with a scanning tunnelling microscope. Specifically, we find enhanced probability densities in the form of lemniscate ∞-shaped and streak-like patterns within our stadium-shaped GQDs. Both features show equal energy interval recurrence, consistent with predictions for relativistic quantum scars13,14. By combining classical and quantum simulations, we demonstrate that the observed patterns correspond to two unstable periodic orbits that exist in our stadium-shaped GQD, thus proving that they are both quantum scars.

 Despite the fundamental role of bacterial strain variation in gut microbiota function1–6, the number of unique strains of a species that can stably colonize the human intestine is still unknown for almost all species. Here we determine the strain richness (SR) of common gut species using thousands of sequenced bacterial isolates with paired metagenomes. We show that SR varies across species, is transferable by faecal microbiota transplantation, and is uniquely low in the gut compared with soil and lake environments. Active therapeutic administration of supraphysiologic numbers of strains per species increases recipient SR, which then converges back to the population average after dosing is ceased. Stratifying engraftment outcomes by high or low SR shows that SR predicts microbial addition or replacement in faecal transplants. Together, these results indicate that properties of the gut ecosystem govern the number of strains of each species colonizing the gut and thereby influence strain addition and replacement in faecal microbiota transplantation and defined live biotherapeutic products. Strain richness of gut microbiota ecosystems is a key characteristic underpinning engraftment in faecal microbiota transplantation, and could improve the design of defined live biotherapeutic products with predictable outcomes."

 The Southern Ocean, a region highly vulnerable to climate change, plays a vital role in regulating global nutrient cycles and atmospheric CO2 via the biological carbon pump. Diatoms, photosynthetically active plankton with dense opal skeletons, are key to this process as their exoskeletons are thought to enhance the transfer of particulate organic carbon to depth, positioning them as major vectors of carbon storage. Yet conflicting observations obscure the mechanistic link between diatoms, opal and particulate organic carbon fluxes, especially in the twilight zone where greatest flux losses occur. Here we present direct springtime flux measurements from different sectors of the subpolar Southern Ocean, demonstrating that across large areas of the subpolar twilight zone, carbon is efficiently transferred to depth, albeit not by diatoms. Rather, opal is retained near the surface ocean, indicating that processes such as diatom buoyancy regulation and grazer repackaging can negate ballast effects of diatoms’ skeletons. Our results highlight that the presence of diatoms in surface waters of the Southern Ocean’s largest biome does not guarantee their importance as vectors for efficient carbon transfer through the subpolar twilight zone. Climate change-driven shifts in phytoplankton community composition may affect biologically sequestered carbon pools less than currently predicted.

 Lung tissue-resident memory T (TRM) cells induced by influenza vaccination are crucial for heterosubtypic immunity upon re-exposure to the influenza virus, enabling rapid and robust responses upon reactivation. To enhance the efficacy of influenza vaccines, we induce the generation of lung TRM cells following intranasal vaccination with a commercial influenza vaccine adjuvanted with NexaVant (NVT), a TLR3 agonist-based adjuvant. We demonstrate that intranasal immunization with the NVT-adjuvanted vaccine provides improved protection against influenza virus infections by inducing the generation of CD4+ TRM cells in the lungs in a type I interferon-dependent manner. These pulmonary CD4+ TRM cells provide potent mucosal immunity and cross-protection against heterosubtypic infections in both mouse and ferret models.

 Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare, aggressive malignancy with a poor prognosis. Therapeutic options for patients with advanced ACC who have failed standard treatments are limited. Single-agent immunotherapy as a second-line treatment has shown unsatisfactory clinical outcomes. This phase II trial (NCT04318730) evaluated the efficacy and safety of the PD-1 inhibitor camrelizumab combined with the VEGFR inhibitor apatinib in previously treated advanced ACC. The primary endpoint was objective response rate (ORR). The secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. A total of 21 patients with advanced ACC received at least one dose of camrelizumab and apatinib. The ORR was 52% (95% CI, 30−74%), meeting the primary endpoint, and the disease control rate (DCR) was 95% (95% CI, 76−100%).

 Paediatric medulloblastomas with chromothripsis are characterised by high genomic instability and are among the tumours with the worst prognosis. However, the molecular makeup and the determinants of the aggressiveness of chromothriptic medulloblastoma are not well understood. Here, we apply spatial transcriptomics to profile a cohort of 13 chromothriptic and non-chromothriptic medulloblastomas from the same molecular subgroup. Our data reveal a higher extent of spatial intra-tumour heterogeneity in chromothriptic medulloblastomas compared to non-chromothripictic tumours, which is associated with increased proliferation and stemness, but lower immune infiltration and differentiation. Spatial mapping of genetic subclones of the same tumour identify a regionally distinct architecture and clone-specific phenotypic features, with distinct degrees of differentiation, proliferation and immune infiltration between clones. We conduct temporal profiling of 11 samples from patient-derived xenografts from a patient with chromothriptic medulloblastoma, covering the transition from the minimal residual disease stage to treatment-resistant regrown tumours. In chromothriptic medulloblastoma, an ecosystem of cells from multiple genetic clones resist treatment and lead to relapse.

 Understanding the concurrent responses of aboveground and belowground biota compartments to global changes is crucial for the maintenance of ecosystem functions and biodiversity conservation. We conduct a comprehensive analysis synthesizing data from 13,209 single observations and 3223 pairwise observations from 1166 publications across the world terrestrial ecosystems to examine the responses of plants and soil organisms and their synchronization. We find that global change factors (GCFs) generally promote plant biomass but decreased plant species diversity. In comparison, the responses of belowground soil biota to GCFs are more variable and harder to predict. The analysis of the paired aboveground and belowground observations demonstrate that responses of plants and soil organisms to GCFs are decoupled among diverse groups of soil organisms for different biomes.

Here, Aboy et al. describe CAV1 Y14 phosphorylation as required for appropriate adipocyte caveolae flattening and homeostasis. 
 Adipocytes expand massively to accommodate excess energy stores and protect the organism from lipotoxicity. Adipose tissue expandability is at the center of disorders such as obesity and lipodystrophy; however, little is known about the relevance of adipocyte biomechanics on the etiology of these conditions. Here, we show in male mice in vivo that the adipocyte plasma membrane undergoes caveolar domain reorganization upon lipid droplet expansion. As the lipid droplet grows, caveolae disassemble to release their membrane reservoir and increase cell surface area, and transfer specific caveolar components to the LD surface. Adipose tissue null for caveolae is stiffer, shows compromised deformability, and is prone to rupture under mechanical compression. Mechanistically, phosphoacceptor Cav1 Tyr14 is required for caveolae disassembly: adipocytes bearing a Tyr14Phe mutation at this residue are stiffer and smaller, leading to decreased adiposity in vivo; exhibit deficient transfer of Cav1 and EHD2 to the LD surface, and show distinct Cav1 molecular dynamics and tension adaptation. These results indicate that Cav1 phosphoregulation modulates caveolar dynamics as a relevant component of the homeostatic mechanoadaptation of the differentiated adipocyte.

 Programming matter one molecule at a time is a long-standing goal in nanoscience. The atomic resolution of a scanning tunnelling microscope (STM) can give control over the probability of inducing single-outcome single-molecule reactions. Here we show it is possible to measure and influence the outcome of a single-molecule reaction with multiple competing outcomes. By precise injection of electrons from an STM tip, toluene molecules are induced to react with two outcomes: switching to an adjacent site or desorption. Within a voltage range set by the electronic structure of the molecule-surface system, we see that the branching ratio between these two outcomes is dependent on the excess energy the exciting electron carries. Using known values, ab initio DFT calculations and empirical models, we conclude that this excess energy leads to a heating of a common intermediate physisorbed state and gives control over the two outcomes via their energy barriers and prefactors.

Here, the authors use ancestral sequence reconstruction to trace the evolution of stereoselectivity in imine reductases, elucidate its structural basis, and investigating the role of epistasis. 
 The stereoselectivity of enzymes plays a central role in asymmetric biocatalytic reactions, but there remains a dearth of evolution-driven biochemistry studies investigating the evolutionary trajectory of this vital property. Imine reductases (IREDs) are one such enzyme that possesses excellent stereoselectivity, and stereocomplementary members are pervasive in the family. However, the regulatory mechanism behind stereocomplementarity remains cryptic. Herein, we reconstruct a panel of active ancestral IREDs and trace the evolution of stereoselectivity from ancestors to extant IREDs. Combined with coevolution analysis, we reveal six historical mutations capable of recapitulating stereoselectivity evolution. An investigation of the mechanism with X-ray crystallography shows that they collectively reshape the substrate-binding pocket to regulate stereoselectivity inversion. In addition, we construct an empirical fitness landscape and discover that epistasis is prevalent in stereoselectivity evolution. Our findings emphasize the power of ASR in circumventing the time-consuming large-scale mutagenesis library screening for identifying mutations that change functions and support a Darwinian premise from a molecular perspective that the evolution of biological functions is a stepwise process.

 This paper addresses the challenge of indoor space segmentation from 3D point clouds, which is essential for understanding interior layouts, reconstructing 3D structures, and developing indoor navigation maps. While current deep learning-based methods rely on projecting 3D point clouds into 2D for instance extraction, they often fail to capture the local and global 3D features necessary for effectively segmenting complex indoor spaces, such as multi-ring nested structures. These methods also struggle with generalization across different scenes. In response, this paper proposes an efficient indoor space segmentation method that integrates both 2D and 3D geometric constraints. By leveraging the distribution characteristics of point clouds in 2D and the local and global features in 3D, the method achieves reliable extraction of vertical structural information in complex indoor environments. To address under-segmentation in small spaces due to varying scales, the paper introduces an adaptive extraction method for space partition anchors, guided by local features. During instance-level space segmentation, a hierarchical contour tree structure is employed to precisely partition complex indoor spaces, effectively handling circular and composite structures. The proposed approach was tested on 96 RGB-D scans from the Beike dataset and 6 large-scale indoor scenes from the S3DIS dataset, covering a range of complexities, sizes, and structures. The experimental section includes ablation studies and thorough comparisons with existing state-of-the-art spatial partitioning algorithms based on morphology and deep learning. Results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of accuracy, robustness, and generalization ability, providing a solid foundation for indoor space modeling and robotic navigation.

 Leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) retrieval from remote sensing imagery is essential for monitoring vegetation growth and stress in the agroforestry industry. Many remote sensing inversion methods for estimating LCC primarily rely on 1D radiative transfer models (RTMs) that abstract canopies into horizontal layers or simple geometric primitives. Yet, this methodology faces challenges when applied to heterogeneous canopies, particularly in fine-scale mapping where each pixel's reflectance is significantly influenced by its surroundings, e.g. crown shadows. While 3D RTMs hold promise for addressing these challenges by explicitly describing complex canopy structures, their computational demands and the complexity involved in parameterizing detailed 3D structures limit the generation of extensive training datasets, requiring simulations across numerous parameter combinations. In this study, we used a semi-empirically accelerated 3D RTM, termed Semi-LESS, with a 1D residual network to accurately retrieve leaf chlorophyll content (LCC) from UAV images and LiDAR data at a 3-m resolution. We first reconstructed structures of forest plots using UAV LiDAR point cloud, based on which, UAV images with varying leaf and soil optical properties are simulated using the Semi-LESS. Subsequently, a training dataset consisting LCC and its corresponding reflectance was generated from the simulated UAV images by focusing on sunlit pixels. A 1D residual network is trained using the training dataset for LCC estimation. For comparison, we also trained an estimation model using a dataset generated from PROSAIL. The results show that estimation model trained with Semi-LESS surpasses PROSAIL in retrieving LCC from both simulation datasets and field measurements of two forest plots. The RMSE of Semi-LESS was 5.40–6.92 µg/cm2 for simulation datasets and 8.21–9.76 µg/cm2 for field measurements, whereas PROSAIL exhibited lower accuracy with an RMSE of 7.76–9.83 µg/cm2 for simulation datasets and 12.76–13.06 µg/cm2 in field measurements.

 Accurate bathymetric data is crucial for various aspects such as marine resource exploitation and marine ecological conservation. Currently, satellite-derived bathymetry (SDB) based on empirical and physical models has been widely utilized in constructing underwater terrain in shallow seas. However, the application of such SDB models is limited in remote island reef areas lacking in-situ measurement data. To overcome this issue, the manuscript proposes an unconstrained SDB optimization method without in-situ measurement data, utilizing satellite multispectral imagery (Geoeye-1) and spaceborne LiDAR data (ICESat-2). By classifying the seafloor substrate in coral reef areas into sandy and coral, based on the depth invariant index (DII), we employ an adaptive logarithmic ratio model for unconstrained SDB. The ICESat-2 LiDAR data are then used to correct the SDB results, achieving bathymetry optimization in the coral reef area of the Xisha Islands. Additionally, the proposed method is applied to Yuanzhi Island of the Xisha Islands, and the accuracy of the bathymetric results is evaluated against ALB (Airborne LiDAR Bathymetry) data. The findings demonstrate that compared to conventional methods, our method can improve the accuracy of SDB results with good adaptability. In the Yuanzhi Island area, the proposed method yields SDB results with an R2 of 0.93, an MAE (Mean Absolute Error) of 0.94, and an RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) of 1.12 m, compared to ALB data. The average error is less than 10 % of the maximum depth, essentially meeting the requirements of the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) standards for depth measurement error when depth is <20 m. This study can offer a novel approach for enhancing bathymetric accuracy around offshore and remote islands, where gathering underwater terrain data is challenging."

 Climate change caused by rapid urbanization in the Guanzhong region of China is becoming an increasingly significant problem. Previous empirical studies have confirmed that landscape patterns inextricably linked with the thermal environment, but static results based on a single temporal cross section of image data provide only a partial understanding. In this paper, we constructed a dynamic framework using Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) for temperature simulation and Geodetector to study the landscape factors and their interactions that influence near-surface temperature (NST) changes in the Guanzhong Plain Urban Agglomeration (GPUA) between 2000 and 2020. Results showed that the GPUA average NST increased by 0.012 °C and 0.053 °C in January and July from 2000 to 2020, respectively. In terms of the dynamic correlation between landscape patterns and NST, cropland (CPL) was negative, urban land (UBL) was positive, and the remainder of the landscapes differed in winter and summer. Furthermore, results from the Geodetector showed that UBL embodied a stronger influence in summer than during winter months. This finding helps to explain why the average NST increase is higher in summer than during winter. The Dynamic Q values (DQ) of the area-based landscape metrics were generally larger than those of other spatial configuration metrics, and the interaction results showed that the landscape metrics of various land-cover classifications were enhanced, indicating that the superposition effect among landscape metrics needs to be taken into account in landscape planning in addition to area factors. The study of the relationship between landscape patterns and thermal environment considering dynamic perspective using WRF offers an important theoretical reference allied with practical guidance for understanding and adapting to forthcoming change in our climate through which we can help drive sustainable development decisions of the GPUA."

 Increasing exposure to heatwaves threatens public health, challenging various socioeconomic sectors in the coming decades. Prior studies mostly concentrated on the heatwaves occurring in specific regions by examining temperature durations, ignoring the fact that heatwaves typically swept across a large area. To comprehensively assess the effects of heatwaves, we jointly analyzed public attention to heatwaves using a dataset of over 10 million geo-located Weibo tweets across 321 cities in China. By considering spatial disparities, two kinds of public attention at city level, namely the number of heat-related tweets (NHTs) and the ratio of heat-related tweets (RHTs), were designed to indicate the severity and location of heatwave impacts, respectively. The heat cumulative intensity was used as a proxy for heatwaves, which exhibited more significant correlations with RHTs than NHTs. The multiscale geographically weighted regression (MGWR) model was employed to investigate the spatiotemporal variations of environment, demographic, and economic-social factors.

 Population growth and agricultural intensification lead to stress on landscapes that are highly sensitive to land-use changes. An increase in irrigation-triggered landslides (ITL) in dry climates has negative impacts on local communities. However, evolution and global impacts of ITL are little-known. Here, we use Multi-Temporal Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (MT-InSAR), vectorization, and differential method to study surface deformation, ground displacement, and changes in headscarp morphology and topography in regions prone to ITL, aiming to uncover the evolution and spatiotemporal distribution of ITL. Findings show that the most severe surface deformation of ITL occurs on the landslide body. Meanwhile, the ITL displacement curve indicates the ITL will maintain continuous movement for at least 7 years, while ancient ITL also poses a threat. Moreover, the headscarp of ITL shows lateral expansion and longitudinal retrogression on the horizontal ground, whereby the scale of expansion is greater than that of retrogression, which transforms landslides into landslide clusters. Finally, the topographic changes further reveal that the main development pattern of ITL is lateral expansion. We suggest that the frequency and disaster-causing ability of ITL will increase greatly with further population growth and related intensification in the agricultural sector."

 3D mapping provides highly accurate environmental data, which is essential for critical applications such as autonomous driving and urban emergency response. Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) sensors, particularly solid-state ones, play a pivotal role in spatial–temporal mapping by providing precise three-dimensional data of the environment, significantly enhancing remote sensing capabilities and adaptability to challenging environments compared to mechanical LiDAR systems. However, the limited field of view results in a sparse point cloud frame with few features, which poses challenges to feature matching, causes pose offset, and hinders spatial–temporal continuity, and further significant obstacle for existing vehicle-mounted mobile mapping methods.

The effectiveness of the method is validated through extensive experiments in complex community and high-speed urban road scenarios.

The UHRViT utilized a multi-scale high-resolution visual Transformer as its backbone network and was designed to a multi-branch U-shaped network structure to extract features of different scales layer by layer, and to facilitate the interaction of high and low-level semantic information. We further verified the classification performance superiority of UHRViT model by comparing to HRViT and HRNetV2 algorithms.

 Accurate crop mapping is critical for agricultural decisions and food security. Despite the widespread use of machine learning and deep learning in remote sensing for crop classification, mapping crops in mountainous smallholder farming systems remains challenging. In particular, cloudy and rainy weather limits high-quality satellite imagery, potentially limiting the availability of reliable data for classification. Additionally, the substantial intraclass variability among multiple crops further impedes classification accuracy.

For the first challenge, multisource remote sensing data, including Landsat-8, Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 data from the Google Earth Engine, were integrated to provide more comprehensive information on crop growth and differences. To address the second challenge, we proposed a 2D-CNN network enhanced by CBAM attention and an online hard example mining strategy. The network focuses on the channel-spatial information of crop samples and their surrounding pixels while promoting the convergence of similar crop samples within the latent feature space and enhancing the separation among different samples. This process is exemplified through a case study of crop mapping in Jiangjin District, Chongqing city, an area representing the typical mountain smallholder farming systems in Southwest China.

 Recently the applications of remotely sensed Solar-Induced chlorophyll Fluorescence (SIF) in the study of photosynthesis, stress conditions, and gross primary production have increased significantly. The full SIF spectrum spans over a spectral region of 650 ∼ 850 nm with two characteristic peaks around 685 nm and 740 nm. Over recent decades, many retrieval algorithms have been developed to estimate SIF at Top-Of-Canopy (TOC) using in-situ measurements of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. Although the majority of retrieval methods retrieve SIF at a narrow spectral window, there exists a potential for retrieval of SIF in the full emission spectrum. Moreover, solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra should ideally be measured at the same time but are usually measured sequentially with a certain time lag, raising potential errors in SIF retrieval. In this study, an enhanced retrieval algorithm of the full SIF spectrum at TOC is proposed. The proposed algorithm attempts to minimize the errors owing to time mismatch in measurements of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. As an improvement to the previous algorithm (advanced Fluorescence Spectrum Reconstruction, aFSR), this proposed algorithm (aFSR-SVE) models the SIF-free contribution with principal components using the singular value decomposition technique. The optimal parameter settings in the forward model were determined for the experimental data collected by spectrometers used in the study. Firstly, the proposed algorithm was used to reconstruct full SIF spectrum for simulated data. The results were compared with known reference SIF values. After achieving satisfying results from simulated data, the proposed algorithm was compared with retrievals from established algorithms using experimental data. The results show improved SIF retrieval accuracy, without the need to simultaneously measure solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. The retrieval values comply with the results of previous algorithms in terms of spectral shape, diurnal trend, and temporal variations. The induced errors in SIF retrievals due to non-simultaneous measurements of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra were also investigated and the proposed algorithm was found to be less prone to such errors. Hence, the proposed algorithm is an improvement in reconstructing the full SIF spectrum with near-ground measurements. With the help of the proposed algorithm, field measurements using sequential systems and automated measurements of multiple targets can be performed effectively as it relaxes the requirement of concurrent measurement of solar irradiance and canopy radiance spectra. For future work, the applicability of this method can be investigated under more variable illumination conditions, like high cirrus clouds, passing clouds or persistent thin clouds."

 Recently, Autoencoders (AEs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in the field of hyperspectral anomaly detection, owing to their powerful capability in handling high-dimensional data. However, they often overlook the inherent global distribution characteristics and long-range dependencies in hyperspectral images (HSI). This oversight makes it challenging to accurately characterize and describe boundaries between different backgrounds and anomalies in complex HSI, thereby affecting detection accuracy. To address this issue, a robust multi-stage progressive autoencoder for hyperspectral anomaly detection (RMSAD) is proposed. Initially, a progressive multi-stage learning framework based on convolutional autoencoders is employed. This framework incrementally reveals and integrates deep contextual features along with their long-range dependencies in HSI, aiming to accurately characterize the background and anomalies. Subsequently, an innovative multi-scale fusion strategy is introduced at the intersections of each stage, reinforcing the learning and representation of background and global spatial details across multiple stages. Finally, by collectively extracting abnormal spatial information across stages, effectively reducing the tendency of autoencoders to reconstruct anomalies. This ensures the efficient restoration and replication of global textural details in HSI.

 Precise spatial mapping of individual species using hyperspectral data is crucial for effective forest management and policy-making. This study focuses on Rhododendron arboreum, known for its medicinal properties attributed to the flavonoid Quercitrin. Sample data and spectroradiometer data were collected from the complex terrain of the Kumaon region in the Himalayas. Hyperspectral data, which includes signal variations based on biophysical and biochemical properties along with noise, were preprocessed using filtering techniques to enhance signal clarity by removing noise. Smoothing techniques were applied to remove noisy bands from the spectra, such as the Savitzky-Golay filter for reduced least square fit complexity and the Average Mean filter for taking mean spectral values. Subsequently, Spectral Analysis (SA) techniques, including first derivative, second derivative, and continuum removal, were employed. These mathematical transformations highlighted absorption troughs and determined the effect of Quercitrin on spectral wavelengths. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to identify the most relevant bands related to Quercitrin. Additionally, regression analysis was applied on resampled spectral data, selected significant wavelengths based on variable importance values, pinpointing the most prominent wavelengths: 1196, 1229, 1328, 1383, 1425, 1636, 1661, 1699, 1785, and 1715 nm.

For the development of prediction model, Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Relevance Vector Machine (RVM), Random Forest (RF), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN), were applied. The Random Forest model, which splits input data into trees to simulate the best model based on observed values, demonstrated high effectiveness in predicting Quercitrin levels, achieving a training correlation of 0.864 and a testing correlation of 0.570. Hence RF proved to be a best technique of band selection as well as robust for Quercitrin prediction.

 Detailed knowledge of vegetation patterns allows to evaluate mire ecosystems and their dynamics. The use of hyperspectral information has the benefits of exploring spectral characteristics of species and vegetation modelling. Our study employed multi-scale and multi-source hyperspectral imaging with a handheld camera in the field and an UAV (Unoccupied Aerial Vehicle) sensor covering the wavelengths of 400 – 1000 nm. Plot-level spectra acquired with a UAV and field spectra collected at 1 m height were combined to develop a spectral library for Sphagnum moss species. This library was then used to map dominant Sphagnum species in a Finnish Aapa mire complex using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) classifier. Classification performance assessment was supported by calculating a water index from the UAV-information. Additionally, we examined the transferability of site-specific spectral libraries to an aapa mire with similar vegetation. The results showed little spectral variation in the plot spectrum between the sensors. A fusion of species- and plot-level libraries yielded the highest accuracy of 62 %. For both mires, there was a great variation among the class accuracies. Floating mosses had an accuracy of 86 %, followed by lawn-forming Sphagnum balticum with 77 %. For the test site, the latter species was mapped with an accuracy of 59 %. Red moss species achieved low accuracies of 45 % and 38 %, likely due to effects from sub-pixel and mixed-pixel effects of neighbouring graminoid species and the presence of litter. This might have also enhanced the contrast of adjacent pixels contributing to spectral alterations. Water table depth measurements and the water index revealed a hydrological preference for most species, with classification performance notably improving with higher water index values. We recommend collecting on-site hyperspectral information at varying hydrological circumstances to build a comprehensive spectral library for mire vegetation and modelling."

 Hyperspectral imaging of solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) is required for plant phenotyping and stress detection. However, the most accurate instruments for SIF quantification, such as sub-nanometer (≤1-nm full-width at half-maximum, FWHM) airborne hyperspectral imagers, are expensive and uncommon. Previous studies have demonstrated that standard narrow-band hyperspectral imagers (i.e., 4–6-nm FWHM) are more cost-effective and can provide far-red SIF quantified at 760 nm (SIF760), which correlates strongly with precise sub-nanometer resolution measurements. Nevertheless, narrow-band SIF760 quantifications are subject to systematic overestimation owing to the influence of the spectral resolution (SR). In this study, we propose a modelling approach based on the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry and Energy Fluxes (SCOPE) model with the objective of enhancing the accuracy of absolute SIF760 levels derived from standard airborne hyperspectral imagers in practical settings.

Leaf biophysical and biochemical traits were first estimated from airborne narrow-band reflectance imagery and subsequently used as SCOPE model inputs to simulate a range of top-of-canopy (TOC) radiance and SIF spectra at 1-nm FWHM. The SCOPE simulated radiance spectra were then convolved to match the spectral configuration of the narrow-band imager to compute the 5.8-nm FWHM SIF760. A site-specific model was constructed by employing the convolved 5.8-nm SR SIF760 as the independent variable and the 1-nm SR SIF760 directly simulated by SCOPE as the dependent variable. When applied to the airborne dataset, the estimated SIF760 at 1-nm SR from the standard narrow-band hyperspectral imager matched the reference sub-nanometer quantified SIF760 with root mean square error (RMSE) less than 0.5 mW/m2/nm/sr, yielding R2 = 0.93–0.95 from the two experiments. These results suggest that the proposed modelling approach enables the interpretation of SIF760 quantified using standard hyperspectral imagers of 4–6 nm FWHM for stress detection and plant physiological condition assessment."

 Confronting the escalating challenge of emergencies, the urban supply network of daily necessity is an important defense line for human well-being. This study introduces a groundbreaking approach that leverages mobile signaling data, departing from static regional data, to model large-scale and high-precision urban supply-demand network. Moreover, a significant stride in assessing network invulnerability is presented by incorporating cascading failure and emphasizing demand-side factors in attack strategy simulations. This approach marks a paradigm shift in network invulnerability simulation: moving from network topology characteristics to a human-centric approach, which helps better identify vulnerable zones. The model’s robustness is corroborated through simulations of major disaster scenarios. The results indicate that: 1) High-precision human mobility data promises large-scale urban supply-demand network modeling with high accuracy. 2) In regions characterized by greater vulnerability, the establishment of local supply networks demonstrates efficacy in mitigating the impacts of minor disasters. 3) During various stages of cascading failure, the leading factors contributing to community supply shortages vary, with population density being the predominant factor.

 Mapping tree crowns in arid or semi-arid areas, which cover around one-third of the Earth’s land surface, is a key methodology towards sustainable management of trees. Recent advances in deep learning have shown promising results for tree crown segmentation. However, a large amount of manually labeled data is still required. We here propose a novel method to delineate tree crowns from high resolution satellite imagery using deep learning trained with automatically generated labels from 3D radiative transfer modeling, intending to reduce human annotation significantly. The methodological steps consist of 1) simulating images with a 3D radiative transfer model, 2) image style transfer learning based on generative adversarial network (GAN) and 3) tree crown segmentation using U-net segmentation model. The delineation performances of the proposed method have been evaluated on a manually annotated dataset consisting of more than 40,000 tree crowns. Our approach, which relies solely on synthetic images, demonstrates high segmentation accuracy, with an F1 score exceeding 0.77 and an Intersection over Union (IoU) above 0.64. Particularly, it achieves impressive accuracy in extracting crown areas (r2 greater than 0.87) and crown densities (r2 greater than 0.72), comparable to that of a trained dataset with human annotations only. In this study, we demonstrated that the integration of a 3D radiative transfer model and GANs for automatically generating training labels can achieve performances comparable to human labeling, and can significantly reduce the time needed for manual labeling in remote sensing segmentation applications."

 Fusion of hyperspectral image (HSI) and multispectral image (MSI) is a prevalent scheme to generate a HSI with enhanced spatial resolution. Current methods often fail to sufficiently leverage the effective spectral and spatial priors existing in the observed HSI and MSI to further enhance the fusion performance. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel HSI-MSI fusion approach, which integrates Sparse and Low Rank with a CNN denoiser (SLRCNN) while considering spectral dictionary optimization. Firstly, an initialized spectral dictionary is derived from the HSI. Next, the spatial coefficients optimization model is established by incorporating the sparse prior, local low-rank prior, and plugged image prior simultaneously, where the l1 norm is imposed to promote the sparse prior, and the super-pixel segmentation strategy is conducted on the MSI to impose the local low-rank prior while a well-trained CNN denoiser is plugged in to enforce the image prior. Then, the spectral dictionary optimization model is constructed to refine the initial spectral dictionary, capturing more detailed spectral characteristics to further improve the fusion results. Finally, the optimization process involves applying the split-augmented Lagrangian shrinkage method and the alternating direction method of multipliers. Experimental results on simulated and real datasets, namely the Pavia University dataset, the Indian Pines dataset, and the EO-1 dataset, indicate that SLRCNN outperforms existing state-of-the-art approaches at 4x, 5x, and 6x resolutions in both qualitative and quantitative evaluation results. Specifically, the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of SLRCNN is improved by more than 0.9 dB, 0.9 dB, and 0.2 dB while the spectral angle mapper (SAM) is decreased by more than 0.1, 0.2, and 0.2 in degree compared to other state-of-the-art methods across three datasets, respectively, which underscores the effectiveness of SLRCNN in leveraging both spatial detail reconstruction and spectral preservation."

 Average leaf inclination angle (θ¯L) is an important canopy structure variable that influences light regime, photosynthesis, and evapotranspiration of plants. θ¯L can be measured through direct methods (e.g., protractor), which are labor-intensive and time-consuming, or through indirect optical instruments, which are more efficient than the direct methods. However, uncertainties of different indirect optical instruments for quantifying θ¯L remain largely unquantified. In this study, we evaluated and compared the performances of three major indirect optical instruments: (1) LAI-2200, (2) 30°-tilted camera, and (3) digital hemispherical photography (DHP), in different crop fields over a growing season, benchmarked with direct measurements. LAI-2200 and 30°-tilted camera showed higher agreement with direct θ¯ measurements (R2 = 0.54, RMSE = 7.37°; R2 = 0.58, RMSE = 8.08°) than DHP (R2 = 0.14, RMSE = 13.96°). Different performances of indirect optical instruments could be attributed to the accuracy of gap fraction measurement and the performance of the θ¯L quantification algorithms. When using the LAI-2200 algorithm, larger gap fraction gradients over view zenith angles led to larger θ¯L values, and smaller gap fraction gradients led to smaller θ¯L values. Such error propagation was larger in sparse canopy than in dense canopy. The Wilson G function of the LAI-2200 algorithm performed better in estimating θ¯L than the G function based on the ellipsoidal LAD function used by the CAN_EYE algorithm. We also proposed a modification of the LAI-2200 algorithm, which further improved the performance of LAI-2200 and 30°-tilted cameras in estimating θ¯L. We envision that the low-cost 30°-tilted cameras provide a promising sensor solution to continuously monitor canopy structure for various ecosystems."

 Commercial districts, as the epicenters of urban commerce and economic activity, largely reflect an area’s prosperity through their customer flow. However, previous research, which often relied on statistical and survey data, has typically not captured the full scope of customer flow dynamics throughout urban commercial districts and has not adequately measured the specific impacts of business district locations and their surrounding communities on customer flow. To bridge these gaps, this study utilizes multidimensional big geo-data resources, including mobile phone signaling data, Points of Interest (POI) data, and transportation network data, to uncover the underlying factors that influence customer flow within urban commercial districts. The findings suggest that several factors—the size of the commercial district, the diversity of business formats, the convenience of parking, the working and residential population in surrounding communities, and the proximity to urban centers—significantly influence the customer flow. Consumers show a preference for larger-scale, centrally-located commercial districts that offer convenient parking options, while a homogenized and uncharacteristic business format may reduce a commercial district’s appeal. Furthermore, the study reveals that industrial parks and mixed-use complexes within the 15-minute living circle surrounding the commercial district have a stronger attraction to customer flow than residential neighborhoods do. The insights from this research not only guide the strategic placement of new commercial centers but also provide a robust framework for enhancing the layout of urban commercial spaces and for the revitalization and advancement of established commercial districts."

 Attribution of forest disturbance types using satellite remote sensing is practicable and several methods have been developed to automate the procedure. However, limited by commonly used data and the methodology, achieving accurate and rapid attribution of forest disturbance types over broad spatial extents remains challenging. In this study, we developed a method for attributing forest disturbance types using Dynamic World class probability data (i.e., probabilities for Dynamic World land use land cover types). Specifically, we first obtained a high-quality probability time series by pre-processing the class probability data. Then, we segmented the entire time series into several subseries and classified them according to the hypothetical trajectories. Finally, we completed the attribution of forest disturbance types using the variables derived from the probability time series and the results of the subseries classification. We used the developed method to investigate the forest disturbance types in Myanmar from 2017 to 2023 and validated its effectiveness by conducting unbiased accuracy assessment. The overall accuracy of the type for the acquired map was approximately 93.3%, and the overall accuracy of the year was approximately 96.7%, proving that the method is feasible.

 Land cover change detection and classification, including both inter-class changes (land cover conversion, LCC) and intra-class changes (land cover modification, LCM), is critical for understanding the Earth’s dynamic processes and promoting sustainability. However, previous studies have predominantly focused on LCC, with less emphasis on LCM. Land cover classification remains challenging, and its mapping results are often affected by salt and pepper noise. Here, we propose a hybrid approach for continuous change detection and classification of LCC and LCM using Jinchang City, China, as a case study. Firstly, we combined the Continuous Change Detection and Classification (CCDC) and the Bayesian Estimator of Abrupt change, Seasonal change, and Trend (BEAST) algorithms to identify LCC and LCM using all available Landsat time series (TS) data from 2000 to 2020. Then, the harmonic regression coefficients and RMSE values derived from CCDC (hereafter called CCDC features) were fed into the DCNN model for LCC classification. Our findings indicate: (1) For LCC and LCM accuracy assessment, the CCDC and BEAST ensemble achieved a spatial F1 score of 82.7% and an average temporal F1 score of 79.7%. (2) In LCC classification, the DCNN model with CCDC features, particularly DeepLabV3+, outperformed the pixel-based XGBoost and other multi-year land cover products, with frequency-weighted intersection over union (FWIoU), overall accuracy, and Kappa scores of 88.7%, 94%, and 0.87, respectively.

 Low scattering terrain areas introduce complex phase interference, which reduces the accuracy of deformation signal estimation in InSAR(Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) techniques. Existing covariance matrix-based InSAR phase calculation methods often fail to account for translational offset relations between scatterers leading to inaccuracies, and pixels with zero spatial coherence exist. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distributed scatterer InSAR phase estimation method based on the Cross-Correlation complex coherence matrix. The effectiveness and superiority of the algorithm are verified through simulation and actual data. The results show that: (i) The simulation analysis shows that, compared to the traditional covariance matrix method, the optimal Cross-Correlation matrix improves the interferometric phase, coherence, and accuracy by 21.51%, 15.24%, and 6.52%, respectively. (ii) The actual experimental data show that the interferometric phase optimal by the Cross-Correlation matrix can effectively overcome the pseudo-signal caused by spatial hopping and make the phase more continuous. Compared with the traditional covariance matrix, the average a posteriori coherence and average coherence of arbitrary interference combinations in the Cross-Correlation matrix are improved by 18.12% and 58.10%, respectively. (iii) The number of DS points selected by the Cross-Correlation matrix algorithm is more than that of the covariance matrix algorithm.

 Effective management of corn straw and stubble is critical in conservation tillage, as it impacts soil health and productivity. However, accurate classification of different types of straw cover has been hindered by their similar spectral and spatial characteristics and the low spatial resolution of hyperspectral satellite imagery. Moreover, traditional convolution neural network (CNN)-based methods, which rely on first-order statistics for feature extraction, often struggle to extract distinguishable features of highly similar objects effectively, thereby reducing classification accuracy. In this study, a second-order statistical-feature extraction algorithm based on CNN that uses fused multispectral and hyperspectral data was tested for its ability to classify types of straw cover. In the first step, coupled non-negative matrix factorization (CNMF) was used to fuse hyperspectral and multispectral images effectively, thereby enhancing the spatial resolution of the hyperspectral data. In this study, we integrated pointwise convolution (PWC), depthwise convolution (DWC), and a distance covariance matrix (DCM) to form a mixed convolution and DCM (MCDCM) network; we used this to extract and integrate deep spectral–spatial features of the hyperspectral images. Our experimental results show that the MCDCM network significantly improved classification accuracy compared to traditional methods, with accuracy rates for the different straw-cover types exceeding 90% and overall accuracy reaching 98.26%.

 Effective geographic environment observation planning is the key to obtain disaster monitoring and warning information.

Lastly, high-accuracy crater detection is achieved based on the learned multi-modal data features through semantic segmentation. Our results demonstrate that ADSNet outperforms other baseline models in many metrics such as IoU and F1 score.

Among the models, ResNet-50 achieved the highest weighted overall accuracy (OA) of 0.95, closely followed by SwinV2-t with an OA of 0.94, demonstrating their strong ability to detect complex patterns in satellite imagery. DenseNet-121 also performed competitively with a weighted OA of 0.93, while ViTb-19 and VGG-16 showed slightly lower performance. SwinV2-t, a transformer-based model, outperformed traditional CNN architectures in data-rich classes but faced challenges in classifying habitats with limited representation. Consequently, this study identifies these challenges that conventional transformer architectures pose in classifying certain habitats with limited representation and intricate features.

 Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) have garnered significant attention across various research domains due to their impressive performance, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), known for their exceptional accuracy in image processing tasks. However, the opaque nature of DNNs has raised concerns about their trustworthiness, as users often cannot understand how the model arrives at its predictions or decisions. This lack of transparency is particularly problematic in critical fields such as healthcare, finance, and law, where the stakes are high. Consequently, there has been a surge in the development of explanation methods for DNNs. Typically, the effectiveness of these methods is assessed subjectively via human observation on the heatmaps or attribution maps generated by eXplanation AI (XAI) methods. In this paper, a novel GeoStatistics Explainable Artificial Intelligence (GSEAI) framework is proposed, which integrates spatial pattern analysis from Geostatistics with XAI algorithms to assess and compare XAI understandability. Global and local Moran’s I indices, commonly used to assess the spatial autocorrelation of geographic data, assist in comprehending the spatial distribution patterns of attribution maps produced by the XAI method, through measuring the levels of aggregation or dispersion. Interpreting and analyzing attribution maps by Moran’s I scattergram and LISA clustering maps provide an accurate global objective quantitative assessment of the spatial distribution of feature attribution and achieves a more understandable local interpretation. In this paper, we conduct experiments on aircraft detection in SAR images based on the widely used YOLOv5 network, and evaluate four mainstream XAI methods quantitatively and qualitatively. By using GSEAI to perform explanation analysis of the given DNN, we could gain more insights about the behavior of the network, to enhance the trustworthiness of DNN applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time XAI has been integrated with geostatistical algorithms in SAR domain knowledge, which expands the analytical approaches of XAI and also promotes the development of XAI within SAR image analytics."

 Tropical savannas have a patchy vegetation structure and heterogeneous composition that complicates their mapping and management. Land managers need detailed vegetation information, especially as tropical savannas often support extensive ranching systems or wildlife-based tourism and face specific challenges such as bush thickening, drought, bushfires and, in Africa, browsing by large game. Since existing methods to map savanna vegetation mosaics rarely provide the resolution or speed required, this study aimed to characterise savanna vegetation with sufficient detail for management purposes and sufficient generalisation for the assessment of processes at a landscape level, using an easy, quick, and cost-efficient system. The study area is a semi-arid savanna in a small game reserve south of Etosha National Park in Namibia. A rapid field assessment focused on the woody vegetation and used the Bitterlich method. Indicator species analysis and MRPP tests resulted in five mixed woody vegetation classes. Random Forest was used to model vegetation composition, structure and woody cover. The highest accuracy was obtained for vegetation composition (77 %) and the lowest for vegetation cover (71 %) with similar accuracies at a resolution of 10 m compared to 30 m. The most important predictors were a radar mosaic (ALOS PALSAR HV) and Sentinel-2 data representing days in wet and dry seasons, with MSAVI2 a more suitable vegetation index than NDVI. Other predictors such as land surface temperature during winter nights, geology, and distance to water points contributed to the models. The final vegetation map contains 10 classes based on woody vegetation composition and structure. The most dominant classes were Colophospermum mopane – Terminalia prunioides woodland (33 %) and bushland (18 %) with grassland only covering 2.5 %. The method described here was driven by management requirements and can be used for bush control monitoring, quantifying the carbon pool and carrying capacity. It combines an old field survey method with free state-of-the-art datasets and algorithms. The focus on woody vegetation minimises the dependence on the intermittent presence of grasses and herbs in semi-arid savannas."

 Forest fires pose a significant threat to ecosystems, biodiversity, and human settlements, necessitating accurate and timely detection of burned areas for post-fire management. This study focused on the immediate assessment of a recent major forest fire that occurred on March 15, 2024, in southwestern China. We comprehensively utilized high temporal resolution MODIS and Black Marble nighttime light images to monitor the fire’s development and introduced a novel method for detecting burned forest areas using a new Shadow-Enhanced Vegetation Index (SEVI) coupling with a machine learning technique. The SEVI effectively enhances the vegetation index (VI) values on shaded slopes and hence reduces the VI disparity between shaded and sunlit areas, which is critical for accurately extracting fire scars in such terrain. While SEVI primarily identifies burned forest areas, the Random Forest (RF) technique detects all burned areas, including both forested and non-forested regions. Consequently, the total burned area of the Yajiang forest fire was estimated at 23,588 ha, with the burned forest area covering 19,266 ha. The combination of SEVI and RF algorithms provided a comprehensive and efficient tool for identifying burned areas. Additionally, our study employed the Remote Sensing-based Ecological Index (RSEI) to assess the ecological impact of the fire on the region, uncovering an immediate 15 % decline in regional ecological conditions following the fire. The usage of RSEI has the potential to quantitatively understand ecological responses to the fire. The findings achieved in this study underscore the significance of precise fire-burned area extraction techniques for enhancing forest fire management and ecosystem recovery strategies, while also highlighting the broader ecological implications of such events."

 Yellow River is famous for its exceptionally higher suspended sediment concentrations (SSC), displaying significant spatiotemporal heterogeneity across diverse sections. Although SSC monitoring of the Yellow River and some of its tributaries has been achieved using Landsat data, it remains unclear whether the inclusion of higher spatial resolution satellites can expand the spatiotemporal monitoring capabilities for the Yellow River and most of its tributaries. In this study, we employed Sentinel-2 imagery, offering superior spatiotemporal resolution, to develop a higher-accurate SSC model and quantitatively evaluated its potential to improve the spatiotemporal coverage of SSC monitoring compared to Landsat satellites. For the Yellow River in the Loess Plateau, the optimized Sentinel-2 model exhibited superior accuracy, achieving R2 = 0.91, root mean square error of 728.76 mg/L, and unbiased percentage difference of 16.75%. Notably, distinct SSC distribution differences were observed across different rivers, indicating significant spatial heterogeneity (SSC: 0.58 – 3.01 × 105 mg/L). Moreover, Sentinel-2 showed a significant increase in observation frequency and spatial coverage (204.08% and 107.15%, respectively) compared to Landsat. An additional 35.29% increase in observation frequency was achieved through the combined satellite observation method. Furthermore, based on river width statistics, we found that upgrading the spatial resolution from 10 m to 1 m enhanced the coverage of observable river segments in the Loess Plateau by approximately 47.96%, and by about 50.56% globally. This study established a crucial scientific foundation for integrating Sentinel-2 and Landsat, enabling finer-scale monitoring and management of river sediment."

 The wave spectrum describes the distribution of wave energy across frequency and direction. Obtaining wave spectrum information with high accuracy is of great value for oceanographic research and disaster prevention and reduction. Currently, wave spectral data can be obtained from remote sensing observations, global meteorological and climate reanalysis products, and in-situ observations, which exhibit different advantages and limitations in terms of spatio-temporal resolution, accuracy, and data coverage. Fusing these diverse spectral data to complement the advantage of improving the accuracy of wave spectrum is very promising. However, there is still no simple and effective method to fuse the above spectral data. In this study, a multi-source spectral fusion method is developed based on BU-NET, which realizes the integration of ERA5 spectra and SWIM spectra, with buoy spectra as the reference. The results of the systematic evaluation indicate that the fusion spectra alleviate parasitic peaks, address the issue of larger mean energy, and compensate for energy loss due to the cutoff frequency in the SWIM spectra. The fusion spectra also alleviate energy underestimation during high sea states in the ERA5 spectra. Furthermore, the accuracy of the significant wave height, mean wave period, dominant wave period, and dominant wave direction obtained from the fusion spectra is improved.

 Existing methods for matching multi-modal remote sensing images (MRSI) demonstrate considerable adaptability. However, high-precision matching for rectification remains challenging due to differing imaging mechanisms in cross-modal remote sensing images, leading to numerous non-repeated detailed feature points. Additionally, assuming linear transformations between images conflicts with the complex aberrations present in remote sensing images, limiting matching accuracy. This paper aims to elevate matching accuracy by implementing a detailed texture removal strategy that effectively isolates repeatable structural features. Subsequently, we construct a radiation-invariant similarity function within a generalized gradient framework for least-squares matching, specifically designed to mitigate nonlinear geometric and radiometric distortions across MRSIs. Comprehensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations across multiple datasets, employing substantial manual checkpoints, demonstrate that our method significantly enhances matching accuracy for image data involving multiple modal combinations and outperforms the current state-of-the-art solutions in matching accuracy. Additionally, rectification experiments employing WorldView and TanDEM-X images validate our method’s ability to achieve a matching accuracy of 1.05 pixels, thereby indicating its practical utility and generalization capacity.

Thirteen-lined ground squirrels (Ictidomys tridecemlineatus) use the short-term response during summer, whereas during winter, they lack thirst and survive without water for months. In this work, we show that long-term thirst suppression occurs despite hormonal and behavioral signs of a substantial fluid deficit and originates from hypoactivity of neurons in the circumventricular organs, which exhibit marked functional suppression during winter that blunts their sensitivity to thirst cues. Our work reveals a notable capacity of the evolutionarily conserved brain regions that control fluid homeostasis in mammals to enable long-term survival without water."

Pervaporation membrane technology has the potential for separating these mixtures. We developed an oriented monolayer polyhedral (OMP) membrane that consists of a monolayer of ordered polyhedral particles and is anchored by hyperbranched polymers. It contains a high density of straight, selective nanochannels, enabling the preferential transport of aromatic molecules. Compared with traditional mixed-matrix membranes with random orientations, the OMP membrane improves the pervaporation separation index for aromatic-aliphatic hydrocarbon mixtures with C6and C7compounds, surpassing the performance of existing membranes by 3 to 10 times. This high performance demonstrates the potential of OMP membranes for hydrocarbon molecular separation and their application in the value-added separation of naphtha feedstocks."

In this work, we used single-nuclei transcriptomics to dissect the contributions of sex chromosomes and gonads in demyelination and AD. In a mouse model of demyelination, we identified the roles of sex chromosomes and gonads in modifying microglia and oligodendrocyte responses before and after myelin loss. In an AD-related mouse model expressing APOE4, XY sex chromosomes heightened interferon (IFN) response and tau-induced demyelination. The X-linked gene, Toll-like receptor 7 (Tlr7), regulated sex-specific IFN response to myelin. Deletion ofTlr7dampened sex differences while protecting against demyelination. Administering TLR7 inhibitor mitigated tau-induced motor impairment and demyelination in male mice, indicating thatTlr7plays a role in the male-biased type I Interferon IFN response in aging- and AD-related demyelination."

Outrage is highly engaging and need not be accurate to achieve its communicative goals, making it an attractive signal to embed in misinformation. In eight studies that used US data from Facebook (1,063,298 links) and Twitter (44,529 tweets, 24,007 users) and two behavioral experiments (1475 participants), we show that (i) misinformation sources evoke more outrage than do trustworthy sources; (ii) outrage facilitates the sharing of misinformation at least as strongly as sharing of trustworthy news; and (iii) users are more willing to share outrage-evoking misinformation without reading it first. Consequently, outrage-evoking misinformation may be difficult to mitigate with interventions that assume users want to share accurate information."

We report monthly resolved records of coral skeleton–bound nitrogen isotopes (CS-δ15N) to reconstruct denitrification in the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) ODZ over the last 80 years. The data indicate strong decadal variation in ETNP denitrification, with maxima during the cool North Pacific phase of Pacific Decadal Variability. The maxima in denitrification (and thus oxygen deficiency) were likely due to stronger upwelling that enhanced productivity leading to greater oxygen demand in the thermocline. Prior findings of multidecadal-to-centennial ODZ trends were likely biased by this variability. ODZ evolution over the next century will depend on how global warming interacts with the decadal oscillations."

In this work, we realize Abelian anyons in one dimension with arbitrary exchange statistics using ultracold atoms in an optical lattice, where we engineer the statistical phase through a density-dependent Peierls phase. We explore the dynamical behavior of two anyons undergoing quantum walks and observe the anyonic Hanbury Brown–Twiss effect as well as the formation of bound states without on-site interactions. Once interactions are introduced, we observe spatially asymmetric transport in contrast to the symmetric dynamics of bosons and fermions.

Rationing restricted sugar intake to levels within current dietary guidelines, and consumption nearly doubled immediately after rationing ended. Using an event study design with UK Biobank data comparing adults conceived just before or after rationing ended, we found that early-life rationing reduced type 2 diabetes and hypertension risk by about 35 and 20% and delayed disease onset by 4 and 2 years, respectively. Protection was evident with in utero exposure and increased with postnatal sugar restriction, especially after 6 months, when eating of solid foods likely began.

For the first time in flood management literature, we develop an integrated approach to quantify the distinguishing nature of flood risks during both seasons. We employ a sophisticated 1D–2D coupled flood model to generate high-resolution flood hazards while considering the compound interactions between rainfalls and storm-tides. Flood vulnerability is mapped at the finest administrative scale while considering flood-susceptible physical and socio-economic indicators. With the concept of Bivariate Risk Classifier, we introduce two novel metrics: (a) area index and (b) multi-hazard risk index that advance our understanding of the multi-hazard nature of flood risks during monsoon and post-monsoon seasons.

Despite widespread consensus on the need for transformation, discussed strategies vary widely, from technology-driven to sufficiency-focused approaches, emphasizing different agents of change and policy mixes. This study assesses the implications of a new generation of target-seeking scenarios incorporating such diverse sustainability perspectives. We apply two integrated assessment models to explore food and land futures under three whole-economy sustainable development pathways (SDPs): Economy-driven Innovation, Resilient Communities, and Managing the Global Commons. Our assessment shows that the SDPs align sufficient food supply with progress towards planetary integrity, halting biodiversity loss, mitigating adverse impacts from irrigation, and significantly reducing nitrogen pollution. While all SDPs comply with the Paris climate target, they diverge in the timing of climate mitigation efforts and focus on different greenhouse gases and emission sources. The Economy-driven Innovation pathway rapidly achieves net-negative CO2 emissions from the land system, whereas the pathways Resilient Communities and Managing the Global Commons significantly decrease agricultural non-CO2 emissions. Moreover, sustainability interventions attenuate trade-offs associated with narrowly focused mitigation scenarios and reduce reliance on carbon dioxide removal strategies like bioenergy with carbon capture and storage."

This study quantifies historical trends in climate metrics affecting apple growth, production, and quality, which remain understudied. Utilizing the high-resolution gridMET dataset, we analyzed trends (1979–2022) in several key metrics across the U.S.—cold degree days, chill portions, last day of spring frost, growing degree days (GDD), extreme heat days (daily maximum temperature >34 °C), and warm nights (daily minimum temperatures >15 °C). We found significant trends across large parts of the U.S. in all metrics, with the spatial patterns consistent with pronounced warming across the western states in summer and winter. Yakima County, WA, Kent County, MI, Wayne County, NY—leading apple-producers—showed significant decreasing trends in cold degree days and increasing trends in GDD and warm fall nights. Yakima county, with over 48 870 acres of apple orchards, showed significant changes in five of the six metrics—earlier last day of spring frost, fewer cold degree days, increasing GDD over the overall growth period, and more extreme heat days and warm nights. These trends could negatively affect apple production by reducing the dormancy period, altering bloom timing, increasing sunburn risk, and diminishing apple appearance and quality. Large parts of the U.S. experience detrimental trends in multiple metrics simultaneously that indicate the potential for compounding negative impacts on the production and quality of apples and other tree fruit, emphasizing the need for developing and adopting adaptation strategies."

However, it is also a regulated toxic substance with a long history of environmental and health impacts. As the mining of both Zn and Cd will need to increase to support the global energy transition, the status of Cd as either a resource or a pollutant has major implications for global supply chains and environmental management. Here, we present a new global, site-specific database and analysis of Cd resources in Zn-bearing mineral deposits and mines. Our database, which exceeds past Cd studies in scope, transparency and replicability is made available in full to support future assessments of Cd and Zn resources, mine production and associated risks. It includes 927 sites subject to detailed geological data compilation and analysis. Collectively, these sites suggest a new global resource estimate of 3.3 Mt Cd (95% confidence interval: 2.7–6.1 Mt). A preliminary geospatial analysis of sites in our database and mine toxicity indicators was also conducted. It shows that: - A human population of approximately 3.27 million live within 10 km of sites containing Cd resources, - ∼31% of the world’s Cd resources sit within 20 km of International Union for the Conservation of Nature protected areas, and - Some 28% of Cd mobilised annually by mining originates from areas hosting seasonal or permanent surface water cover. As ∼27% of Cd resources are in countries that do not refine it, our study highlights the need for further research exploring global Cd trade flows and associated emissions.

In this study, we analyze the spatiotemporal dynamics of avocado frontier expansion and intensification from 2011 to 2019 and assess their effects on landscape connectivity, focusing on Michoacán, Mexico, the world’s leading avocado exporter. Using high-resolution satellite imagery combined with deep learning based on convolutional neural networks, we delineated avocado orchards and other land use/cover classes, mapped individual avocado tree crowns and irrigation ponds, and identified hotspots of expanding and intensifying avocado production. We used a circuit theory approach to evaluate the effects of avocado expansion and intensification on the connectivity of natural and semi-natural habitats. Our results reveal a rapid increase in avocado orchards, which expanded by 4175 ha—a growth from 27.9% to 37% in area—over the eight-year period. There was also a decline in rainfed agriculture by 3252 ha, and oak-pine forests by 1343 ha. We observed not only the expansion of the avocado frontier into forests but also an intensification of avocado production via increases in high-density plantations, irrigation ponds, and orchards prone to intensive pruning. Moreover, lower-intensity land-use classes, such as rainfed crops, were rapidly converted to avocado orchards. This expansion and intensification have led to increasing isolation of forest fragments. Although we identified routes that could facilitate the movement of species, the dense avocado monocultures continue to threaten the connectivity of natural and semi-natural habitats, causing notable losses of old-growth oak-pine forests and disrupting crucial ecological corridors. Our research underscores the adverse effects of avocado production on land use and landscape connectivity, emphasizing the need for sustainable management practices to ensure the long-term viability of avocado production systems and overall ecosystem functioning."

Here, we assess the HIDF over India during the period 1961–2023, and show that there exists a systematic East–West asymmetry in their characteristics over northern India. Specifically, we show that a substantial increase (decrease) in HIDF exists over major cities in the western (eastern) parts of North India. For example, Ahmedabad (a city in the western part) shows a 67.5% increase in the likelihood of four-day heatwaves in the recent decades (1991–2023) compared to the reference period 1961–1990. On the other hand, in the city of Patna (in the eastern part), we notice a 78% decrease in the likelihood of four-day heatwaves in the recent decades. Furthermore, we show that the East–West asymmetry in the HIDF is caused by a major climatic mode, i.e. the Atlantic Niño.

The 2022 global energy crisis raises questions about how the war affects the energy transition and global climate policy. However, there are limited studies that incorporate its effects into self-consistent projections of alternative scenarios. This scenario study uses two leading macro-economic models and one integrated assessment model to assess how the war in Ukraine and its direct implications—trade restrictions and rising energy prices—affect economies, energy supply and demand trends, emissions and the feasibility of climate policies. The models consistently project that the disruptive responses to the war lead to a shift from fossil fuels (notably natural gas) to renewable energy and a consequent CO2 emission reduction of about 1%–5%, in the period up to 2050, both for the European Union and globally. However, projections differ across models in terms of sectoral and regional contributions to emission reductions. The results are found to be highly sensitive to the expected, yet uncertain persistence of higher fossil energy prices due to the war, which depends on the duration of the conflict, the disruption of global energy supplies and the response of other major fossil fuel exporters."

Here, we present the most comprehensive meta-analysis to date (1976–2023) of human impacts on the regenerating tree community (i.e. seedlings, saplings, and juveniles) across tropical rainforests. We examined the response of woody plant (i.e. trees, shrubs and palms) community patterns (e.g. species diversity) and processes (e.g. individual growth and survival) to four major human disturbances: fire, defaunation, logging, and exotic/invasive species. We gathered 773 disturbed vs. non-disturbed comparisons from 99 studies. Exotic/invasive species and fire showed strong negative impacts on the regenerating plant community, causing a decrease in species richness, diversity and abundance in more disturbed areas. Such impacts were especially detrimental to old-growth forest species, which are usually rare and more prone to local extirpation. Time since the last fire had a negative impact on the early phases of the regenerating community recovery. Conversely, most response variables increased in defaunated and logged forests, as these disturbances (e.g. loss of herbivores) increased plant performance. Yet, the loss of seed dispersers seems to have weak effects on most responses. Interestingly, reduced-impact logging activities show effects similar to those of conventional and selective logging. Overall, our results revealed that human disturbances threaten the abundance and diversity of regenerating tropical trees, but tree performance and productivity variables may be favored by some human activities. Although further research is needed to fill persisting knowledge gaps, our findings have valuable ecological and applied implications that can guide urgently needed conservation and restoration strategies aimed at mitigating the impact of human disturbances on forest regeneration."

This synthetic review examines historical and archaeological studies on climate resilience especially concentrating on human societies in the past 5000 years. It highlights that human societies have had a degree of general resilience to climate and environmental stresses over various spatial and temporal scales, which is reflected through the evidence of population growth, agriculture development, settlement expansion and continuing social-economic development in hazard-prone conditions. Many of the cases considered here demonstrate that climate resilience manifests as a profile of resilience loop and scale relationships in different social systems. Multiple and diverse measures have been identified as being helpful in enhancing the resilience level of various social systems, e.g. improvement of infrastructure, knowledge and technology development, and the strengthening of social organization and cooperation. This review emphasizes the necessity and priority of deepening our understanding of long-term resilience dynamics, and it calls for holistic studies in the field of climate resiliology, particularly targeting to effective and efficient resilience measures as well as their transference across time and space."

 Water-soluble components significantly contribute to the oxidative potential (OP) of atmospheric fine particles (PM2.5), but our understanding of the water-soluble PM2.5 OP and its sources, as well as its relationship with water-soluble components, is still limited. In this study, the water-soluble OP levels in wintertime PM2.5 in the south and north of Beijing, representing the difference in sources, were measured with the dithiothreitol (DTT) assay. The volume-normalized DTT (DTTv) in the north (3.5±1.2 nmol min−1 m−3) was comparable to that in the south (3.9±0.9 nmol min−1 m−3), while the mass-normalized DTT (DTTm) in the north (65±28 pmol min−1 µg−3) was almost twice that in the south (36±14 pmol min−1 µg−3).

However, in the south, DTTv was mainly related to soluble As, Fe and Pb. The sources of DTTv were further resolved using the positive matrix factorization (PMF) model. Traffic-related emissions (39 %) and biomass burning (25 %) were the main sources of DTTv in the south, and traffic-related emissions (>50 %) contributed the most to DTTv in the north.

 This work concerns analysis of turbulence in the atmospheric boundary layer (ABL) shortly before and after sunset. Based on a large set of Doppler  lidar measurements at rural and urban sites, we analyze frequency spectra of vertical wind  at different heights and show that they increasingly deviate from Kolmogorov's -5/3 prediction in the measured low-wavenumber part of the inertial range. We find that before sunset, the integral length scales tend to decrease with time. These findings  contrast with a classical model of  equilibrium decay of isotropic turbulence, which predicts that the scaling exponent should remain constant and equal to -5/3 and the integral length scale should increase in time. We explain the observations using  recent theories of non-equilibrium turbulence. The presence of non-equilibrium  suggests that classical parametrization schemes  fail to predict turbulence statistics shortly before sunset. By comparing the classical and the non-equilibrium models, we conclude that the former may underestimate the dissipation rate of turbulence kinetic energy in the initial stages of decay."

Oxygen data obtained by means of oxygen sensors on autonomous Argo floats were compared with reference data based on the chemical analysis, and estimates of the residual offsets were obtained. 
 Global ocean oxygen concentrations have declined in the past decades, posing threats to marine life and human society. High-quality and bias-free observations are crucial to understanding ocean oxygen changes and assessing their impact. Here, we propose a new automated quality control (QC) procedure for ocean profile oxygen data. This procedure consists of a suite of 10 quality checks, with outlier rejection thresholds being defined based on underlying statistics of the data. The procedure is applied to three main instrumentation types: bottle casts, CTD (conductivity–temperature–depth) casts, and Argo profiling floats. Application of the quality control procedure to several manually quality-controlled datasets of good quality suggests the ability of the scheme to successfully identify outliers in the data. Collocated quality-controlled oxygen profiles obtained by means of the Winkler titration method are used as unbiased references to estimate possible residual biases in the oxygen sensor data. The residual bias is found to be negligible for electrochemical sensors typically used on CTD casts. We explain this as the consequence of adjusting to the concurrent sample Winkler data. Our analysis finds a prevailing negative residual bias with the magnitude of several µmol kg−1 for the delayed-mode quality-controlled and adjusted profiles from Argo floats varying among the data subsets adjusted by different Argo Data Assembly Centers (DACs). The respective overall DAC- and sensor-specific corrections are suggested. We also find the bias dependence on pressure, a feature common to both AANDERAA optodes and SBE43-series sensors.

Parsons,Seabed Seismographs Reveal Duration and Structure of Longest Runout Sediment Flows on Earth,"Turbidity currents carve the deepest canyons on Earth, deposit its largest sediment accumulations, and break seabed telecommunication cables. Powerful canyon‐flushing turbidity currents break sensors placed in their path, making them notoriously challenging to measure, and thus poorly understood. This study provides the first remote measurements of canyon‐flushing flows, using ocean‐bottom seismographs located outside the flow's destructive path, revolutionizing flow monitoring. We recorded the internal dynamics of the longest sediment flows yet monitored on Earth, which traveled >1,000 km down the Congo Canyon‐Channel at 3.7–7.6 m s−1 and lasted >3 weeks. These observations allow us to test fundamental models for turbidity current behavior and reveal that flows contain dense and fast frontal‐zones up to ∼400 km in length. These frontal‐zones developed near‐uniform durations and speeds for hundreds of kilometres despite substantial seabed erosion, enabling flows to rapidly transport prodigious volumes of organic carbon, sediment, and warm water to the deep‐sea."

This study demonstrates that the distance to the ground z is relevant in constraining Lmt ${L}_{mt}$ in weakly stable conditions (0<ζ<0.6 $0<  \zeta <  0.6$, where ζ $\zeta $ is the stability parameter) and less relevant in moderately stable conditions (0.6<ζ<2.0 $0.6<  \zeta <  2.0$). The widely used Ozmidov scale, however, fails to represent Lmt ${L}_{mt}$ in moderately stable conditions. The low‐wavenumber ends of the −5/3 scaling law regions in the spanwise and vertical velocity spectra correlate better with a shear‐related length scale. Based on the characteristics of velocity spectra and the balance between kinetic energy and potential energy, a new length scale is proposed to indicate Lmt ${L}_{mt}$ for moderately stable conditions. Observational data show that this new length scale effectively characterizes Lmt ${L}_{mt}$ in moderately stable conditions.

Turbulent mixing is characterized by tidal excursion parameter (Te) and topographic steepness parameter (Sp) measuring tidal current strength and seafloor slope gradient, respectively. Under strong tidal currents (Te > 1), high‐wavenumber internal lee waves propagate upward from the seafloor. Even when Te and Sp are set to produce nearly the same upward energy flux, the vertical profile of mixing hotspots varies with Sp. For Sp ≳ $\mathit{\gtrsim }$ 0.2, near‐inertial currents above the seafloor rapidly amplify by absorbing energy of internal lee waves from below, hindering their upward propagation and creating “short mixing hotspots.” For Sp < 0.2, these near‐inertial currents diminish, allowing internal lee waves to propagate upward and interact with the GM background internal waves, creating “tall mixing hotspots.”"

To test this method, two 2D aquifer models are designed to simulate the synthetic common‐receiver SE gather, followed by the application of exploding‐reflector migration. The result shows that the aquifer interface is well imaged by the SE waves. Additionally, laboratory experiments successfully recovering the interfaces of the rocks confirm the validity of the SE imaging method, suggesting its feasible use in real groundwater exploration in the future."

However, available forcing data sets remain highly uncertain and can introduce additional differences in LSM simulations. This study explored the impact of various forcing data sets, ranging from widely used to newly developed, on hydrological simulations using the Common Land Model 2024 (CoLM2024). We conducted 12 global experiments using different forcing data sets to force CoLM2024. We evaluated the model's performance against plot‐scale observations and globally gridded reference data. We examined the uncertainties in forcings and their impact on output variables such as latent heat, sensible heat, net radiation, and total runoff. Globally, precipitation has the highest degree of uncertainty at 4.4%. The forcing uncertainties propagate to the model simulations and cause significant differences in simulated variables. Runoff uncertainty is about 15.7% globally, with a greater impact in low latitudes. Our evaluation shows that the newly developed data sets, such as CRUJRA and ERA5LAND, generally outperform the others. However, the optimal forcing data set varies depending on the variable of interest and the targeted region. Partial Least Squares Regression analysis reveals that different simulated variables are associated with dominant forcing variables, highlighting the importance of selecting forcing data sets for specific applications and regions. This study confirms the importance of improving the quality and consistency of meteorological data. This would help reduce simulation biases and guide the improvement of the model structure and parameterization of CoLM2024."

Kilometer‐scale convection‐permitting climate models (CPMs) represent convective precipitation and complex terrain more realistically than other climate models, thereby enhancing the representation of sub‐daily extremes. This study employs a novel statistical approach to evaluate projected changes in extreme sub‐daily precipitation and provides a physical interpretation of their driving processes. It focuses on the complex‐topography area of northern Italy, where resides almost half of the Italian population and a significant portion of the Italian economy, with a rich diversity in industry, agriculture, tourism. We use precipitation data from a CPMs ensemble covering three periods: historical (1996–2005), near future (2041–2050), far future (2090–2099) under the RCP8.5 scenario. Sub‐daily to daily precipitation extremes with return periods up to 100 years are examined. We find a general intensification of extremes across all durations (from 1 to 24 hr), stronger at shorter durations and rarer probabilities. Spatial patterns vary with duration, with higher and significant increases emerging in mountainous areas in Eastern Alps and North Apennines. The detected changes cannot be explained by thermodynamics alone, highlighting the modulating role of the changes in atmospheric dynamics. These findings are crucial for enhancing risk management strategies and adapting to natural hazards in a warming climate. This approach may be exploited in larger scale analysis."

However, this view fails to explain the observation of the low free‐living BNF rates in these sites. Here, we conducted two field experiments and a global synthesis to assess the regulatory patterns of free‐living BNF at both regional and global scales. The field experiments showed that the regional distributions of litter free‐living BNF did not necessarily peak at warm and wet sites, due to co‐regulation by climate and substrate stoichiometry (especially carbon:(nitrogen:phosphorus)). Subsequently, the global synthesis demonstrated that these phenomena and co‐regulatory patterns persisted in free‐living BNF in litter and other substrates (e.g., soil) at global scale. Our findings highlight the important role of substrate stoichiometry in regulating the spatial distribution of free‐living BNF."

 The dynamic alteration of the tumor microenvironment (TME) serves as a driving force behind the progression and metastasis of colorectal cancer (CRC). Within the intricate TME, a pivotal player is the extracellular matrix (ECM), where modifications in components, degradation, and stiffness are considered critical factors in tumor development. In this study, we find that the membrane glycoprotein dysadherin directly targets matrix metalloprotease 9 (MMP9), initiating ECM remodeling within the TME and amplifying cancer progression. Mechanistically, the dysadherin/MMP9 axis not only enhances CRC cell invasiveness and ECM proteolytic activity but also activates cancer-associated fibroblasts, orchestrating the restructuring of the ECM through the synthesis of its components in human CRC cells, patient samples, and mouse models. Notably, disruption of ECM reorganization by dysadherin knockout results in a discernible reduction in the immunosuppressive and proangiogenic milieu in a humanized mouse model. Intriguingly, these effects are reversed upon the overexpression of MMP9, highlighting the intricate and pivotal role of the dysadherin/MMP9 axis in shaping the development of a malignant TME. Therefore, our findings not only highlight that dysadherin contributes to CRC progression by influencing the TME through ECM remodeling but also suggest that dysadherin may be a potential therapeutic target for CRC.

 Transcranial brain stimulation is a promising technology for safe modulation of brain function without invasive procedures. Recent advances in transcranial optogenetic techniques with external light sources, using upconversion particles and highly sensitive opsins, have shown promise for precise neuromodulation with improved spatial resolution in deeper brain regions.

 Using remote sensing to measure suspended sediment concentration (SSC) in mountainous rivers can compensate for the scarcity of in situ sediment observations, providing valuable direct supplementation to observational records. However, for inland rivers, remote sensing SSC assessments face challenges such as data quality, long-term water body changes, environmental noise, flood events, and the transferability of local calibrations. Here, we introduce and apply remote sensing big data techniques using 12,445 cloud-free Landsat 5, 7, and 8 satellite images to calibrate SSC in the source region of the Yangtze River (SRYR). Utilizing Google Earth Engine, we implemented a series of image preprocessing techniques and water fraction methods to extract precise inland river water masks. Then we used unsupervised K-Means clustering and machine learning algorithms to model the relationship between water optical properties and SSC. By integrating these methodologies, we achieved an average relative calibration error of 0.26 for each optical cluster, and an average relative station deviation of 0.24 based on in situ measurements, minimizing SSC calibration to acceptable levels. Additionally, our results reveal that geomorphic patterns significantly influence sediment yield and transport by regulating sediment sources and sinks, fluvial morphology, and water-sediment connectivity. Over the past two decades, approximately 35.73 % of the sediment relative to the basin outlet discharge in the SRYR has been temporarily stored or confined within sediment sinks.

 Inland freshwaters are essential in maintaining ecological balance and supporting human development. However, comprehensive water data cataloguing remains insufficient, especially for small water bodies (i.e., ponds), which are overlooked despite their ecological importance. To address this gap, remote sensing has emerged as a possible solution for understanding ecohydrological characteristics of water bodies, particularly in water-stressed areas. Here, we propose a novel framework based on a Sentinel-1&2 local surface water (SLSW) model targeting very small (<0.5 ha, Mdn ≈ 0.031 ha) and seasonal water bodies. We tested this framework in three semiarid regions in SW Iberia, subjected to distinct seasonality and bioclimatic changes. Surface water attributes, including surface water occurrence and extent, were modelled using a Random Forests classifier, and SLSW time series forecasts were generated from 2020 to 2021. Model reliability was first verified through comparative data completeness analyses with the established Landsat-based global surface water (LGSW) model, considering both intra-annual and inter-annual variations. Further, the performance of the SLSW and LGSW models was compared by examining their correlations for specific periods (dry and wet seasons) and against a validation dataset. The SLSW model demonstrated satisfactory results in detecting surface water occurrence (μ ≈ 72 %), and provided far greater completeness and reconstructed seasonality patterns than the LGSW model. Additionally, SLSW model exhibited a stronger correlation with LGSW during wet seasons (R2 = 0.38) than dry seasons (R2 = 0.05), and aligned more closely with the validation dataset (R2 = 0.66) compared to the LGSW model (R2 = 0.24). These findings underscore the SLSW model’s potential to effectively capture surface characteristics of very small and seasonal water bodies, which are challenging to map over broad regions and often beyond the capabilities of conventional global products. Also, given the vulnerability of water resources in semiarid regions to climate fluctuations, the present framework offers advantages for the local reconstruction of continuous, high-resolution time series, useful for identifying surface water trends and anomalies. This information has the potential to better guide regional water management and policy in support of Sustainable Development Goals, focusing on ecosystem resilience and water sustainability."

 The phenological characteristics of vegetation exposed to oil pollution can reveal how different vegetation types and species respond to the effects of hydrocarbons in crude oil. This can further inform the recovery status and remediation efforts on polluted sites. In this study, the potential of various SAR frequencies (including multitemporal C band Sentinel-1, X band Cosmo Skymed, X band TanDEM-X, and L band ALOS PALSAR 2) were explored to analyse the characteristics of vegetation affected by hydrocarbons over time. The SAR backscatter characteristics of both oil-polluted and oil-free vegetation were systematically examined across different seasons to deduce the primary effects of oil pollution. Additionally, machine learning random forest (RF) classification and support vector machines (SVM) were implemented on seasonal image composites to assess spatial extent. Results show that stress caused by oil pollution on vegetation is better distinguishable during the wet season in the VV channel than in the VH channel of the multitemporal Sentinel 1. This was supported by the machine learning classification, as overall accuracy (OA) and Kappa (K) were also highest with the wet season SAR image composites. A further incorporation of L- and X-Band multifrequency SAR across the two seasons showed that the wet season composites significantly improved the classification accuracy, with Cropland, Grassland and Tree Cover Area (TCA) recording an increase in OA and K, to 82.3 % and 0.64, 66.67 % and 0.33, and 74.7 % and 0.49, respectively.

 This study aimed to create a model to identify land suitable for growing sunn hemp (Crotalaria juncea) and pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan) in the Okavango River basin of the Kavango East region of Namibia. Advanced tree-based ensemble learning models, including Random Forest, Extra Trees, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost and multivariate regression analysis , were employed to enhance analytical accuracy. The Random Forest and XGboost models exhibited outstanding performance, as evidenced by their respective accuracy values of 0.97 and 0.96. In addition, this study proposed an innovative approach through the integration of subjective and objective analytical methods, which are independent of one another. The subjective component of the analysis employed a Multi-Criteria Decision Making-Analytic Hierarchy Process (MCDM-AHP). On the other hand, the objective component used a data-driven multivariate approach supported by tree-based learning algorithms. Twenty-two variables were considered, encompassing climatic conditions, hydro-geomorphologic features, soil characteristics, vegetation patterns, and socio-economic factors. These variables played a crucial role to identify the most suitable areas for growing the selected leguminous crops. The MCDM-AHP method utilised expert evaluations to rank the importance of variables, identifying water sources, slope, and soil properties as key factors. A suitability mapping analysis revealed that 17.63% of the area was highly suitable and 62.77% moderately suitable, while 10% was less suitable and 9.59% unsuitable for growing these two legumes. According to the data driven methodology, soil fertility and nitrogen content emerged as key determinants for land suitability. This is particularly relevant for nitrogen-fixing leguminous crops such as sunn hemp and pigeon pea, which play a central role in improving soil quality and ensuring food security."

We explored the spatial distribution characteristics of safety perception differences using the Gradient Boosting Decision Tree model and spatial autocorrelation analysis. Additionally, we examined the impact of visual elements on gender differences through ridge regression analysis. Given the unsteady spatial distribution of urban environmental data and safety perceptions, we employed multi-scale geographically weighted regression models to account for differential distributions.

 Understanding the characteristics of the growth zones of live corals and competitive algae, including turf algae and macroalgae, is crucial for assessing the degradation of coral reef ecosystems. However, identifying live corals and competitive algae in multispectral satellite images is challenging because different objects can have similar spectra. To address this, we used two satellite images acquired at different times (Landsat thematic mapper (TM), Landsat operational land imager (OLI), or Sentinel-2 multi-spectral instrument (MSI)) to assess the growth zone characteristics of live corals and competitive algae. This assessment leveraged the seasonal dieback of competitive algae and the relative stability of live-coral growth zones over a short period. Specifically, we developed a normalized red–green difference index (NRGI) to segment live-coral-or-competitive-alga growth zones in satellite images. By comparing the segmentation results from an image captured during a period with few competitive algae and another image captured during a period with lush competitive algae, we estimated the growth zone areas of the live corals and competitive algae. Finally, we calculated the ratio of the competitive-alga growth zone area to the live-coral growth zone area (RCL). Experiments on eight typical coral islands and reefs in the South China Sea (SCS) from 1995 to 2022 revealed that: (1) the identification accuracies of live-coral-or-competitive-alga growth zones reached 80.3 % and 92.6 % during periods with few competitive algae (January to March) and lush competitive algae (April to October), respectively; (2) the RCL was well correlated with the coral-macroalgae encounter rate (an ecological index indicating the pressure of the competitive algae on the live corals) (r = 0.79, P<0.05); and (3) the trends in the growth zones of competitive algae and live corals, along with the RCL, were consistent with major ecological events in the SCS, such as coral bleaching, outbreak of Acanthaster planci, and black band disease. (4) Moreover, a time-lagged correlation was observed between heat stress and the RCL. In summary, the proposed approach is simple, effective, and feasible. The RCL is a valuable indicator of the status of coral reef ecosystems, highlighting the pressure of competitive algae on live corals and the degradation of coral reef ecosystems. This method introduces a novel application of multispectral satellite images for assessing coral reef ecosystems and has significant potential for future coral reef ecosystem monitoring."

 There is a need to help farmers make decisions to maximize crop yields. Many studies have emerged in recent years using deep learning on remotely sensed images to detect plant diseases, which can be caused by multiple factors such as environmental conditions, genetics or pathogens. This problem can be considered as an anomaly detection task. However, these approaches are often limited by the availability of annotated data or prior knowledge of the existence of an anomaly. In many cases, it is not possible to obtain this information.

To overcome this, our study proposes a progressive feature screening and fusion method using multi-temporal SAR images. We introduce fuzzy coarse screening based on statistical distribution characteristics and refine it with Gaussian fitting. A model incorporating time-series sample separation and polarization decomposition feature fusion based on rice growth height enhances rice growth expression. For more precise results, we advocate a multi-temporal feature fusion approach using optimized sample features in the BiLSTM network to characterize rice growth and ground features. Experimental results demonstrate the method’s efficacy in two cities with a limited number of sampling points.

In particular, methods imposing an RH restriction along the air parcel trajectories to filter out noise in moisture losses outperform the others, providing more reliable moisture source contributions. We also introduced a simple bias correction approach that further improves the reliability of moisture source representation."

Martín,Effect of complex orography on numerical simulations of a downburst event in Spain,"•The role of complex orography was evaluated in a downburst event at Zaragoza Airport on July 1, 2018. •Reduced orographic complexity increases MUCAPE and uniform wind flow, promoting supercell formation. •Moisture from the Mediterranean deeply penetrates the region in smoothed orography, affecting downburst formation by reducing orographic barriers. 
 A downburst is a localized and intense downdraft of air that descends quickly from the middle troposphere and reaches the Earth's surface. It is frequently originated by a thunderstorm or a supercell. Downburst winds can cause significant damage to buildings, infrastructure, and pose a great threat to aviation traffic. On July 1, 2018, many supercells were spotted near the Zaragoza Airport (Spain), and at least one of them generated a downburst that affected the airport, causing significant damage in the surrounding area. This event is here simulated using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF-ARW) numerical weather prediction model. Three different WRF-ARW orography experiments are carried out to investigate if the region's complex orography has an important role in supercell and downburst development over the research area. One of the three experiments uses the default orography as control; another one uses a 90 % smoothed orography, and the third experiment is configured with a high-resolution dataset. Several atmospheric and convective variables are compared for each orography experiment. Results show that MUCAPE is clearly higher when the orography complexity is reduced. The smoothing process leads to a more uniform wind flow, contributing to the formation of numerous supercells. However, supercells channel through valleys and mountains in the control and high-resolution orography experiments, where the surface wind divergences are uniquely reproduced, and the highest reflectivity values are observed. Moisture advection from the Mediterranean Sea is essential in the process, reaching more deeply into the study region in the smoothed orography experiment due to the lack of orographic barriers. Orography affects dynamic and thermodynamic features, which have considerable effects on the formation and development of downbursts."

 Characterizing and understanding the evolving water cycle in the Three-River Headwaters (TRH) region of the Tibetan Plateau, where data scarcity poses significant challenges to climate and atmospheric water cycle research, heavily depends on model simulations. However, advanced global climate models and reanalysis datasets frequently overestimate precipitation. To address this, we employ high-resolution (9 km) regional climate simulations (WRF9km) to examine atmospheric water cycle variables in the TRH region, comparing them with in-situ observations and ERA5 reanalysis. Our study demonstrates that WRF9km substantially reduces the overestimation of summer precipitation (by 24.0 %) and evapotranspiration (by 52.7 %) compared to ERA5, thereby improving its alignment with observational data. The reduced biases in precipitation are attributed to diminished moisture influx from the southern boundary and local evapotranspiration, coupled with increased moisture export from the eastern boundary. Summer precipitation recycling (PR) accounts for approximately 20 % of total precipitation in the TRH region. Despite divergent trends in PR between a water accounting model (WAM) and a bulk method, our findings support the reliability of WAM, indicating a slight decrease in summer PR (−0.4 %/10a for ERA5 and − 0.6 %/10a for WRF9km). While WRF9km accurately captures the spatial pattern of summer PR, ERA5 appears to overestimate it, likely due to biases in evapotranspiration and moisture inflow. In conclusion, WRF9km provides a more accurate representation of the atmospheric water cycle in the TRH region."

Here, we developed a sustainable and environmentally adaptable adsorbent through supramolecular self-assembly of chitin and cellulose. This biomass fibrous framework (Ct-Cel) showcases an excellent adsorption performance for polystyrene, polymethyl methacrylate, polypropylene, and polyethylene terephthalate. The affinity for diverse microplastics is attributed to the transformation of multiple intermolecular interactions between different microplastics and Ct-Cel. Meanwhile, the strong resistance of Ct-Cel to multiple pollutants in water enables an enhanced adsorption when coexisting with microorganisms and Pb2+. Moreover, Ct-Cel can remove 98.0 to 99.9% of microplastics in four types of real water and maintains a high removal efficiency of up to 95.1 to 98.1% after five adsorption cycles.

Here, we show in male and female mice that enhancing levels of the eCB, 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG), through pharmacological inhibition of its catabolic enzyme, monoacylglycerol lipase (MAGL), either systemically or in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) with JZL184, leads to a substantial attenuation of the rewarding effects of opioids in mice using conditioned place preference and self-administration paradigms, without altering their analgesic properties. These effects are driven by cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) within the VTA, as VTA CB1R conditional knockout counteracts JZL184’s effects. Using fiber photometry with fluorescent sensors for calcium and dopamine (DA), we find that enhancing 2-AG levels diminishes opioid reward–related nucleus accumbens (NAc) activity and DA neurotransmission.

Biochemical data indicate that FER phosphorylates CC1 on multiple residues in its second and third hydrophobic microtubule-binding regions and that these phosphorylations modulate CC1 trafficking and affect the ability of CC1 to engage with microtubules.

Dense laths composed of the multiscaled LCO domains evolve from planar-slip bands that form in the prior thermomechanical processing, contributing to ultrahigh yield strengths over a wide temperature range. During cryogenic tensile deformation, LCO further develops and promotes remarkable dislocation cross-slip.

A key effector of these changes is exaggerated airway smooth muscle (ASM) cell contraction to spasmogens. No drugs in clinical use effectively prevent ASM hyperresponsiveness in asthma across all severities. We find that N-cadherin, a membrane cell-cell adhesion protein up-regulated in ASM from patients with severe asthma, is required for the development of airway obstruction induced by allergic airway inflammation in mice. Inhibition of N-cadherin by ADH-1 reduced airway hyperresponsiveness independent of allergic inflammation, prevented bronchoconstriction, and actively promoted bronchodilation of airways ex vivo. ADH-1 inhibited ASM contraction by disrupting N-cadherin–δ-catenin interactions, which decreased intracellular actin remodeling.

When one end of an actively reptative polymer is anchored, it undergoes continual self-knotting as a result of intermittent giant conformation fluctuations and the outward reptative motion. Once a knot is formed, it migrates to the anchoring point due to a nonequilibrium ratchet effect. Moreover, when the active polymer is grafted on a passive polymer, it can function as a self-propelling soft needle to either transfer its own knots or directly braid knots on the passive polymer.

For example, surface phonon modes in quantum paraelectrics are thought to be essential in facilitating interfacial superconductivity. However, detecting these modes, especially below 1 terahertz, is challenging because of limited sampling volumes and the need for high spectroscopic resolution. Here, we report surface soft transverse optical (TO1) phonon dynamics in KTaO3and SrTiO3by surface-sensitive spintronic terahertz spectroscopy that can sense the collective modes only a few nanometers deep from the surface. In KTaO3, the TO1 mode softens and sharpens with decreasing temperature, leveling off at 0.7 terahertz. In contrast, this mode in SrTiO3broadens substantially below the quantum paraelectric crossover and coincides with the hardening of a sub–milli–electron volt phonon mode related to the antiferrodistortive transition. These observations that deviate from their bulk properties may have implications for interfacial superconductivity and ferroelectricity.

The article claims that land abandonment was driven by mismanagement of irrigation through neoliberal economic policies before the 2006–10 Syrian drought and that agriculture quickly recovered after the drought. We use inferential statistics to test the authors’ claims. We find that before the drought, land abandonment occurred in areas with more rain-fed agriculture and was associated with population growth in sub-districts with more urban land cover. This finding suggests that pre-drought land abandonment was driven by increased urban development, rather than water mismanagement and irrigation policy reform. After drought onset, we find climatic stress caused first-year land abandonment, consistent with the authors’ claims. We also find third-year land abandonment is associated with population decline through 2010, going against the claim of a quick recovery. Our evidence suggests that the drought interrupted a long-term trend of decreasing agricultural use related to local urban expansion, bringing about a new trend of agricultural abandonment as a result of climate-induced out-migration. We find no evidence that land abandonment is associated with neoliberal policy reforms, or that there was a recovery when the drought ended."

By using a global atmospheric model and reanalysis data, it is found that the stratospheric QBO winds can affect the mesospheric diurnal tides by modulating the subtropical ozone variability in the upper stratosphere and the interaction between tides and gravity waves in the mesosphere. 
 A quasi-biennial oscillation (QBO) disruption is a very rare phenomenon in which QBO westward wind is temporarily interrupted by the occurrence of a band of westward wind in the tropical stratosphere. This phenomenon is important as it could greatly affect the global atmospheric circulation, especially in the mesosphere. Past observational and modelling studies have shown the QBO varying mesospheric diurnal tide, but the mechanism is still not fully understood. In this study, we report on the strong response of mesospheric diurnal tides to the two QBO disruptions that occurred in 2015–2016 and 2019–2020 and their possible mechanisms. The diurnal tidal winds are observed by a meteor radar chain, consisting of meteor radars located at Kunming (25.6° N, 103.8° E), Wuhan (30.5° N, 114.2° E), Mengcheng (33.4° N, 116.5° E), Beijing (40.3° N, 116.2° E), and Mohe (53.5° N, 122.3° E) in China. These observations provide clear evidence that mesospheric diurnal tides are unusually weakened (by ∼ −6 m s−1) during these QBO disruptions, over Kunming, Wuhan, Mengcheng, and Beijing. Using the Specific Dynamics version of the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere extension (SD-WACCM-X) and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset, the analysis indicates that the QBO wind affects mid-latitude mesospheric diurnal tides by modulating both the solar radiative absorption by subtropical stratospheric ozone (∼ 5 to 0.5 hPa) and the tidal–gravity wave interaction in the mesosphere (∼ 60 to 100 km). Thus, these unexpected QBO disruptions provide an opportunity to better understand the coupling between climate change and middle-atmospheric dynamics."

However, a major limitation is the computational expense. We have developed a method using artificial neural networks to emulate the influence of 3D Earth models to affordably constrain the viscosity parameter space. Our results indicate that the misfits are of a scale such that useful predictions of relative sea level can be made. 
 Models of glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) play a central role in the interpretation of various geologic and geodetic data to understand and simulate past and future changes in ice sheets and sea level, as well as to infer rheological properties of the deep Earth. During the past few decades, a major advance has been the development of models that include 3D Earth structure, as opposed to 1D spherically symmetric (SS) structure. However, a major limitation in employing 3D GIA models is their high computational expense. As such, we have developed a method using artificial neural networks (ANNs) and the Tensorflow library to predict the influence of 3D Earth models with the goal of more affordably exploring the parameter space of these models, specifically the radial (1D) viscosity profile to which the lateral variations are added.Our goal is to test whether the use of an ANN to produce a fast surrogate model can accurately predict the difference in GIA model outputs (i.e., relative sea level (RSL) and uplift rates) for the 3D case relative to the SS case. If so, the surrogate model can be used with a computationally efficient SS (Earth) GIA model to generate output that replicates that from a 3D (Earth) GIA model. Evaluation of the surrogate model performance for deglacial RSL indicates that it is able to provide useful estimates of this field throughout the parameter space when trained on only ≈15 % (≈50) of the parameter vectors considered (330 in total).We applied the surrogate model in a model–data comparison exercise using RSL data distributed along the North American coasts from the Canadian Arctic to the US Gulf Coast. We found that the surrogate model is able to successfully reproduce the model–data misfit values such that the region of minimum misfit either generally overlaps the 3D GIA model results or is within two increments of the radial viscosity model parameter space (defined here as lithosphere thickness, upper-mantle viscosity, and lower-mantle viscosity). The surrogate model can, therefore, be used to accurately explore this aspect of the 3D Earth model parameter space. In summary, this work demonstrates the utility of machine learning in 3D Earth GIA modelling, and so future work to expand on this initial proof-of-concept analysis is warranted."

However, the scalable preparation of carbon electrocatalysts to achieve satisfactory H2O2 yield in acidic media remains a grand challenge. Here, we present the design of a carbon nanoreactor series that integrates precise O/N codoping alongside well-regulated geometric structures targeting high-efficiency electrosynthesis of H2O2. Theoretical computations reveal that strategic N/O codoping facilitates partial electron transfer from C sites to O sites, realizing electronic rearrangement that optimizes C-site adsorption of *OOH. Concurrently, the O–O bond in *OOH is strengthened by charge transfer from antibonding to π-orbitals, stabilizing the O–O bond and preventing its dissociation. The carbon nanoreactor with a hollow bowl geometry also facilitates the mass transport of O2 and H2O2, achieving an H2O2 selectivity of 96% in acidic media. Furthermore, a flow cell integrated with the refined nanoreactor catalyst achieves an impressive H2O2 production rate of 2942.4 mg L–1 h–1, coupled with stable operation of nearly 80 h, surpassing the state-of-the-art metal-free analogs.

Physics‐based models predict the average relationship between bankfull geometry and discharge to within an order of magnitude, however, observed variability about the prediction remains unaccounted for. We used high‐resolution topography to extract continuous measurements of bankfull width from 67 sites spanning the continental United States, yielding a reach‐scale probabilistic description of river width for each site. Within an individual reach, bankfull river width is well‐described by a lognormal distribution. Rivers that spend a greater proportion of time above bankfull are wider for the same bankfull discharge, revealing an unrecognized pathway through which climatic or engineered changes in flow frequency could alter river geometry and therefore impact aquatic habitat and flooding risk."

Using daily outputs from the Paleoclimate Modeling Intercomparison Project, we illustrate a decrease in extreme precipitation intensity over the global monsoon regions during the LGM relative to preindustrial, accompanied by increased extreme precipitation frequency, although regional differences exist. The weakened extreme precipitation is dominated by the thermodynamics (∼92%) linked to change in temperature, with the dynamic component linked to change in vertical velocity contributing to regional differences. Furthermore, we show a ∼3.6% decrease in extreme precipitation per 1°C cooling during the LGM, lower than the sensitivity (∼5%/°C) in future warming scenarios.

This article tackles the controversial discussion on the mitigation of the post‐injection induced seismicity through ending fluid injection by either a bleed‐off or a shut‐in. Both scenarios failed to mitigate the occurrence of large magnitude earthquake after stopping injection in numerous EGS. The two protocols are compared by using a seismological forecasting methodology coupled with a hydro‐mechanical model reproducing flow, poroelastic stress and fault failure in a domain including a discrete fault network based on Basel EGS (Switzerland, 2006). Unlike bleed‐off, shut‐in mitigates early post‐injection seismicity by smoothly reducing pressure, and consequently poroelastic stress changes in the modelled Basel EGS. Although post‐injection pore pressure diffusion eventually reaches distant faults and destabilizes them, seismicity is not initiated according to our simulation forecasting."

In the initial 3 years, the equatorial SST responses exhibit an opposite sign to the forcings in the northern extratropics but align with those in the southern extratropics. At this stage, heating the northern extratropics is more effective at cooling the equatorial Pacific than cooling the southern extratropics. This occurs because the anomalous warming in the northern extratropics is blocked by the rainband and can only enter the equatorial Pacific from the west, triggering Bjerknes feedback more effectively. Over a decade, all experiments show enhanced equatorial responses aligning with the signs of the forcings. The south‐perturbed cases experience stronger equatorial SST responses, suggesting the significant control of the southern extratropics on tropical Pacific on decadal timescales."

This distribution comprises an elongated component parallel with the magnetic field at lower energies and a butterfly component (with peaks at pitch angles near 45° $45{}^{\circ}$ and 135° $135{}^{\circ}$) at higher energies. We provide evidence that these distributions are partly linked to electron trapping and preferential heating along the direction of magnetic fields.

A uniformly dry SM patch at a 5° × 5° scale is centered at the point of a documented MCS initiation to observe spatiotemporal changes of the simulated MCS events, totaling 97 cases between 2004 and 2017. A storm‐centered composite analysis of SM at the location of simulated MCS events depicted SM heterogeneity [O(100) km] structured as significantly drier soils to the southwest (SW) transitioning to wetter soils northeast (NE) of the mean simulated initiation. Further analyses showed that this SM configuration influenced near‐surface fluxes, which created a gradient of 2m‐temperature and 2m‐humidity, also aligned SW‐to‐NE, which affected the growth of the planetary boundary layer to trigger MCS initiations earlier in time (∼1–2 hr on average) compared to Control simulations. The implementation of the dry SM perturbation introduced drier‐to‐wetter SM gradients along the edges of the perturbed area, and MCS initiations were subsequently preferred on the drier side of those transition zones, with the most common orientation of simulated MCS events embedded within southwesterly flow. These results emphasize the importance of the low‐level wind field alignment to organized SM gradients, which suggests that SM heterogeneity can drive MCS initiation related to near‐surface atmospheric variable fluctuations as the main mechanism of interaction in weakly forced synoptic environments."

All the simulations agreed with the main observed characteristics of this storm, with some discrepancies in magnitude and location, which vary with CP and MP schemes. These discrepancies were larger during the mature phase of the storm. In the CP‐on simulations, the non‐scale aware Kain–Fritsch (KF) scheme typically resulted in higher precipitation, while the Betts‐Miller‐Janjic (BMJ) scheme led to lower precipitation compared to the CP‐off simulations (C0). The tendency of the KF scheme to consume available convective potential energy at a relatively high rate (i.e., short time scale) resulted in high mass fluxes and latent heat release, leading to strengthened convective activity and, hence, precipitation. The multi‐scale aware (MSKF) substantially reduces the precipitation compared to KF due to the reduced contribution of convective scale precipitation. It also modulates the spatial structure precipitation compared to KF, especially light precipitation over the outer bands, and the contribution of grid‐scale precipitation to total precipitation. KF shows the lowest contribution, around 50%, whereas BMJ exhibits a slightly higher contribution, and MSKF versions nearly reach 100%, making it closer to CP‐off. The improved performance in MSKF compared to KF highlights the importance of MSKF convection parameterization for gray zone (~1–4 km) simulation. The persistent discrepancy in landfall location in CP‐on and CP‐off simulation underscored the need of further investigating other physics parameterizations and dynamical mechanisms."

 Even though tuning electronic effect of chiral ligands has proven to be a promising method for designing efficient catalysts, the potential to achieve highly selective reactions by this strategy remains largely unexplored. Here, we report a palladium-catalyzed enantioselective ring-closing aminoalkylative amination of aminoenynes enabled by rationally tuning the remote electronic property of 1,1’-binaphthol-derived phosphoramidites. With a tailored 6,6’-CN-substituted 1,1’-binaphthol-derived phosphoramidite as a ligand, a broad range of aromatic amines are compatible with this reaction, allowing the efficient synthesis of a series of enantioenriched exocyclic allenylamines bearing saturated N-heterocycles with up to >99% enantiomeric excess. Remarkably, a one-pot aminoalkylative amination/hydroamination process for the rapid synthesis of chiral spirodiamines promoted by this catalytic system is also established. Detailed mechanistic studies provide solid evidence to support that the remote electronic character of these chiral ligands can efficiently tuning the enantioselectivity by altering the length of the allylic C-Pd bond of the key catalytic intermediate.

Here, the authors show that loss of OSGEP, an enzyme known to add the t6A modification on tRNA, disrupts proinsulin translation and causes ER stress in β cells. 
 Proinsulin translation and folding is crucial for glucose homeostasis. However, islet β-cell control of Proinsulin translation remains incompletely understood. Here, we identify OSGEP, an enzyme responsible for t6A37 modification of tRNANNU that tunes glucose metabolism in β-cells. Global Osgep deletion causes glucose intolerance, while β-cell-specific deletion induces hyperglycemia and glucose intolerance due to impaired insulin activity. Transcriptomics and proteomics reveal activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR) and apoptosis signaling pathways in Osgep-deficient islets, linked to an increase in misfolded Proinsulin from reduced t6A37 modification. Osgep overexpression in pancreas rescues insulin secretion and mitigates diabetes in high-fat diet mice. Osgep enhances translational fidelity and alleviates UPR signaling, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic target for diabetes. Individuals carrying the C allele at rs74512655, which promotes OSGEP transcription, may show reduced susceptibility to T2DM.

 Synthesizing high-crystalline covalent organic framework films is highly desired to advance their applications in two-dimensional optoelectronics, but it remains a great challenge. Here, we report a diffusion-limited synthesis strategy for wafer-scale uniform covalent organic framework films, in which pre-deposited 4,4′,4″,4‴-(1,3,6,8-Tetrakis(4-aminophenyl) pyrene is encapsulated on substrate surface with a layer of covalent organic framework prepolymer. The polymer not only prevents the dissolution of precursor, but limits the reaction with terephthalaldehyde dissolved in solution, thereby regulating the polymerization process. The size depends on growth substrates, and 4-inch films have been synthesized on silicon chips. Their structure, thickness, patterning and crystallization degree can be controlled by adjusting building blocks and polymerization chemistries, and molybdenum disulfide have been used as substrates to construct vertical heterostructure. The measurements reveal that using covalent organic framework as a photosensitive layer, the heterojunction displays enhanced photoelectric performance, which can be used to simulate the adaptative function of visual system.

In this process, trigger waves gradually replace transient phase waves, with spatial heterogeneities accelerating the transition. 
 Cyclin-dependent kinase 1 (Cdk1) activity rises and falls throughout the cell cycle: a cell-autonomous process called mitotic oscillations. Mitotic oscillators can synchronize when spatially coupled, facilitating rapid, synchronous divisions in large early embryos of Drosophila (~0.5 mm) and Xenopus (~1.2 mm). Diffusion alone cannot achieve such long-range coordination. Instead, studies proposed mitotic waves—phase and trigger waves—as mechanisms of the coordination. How waves establish over time remains unclear. Using Xenopus laevis egg extracts and a Cdk1 Förster resonance energy transfer sensor, we observe a transition from phase to trigger wave dynamics in initially homogeneous cytosol. Spatial heterogeneity promotes this transition. Adding nuclei accelerates entrainment. The system transitions almost immediately when driven by metaphase-arrested extracts. Numerical simulations suggest phase waves appear transiently as trigger waves take time to entrain the system. Therefore, we show that both waves belong to a single biological process capable of coordinating the cell cycle over long distances. Using Xenopus laevis egg extracts and a Cdk1 FRET sensor, the authors demonstrate how rapid cell cycles achieve long-range cytoplasmic synchronization through mitotic waves.

 There is no consensus in society on how to achieve sustainability. Scientists’ limited experience in reflecting on their guiding assumptions, combined with a tendency to inflate their own research findings, hinders interdisciplinary dialogue and limits the usefulness of science. Through bibliometrics and discourse analysis, we analysed highly cited articles on agroecology and sustainable intensification. In broad terms, agroecology prioritizes diversity while sidelining productivity and adheres to relational epistemology, while sustainable intensification emphasizes boosting crop production while reducing environmental impact within a reductionist epistemology. Both discourses claim to have the solution to agricultural sustainability but are largely inexplicit about their guiding assumptions and their own limitations, and rarely engage with research in the other discourse. Interdisciplinary dialogue based on transparent and self-critical reflection on the assumptions and limitations of research could increase the relevance of science in societal dialogues about alternative pathways towards sustainable agriculture.

 Natural climate solutions (NCS) play a critical role in climate change mitigation. NCS can generate win–win co-benefits for biodiversity and human well-being, but they can also involve trade-offs (co-impacts). However, the massive evidence base on NCS co-benefits and possible trade-offs is poorly understood. We employ large language models to assess over 2 million published journal articles, primarily written in English, finding 257,266 relevant studies on NCS co-impacts. Using machine learning methods to extract data (for example, study location, species and other key variables), we create a global evidence map on NCS co-impacts. We find that global evidence on NCS co-impacts has grown approximately tenfold in three decades, and some of the most abundant evidence relates to NCS that have lower mitigation potential. Studies often examine multiple NCS, indicating some natural complementarities. Finally, we identify countries with high carbon mitigation potential but a relatively weak body of evidence on NCS co-impacts. Through effective methods and systematic and representative data on NCS co-impacts, we provide timely insights to inform NCS-related research and action globally.

 Despite its pronounced global impacts, tropical Pacific decadal variability (TPDV) is poorly predicted by current climate models due to model deficiencies and a limited understanding of its underlying mechanisms. Using observational data and a hierarchy of model simulations including decadal hindcasts, we find that decadal isopycnal depth variability driven by oceanic Rossby waves in the tropical Pacific provides the most important source of predictability for TPDV. The predictability arising from initial isopycnal depth conditions is further amplified by tropical ocean-atmosphere coupling and variations in the strength of subtropical cells in the Pacific throughout the decadal forecasts. Regional initialization experiments that effectively isolate the impact of different ocean basins on TPDV predictability highlight the essential role of the tropical Pacific. This study enhances our understanding of the mechanisms governing TPDV predictability, offering crucial insights for improving the accuracy of decadal predictions."

 Photovoltaic (PV) installations have rapidly and extensively been deployed worldwide as a promising alternative renewable energy source. However, weather anomalies could expose them to challenges in supply security by causing very low power production. Using reanalysis weather data from 1986 to 2021 and a high-resolution global inventory of PV installations, we assess the impact of extreme low-production (ELP) events across various regions. Our results reveal that regions between 60°N and 60°S experience an average of 27 ELP events annually, with 17% of these events being high-intensity. Regions with dense PV installations—including Southern China, Central and Northern Europe, Central and Eastern America, and Japan—are particularly affected. These areas, which collectively host approximately half of the global PV installations, see 44% of ELP events being high-intensity. Maintaining a daily backup supply equivalent to the average event intensity could recover 39% to 81% of events across different sites.

 Subduction initiation remains elusive because no present example exists. Ophiolites formed over nascent subduction zones in the past provide the key to constraining the processes of subduction initiation. Here we document three Cambrian ophiolites with supra-subduction zone affinity, which likely reflect the inception of a plate-boundary scale subduction zone within the Paleo-Asian Ocean. Our findings, together with a compilation of Cambrian ophiolites in the Central Asian Orogenic Belt, indicate diachronous subduction initiation(s) along a > 6000 kilometer zone within the Paleo-Asian Ocean between 536 and 528 million years ago. The subduction initiation of the Paleo-Asian Ocean coincides with the closure of the Mirovoi Ocean following the collision of a series of microcontinents with the Siberian craton, likely representing a typical record of collision-induced subduction jump. Our observations and numerical modeling provide a new scenario that subduction initiations would locate at oceanic weak zones rather than passive margins of accreted microcontinents during collision-induced subduction process.

 Plastic pollution transported in rivers remains poorly understood due to the diversity of shapes, sizes, and densities of plastics, as well as their complex interactions with biofilms. While previous studies have explored the settling velocities of plastics and their interactions with biofilms, they often overlook how biofouling alters plastic dynamics and settling behaviour. To address this, over 800 settling experiments were conducted to demonstrate that the dynamics and falling velocities of isotropic (spheres) and anisotropic (square and rectangle plates) macroplastics of different densities (1050 to 2200 kg/m3) are significantly impacted by biofouling. Three-dimensional tracking of plastic trajectories revealed that biofilm colonisation on the surface of anisotropic plastic plates triggered them to exhibit more chaotic trajectories, larger horizontal dispersion and higher oscillatory frequencies. These dynamics reduced the average vertical settling velocity of anisotropic biofouled plates by up to 12%—despite greater plastic densities and considering the multimodal distribution of a plate’s fall velocity—compared to their pristine counterparts. Results highlight the necessity of accounting for the intricate multimodal settling dynamics of plastics, including their interactions with biofilms, to provide more reliable predictions of plastic transport and fate in aquatic environments.

 Macroplastic pollution is a pervasive global environmental challenge, adversely affecting marine ecosystems, wildlife and human health. Understanding temporal variations is crucial for identifying pollution sources and developing effective mitigation policies.

Here we employ a Bayesian machine learning framework to investigate seasonal variations, identify regional hotspots and elucidate their anthropogenic drivers. Using data from 3866 surveys across 168 western European beaches, we leverage a spatial log-Gaussian Cox Process to enhance statistical inference by integrating information from nearby beaches. Distinct seasonal patterns emerge, with winter and spring exhibiting the highest pollution levels, while pronounced regional differences highlight seasonal pollution hotspots in the western Iberian Peninsula, French coastline, Irish Sea and Skagerrak region. These peaks are attributed to riverine emissions and aquaculture activities, highlighting the potential impact of these sources on beach pollution.

 Permafrost thaw in warming Arctic landscapes alters hydrology and saturation-driven biogeochemical processes. Models assume that aerobic respiration occurs in drained soils while saturated soils support methanogenesis; however, saturated soils maintain redox gradients that host a range of anaerobic metabolisms. We evaluated how redox potential and redox-active solutes vary with soil moisture in the active layer of permafrost-affected acidic and non-acidic tundra hillslopes. Oxidizing conditions persisted in highly permeable organic horizons of both unsaturated tussock tundra and saturated wet sedge meadows. Redox potential decreased with depth in all soils as increasing soil bulk density restricted groundwater flow and oxygen diffusion. High concentrations of dissolved iron, phosphate, and organic carbon coincided with redox boundaries below the soil surface in acidic tundra, indicating active iron redox cycling and potential release of adsorbed phosphate during iron (oxyhydr)oxide dissolution. In non-acidic tundra, weatherable minerals affected nutrient dynamics more than redox-driven iron cycling, especially in low-lying, saturated areas where thaw reached mineral soils. The role of thaw depth and the ability of saturated soils to maintain oxidizing conditions in organic surface layers highlight the importance of soil physical properties and hydrology in predicting biogeochemical processes and greenhouse gas emissions.

 Understanding the optical properties of dorsiventral leaves and quantifying leaf biochemical traits through physical models are important for interpreting canopy radiative transfer and monitoring plant growth. Previous models, such as the dorsiventral leaf model (DLM), have effectively accounted for the inner asymmetry of the leaf but neglected the asymmetry of surface structures between the upper and lower epidermis. In this study, we found marked differences in bidirectional reflectance factors (BRF) between the adaxial and abaxial surfaces of leaves under multi-angular measurements due to surface structural distinctions. To address this asymmetry in both internal and surface leaf structures, we subsequently proposed an advanced DLM model (MADLM) for simulating both multi-angular and spectral BRF of two leaf sides, linking the angular reflection of leaf adaxial and abaxial sides to surface structural parameters (roughness and refractive index) based on microfacet theory. Results show that MADLM accurately simulates multi-angular and spectral BRF for both sides of dorsiventral leaves, and yields satisfactory retrieval accuracy of leaf traits from all observation geometries. For close-range hyperspectral imaging applications, we further introduced a simplified version, sMADLM, which characterizes the surface reflection of two leaf sides in terms of the product of a leaf-side dependent parameter and the wavelength-dependent Fresnel factor. The sMADLM improves the mapping accuracy of leaf biochemical traits by effectively reducing the surface reflection effects in dorsiventral leaves. The MADLM and sMADLM deepen our understanding of the optical properties of dorsiventral leaves and provide practical methods for retrieving leaf biochemical traits via optical remote sensing."

Atkinson,Unsupervised object-based spectral unmixing for subpixel mapping,"•An unsupervised object-based subpixel mapping (UO-SPM) model was proposed. •Object-based analysis was used to enhance spectral unmixing and subpixel mapping. •Various SPM methods are enhanced effectively within the UO-SPM framework. •UO-SPM consistently produces more accurate results across various study sites. 
 Subpixel mapping (SPM) addresses the widespread mixed pixel problem in remote sensing images by predicting the spatial distribution of land cover within mixed pixels. However, conventional pixel-based spectral unmixing, a key pre-processing step for SPM, neglects valuable spatial contextual information and struggles with spectral variability, ultimately undermining SPM accuracy. Additionally, while extensively utilized, supervised spectral unmixing is labor-intensive and user-unfriendly. To address these issues, this paper proposes a fully automatic, unsupervised object-based SPM (UO-SPM) model that exploits object-scale information to reduce spectral unmixing errors and subsequently enhance SPM. Given that mixed pixels are typically located at the edges of objects (i.e., the inner part of objects is characterized by pure pixels), segmentation and morphological erosion are employed to identify pure pixels within objects and mixed pixels at the edges. More accurate endmembers are extracted from the identified pure pixels for the secondary spectral unmixing of the remaining mixed pixels. Experimental results on 10 study sites demonstrate that the proposed unsupervised object (UO)-based analysis is an effective model for enhancing both spectral unmixing and SPM. Specifically, the spectral unmixing results of UO show an average increase of 3.65 % and 1.09 % in correlation coefficient (R) compared to Fuzzy-C means (FCM) and linear spectral mixture model (LSMM)-derived coarse proportions, respectively. Moreover, the UO-derived results of four SPM methods (i.e., Hopfield neural network (HNN), Markov random field (MRF), pixel swapping (PSA) and radial basis function interpolation (RBF)) exhibit an average increase of 5.89 % and 3.04 % in overall accuracy (OA) across the four SPM methods and 10 study sites compared to the FCM and LSMM-based results, respectively. Moreover, the proportions of both mixed and pure pixels are more accurately predicted. The advantage of UO-SPM is more evident when the size of land cover objects is larger, benefiting from more accurate identification of objects."

 Volcanoes are dynamic systems whose surfaces constantly evolve. During volcanic eruptions, which can pose great threat to local communities, significant changes to the local topography occur as edifices build up and/or collapse and lava, tephra and other eruptive products are deposited. Monitoring such changes in topography is crucial to risk assessment and the prediction of further eruptive behaviour. Multistatic Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) is a remote sensing modality particularly suited to this task as it allows for the creation of digital elevation models (DEMs) that can accurately map out three-dimensional changes in the topography, regardless of weather conditions and temporal decorrelation caused by volcanic activity. Few such missions are however currently operational. Harmony is an upcoming ESA mission that will be operating alongside Sentinel-1 and will provide multistatic InSAR capabilities for the measurement of stress and deformation across the cryosphere, the oceans and the solid earth, with the monitoring of topographic change due to volcanic eruptions being one of the specific areas of focus for the mission.In this work we demonstrate the use of high resolution bistatic interferometric data from TanDEM-X for the measurement of topographic change after recent eruptions in El Reventador, Ecuador and La Soufrière, St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Additionally, we simulate data at the lower, 20 m resolution of Harmony so as to gain insights into its capability in quantifying topographic change. Our results demonstrate that Harmony’s resolution can be sufficient to resolve and measure accurately topographic change such as the emplacement of lava flows, but may be challenged in areas of steep topography where unwrapping errors can occur. The experimental results highlight the effect of acquisition pass direction with respect to local topography, the challenges arising in areas of steep topography and the importance of masking results based on estimates of precision and resolution. Finally we discuss some of the challenges, as well as implications of the Harmony mission for the future of volcano monitoring."

 The increasing use of smartphones has led to a surge in crowdsourcing initiatives, where citizens easily collect and upload information using advanced sensors, leveraging the collective efforts of the crowd. However, these devices face accuracy issues that must be addressed before they can be used effectively in certain applications. While most research has focused on GNSS-based positioning errors, compass-based orientation errors have received far less attention. This paper presents a novel method for determining the geolocation of static events by combining contributions from multiple volunteers located around a target event. Instead of straight lines, the method applies funnel-shaped regions to represent the azimuths toward the target location and encompasses various phases to address errors stemming from measured azimuths. These compass-based orientation errors have attracted less attention compared to GNSS-based positioning errors. The approach mitigates the uncertainty in azimuth measurements, producing a set of regions that contain the target location with different levels of confidence. Its reliability was tested in three case studies with known target locations, using metrics such as area and compactness. The results were promising, indicating that the developed approach is particularly useful in applications that do not require a high degree of accuracy (common in many crowdsourcing projects), such as the geolocation of forest fire ignitions − once in the vicinity they can be easily spotted. Implementing this approach within a system that collates citizens’ contributions can furnish invaluable information to authorities, empowering prompt action during emergency scenarios."

 Fifty-six total suspended particle (TSP) samples, covering four seasons from April 2022 to January 2023, were collected from the centre of Chongqing, a metropolitan city of southwest China, using an aerosol sampler. The samples were analyzed for 20 targeted poly- and per-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) by HPLC-MS/MS. The concentrations of PFAS ranged from 125 pg/m3 to 200 pg/m3 and were dominated by perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), 2-perfluorohexyl ethanoic acid (6:2 FTCA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). Seasonal variations of PFAS were distinct, with the highest concentrations in winter, followed by autumn, and with lowest levels in summer. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) and a dry deposition model were used to apportion sources and to estimate the dry deposition fluxes of the 20 PFAS, respectively. PMF analysis indicated that, based on the annual average, paper packaging production (28.1%) and the degradation of precursor compounds and emissions from PFCA production (27.8%) were the two major sources, followed by electronic product manufacturing (24.0%) and textile production (20.1%), although there were significant differences in sources between seasons. The average annual dry deposition flux of PFAS was estimated to be 18.0 ng/m2/day. However, the wet deposition of PFAS was estimated to account for 82.2% of the total atmospheric deposition flux, suggesting it plays a more important role. Estimated daily intakes (EDI) and hazard quotients (HQ) were utilized to evaluate the risks to humans via exposure to PFAS through inhalation and were found to be insignificant (HQ ≪1).

 This study investigates the meteorological conditions, dynamics, and microphysical characteristics of convective precipitation in Longmen, South China, during the Pre-summer Rainy Season (PRS) from 2016 to 2020, focusing on the influence of the South China Sea summer monsoon (SCSSM) onset. Utilizing the ERA5 reanalysis dataset and observations from the C-band Vertical Pointing Radar (VPRC) and Two-Dimensional Video Disdrometer (2DVD), we analyzed 4560 Convective Precipitation Features (CPFs) and classified them into shallow convection (SC), middle convection (MC), and deep convection (DC) based on the maximum height of 35 dBZ echo-top. Key findings reveal that the onset of the SCSSM significantly enhances convective rainfall. Specifically, it increases the proportion of convective rainfall by 11 % and intensifies rainfall duration and intensity by approximately 2.2 times. Enhanced moisture convergence and stronger convective instability drive these changes. The microphysical processes are distinct across different CPF types. SCs display warm-rain processes, MCs indicate mixed-phase processes, and DCs are associated with ice-phase processes. Each type contributes uniquely to precipitation characteristics, vertical reflectivity profiles, and raindrop size distributions. These insights emphasize the SCSSM's critical role in regional precipitation patterns and provide valuable insights into the underlying processes affecting convective systems in South China, ultimately contributing to improving the capabilities of prediction in atmospheric research."

 This paper presents an analysis of the dominant cloud microphysical processes of the extreme rainfall event on 7 May 2017, using a series of convective-permitting simulations. Special emphasis is placed on the microphysical processes of two extreme-rain-producing storms, yielding hourly rainfalls exceeding 120 mm. For the Huashan (HS) storm, a large amount of cloud water is produced through condensation (PRW_VCD) within the storm, and significant rainwater is generated by the collection of cloud water by raindrops (PRR_RCW). As for the Jiulong (JL) storm, warm rain microphysical processes are as same as the HS storm. Additionally, considerable rainwater is produced via the collection of graupel by raindrops (PRR_RCG), with contributions also coming from the melting of graupel (PRR_GML). It is noteworthy that there is slight evaporation of raindrops (PRV_REV) in both storms. To verify the dominant cloud microphysical processes of the extreme rainfalls, an experiment has been conducted using a simple ice microphysics scheme that covers the aforementioned dominant microphysical processes. The results indicate that extreme rainfalls are well replicated with the simple microphysics scheme, showing good agreement in spatial distribution and temporal evolution with observations and the control run. The experiment confirms largely the dominant cloud microphysical processes responsible for the extreme rainfall. Based on the results, we propose that placing special emphasis on the treatment of snow terminal velocity in the Thompson scheme would improve the performance of the scheme for heavy rainfall simulation. The findings gained here may help further understand cloud microphysical processes for localized extreme rainfall over southern China, and provide guidance for the improvement of cloud microphysics schemes."

 The advent of open science and the United Nations Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development are revolutionizing the ocean-data-sharing landscape for an efficient and transparent ocean information and knowledge generation. This blue revolution raised awareness on the importance of metadata and community standards to activate interoperability of the digital assets (data and services) and guarantee that data-driven science preserves provenance, lineage and quality information for its replicability. Historical data are frequently not compliant with these criteria, lacking metadata information that was not retained, crucial at the time of data generation and further ingestion into marine data infrastructures. The present data review is an example attempt to fill this gap through a thorough data reprocessing starting from the original raw data and operational log sheets. The data gathered using XBT (eXpendable BathyThermograph) probes during several monitoring activities in the Tyrrhenian and Ligurian seas between 1999 and 2019 have first been formatted and standardized according to the latest community best practices and all available metadata have been inserted, including calibration information never applied, uncertainty specification and bias correction from Cheng et al.

The comparison between REP and SDN datasets has the objective to highlight the main differences derived from the new data processing process. The maximum discrepancy among the REP and SDN data versions always resides within the surface layer (REP profiles are warmer than SDN ones) until 150 m depth generally when the thermocline settles (from June to November). The overall bias and root mean square difference are equal to 0.002 and 0.041 °C, respectively. Such differences are mainly due to the new interpolation technique (Barker and McDougall, 2020) and the application of the calibration correction in the REP dataset.The REP dataset (Reseghetti et al., 2024; https://doi.org/10.13127/rep_xbt_1999_2019.2) is available and accessible through the INGV (Istituto Nazionale di Geofisica e Vulcanologia, Bologna) ERDDAP (Environmental Research Division's Data Access Program) server, which allows for machine-to-machine data access in compliance with the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) principles (Wilkinson et al., 2016)."

Walvoord,Permafrost-wildfire interactions: Active layer thickness estimates for paired burned and unburned sites in northern high-latitudes,"Wildfires have the potential to accelerate permafrost thaw and the associated feedbacks to climate change. We assembled a data set of permafrost thaw depth measurements from burned and unburned sites contributed by researchers from across the northern high latitude region. We estimated maximum thaw depth for each measurement, which addresses a key challenge: the ability to assess impacts of wildfire on maximum thaw depth when measurement timing varies. 
 As the northern high latitude permafrost zone experiences accelerated warming, permafrost has become vulnerable to widespread thaw. Simultaneously, wildfire activity across northern boreal forest and Arctic/subarctic tundra regions impact permafrost stability through the combustion of insulating organic matter, vegetation and post-fire changes in albedo. Efforts to synthesise the impacts of wildfire on permafrost are limited and are typically reliant on antecedent pre-fire conditions. To address this, we created the FireALT dataset by soliciting data contributions that included thaw depth measurements, site conditions, and fire event details with paired measurements at environmentally comparable burned and unburned sites. The solicitation resulted in 52,466 thaw depth measurements from 18 contributors across North America and Russia. Because thaw depths were taken at various times throughout the thawing season, we also estimated end of season active layer thickness (ALT) for each measurement using a modified version of the Stefan equation. Here, we describe our methods for collecting and quality checking the data, estimating ALT, the data structure, strengths and limitations, and future research opportunities. The final dataset includes 47,952 ALT estimates (27,747 burned, 20,205 unburned) with 32 attributes. There are 193 unique paired burned/unburned sites spread across 12 ecozones that span Canada, Russia, and the United States. The data span fire events from 1900 to 2022. Time since fire ranges from zero to 114 years. The FireALT dataset addresses a key challenge: the ability to assess impacts of wildfire on ALT when measurements are taken at various times throughout the thaw season depending on the time of field campaigns (typically June through August) by estimating ALT at the end of season maximum. This dataset can be used to address understudied research areas particularly algorithm development, calibration, and validation for evolving process-based models as well as extrapolating across space and time, which could elucidate permafrost-wildfire interactions under accelerated warming across the high northern latitude permafrost zone.

We formalise a software package that calibrates the open-source FaIR simple climate model to full-complexity Earth system models. Observations, including historical warming, and assessments of key climate variables such as that of climate sensitivity are used to constrain the model output. 
 Simple climate models (also known as emulators) have re-emerged as critical tools for the analysis of climate policy. Emulators are efficient and highly parameterised, where the parameters are tunable to produce a diversity of global mean surface temperature (GMST) response pathways to a given emission scenario. Only a small fraction of possible parameter combinations will produce historically consistent climate hindcasts, a necessary condition for trust in future projections. Alongside historical GMST, additional observed (e.g. ocean heat content) and emergent climate metrics (such as the equilibrium climate sensitivity) can be used as constraints upon the parameter sets used for climate projections. This paper describes a multi-variable constraining package for the Finite-amplitude Impulse Response (FaIR) simple climate model (FaIR versions 2.1.0 onwards) using a Bayesian framework. The steps are, first, to generate prior distributions of parameters for FaIR based on the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP6) Earth system models or Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)-assessed ranges; second, to generate a large Monte Carlo prior ensemble of parameters to run FaIR with; and, third, to produce a posterior set of parameters constrained on several observable and assessed climate metrics. Different calibrations can be produced for different emission datasets or observed climate constraints, allowing version-controlled and continually updated calibrations to be produced. We show that two very different future projections to a given emission scenario can be obtained using emissions from the IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) (fair-calibrate v1.4.0) and from updated emission datasets through 2022 (fair-calibrate v1.4.1) for similar climate constraints in both cases. fair-calibrate can be reconfigured for different source emission datasets or target climate distributions, and new versions will be produced upon availability of new climate system data."

Using simulations, we developed a more accurate method that works efficiently, making it suitable for application in weather and climate prediction models. The new approach is numerically verified and provides precise predictions of ice formation events and reliable estimates of key parameters. 
 The present work aims to extend the parameterisation of homogeneous ice nucleation introduced in Dolaptchiev et al. (2023) by incorporating variable ice mean mass and generalizing the approach under different conditions. The proposed method involves introducing an empirically derived correction based on a large data set of parcel model simulations. The method is validated against ensemble simulations using double-moment ice microphysics, showing a mean deviation of less than 16 % from the reference solution, with robust performance across a range of conditions. The uncertainty of the extended parameterisation is evaluated for the increasing integration time steps. The method remains computationally efficient and produces sufficiently accurate results, even with larger time steps, making it suitable for integration into numerical weather prediction models. It is shown that the generalized approach not only provides a good representation of individual nucleation events but also effectively captures the statistics across the ensemble data. The prediction of ice mixing ratio is also assessed against the reference full double-moment system results. Despite a significant error in the initial prediction, it is demonstrated that the integration of the system over several time steps equilibrates the inconsistencies. This refined parameterisation offers a more accurate prediction of ice number concentration and ice mixing ratio and is not limited to gravity wave induced perturbations and can be supplemented by other relevant dynamical effects, such as turbulence."

However, the slow and unsustainable dissolution of silicate minerals in natural environments remains a challenge. This study proposed a new CO2 capture system that uses the combined effect of amino acids and NaCl to promote mineral dissolution, and its characteristics were investigated experimentally. The results showed that amino acids are promising for enhancing the near-congruent dissolution of silicate minerals, specifically at weakly alkaline pHs (i.e., 8), implying the long-term effectiveness of the system. Comprehensive findings revealed a 13-fold increase in the level of Ca extraction from wollastonite (CaSiO3) in the presence of 0.1 mol/L glutamic acid (Glu) over 72 h at 35 °C and a 22-fold increase in the level of CO2 capture efficiency. However, Fe-bearing minerals, such as olivine ((Mg,Fe)2SiO4), are unsuitable for application, because the enhanced Fe extraction results in the generation of Fe hydroxide, which lowers pH and consequently reduces CO2 capture efficiency.

This study enrolled 571 newly diagnosed ACS cases and investigated the association of 12 PFAS with coronary stenosis severity and prognosis. Coronary stenosis was assessed via Gensini score (GS) and number of lesioned vessels (LVN). Prognosis was estimated by tracking major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Statistical analyses included ordered logistic regression, Cox regression, threshold effect models, Bayesian kernel machine regression, and quantile g-computation models. The adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework was applied to reveal the underlying mechanism. The results showed positive association between perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) and coronary stenosis, with an odds ratio (95% confidence interval, CI) of 1.33 (1.06, 1.67) for GS and 1.36 (1.08, 1.71) for LVN. PFOS significantly increased the incidence of poor prognosis, with hazard ratios (95% CI) of 1.96 (1.34, 2.89) for MACE. Threshold effects were observed for PFAS on coronary stenosis and prognosis, with PFOS thresholds of 4.65 ng/mL for GS, 4.54 ng/mL for LVN, and 5.14 ng/mL for MACE, and 5.03 ng/mL for nonfatal myocardial infarction. PFAS mixture exposure increased the occurrence of MACE and nonfatal myocardial infarction. The AOP framework shows that PFAS may impact protein binding, the cytoskeleton, multicellular biological processes, and heart function. In summary, our study revealed the adverse effects of PFAS on the degree of coronary stenosis and prognosis in ACS and identified potentially relevant molecular loci."

However, the strain distribution associated with these faults at mantle depths is not well understood. At the heart of this question is the rheology of the lithosphere: when stressed by displacement on a trans‐crustal fault, does the uppermost mantle localize strain in a continuing narrow fault zone, or is that strain instead distributed in a shear zone that widens with increasing depth? This study uses harmonic decomposition of receiver functions to measure the spatial and depth distribution of seismic anisotropy, a proxy for viscous deformation, around the Alpine Fault in Aotearoa New Zealand. Anisotropy aligned with the fault is present in the lithosphere at least 100 km away from the fault trace, suggesting that the Alpine Fault shear zone widens at depth."

Authors demonstrate such optical modes that propagate at the edge of truncated photonic crystal structures composed of an array of silicon pillars. 
 Bound states in the continuum are optical modes with extremely high-quality factors and narrow resonances, which exist in the dispersion spectrum of the radiative region above the light line. A unique bound state in the continuum is supported at the edge of truncated photonic crystals, which is a type of a Fabry-Pérot type bound state in the continuum, but has never been observed in experiments. Here, we demonstrate the bound states in the continuum supported at the edge array of silicon (Si) pillars whose diameter is bigger than that of the rest of a Si-pillar two-dimensional photonic crystal. We also show the tunability of the resonance and surface sensitivity of the mode when Si pillars are conformally coated with nanometer-thick aluminium oxide films. The presence of an oxide nanofilm improves the quality factor by over 60 % and shifts the resonance wavelength. Such behavior signifies the substantial potential of the bound states in the continuum on two-dimensional photonic crystals for post-fabrication tuning of the quality factor and surface sensing applications.

Here, researchers measured antibodies in serum and saliva from a strep throat human challenge trial. Baseline antibodies led to variable responses and affected susceptibility to strep throat. 
 Knowledge gaps regarding human immunity to Streptococcus pyogenes have impeded vaccine development. To address these gaps and evaluate vaccine candidates, we established a human challenge model of S. pyogenes pharyngitis. Here, we analyse antibody responses in serum and saliva against 19 antigens to identify characteristics distinguishing 19 participants who developed pharyngitis and 6 who did not. We show that pharyngitis elicits serum IgG responses to key vaccine antigens and a muted mucosal IgA response, whereas IgG responses are minimal and IgA responses more pronounced in participants without pharyngitis. Serum IgG responses to pharyngitis in adult participants resemble those in children and are inversely correlated with the magnitude of pre-existing responses. While a straightforward correlate of protection is not evident, baseline antibody signatures distinguish clinical and immunological outcomes following experimental challenge. This highlights the influence of a complex humoral imprint from previous exposure, relevant for interpreting immunogenicity in forthcoming vaccine trials.

 Advances in X-ray crystallography and cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) offer the promise of elucidating functionally relevant conformational changes that are not easily studied by other biophysical methods. Here we show that 3D variability analysis (3DVA) of the cryo-EM map for wild-type (WT) human asparagine synthetase (ASNS) identifies a functional role for the Arg-142 side chain and test this hypothesis experimentally by characterizing the R142I variant in which Arg-142 is replaced by isoleucine. Support for Arg-142 playing a role in the intramolecular translocation of ammonia between the active site of the enzyme is provided by the glutamine-dependent synthetase activity of the R142 variant relative to WT ASNS, and MD simulations provide a possible molecular mechanism for these findings. Combining 3DVA with MD simulations is a generally applicable approach to generate testable hypotheses of how conformational changes in buried side chains might regulate function in enzymes.

Here, the authors reveal that BAZ1B inhibits ATAD5-UAF1-USP1, thereby preventing premature PCNA de-ubiquitination during lesion bypass under replicative stress. 
 Mono-ubiquitinated PCNA (mono-Ub-PCNA) is generated when replication forks encounter obstacles, enabling the bypass of DNA lesions. After resolving stalled forks, Ub-PCNA must be de-ubiquitinated to resume high-fidelity DNA synthesis. ATAD5, in cooperation with the UAF1-USP1 complex, is responsible for this de-ubiquitination. However, the precise regulation of timely Ub-PCNA de-ubiquitination remains unclear. Our research reveals that BAZ1B, a regulatory subunit of the BAZ1B-SMARCA5 chromatin-remodeling complex (also known as the WICH complex), plays a crucial role in fine-tuning the de-ubiquitination process of Ub-PCNA. The BAZ1B binding region of ATAD5 encompasses the UAF1-binding domain of ATAD5. Disruption of the ATAD5-BAZ1B interaction results in premature de-ubiquitination of Ub-PCNA following treatment with hydrogen peroxide. Cells with impaired BAZ1B binding to ATAD5 display increased sensitivity to oxidative stress compared to wild-type cells. These findings suggest that BAZ1B prevents premature Ub-PCNA de-ubiquitination, thereby safeguarding genome integrity. Regulation of PCNA ubiquitination is required for initiating lesion bypass and ensuring subsequent high-fidelity replication and ensure genome stability.

This Perspective critiques it for oversimplifying the complexities of natural and social systems and failing to drive effective action, and offers recommendations for future improvements. 
 Tipping points have gained substantial traction in climate change discourses. Here we critique the ‘tipping point’ framing for oversimplifying the diverse dynamics of complex natural and human systems and for conveying urgency without fostering a meaningful basis for climate action. Multiple social scientific frameworks suggest that the deep uncertainty and perceived abstractness of climate tipping points render them ineffective for triggering action and setting governance goals. The framing also promotes confusion between temperature-based policy benchmarks and properties of the climate system. In both natural and human systems, we advocate for clearer, more specific language to describe the phenomena labelled as tipping points and for critical evaluation of whether, how and why different framings can support scientific understanding and climate risk management.

 Northern Foothills of Victoria Land, Antarctica contains numerous hydrological formations, ranging from small surface streams and ponds fed by glacial or snow meltwater to permafrost lakes containing briny pockets. Here we describe the discovery of a massive body of unfrozen stratified oligotrophic water in Lake Enigma, a permanently ice-covered lake previously thought to be frozen from top to bottom. A remarkable feature of the Lake Enigma microbial ecosystem is the presence, and sometimes even dominance, of ultrasmall bacteria belonging to the superphylum Patescibacteria, a group apparently absent from Antarctic lakes in the well-studied McMurdo Dry Valleys. Cyanobacteria are virtually absent from Lake Enigma ice and water column although they are well represented in its extensive and diverse benthic microbial mats. Collectively, these features reveal a new complexity in Antarctic lake food webs and demonstrate that in addition to phototrophic and simple chemotrophic metabolisms, both symbiotic and predatory lifestyles may exist.

 Campi Flegrei is the largest active caldera in Europe and it is home to more than 350,000 people. Since 2005, the caldera has shown accelerating ground inflation and an intensification of seismic activity. Here we quantify the decadal accelerating trend alongside oscillations of various frequencies and explore the relationships between deformation and seismic activity over the period 2000 to November 2023. Results highlight the major changes that have occurred in the last four years analyzed and reveal a parabolic increase in vertical uplift and a super-exponential (squared-exponential) rise in the number of earthquakes and seismic energy release. Inspection of data indicate a close temporal correlation between deformation rate and seismicity, and an exponential relationship, with an exponent increasing over time, between ground deformation and cumulative number of earthquakes. These relationships are consistent with a quasi-elastic behavior and a stress memory (Kaiser) effect of the upper crust of the caldera under an increasing stress suggesting a progressive mechanical weakening. Most importantly, they provide evidence of an accelerating sensitivity of seismic activity to caldera inflation and warn of the possibility of significant seismic events in case of continuation, with the same trends and relations, of the bradyseismic crisis in the next years.

 We present a new method for estimating biophysical parameters from Earth Observation (EO) data using a crop-specific empirical model based on the PROSAIL Radiative Transfer (RT) model, called an ‘archetype’ model. The first-order model presented uses maximum biophysical parameter magnitude, phenological and soil parameters to describe the spectral reflectance (400–2500 nm) of vegetation over time. The approach assumes smooth variation and archetypical coordination of crop biophysical parameters over time for a given crop. The form of coordination is learned from a large sample of observations. Using Sentinel-2 observations of maize from Northeast China in 2019, we map reflectance to biophysical parameters using an inverse model operator, synchronise the parameters to a consistent time frame using a double logistic model of LAI, then derive the model archetypes as the median value of the synchronised samples. We apply the model to estimate time series of biophysical parameters for different cereal crops using an ensemble framework with a weighted K-nearest neighbour solution, and validate the results with ground measurements of different crops collected near Munich, Germany in 2017 and 2018. The results show R values greater than 0.8 for leaf area index (LAI) and leaf brown pigment content (Cbrown), with an RMSE of 0.94 m2/m2 for LAI and 0.15 for Cbrown. The chlorophyll content (Cab) and canopy water content (CCw) were retrieved at a higher level of accuracy, with R values around 0.9 and an RMSE of 6.59μg/cm2 for Cab and 0.03 g/cm2 for CCw. Comparison of forward-modelled hyperspectral reflectance with independent ground measures shows that the retrieved parameters account for 90% of the variation in canopy reflectance, with an overall RMSE of around 0.05 in reflectance units. The retrievals for all terms are mostly within 1σ when measurement and prediction uncertainty are taken into account, except for some early and late season issues in leaf and canopy water due to the complexity of canopy structure and understory during these periods. The approach provides a new form of constraint for the simultaneous estimation of biophysical parameters from EO and greatly reduces the rank of the problem. It is suitable for monitoring crop conditions where biophysical parameters vary smoothly over time consistently with each archetype form. The approach can be refined for other canopy types and canopy representations and could provide strong constraints on expected smoothly-varying canopy features to aid in the interpretation of EO signals across different regions of the electromagnetic spectrum."

 Accurate estimation of evapotranspiration (ET) is essential for the precise quantification of energy and water budgets under climate change. Remote sensing ET models provide an effective way to map ET across different spatial and temporal scales. However, conductance-based ET models such as PML_V2 are associated with limited or no water stress constraints on soil evaporation and canopy transpiration that could cause significant bias for sparse vegetation in arid and semi-arid areas. To meet this challenge for using conductance-based ET models, we proposed to use shortwave infrared information to serve as a water stress constraint to vegetation transpiration and soil evaporation, and an improved ET model (PML_SWIR) was proposed. The PML_SWIR model was calibrated with ET measurements from 21 eddy covariance flux towers distributed across China, and showed good performance for estimating ET (R2 = 0.70 and RMSE = 0.72 mm/day) for the cross-validation dataset. PML_SWIR outperformed PML_V2 in estimating ET for arid and semi-arid areas, indicated by RMSE being 7.86 and 25.93 mm/year lower and bias being 4.74 and 16.63 % less compared with PML_V2(China) and PML_V2(Global) for ET estimation over Xinjiang Province. In addition, PML_SWIR was noticeably better than PML_V2 for depicting the ET patterns for these seasonal rivers in the arid areas. The ET values estimated by PML_SWIR were further compared with other ET products. The results indicated that PML_SWIR well characterized the ET pattern in arid and semi-arid areas, and the estimated ET values showed good agreement with the water balance-based ET (R2 = 0.87, RMSE = 91.37 mm/year) in major river basins of China. The PML_SWIR ET estimates indicated that 20.2 % of the area of China increased significantly in ET over the study period, mainly due to vegetation greening caused by cropland expansion and the large-scale afforestation program. Overall, our results demonstrated that the incorporation of SWIR-based water stress constraints into the conductance-based ET model was a very promising way for accurately mapping ET in arid and semi-arid areas, and that the PML_SWIR model was highly applicable to regional high spatiotemporal ET mapping."

 The efficient and automated identification of landslide hazards is essential for socio-economic development and human safety. Integrating the feature extraction capabilities of deep learning with the millimeter-level precision of Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology establishes a foundation for this task. However, current methods require unwrapping interferograms, and even converting them into deformation products before identifying landslide hazards. This process is susceptible to unwrapping errors, resulting in inefficient data utilization, and demands considerable time and labor. To overcome these challenges, wrapped interferograms are directly utilized for identifying creeping landslides. In this study, trigonometric functions are applied to improve the representation of interferograms and to further enhance the data through rendering. Secondly, a multi-branch semantic segmentation network (MB-Net) was designed, with parallel branch encoding and progressive feature fusion to optimize the model’s ability to learn interferometric phases. Experimental results indicate a good performance, with the F1-score of 80.91 %, the Intersection over Union (IoU) of 67.94 %, and the Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) of 80.16 % on the ISSLIDE dataset. To further validate the generalization capability of MB-Net, the public COMET-LiCS Sentinel-1 InSAR portal data was utilized, focusing on the middle reaches of the Jinsha River in China. The results highlight MB-Net’s efficacy in spatial transferability analysis.

 Hyperspectral images (HSIs) acquired from different imaging platforms are inevitably contaminated by multiple types of noise. However, the existing supervised learning based denoising methods often show poor generalizability on data with complex degradation, due to the discrepancy between synthetic training data and real data. Although some unsupervised denoisers have been developed to learn priors on real data, the noise assumptions or image priors in these methods limit their performances. In this paper, an unsupervised noise estimation and restoration (UNER) framework is proposed based on disentangled representation learning, to create an interband representation space that is resistant to noise within a single HSI, i.e., an interband-invariant representation space. Real HSIs are categorized internally into noisy and clean bands by noise intensity estimation. Intraband and interband disentangled reconstruction are designed to train two encoder-decoder modules to learn the interband-invariant representation. Noise patterns are separated from HSIs by transforming noisy bands into the representation space without introducing hand-crafted priors. The estimated noise and clean bands are then combined to train the self-supervised interband information restoration module, thereby exploiting spectral correlation and restoring the latent noise-free data with high information fidelity. In this way, the UNER framework can learn specific priors from real HSIs without clean data and be applied to various scenarios with complicated noise patterns. Noise removal experiments conducted on three airborne hyperspectral datasets representing urban, agricultural, and forestry areas respectively demonstrate the superiority of the proposed UNER framework over the state-of-the-art hyperspectral denoising methods."

The side-by-side comparison of these enzymes has emphasized that TmrA and AcdA are specialized toward CF with both having a 4-fold higher maximum specific activity (Vmax) on CF than 1,1,1-TCA, whereas CfrA has very similar rates on both CF and 1,1,1-TCA. AcdA is the most sensitive to substrate inhibition by CF and 1,1,2-TCA and inhibition by a common cocontaminant trichloroethene. Finally, the reduction of 1,1,2-TCA, which can produce both 1,2-dichloroethane and vinyl chloride, was assessed for each enzyme. Interestingly, each enzyme has a distinct preference for the major product it produces, indicating a favored reaction pathway. Despite over 95% sequence identity, TmrA, CfrA, and AcdA exhibit substantial differences in kinetic behavior, highlighting the importance of understanding such nuances for informed bioremediation strategies."

This study advances the functionality of Li+ ISE sensors and enables continuous monitoring of Li+ concentration in LrB by introducing apolyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) of poly(allylamine hydrochloride)/poly(sodium 4-styrenesulfonate) (PAH/PSS) that serves as an antigypsum scaling material to minimize nucleation on the sensor surface. With 5.5 bilayers of PAH/PSS coating, the Li+ ISE sensors possess a high Nernst slope (59.14 mV/dec), rapid response (<10 s), and superior selectivity against competitive ions (Na+, log Ks = −2.35; K+, log Ks = −2.47; Ca2+, log Ks = −4.05; Mg2+, log Ks = −4.18). The impedance (85.1 kΩ) of (PAH/PSS)5.5-coated sensors is 1 order of magnitude lower than that of electrospray ion-selective membrane (E-ISM) Li+ sensors (830 kΩ), attributed to the ultrathin (45.3 nm) and highly dielectric PAH/PSS bilayers. During a 15-day continuous monitoring test in LrB, the (PAH/PSS)5.5-coated Li+ ISE sensors with their superhydrophilic and smooth surface diminish nucleation sites for scaling agents (e.g., Ca2+ and SO42–) and consequently mitigate gypsum scaling. Moreover, a brine-tailored denoising data processing algorithm (bt-DDPA), coupled with the salinity-adjusted mathematical model with Lagrange interpolation, effectively captures Li+ fluctuation by filtering out anomalies and reducing sensor drift in brine. Bt-DDPA alleviates the discrepancy between the sensor readings and the lab-based validation results by 46.06%. This study demonstrates that the integration of material advancement (PAH/PSS coating) with sensor data processing (bt-DDPA) bolsters continuous and accurate Li+ monitoring in LrB, crucial for brine water treatment and resource recovery."

However, the underlying mechanisms of TRI responsible for testicular damage and hormonal disruption remain elusive. This study elucidated the male reproductive toxicity of TRI at the molecular level under environmentally relevant concentrations and its associations with gut microbiota dysbiosis. The rats were administered TRI (1.5, 15, and 75 mg/kg of body weight/day) continuously via gavage for 90 days. Exposure to 15 mg/kg (below the no-observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) of 30 mg/kg) and 75 mg/kg TRI damaged testicular tissue, reduced sperm count, and lowered serum hormone and total cholesterol levels. Transcriptomics analysis combined with molecular docking simulations and cell proliferation assays showed that exposure to TRI led to testicular damage by inhibiting the expression of cholesterol receptor genes, which, in turn, disrupted steroid hormone biosynthesis. Furthermore, exposure to TRI resulted in a marked decline in the relative abundance of the probiotic bacteria. Consistently, significant reductions in the relative abundance of short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), retinoic acids, and steroid hormones in the gut were observed. Additionally, a significant correlation was observed between the relative abundance of Parabacteroides and serum testosterone levels, a vital biomarker for reproductive toxicity monitoring. These findings shed light on the mode of action of TRI-induced male reproductive toxicity and highlight the link between testicular injury and gut microbiota."

Yet its role in advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) has primarily been limited to functioning as an inert carrier due to its inherently nonredox nature. This study, for the first time, presents the highly efficient capability of γ-Al2O3 to activate peroxymonosulfate (PMS) for selectively eliminating electron-rich organic pollutants in the presence of Cl–. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we revealed that γ-Al2O3, characterized by uniquely strong Lewis acid sites, enabled robust inner-sphere complexation between PMS and Al(III) sites, triggering the oxidation of Cl– to free chlorine through a distinctive, low-energy-barrier Eley–Rideal pathway. Such a unique pathway resulted in a 42.7-fold increase in free chlorine generation, culminating in a remarkable 145.9-fold enhancement in the degradation of carbamazepine (CBZ) compared with the case without γ-Al2O3. Furthermore, this catalyst exhibited high oxidant utilization efficiency, stable performance in real-world environmental matrices, and sustained long-term activation for over 1206 bed volumes (BV) with a CBZ removal rate exceeding 90% in fixed-bed experiments. These favorable features render γ-Al2O3 an extremely promising nanomaterial for sustainable water treatment initiatives."

Forests are a major sink for the global pollutant mercury (Hg), and fluvial transport of Hg from recently burned watersheds has not been widely investigated. Here, we examined two years of fluvial transport of Hg and its speciation (total Hg, methyl-Hg, particulate, and dissolved forms) under storm events and baseflow in two recently burned watersheds with different burned proportions and one nonburned reference watershed in the Coastal Ranges of northern California. We examined postfire storm-event transport of Hg and its methylated form (methyl-Hg), addressed the importance of the “initial runoff pulse” to postfire Hg fluvial transport and its predominant association with suspended solids, and elucidated potential sources of Hg exports from the burned landscapes using geochemical indicators, which suggested that ash materials were likely the significant sources of particulates in the first high-flow season postfire but not subsequently. The maximum total suspended solid and total Hg levels in the “first pulse” at the severely burned watershed were 442 and 46 times higher, respectively, than those at the reference watershed. Stream suspended solid and Hg levels declined substantially in the burned watersheds after just a few months of rainfall likely due to the rapid regrowth of vegetation commonly observed in postfire landscapes, implying that the wildfire effects on immediate Hg inputs from the burned landscape are at most transient in nature."

Their analysis demands precise quantification methods, with interlaboratory comparisons (ILCs) being crucial for performance assessment. Typically, ILCs follow a parallel design: participants each analyze their own sample specimen, often with significant variability due to challenges in producing identical subsamples of the particulate analyte, inseparably masking the relevant uncertainty sources the ILC intends to measure. We provide a filtration-immobilization approach for particles ≤100 μm, creating permanently immobilized microplastics samples. This enables serial ILC designs where participants sequentially measure the same sample. Demonstrating the concept using 5 polymers immobilized on 10 μm pore-sized silicon filters, we expose the specific measurement uncertainty being 77% lower than the total combined uncertainty observed in a parallel ILC (relative standard deviations: 5 and 23%, respectively).

In this study, surface sediments were collected from the deep sea of the Eastern Indian Ocean (water depth: 2161–4545 m) and analyzed for 29 semivolatile organic compounds (SVOCs), including parent PAHs and their alkylated derivatives, as well as source biomarkers. The target SVOCs (∑29SVOCs: 23.0–183 ng/g, ∑16PAHs: 11.3–93.3 ng/g) were mainly from pyrogenic sources, namely coal combustion, traffic emissions, and wood burning. The contributions from wood burning and coal combustion exhibited distinct trends with increasing total organic carbon contents, suggesting different dominant biogeochemical behaviors. Major fractions of PAHs from wood burning can be biodegraded or photodegraded, leading to a depletion-dominated fate in the water column. Conversely, PAHs from coal combustion showed an accumulation-dominated fate via their sedimentation due to their persistence and hydrophobicity. This study highlights the distinct biogeochemical fates of PAHs from biomass or fossil fuel combustion in deep oceans and has implications for the marine cycle of refractory organic carbon under anthropogenic impacts."

Simulations of this SAI scenario with the CESM Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (CESM2‐WACCM6) showed nearly unchanged interhemispheric and pole‐to‐Equator surface temperature gradients relative to present‐day conditions around 2020, and reduced global impacts, such as heatwaves, sea ice melting, and shifting precipitation patterns (Tilmes et al., 2020, https://doi.org/10.5194/esd‐11‐579‐2020). However, model structural uncertainties can lead to varying climate projections under the same forcing. Implementing identical stratospheric aerosol radiative properties in GFDL‐ESM4.1, which has a much lower Effective Climate Sensitivity compared to CESM2‐WACCM6, resulted in a decrease in global‐mean surface temperature by more than 1.5°C and a corresponding reduction in precipitation responses. Two major reasons contribute to the different temperature response between the two models: first, GFDL‐ESM4.1 has less warming in the SSP534‐OS scenario; second, GFDL‐ESM4.1 has shown more pronounced cooling in response to the same stratospheric AOD perturbation. Notably, the Southern Hemisphere experiences substantial cooling compared to the Northern Hemisphere, accompanied by a northward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). Furthermore, our analysis reveals that spatially heterogeneous forcing within the SAI scenario results in diverse climate feedback parameters in the GFDL‐ESM4.1 model, through varying surface warming/cooling patterns. This research highlights the importance of considering model structural uncertainties and forcing spatial patterns for a comprehensive evaluation of future scenarios and geoengineering strategies."

In this study, we perform simulations of IC growth in spherical geometries (assuming axisymmetry). We find that it is possible for the IC to develop large‐scale convective flows under certain conditions and, in some instances, produce small‐scale heterogeneites close to the IC boundary.

An analytical model is derived that incorporates various input parameters, including current‐to‐wave velocity ratio, wave height, wave period, water depth, and vegetation properties, to describe wave decay by rigid submerged vegetation under orthogonal wave‐current conditions. Force experienced by individual cylinders was measured, revealing that the drag coefficient of waves is applicable to orthogonal wave‐current conditions.

The model assumes the extending leader channel is equipotential and has a linear charge distribution induced by an ambient electric field. The charge distribution induced by the ambient field can be used to model the electric field change at the ground. We then find the ambient electric field which best fits the field change measurements at the two BIMAP stations. The estimated ambient electric field decreases in the direction of dart leader propagation. Our observations and modeling results are consistent with our earlier hypothesis that dart leader speed is proportional to the electric field at the leader tip. The model also supports our earlier analysis that leader speed variations near branch junctions were due to previous charge deposits near the junctions. The modeled tip electric field is generally lower than the breakdown field unless the pre‐dart‐leader channel has a significant temperature of ∼ ${\sim} $ 3,000 K. This is consistent with the fact that dart leaders typically do not form new branches into the virgin air. Furthermore, the tip field is generally close to the negative streamer stability field at ambient temperatures, explaining the nature of the narrow and well‐defined channel structure. In addition to the charge distribution and the ambient and tip electric field, the development of the channel potential and current distribution are also presented."

The analysis includes spatial extent, frequency and population exposure of different risk levels (Safe, Caution, Extreme Caution and Danger) gradually rising as the value of the heat index increases. The projections show a recession of Safe areas and a robust expansion of the Caution and Extreme caution classes, irrespective of the seasons and scenarios. The largest change of fractional areal cover, estimated between 23.9% and 30.7% of Africa land areas, occurs for the Extreme caution category over West Africa, East Africa, Central Africa and part of East southern Africa in JJA under the SSP5‐8.5 scenario. Furthermore, regions north of 5°S are projected to face an average annual increase of the number of days with high‐end heat stress conditions intensifying as greenhouse gas forcing increases. Under the SSP5‐8.5, the change in the number of days with Extreme caution ranges between 60% and 80%, while that of days in the Danger category reaches 10%–20%. As a result, the total population exposure to the Extreme caution category is projected to increase over West Africa, East Africa, and Central Africa under both SSP2‐4.5 and SSP5‐8.5 scenarios, while for the Danger class, the exposure increase is limited to the Sahel regions under SSP5‐8.5. These exposures are due to the intensification of heat stress but also to its interaction with an increased population. Our results thus highlight the need of adaptation measures to extreme heat in Africa in order to ensure healthy population and safe and efficient working conditions."

 During reproduction, multiple species such as insects and all mammals undergo extensive physiological and morphological adaptions to ensure health and survival of the mother and optimal development of the offspring. Here we report that the intestinal epithelium undergoes expansion during pregnancy and lactation in mammals. This enlargement of the intestinal surface area results in a novel geometry of expanded villi. Receptor activator of nuclear factor-κΒ (RANK, encoded by TNFRSF11A) and its ligand RANKL were identified as a molecular pathway involved in this villous expansion of the small intestine in vivo in mice and in intestinal mouse and human organoids. Mechanistically, RANK–RANKL protects gut epithelial cells from cell death and controls the intestinal stem cell niche through BMP receptor signalling, resulting in the elongation of villi and a prominent increase in the intestinal surface. As a transgenerational consequence, babies born to female mice that lack Rank in the intestinal epithelium show reduced weight and develop glucose intolerance after metabolic stress. Whereas gut epithelial remodelling in pregnancy/lactation is reversible, constitutive expression of an active form of RANK is sufficient to drive intestinal expansion followed by loss of villi and stem cells, and prevents the formation of Apcmin-driven small intestinal stem cell tumours. These data identify RANK–RANKL as a pathway that drives intestinal epithelial expansion in pregnancy/lactation, one of the most elusive and fundamental tissue remodelling events in mammalian life history and evolution. The RANK–RANKL pathway drives intestinal epithelial expansion in pregnancy and lactation."

 Most stars in today’s Universe reside within spheroids, which are bulges of spiral galaxies and elliptical galaxies1,2. Their formation is still an unsolved problem3–5. Infrared/submillimetre-bright galaxies at high redshifts6 have long been suspected to be related to spheroid formation7–12. Proving this connection has been hampered so far by heavy dust obscuration when focusing on their stellar emission13–15 or by methodologies and limited signal-to-noise ratios when looking at submillimetre wavelengths16,17. Here we show that spheroids are directly generated by star formation within the cores of highly luminous starburst galaxies in the distant Universe. This follows from the ALMA submillimetre surface brightness profiles, which deviate substantially from those of exponential disks, and from the skewed-high axis-ratio distribution. Most of these galaxies are fully triaxial rather than flat disks: the ratio of the shortest to the longest of their three axes is half, on average, and increases with spatial compactness. These observations, supported by simulations, reveal a cosmologically relevant pathway for in situ spheroid formation through starbursts that is probably preferentially triggered by interactions (and mergers) acting on galaxies fed by non-coplanar gas accretion streams.

 The inclusion of microexons by alternative splicing occurs frequently in neuronal proteins. The roles of these sequences are largely unknown, and changes in their degree of inclusion are associated with neurodevelopmental disorders1. We have previously shown that decreased inclusion of a 24-nucleotide neuron-specific microexon in CPEB4, a RNA-binding protein that regulates translation through cytoplasmic changes in poly(A) tail length, is linked to idiopathic autism spectrum disorder (ASD)2. Why this microexon is required and how small changes in its degree of inclusion have a dominant-negative effect on the expression of ASD-linked genes is unclear. Here we show that neuronal CPEB4 forms condensates that dissolve after depolarization, a transition associated with a switch from translational repression to activation. Heterotypic interactions between the microexon and a cluster of histidine residues prevent the irreversible aggregation of CPEB4 by competing with homotypic interactions between histidine clusters. We conclude that the microexon is required in neuronal CPEB4 to preserve the reversible regulation of CPEB4-mediated gene expression in response to neuronal stimulation. The molecular mechanisms of how small changes in the degree of inclusion of a neuron-specific microexon in CPEB4 lead to dominant-negative effects in the expression of genes associated with autism spectrum disorder are identified."

 The stretch reflex is a fundamental component of the motor system that orchestrates the coordinated muscle contractions underlying movement. At the heart of this process lie the muscle spindles (MS), specialized receptors finely attuned to fluctuations in tension within intrafusal muscle fibres. The tension variation in the MS triggers a series of neuronal events including an initial depolarization of sensory type Ia afferents that subsequently causes the activation of motoneurons within the spinal cord1,2. This neuronal cascade culminates in the execution of muscle contraction, underscoring a presumed closed-loop mechanism between the musculoskeletal and nervous systems. By contrast, here we report the discovery of a new population of macrophages with exclusive molecular and functional signatures within the MS that express the machinery for synthesizing and releasing glutamate. Using mouse intersectional genetics with optogenetics and electrophysiology, we show that activation of MS macrophages (MSMP) drives proprioceptive sensory neuron firing on a millisecond timescale. MSMP activate spinal circuits, motor neurons and muscles by means of a glutamate-dependent mechanism that excites the MS. Furthermore, MSMP respond to neural and muscle activation by increasing the expression of glutaminase, enabling them to convert the uptaken glutamine released by myocytes during muscle contraction into glutamate. Selective silencing or depletion of MSMP in hindlimb muscles disrupted the modulation of the stretch reflex for force generation and sensory feedback correction, impairing locomotor strategies in mice. Our results have identified a new cellular component, the MSMP, that directly regulates neural activity and muscle contraction. The glutamate-mediated signalling of MSMP and their dynamic response to sensory cues introduce a new dimension to our understanding of sensation and motor action, potentially offering innovative therapeutic approaches in conditions that affect sensorimotor function.

 Wearable sensors are a recent paradigm in healthcare, enabling continuous, decentralized, and non- or minimally invasive monitoring of health and disease. Continuous measurements yield information-rich time series of physiological data that are holistic and clinically meaningful. Although most wearable sensors were initially restricted to biophysical measurements, the next generation of wearable devices is now emerging that enable biochemical monitoring of both small and large molecules in a variety of body fluids, such as sweat, breath, saliva, tears and interstitial fluid. Rapidly evolving data analysis and decision-making technologies through artificial intelligence has accelerated the application of wearables around the world. Although recent pilot trials have demonstrated the clinical applicability of these wearable devices, their widespread adoption will require large-scale validation across various conditions, ethical consideration and sociocultural acceptance. Successful translation of wearable devices from laboratory prototypes into clinical tools will further require a comprehensive transitional environment involving all stakeholders. The wearable device platforms must gain acceptance among different user groups, add clinical value for various medical indications, be eligible for reimbursements and contribute to public health initiatives. In this Perspective, we review state-of-the-art wearable devices for body-fluid analysis and their translation into clinical applications, and provide insight into their clinical purpose.

 A central question in biology is how macromolecular machines function cooperatively. In bacteria, transcription and translation occur in the same cellular compartment, and can be physically and functionally coupled1–4. Although high-resolution structures of the ribosome–RNA polymerase (RNAP) complex have provided initial mechanistic insights into the coupling process5–10, we lack knowledge of how these structural snapshots are placed along a dynamic reaction trajectory. Here we reconstitute a complete and active transcription–translation system and develop multi-colour single-molecule fluorescence microscopy experiments to directly and simultaneously track transcription elongation, translation elongation and the physical and functional coupling between the ribosome and the RNAP in real time. Our data show that physical coupling between ribosome and RNAP can occur over hundreds of nucleotides of intervening mRNA by mRNA looping, a process facilitated by NusG. We detect active transcription elongation during mRNA looping and show that NusA-paused RNAPs can be activated by the ribosome by long-range physical coupling. Conversely, the ribosome slows down while colliding with the RNAP. We hereby provide an alternative explanation for how the ribosome can efficiently rescue RNAP from frequent pausing without requiring collisions by a closely trailing ribosome. Overall, our dynamic data mechanistically highlight an example of how two central macromolecular machineries, the ribosome and RNAP, can physically and functionally cooperate to optimize gene expression.

 Synthetic receptors that mediate antigen-dependent cell responses are transforming therapeutics, drug discovery and basic research1,2. However, established technologies such as chimeric antigen receptors3 can only detect immobilized antigens, have limited output scope and lack built-in drug control3–7. Here we engineer synthetic G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are capable of driving a wide range of native or non-native cellular processes in response to a user-defined antigen. We achieve modular antigen gating by engineering and fusing a conditional auto-inhibitory domain onto GPCR scaffolds. Antigen binding to a fused nanobody relieves auto-inhibition and enables receptor activation by drug, thus generating programmable antigen-gated G-protein-coupled engineered receptors (PAGERs). We create PAGERs that are responsive to more than a dozen biologically and therapeutically important soluble and cell-surface antigens in a single step from corresponding nanobody binders. Different PAGER scaffolds allow antigen binding to drive transgene expression, real-time fluorescence or endogenous G-protein activation, enabling control of diverse cellular functions. We demonstrate multiple applications of PAGER, including induction of T cell migration along a soluble antigen gradient, control of macrophage differentiation, secretion of therapeutic antibodies and inhibition of neuronal activity in mouse brain slices. Owing to its modular design and generalizability, we expect PAGERs to have broad utility in discovery and translational science.

 Most birds can navigate seamlessly between aerial and terrestrial environments. Whereas the forelimbs evolved into wings primarily for flight, the hindlimbs serve diverse functions such as walking, hopping and leaping, and jumping take-off for transitions into flight1. These capabilities have inspired engineers to aim for similar multimodality in aerial robots, expanding their range of applications across diverse environments. However, challenges remain in reproducing multimodal locomotion, across gaits with distinct kinematics and propulsive characteristics, such as walking and jumping, while preserving lightweight mass for flight. This trade-off between mechanical complexity and versatility2 limits most existing aerial robots to only one additional locomotor mode3–5. Here we overcome the complexity–versatility trade-off with RAVEN (Robotic Avian-inspired Vehicle for multiple ENvironments), which uses its bird-inspired multifunctional legs to jump rapidly into flight, walk on the ground, and hop over obstacles and gaps similar to the multimodal locomotion of birds. We show that jumping for take-off contributes substantially to the initial flight take-off speed6–9 and, remarkably, that it is more energy efficient than taking off without the jump. Our analysis suggests an important trade-off in mass distribution between legs and body among birds adapted for different locomotor strategies, with greater investment in leg mass among terrestrial birds with multimodal gait demands. Multifunctional robot legs expand the opportunities to deploy traditional fixed-wing aircraft in complex terrains through autonomous take-offs and multimodal gaits.

 Ageing is associated with a decline in the number and fitness of adult stem cells1,2. Ageing-associated loss of stemness is posited to suppress tumorigenesis3,4, but this hypothesis has not been tested in vivo. Here we use physiologically aged autochthonous genetically engineered5,6 mouse models and primary cells5,6 to demonstrate that ageing suppresses lung cancer initiation and progression by degrading the stemness of the alveolar cell of origin. This phenotype is underpinned by the ageing-associated induction of the transcription factor NUPR1 and its downstream target lipocalin-2 in the cell of origin in mice and humans, which leads to functional iron insufficiency in the aged cells. Genetic inactivation of the NUPR1–lipocalin-2 axis or iron supplementation rescues stemness and promotes the tumorigenic potential of aged alveolar cells. Conversely, targeting the NUPR1–lipocalin-2 axis is detrimental to young alveolar cells through ferroptosis induction. Ageing-associated DNA hypomethylation at specific enhancer sites is associated with increased NUPR1 expression, which is recapitulated in young alveolar cells through DNA methylation inhibition. We uncover that ageing drives functional iron insufficiency that leads to loss of stemness and tumorigenesis but promotes resistance to ferroptosis. These findings have implications for the therapeutic modulation of cellular iron homeostasis in regenerative medicine and in cancer prevention. Furthermore, our findings are consistent with a model whereby most human cancers initiate at a young age, thereby highlighting the importance of directing cancer prevention efforts towards young individuals. Studies using mouse models of lung adenocarcinoma identify an association between age, iron homeostasis and tumour initiation potential that involves NUPR1 and lipocalin-2."

 The response of breast cancer to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) varies substantially, even when tumours belong to the same molecular or histological subtype1. Here we identify the oestrous cycle as an important contributor to this heterogeneity. In three mouse models of breast cancer, we show reduced responses to NAC when treatment is initiated during the dioestrus stage, when compared with initiation during the oestrus stage. Similar findings were observed in retrospective premenopausal cohorts of human patients. Mechanistically, the dioestrus stage exhibits systemic and localized changes, including (1) an increased number of cells undergoing epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition linked to chemoresistance2–4 and (2) decreased tumour vessel diameter, suggesting potential constraints to drug sensitivity and delivery. In addition, an elevated presence of macrophages, previously associated with chemoresistance induction5, characterizes the dioestrus phase. Whereas NAC disrupts the oestrous cycle, this elevated macrophage prevalence persists and depletion of macrophages mitigates the reduced therapy response observed when initiating treatment during dioestrus. Our data collectively demonstrate the oestrous cycle as a crucial infradian rhythm determining chemosensitivity, warranting future clinical studies to exploit optimal treatment initiation timing for enhanced chemotherapy outcomes. In three mouse models of breast cancer, we show reduced responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy when treatment is initiated during the dioestrus stage, when compared with initiation during the oestrus stage."

 Weather forecasts are fundamentally uncertain, so predicting the range of probable weather scenarios is crucial for important decisions, from warning the public about hazardous weather to planning renewable energy use. Traditionally, weather forecasts have been based on numerical weather prediction (NWP)1, which relies on physics-based simulations of the atmosphere. Recent advances in machine learning (ML)-based weather prediction (MLWP) have produced ML-based models with less forecast error than single NWP simulations2,3. However, these advances have focused primarily on single, deterministic forecasts that fail to represent uncertainty and estimate risk. Overall, MLWP has remained less accurate and reliable than state-of-the-art NWP ensemble forecasts. Here we introduce GenCast, a probabilistic weather model with greater skill and speed than the top operational medium-range weather forecast in the world, ENS, the ensemble forecast of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts4. GenCast is an ML weather prediction method, trained on decades of reanalysis data. GenCast generates an ensemble of stochastic 15-day global forecasts, at 12-h steps and 0.25° latitude–longitude resolution, for more than 80 surface and atmospheric variables, in 8 min. It has greater skill than ENS on 97.2% of 1,320 targets we evaluated and better predicts extreme weather, tropical cyclone tracks and wind power production.

In syngeneic mouse modelling, an analogous macrophage population suppresses CD8+ T cell activity in vitro and promotes ICI resistance in vivo. Furthermore, Spp1hi-TAMs are not responsive to anti-CSF1R antibody treatment. Pathway analysis identifies adenosine signalling as a potential mechanism for SPP1hi-TAM-mediated immunotherapeutic resistance. Indeed, pharmacological inhibition of adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) significantly reverses Spp1hi-TAM-mediated immunosuppression in CD8+ T cells in vitro and enhances CRPC responsiveness to programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) blockade in vivo. Consistent with preclinical results, inhibition of A2ARs using ciforadenant in combination with programmed death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) blockade using atezolizumab induces clinical responses in patients with mCRPC. Moreover, inhibiting A2ARs results in a significant decrease in SPP1hi-TAM abundance in CRPC, indicating that this pathway is involved in both induction and downstream immunosuppression. Collectively, these findings establish SPP1hi-TAMs as key mediators of ICI resistance in mCRPC through adenosine signalling, emphasizing their importance as both a therapeutic target and a potential biomarker for predicting treatment efficacy. Single-cell profiling of human prostate cancer and studies in mouse models show that macrophages expressing SPP1 mediate immunotherapeutic resistance through adenosine pathway activation and represent a potential target for future studies."

 Although separation is entropically unfavourable, it is often essential for our life1,2. The separation of very similar macromolecules such as deoxyribonucleic acids (DNAs) and their single nucleotide variants is difficult but holds great advantage for the progress of life science3. Here we report that a particular liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) at a solid–liquid interface led to the partitioning of DNAs with nearly identical structures. We found this intriguing phenomenon when we did drop-casting onto a glass plate an aqueous ammonium sulfate dispersion of phase-separated droplets comprising a homogeneous mixture of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) samples with different termini. Even when the molecular weights of their PEG parts were identical to each other, terminally different PEGs spread competitively at the solid–liquid interface and partitioned into micrometre-scale concentric circles. We found that this competitive spreading was induced by an ammonium sulfate layer spontaneously formed on the glass surface. We successfully extended the above mechanism to partitioning a mixture of nearly identical DNAs into concentric circles followed by their selective extraction using the salting-in effect. We could isolate a human cancer-causing single nucleotide variant in 97% purity from its 1:1 mixture with the original DNA.

 The maintenance of genomic integrity in rapidly proliferating cells is a substantial challenge during embryonic development1–3. Although numerous cell-intrinsic mechanisms have been revealed4–7, little is known about genome-protective effects and influences of developmental tissue microenvironments on tissue-forming cells. Here we show that fetal liver hepatocytes provide protection to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) genomes. Lineage tracing and depletion in mice demonstrated that delayed hepatocyte development in early fetal livers increased the chromosomal instability of newly colonizing HSPCs. In addition, HSPCs developed tolerance to genotoxins in hepatocyte-conditioned medium, suggesting that hepatocytes protect the HSPC genome in a paracrine manner. Proteomic analyses demonstrated the enrichment of fetuin-A in hepatocyte-conditioned medium but not in early fetal livers. Fetuin-A activates a Toll-like receptor pathway to prevent pathogenic R-loop accumulation in HSPCs undergoing DNA replication and gene transcription in the fetal liver. Numerous haematopoietic regulatory genes frequently involved in leukaemogenic mutations are associated with R-loop-enriched regions. In Fetua-knockout mice, HSPCs showed increased genome instability and susceptibility to malignancy induction. Moreover, low concentrations of fetuin-A correlated with the oncogenesis of childhood leukaemia. Therefore, we uncover a mechanism operating in developmental tissues that offers tissue-forming cell genome protection and is implicated in developmental-related diseases. A mechanism is uncovered that results in fetal hepatocytes having a paracrine role in providing genome protection to haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells."

 Fructose consumption has increased considerably over the past five decades, largely due to the widespread use of high-fructose corn syrup as a sweetener1. It has been proposed that fructose promotes the growth of some tumours directly by serving as a fuel2,3. Here we show that fructose supplementation enhances tumour growth in animal models of melanoma, breast cancer and cervical cancer without causing weight gain or insulin resistance. The cancer cells themselves were unable to use fructose readily as a nutrient because they did not express ketohexokinase-C (KHK-C). Primary hepatocytes did express KHK-C, resulting in fructolysis and the excretion of a variety of lipid species, including lysophosphatidylcholines (LPCs). In co-culture experiments, hepatocyte-derived LPCs were consumed by cancer cells and used to generate phosphatidylcholines, the major phospholipid of cell membranes. In vivo, supplementation with high-fructose corn syrup increased several LPC species by more than sevenfold in the serum. Administration of LPCs to mice was sufficient to increase tumour growth. Pharmacological inhibition of ketohexokinase had no direct effect on cancer cells, but it decreased circulating LPC levels and prevented fructose-mediated tumour growth in vivo. These findings reveal that fructose supplementation increases circulating nutrients such as LPCs, which can enhance tumour growth through a cell non-autonomous mechanism. Dietary fructose enhances tumour growth in animal models of melanoma, breast cancer and cervical cancer indirectly via metabolite transfer."

 Anhedonia, the diminished drive to seek, value, and learn about rewards, is a core feature of major depressive disorder1–3. The neural underpinnings of anhedonia and how this emotional state drives behaviour remain unclear. Here we investigated the neural code of anhedonia by taking advantage of the fact that when mice are exposed to traumatic social stress, susceptible animals become socially withdrawn and anhedonic, whereas others remain resilient. By performing high-density electrophysiology to record neural activity patterns in the basolateral amygdala (BLA) and ventral CA1 (vCA1), we identified neural signatures of susceptibility and resilience. When mice actively sought rewards, BLA activity in resilient mice showed robust discrimination between reward choices. By contrast, susceptible mice exhibited a rumination-like signature, in which BLA neurons encoded the intention to switch or stay on a previously chosen reward. Manipulation of vCA1 inputs to the BLA in susceptible mice rescued dysfunctional neural dynamics, amplified dynamics associated with resilience, and reversed anhedonic behaviour. Finally, when animals were at rest, the spontaneous BLA activity of susceptible mice showed a greater number of distinct neural population states. This spontaneous activity allowed us to decode group identity and to infer whether a mouse had a history of stress better than behavioural outcomes alone. This work reveals population-level neural dynamics that explain individual differences in responses to traumatic stress, and suggests that modulating vCA1–BLA inputs can enhance resilience by regulating these dynamics. Examination of the neural activity in the basolateral amygdala and ventral CA1 of mice during tasks or rest following exposure to social stress reveals signatures of resilience and susceptibility to stress."

Here, the authors profile plasma proteins in participants from sub-Saharan African countries before, during and after hyperacute infection and report differentially expressed proteins that define early host response and might serve as biomarkers. 
 The complex dynamics of protein expression in plasma during hyperacute HIV-1 infection and its relation to acute retroviral syndrome, viral control, and disease progression are largely unknown. Here, we quantify 1293 blood plasma proteins from 157 longitudinally linked plasma samples collected before, during, and after hyperacute HIV-1 infection of 54 participants from four sub-Saharan African countries. Six distinct longitudinal expression profiles are identified, of which four demonstrate a consistent decrease in protein levels following HIV-1 infection. Proteins involved in inflammatory responses, immune regulation, and cell motility are significantly altered during the transition from pre-infection to one month post-infection. Specifically, decreased ZYX and SCGB1A1 levels, and increased LILRA3 levels are associated with increased risk of acute retroviral syndrome; increased NAPA and RAN levels, and decreased ITIH4 levels with viral control; and increased HPN, PRKCB, and ITGB3 levels with increased risk of disease progression. Overall, this study provides insight into early host responses in hyperacute HIV-1 infection, and present potential biomarkers and mechanisms linked to HIV-1 disease progression and viral load.

 The imaging of individual Ba2+ ions in high pressure xenon gas is one possible way to attain background-free sensitivity to neutrinoless double beta decay and hence establish the Majorana nature of the neutrino. In this paper we demonstrate selective single Ba2+ ion imaging inside a high-pressure xenon gas environment. Ba2+ ions chelated with molecular chemosensors are resolved at the gas-solid interface using a diffraction-limited imaging system with scan area of 1 × 1 cm2 located inside 10 bar of xenon gas. This form of microscopy represents key ingredient in the development of barium tagging for neutrinoless double beta decay searches in 136Xe. This also provides a new tool for studying the photophysics of fluorescent molecules and chemosensors at the solid-gas interface to enable bottom-up design of catalysts and sensors.

 Room temperature phosphorescent (RTP) hydrogels exhibit great potential but show poor mechanical performance (Tensile strengthen <1 MPa) and non-tunable RTP performance, hindering their practical applications. Here, we develop wood hydrogel (W-hydrogel) by the in situ polymerization of acrylamide in the presence of delignified wood. As a result of the molecular interactions between the components of delignified wood and polyacrylamide, the W-hydrogel exhibit a tensile strengthen of 38.4 MPa and green RTP emission with a lifetime of 32.5 ms. Moreover, the tensile strength and RTP lifetime are increased to 153.8 MPa and 69.7 ms, upon treating W-hydrogel with ethanol. Significantly, the mechanical and RTP performance of W-hydrogel is switched by alternating “ethanol and water” treatments. Additionally, W-hydrogel is used as energy donor in order to produce red afterglow emission using RhB via an energy transfer process. Taking advantage of these properties, W-hydrogel is processed into multiple hydrogel-based luminescent materials.

 Tropical hydroclimate in monsoonal regions has been largely understood according to the orbital monsoon hypothesis, in which rainfall exhibits strong covariation with local summer insolation on precessional (~21,000 years) time scales, as exemplified in the Asian and South American monsoon stalagmite records. However, paleo-rainfall variations in some tropical regions are poorly explained by the orbital hypothesis, suggesting alternative forcing mechanisms of regional monsoon changes. Here, we show a 140,000-year record of Central American rainfall from oxygen-isotope (δ18O) time series of precisely dated stalagmites which reveals two dominant thermally-controlled monsoon regimes in which the Atlantic Ocean thermal state linked to the meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) is the primary driver, and local orbital summer insolation control is limited. Our reconstruction, supported by isotope-enabled climate model simulations, pinpoints the potential impacts of future AMOC weakening on the Central American and Caribbean climate.

This study examines how co-location and collaboration could enhance efforts to stay within Earth system boundaries. 
 Cities and companies have great potential to reduce pressures on Earth system boundaries. Science-based target setting has emerged as a powerful tool to help achieve the potential, but its uptake has been limited. Moreover, cities and companies usually develop their targets separately, even though many are co-located. Focusing on the top 200 cities and 500 companies by greenhouse gas emissions, we analyse the current state and potential of adopting science-based targets for climate. Of these key actors, 110 cities with existing net-zero targets and 22 companies with existing science-based targets could together eliminate up to 3.41 GtCO2e of annual emissions. We argue that this reduction potential could increase by as much as 67% (to 5.70 GtCO2e) if the cities and companies that already have targets bring their co-located counterparts on board to keep abreast of their ambitions. Using freshwater as another example, we discuss entry points for addressing interrelated Earth system boundaries through city–company collaborations. Our findings elucidate previously untapped potentials that could accelerate transformations for operating within Earth system boundaries.

 Large-scale modes of climate variability, such as the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, North Atlantic Oscillation, and Indian Ocean Dipole, show significant regional correlations with seasonal weather conditions, and are routinely forecast by meteorological agencies attempting to anticipate seasonal precipitation patterns. Here, we use machine learning together with more traditional approaches to quantify how much precipitation variability can be explained by large-scale modes of variability, and to understand the degree to which these modes interact non-linearly. We find that the relationship between climate modes and precipitation is predominantly non-linear. In some regions and seasons climate modes can explain up to 80% of precipitation variability. However, variability explained is below 10% for more than half of the land surface, and only 1% of the land shows values above 50%.

 In 2023, the global temperature rose significantly, triggering a marine heatwave (MHW) in the East China Sea (ECS) from August 12 to October 13. Unlike the typical July onset, this event was delayed. Here we investigate the mechanisms behind the late onset and prolonged duration of the 2023 MHW in the ECS and its potential linkage to global warming. The early phase was driven by shortwave radiation and ocean dynamics, while the later phase saw reduced northerly winds, allowing warmer, more humid southerlies to dominate. This shift decreased the air-sea humidity difference, enhancing downward latent heat fluxes. Future CMIP6 projections also suggest that delayed MHWs are linked to weak heat exchanges, limiting the oceanic heat transport to the atmosphere.

 Skeletal cores from massive, long-lived coral colonies provide a unique approach to investigating the chronic effects of climate change on coral calcification across decadal to centennial timescales. Here, we show an overall decline in calcification rates during the industrial era, broadly consistent with other studies, based on 148 skeletal cores from ten reef locations throughout the Indo-Pacific. However, these declines are region-specific, modulated by the opposing influences of density and linear extension (the product of which equals calcification), and superimposed on multi-decadal oscillations. The main drivers of declines in calcification were recent marine heatwaves that induced reductions in linear extension, rather than decreasing skeletal density. Our findings contrast with some regional studies that show growth declines beginning only in recent decades, which in some cases may be the most recent troughs of multi-decadal oscillations in calcification.

 Two distinct extraterrestrial impacts events struck the Earth less than 25,000 years apart in the late Eocene, approximately 35.65 million years ago. These resulted in the Popigai (northern Siberia) and Chesapeake Bay (eastern North America) impacts structures, the largest of the Cenozoic era.

Here we generate data from the Gulf of Mexico, Deep Sea Drilling Project Site 94 covering 35.85 to 35.49 million years ago. No isotopic anomalies or excursions were recorded across the impact horizons. However, ~100,000 years before the impacts, a negative 0.75‰ δ18O shift occurs in planktonic foraminifera, coincident with a 0.25‰ positive change in benthic foraminifera. We interpret this as a warming of ~2 °C in the surface ocean, accompanied by 1 °C deep water cooling, but these modifications are before and not coeval with the impact horizons.

Bailey,"A text-based, generative deep learning model for soil reflectance spectrum simulation in the solar range (400–2499 nm)","•A fully data driven SOGM for simulation of soil reflectance spectra was developed. •The inputs of SOGM are text-based information describing soil properties. •The model was trained on an extensive dataset comprising nearly 180,000 spectra. •SOGM can simulate output spectra based on an incomplete set of input properties. 
 Soil spectral reflectance is a necessary input for land surface and radiative transfer models, and can be used to infer soil properties. Numerous soil reflectance inversion models have been developed based on mechanistic approaches, each with their own limitations. Mechanistic models based on radiative transfer theory are usually based on only a few input soil properties, whereas data-driven approaches are limited by high non-uniformity of available published datasets that severely limits the amount of data usable for model calibration. To address these limitations, a fully data-driven soil optics generative model (SOGM) for simulation of soil reflectance spectra from soil property inputs was developed based on the denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM). The model was trained on an extensive dataset comprising nearly 180,000 soil spectra-property set pairs from 17 published datasets. The model generates soil reflectance spectra from text-based inputs describing soil properties and their values rather than only numerical values and labels in binary vector format, which means the model can handle variable formats for property reporting. Because the model is generative, it can simulate reasonable output spectra based on an incomplete set of available input properties, which becomes more reliable as the input property set becomes more complete. Two additional sub-models were also built to complement the SOGM: a spectral padding model that can fill in the gaps for spectra shorter than the target solar range (400 to 2499 nm), and a wet soil spectra model that can estimate the effects of water content on soil reflectance spectra given the dry spectrum predicted by the SOGM. It can also be easily integrated with other soil–plant radiation models used for remote sensing research such as PROSAIL and Helios 3D plant modeling software. The testing results of the SOGM on new datasets not included in model training demonstrated that the model can generate reasonable soil reflectance spectra based on available property inputs. Results also show soil clay/sand/silt fraction, organic carbon content, nitrogen content, and iron content tended to be important properties for spectra simulation. Inclusion of some trace minerals like nickel as model inputs decreased model performance because of their low concentrations and large propensity for ground-truth measurement error."

These materials enable dynamic bond reconfiguration, allowing reversible bond breaking and formation, similar to natural systems. Leveraging their discrete nature, these materials can adaptively reconfigure their shape and respond dynamically to varying conditions.

The resulting artificial intelligence method can model 1 year of global significant wave heights at a 0.5° × 0.5° × 1-hour resolution within half an hour on a personal computer, achieving higher accuracy than state-of-the-art numerical wave models."

Proteomic analyses reveal ligand-bound αVβ6recruits HER2 and a trafficking subnetwork, comprising guanosine triphosphatases RAB5 and RAB7A and the Rab regulator guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor 2 (GDI2). The RAB5/RAB7A/GDI2 functional module mediates direct cross-talk between αVβ6and HER2, affecting receptor trafficking and signaling. Acute exposure to trastuzumab increases recruitment of the subnetwork to αVβ6, but trastuzumab resistance decouples GDI2 recruitment.

The “lithium triangle”, comprising Chile, Argentina, and Bolivia, contains 53% of the world’s lithium resources and supplies 85% of the EU’s lithium imports. In 2023, the EU and Latin America launched a new cooperation agenda under which the EU signed Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with Chile and Argentina aimed at jointly developing sustainable value chains for critical raw materials. That same year, the EU adopted the European Batteries Regulation (EBR), which mandates due diligence to address social and environmental risks in the mining of battery minerals. The EBR and MoUs form the foundation of the EU’s responsible sourcing strategy for lithium from South America. This study, using the energy justice framework and results from a Delphi survey, investigates whether the EBR and MoUs align with the conditions for a just lithium battery value chain for the lithium triangle. Our findings indicate that the EU-South America agenda reflects cumulative learning by addressing mutual interests, such as local industrialization. However, the current EU responsible sourcing approach overlooks critical local-level justice considerations —distributive, procedural, and recognition justice— that are highly relevant to the lithium triangle.

The results show that the ice number concentration is strongly related to the distance to the cloud top, and the level with a larger distance to the cloud top has more graupel falling from upper levels, which promotes collision and coalescence between graupel and droplets and enhances secondary ice production. 
 The microphysical properties associated with ice production importantly determine precipitation rates. In this study, the microphysical properties of stratiform clouds with embedded convection during an extratropical cyclone over northern China were characterized in situ. Stages of clouds, including young cells rich in liquid water and developing and mature stages with high number concentrations of ice particles (NIce), were investigated. NIce could reach 300 L−1 in the mature stage, approximately 2 orders of magnitude higher than the primary NIce. The secondary ice production (SIP) rate was 0.005–1.8 L−1 s−1, which was derived from the measured NIce. The SIP rate could be produced using a simplified collision–coalescence model by considering the collection of large droplets by graupel. The collection efficiency between the graupel and the droplet was found to increase when the size of the droplet approached that of the graupel, which may improve the agreement between the measurements and the model. Importantly, the overall NIce was found to be highly related to the distance to the cloud top (DCT). The level with a larger DCT had more rimed graupel falling from the upper levels, which promoted coalescence processes between the graupel and the droplets, producing a greater fraction of smaller ice. This seeder–feeder process extended the avalanche SIP process at lower temperatures to −14 °C, beyond the temperature region of the Hallett–Mossop process. The results illustrate the microphysical properties of clouds with convective cells at different stages, which will improve the understanding of the key processes in controlling the cloud glaciation and precipitation processes."

 Primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) can influence the climate and affect human health.

We determined the abundance of microbial cells in the chamber air and seawater using staining and fluorescence microscopy, normalizing these values to sodium concentrations to calculate enrichment factors. Our results showed that microbes were enriched in the aerosol by 13 to 488 times compared to the underlying seawater, with no significant enrichment observed in the sea surface microlayer. Microbial abundances obtained through microscopy were compared with estimates of fluorescent PBAPs (fPBAPs) using a single-particle fluorescence spectrometer. We estimated microbial emission fluxes using two independent approaches: (1) applying the enrichment factors derived from this study with mass flux estimates from previous SSA parameterizations and (2) using a scaling approach from a companion study.

Currently, k is harder to measure than concentration. Here, we present a processing pipeline to estimate k from tracer-gas experiments conducted in 22 streams by the National Ecological Observatory Network. The processed dataset (n = 339) represents the largest compilation of standardized k estimates available. 
 Air–water gas exchange is essential to understanding and quantifying many biogeochemical processes in streams and rivers, including greenhouse gas emissions and metabolism. Gas exchange depends on two factors, which are often quantified separately: (1) the air–water concentration gradient of the gas and (2) the gas exchange velocity.  There are fewer measurements of gas exchange velocity compared to concentrations in streams and rivers, which limits accurate characterization of air–water gas exchange (i.e., flux rates). The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) conducts SF6 gas-loss experiments in 22 of their 24 wadeable streams using standardized methods across all experiments and sites, and publishes raw concentration data from these experiments on the NEON data portal. NEON also conducts NaCl injections that can be used to characterize hydraulic geometry at all 24 wadeable streams. These NaCl injections are conducted both as part of the gas-loss experiments and separately. Here, we use these data to estimate gas exchange and water velocity using the reaRate R package. The dataset presented includes estimates of hydraulic parameters, cleaned raw concentration SF6 tracer-gas data (including removing outliers and failed experiments), estimated SF6 gas-loss rates, normalized gas exchange velocities (k600; m d−1) and normalized depth-dependent gas exchange rates (K600; d−1). This dataset provides one of the largest compilations of gas-loss experiments (n=339) in streams to date. This dataset is unique in that it contains gas exchange estimates from repeated experiments in geographically diverse streams across a range of discharges.

By combining four data sources, we obtained a detailed representation of the riverbed, with resolutions ranging from 2 to 100 m. This dataset will support future studies on water and nutrient exchanges between the Danube and the Black Sea, and provide insights into the Delta’s buffer role within the understudied Danube-Black Sea continuum. 
 Acting as a buffer between the Danube and the Black Sea, the Danube Delta plays an important role in regulating the hydro-biochemical flows of this land-sea continuum. Despite its importance, very few studies have focused on the impact of the Danube Delta on the different fluxes between the Danube and the Black Sea. One of the first step to characterize this land-sea continuum is to describe the bathymetry of the Delta. However, there is no complete, easily accessible bathymetric data on all three branches of the Delta to support hydrodynamic, biogeochemical or ecological studies. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by combining 4 different datasets, three in the river and one for the riverbanks, each varying in density and spatial distribution, to create a high-resolution bathymetry dataset. The bathymetric data was interpolated on a hybrid curvilinear-unstructured mesh with an anisotropic Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation method. The resulting product offers resolutions ranging from 2 m in a connection zone to 100 m in one of the straight unidirectional channel. Cross validation of the dataset underlined the importance of the data source spatial pattern, with average Root Mean Square Error (RRMSE) of 0.55 %, 6.3 % and 27.6 %, for river segments covered by the densest to the coarsest dataset. These error rates are comparable to those observed in bathymetry interpolation in rivers with similar source datasets. The bathymetry presented in this study is the first unique, high-resolution, comprehensive and easily accessible bathymetric model covering all three branches of the Danube Delta. It will serve as an input in a hydrodynamic model of the Danube Delta, with the aim of better understanding the role of the Delta in the land-sea continuum between the Danube and the Black Sea.

 We present a new gridded data set of air temperature change across global land and ocean extending back to the 1780s. This data set, called the GloSAT reference analysis, has two novel features: it uses marine air temperature observations rather than the sea surface temperature measurements typically used by pre-existing data sets, and it extends further into the past than existing merged land and ocean instrumental temperature records which typically estimate temperature changes from the mid-to-late 19th century onwards. New estimates of diurnal heating biases in marine air temperatures have enabled the use of daytime observations, extending the dataset further into the past compared to nighttime-only marine air temperature data. The data set uses an extended version of the CRUTEM5 station database over land areas, incorporating newly available bias adjustments for non-standard thermometer enclosures used prior to the adoption of Stevenson screens and new climatological normal estimates for stations with limited data in the 1961–1990 baseline period. Land and marine temperature anomalies are combined to produce a gridded data set following the methods developed for HadCRUT5. The GloSAT global and hemispheric temperature anomaly series show close agreement with those based on sea-surface temperature for much of the overlapping period of their records but with slightly less warming overall."

 The absence of validation or comparison data for verifying flood mapping methods poses a significant challenge in developing operational hydraulic approaches. This article aims to address this gap by presenting a benchmark dataset for flash flood mapping in the French Mediterranean region. The dataset described in this paper (Nicolle et al., 2024) includes flood hazard maps and simulation results of three actual flash flood events, all computed in steady regime at a 5-meter resolution using a 2D SWE model (neglecting inertia) named Floodos (Davy et al., 2017). Additionally, it includes the input data necessary (Digital Terrain Models, inflow discharges, hydrographic network) for conducting similar simulations with other hydrodynamic modeling approaches, in both steady and unsteady regimes. A comprehensive validation dataset, comprising observed flood extents, high water marks, and rating curves, is also provided, enabling a detailed evaluation of 2D hydraulic simulation results. The simulation results from Floodos, compared against stage-discharge rating curves available at gauging stations, yielded highly encouraging outcomes.

 Global- and basin-scale ocean reanalyses are becoming easily accessible and are utilized widely to study the Southern Ocean. However, such ocean reanalyses are optimized to achieve the best model–data agreement for their entire model domains and their ability to simulate the Southern Ocean requires investigation. Here, we compare several ocean reanalyses (ECCOv4r5, ECCO LLC270, B-SOSE, and GECCO3) based on the Massachusetts Institute of Technology General Circulation Model (MITgcm) for the Southern Ocean. For the open ocean, the simulated time-mean hydrography and ocean circulation are similar to observations. The MITgcm-based ocean reanalyses show Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) levels measuring approximately 149 ± 11 Sv. The simulated 2 °C isotherms are located in positions similar to the ACC and roughly represent the southern extent of the current. Simulated Weddell Gyre and Ross Gyre strengths are 51 ± 11  and 25 ± 8 Sv, respectively, which is consistent with observation-based estimates. However, our evaluation finds that the time evolution of the Southern Ocean is not well simulated in these ocean reanalyses. While observations showed little change in open-ocean properties in the Weddell and Ross gyres, all simulations showed larger trends, most of which are excessive warming. For the continental shelf region, all reanalyses are unable to reproduce observed hydrographic features, suggesting that the simulated physics determining on-shelf hydrography and circulation is not well represented. Nevertheless, ocean reanalyses are valuable resources and can be used for generating ocean lateral boundary conditions for regional high-resolution simulations. We recommend that future users of these ocean reanalyses pay extra attention if their studies target open-ocean Southern Ocean temporal changes or on-shelf processes."

We recommend workshops; code quality metrics; funding; and following the findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR) standards. 
 Research software for simulating Earth processes enables the estimation of past, current, and future world states and guides policy. However, this modelling software is often developed by scientists with limited training, time, and funding, leading to software that is hard to understand, (re)use, modify, and maintain and that is, in this sense, non-sustainable. Here we evaluate the sustainability of global-scale impact models across 10 research fields. We use nine sustainability indicators for our assessment. Five of these indicators – documentation, version control, open-source license, provision of software in containers, and the number of active developers – are related to best practices in software engineering and characterize overall software sustainability. The remaining four – comment density, modularity, automated testing, and adherence to coding standards – contribute to code quality, an important factor in software sustainability. We found that 29 % (32 out of 112) of the global impact models (GIMs) participating in the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project were accessible without contacting the developers. Regarding best practices in software engineering, 75 % of the 32 GIMs have some kind of documentation, 81 % use version control, and 69 % have an open-source license. Only 16 % provide the software in a containerized form, which can potentially limit result reproducibility. Four models had no active development after 2020. Regarding code quality, we found that models suffer from low code quality, which impedes model improvement, maintenance, reusability, and reliability. Key issues include a non-optimal comment density in 75 % of the GIMs, insufficient modularity in 88 % of the GIMs, and the absence of a testing suite in 72 % of the GIMs. Furthermore, only 5 out of 10 models for which the source code, either in part or in its entirety, is written in Python show good compliance with PEP8 coding standards, with the rest showing low compliance. To improve the sustainability of GIMs and other research software, we recommend best practices for sustainable software development to the scientific community.

There is a rising diversity of metals in electricity generation and storage technologies, as well as for mobility technologies. However, little is known about the future supply of minor elements historically mined in low volumes such as indium, tellurium, germanium, or tantalum. Those minor elements are found in lower concentrations in the ores of major elements and therefore rarely form economic deposits on their own. Such elements are often produced as byproducts of a host (or “target commodity”, which underpins the bulk of a mine’s profitability) in ore, e.g., in porphyry ore, tellurium is a byproduct where copper is the host. As a result, the primary supply of those minor elements depends on the supply of the major elements. Such dependency has not been accounted for in scenarios of the mineral supply. To address this gap, we developed a methodology to harmonize scattered data of mineral resource estimates and to calculate the mass ratio between the byproduct and the host in ores and concentrates, called the byproduct-to-host (BtH) ratio. We collected crude ore tonnage and element grades, among other key data, from the state-of-the-art literature and publicly available mining company reports. Our data set covers 3422 deposits across 141 countries providing 22 275 BtH ratios. The future supply of minor elements can be derived by multiplying the primary production of host elements by the developed BtH ratios, noting the limitations of data representativity.

There are also indications that PFAS-free electrolytes are in development by at least one other company, but there is no information regarding the alternative chemistries being proposed. Our review suggests that it is technically feasible to make PFAS-free batteries for battery applications, but PFAS-free solutions are not currently well-established on the market.

We propose a biologically anchored TKTD model, which describes key processes that link the gene expression level of the stress regulator nrf2 to detoxification and lethality by associating toxicodynamic damage with nrf2 expression. Fitting such a model to complex data sets consisting of multiple endpoints required the combination of methods from molecular biology, mechanistic dynamic systems modeling, and Bayesian inference.

Herein, we employed an integrated strategy, combining multiomics analyses, targeted bioassays, and modular model-fitting, to develop and validate a qAOP framework for visual toxicity of OPEs, exemplified by tris(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate, triphenyl phosphate, and tris(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate. Our results revealed that these OPEs induce visual dysfunction in zebrafish larvae primarily via oxidative stress, then cascade to damaging photoreceptors and retinal structures, ultimately resulting in the disruption of visual behaviors (i.e., decreased optokinetic response, phototaxis, and visual motor response). The qAOP, validated through cross-chemical extrapolation, enabled the prediction for vision-related effects of OPEs within a certain domain. Integrating toxicokinetic modeling could compensate for the uncertainty in qAOP predictions, since adjusting for internal concentrations as inputs significantly enhanced the accuracy and applicability of the predictions.

Ultimately, 60 chemicals with diverse known and presently unknown structures were identified, explaining 82.1% of the observed AChE inhibition.

In this study, we compared the thyroid disrupting effects of 6PPD and 6PPDQ through in vitro, in silico, and in vivo assays. Interestingly, although 6PPD and 6PPDQ showed similar docking affinities with thyroid hormone receptor (TR) isoforms and GH3 cell inhibition effects, the thyroid signaling pathway, eye development, phototactic behaviors, and cell density in the retinal layer in the larval zebrafish were  significantly affected only following 6PPD exposure. Further investigation demonstrates that 6PPD can act as a TR antagonist to reduce the opsin protein abundance and inhibit the cone photoreceptor cell proliferation, which finally alters the retinal layer structure and causes microphthalmus in zebrafish. Especially, under environmental relevant concentration exposure, 6PPD induced alterations of trβ, opn1lw1, opn1mw1, rpe65a, nr2e3 gene expressions although no significant eye histopathological change was observed.

Yet the internal structure of the lithosphere is not well characterized and often considered to be homogeneous relative to the structure of continental lithosphere. While geophysical observations clearly delineate the crust‐mantle boundary and the lithosphere‐asthenopshere boundary, other seismic anomalies known as mid‐lithosphere discontinuities (MLDs) have been challenging to detect and poorly constrained. Here we present melt transport models applied to the mid‐ocean ridge system that indicate MLDs are a widespread fundamental feature of oceanic lithosphere. In our models, some melt generated from decompression melting is frozen back into the lithosphere, forming a layered refertilization pattern. These refertilized layers are due to the stacked horizontal layering pattern of melt pooling beneath the freezing front. If the recrystallized melt is incorporated into the lithosphere as mafic lenses, the predicted seismic velocity is compatible with observations."

This study evaluates the evolution of eddies in semi‐circular rough conduits under different hydrodynamic conditions and their effects on solute transport. As inlet flow velocity increases, the non‐Fickian coefficient (a parameter used for qualifying the tailing of BTCs) increases first then decreases afterward. A critical equilibrium concentration is found when the concentration of the main flow stream and the concentration of the eddy zone reaches the same value, signaling the moment at which the mass transfer (due to diffusion) between the main flow stream and the eddy zone drops to zero. Such a critical equilibrium concentration and its corresponding moment of occurrence are found to follow two distinctive logarithmic functions of the inlet flow velocity.

Knowing who and what is at risk, how these risks are changing, and what is driving these changes is of immense importance to flood management and policy. Accurate predictions of flood risk are also critical to public safety. However, many high‐profile research studies reporting risks at national and global scales rely upon a significant oversimplification of how floods behave—as a level pool—an approach known as bathtub modeling that is avoided in flood management practice due to known biases (e.g., >200% error in flood area) compared to physics‐based modeling. With publicity by news media, findings that would likely not be trusted by flood management professionals are thus widely communicated to policy makers and the public, scientific credibility is put at risk, and maladaptation becomes more likely. Here, we call upon researchers to abandon the practice of bathtub modeling in flood risk studies, and for those involved in the peer‐review process to ensure the conclusions of impact analyses are consistent with the limitations of the assumed flood physics. We document biases and uncertainties from bathtub modeling in both coastal and inland geographies, and we present examples of physics‐based modeling approaches suited to large‐scale applications. Reducing biases and uncertainties in flood hazard estimates will sharpen scientific understanding of changing risks, better serve the needs of policy makers, enable news media to more objectively report present and future risks to the public, and better inform adaptation planning."

Here we study two different, but equally valuable New Zealand fisheries (Tasman Bay and Golden Bay, and Chatham Rise), and the potential impacts of climate change on ecosystem structure. We use mizer, a size‐based multispecies modeling package, to simulate interacting fish species in each ecosystem. Utilizing therMizer, an extension of mizer which incorporates temperature effects on species' metabolic rate and aerobic scope, we implement historical climate data from the Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP). This enables us to recreate the historical time period of 1961–2010, deriving reasonable steady state biomasses closely matching past observations. We then carry out a controlled warming simulation experiment, allowing for temperature to remain steady or to increase for both ecosystems, both with and without fishing pressure. The shallower ecosystem of Tasman and Golden Bay has more thermally tolerant species and experiences an overall increase in community biomass under warming, whilst the deeper ecosystem of Chatham Rise suffers an overall decline. In addition, fishing has a stronger negative impact on the Chatham Rise community. Smaller bodied animals also tend to be more resilient, both to warming and fishing impacts. Despite differences in community responses, the majority of important fisheries suffer reduced yields under warming in both ecosystems. Issues raised during the incorporation of temperature effects include species' thermal tolerances and model calibration to data. This study facilitates ecosystem intercomparisons under climate change and offers insight into drivers of ecosystem responses."

 Local delivery of mRNA-based immunotherapy offers a promising avenue as it enables the production of specific immunomodulatory proteins that can stimulate the immune system to recognize and eliminate cancer cells while limiting systemic exposure and toxicities. Here, we develop and employ lipid-based nanoparticles (LNPs) to intratumorally deliver an mRNA mixture encoding the cytokines interleukin (IL)−21 and IL-7 and the immunostimulatory molecule 4-1BB ligand (Triplet LNP). IL-21 synergy with IL-7 and 4-1BBL leads to a profound increase in the frequency of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells and their capacity to produce granzyme B and IFN-γ, leading to tumor eradication and the development of long-term immunological memory. Mechanistically, the efficacy of the Triplet LNP depends on tumor-draining lymph nodes to tumor CD8+ T-cell trafficking. Moreover, we highlight the therapeutic potential of the Triplet LNP in multiple tumor models in female mice and its superior therapeutic efficacy to immune checkpoint blockade. Ultimately, the expression of these immunomodulators is associated with better overall survival in patients with cancer.

 G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) endocytosis is canonically associated with β-arrestins. Here, we delineate a β-arrestin-independent endocytic pathway driven by the cytoskeletal motor, myosin VI. Myosin VI engages GIPC, an adaptor protein that binds a PDZ sequence motif present at the C-terminus of several GPCRs. Using the D2 dopamine receptor (D2R) as a prototype, we find that myosin VI regulates receptor endocytosis, spatiotemporal localization, and signaling. We find that access to the D2R C-tail for myosin VI-driven internalization is controlled by an interaction between the C-tail and the third intracellular loop of the receptor. Agonist efficacy, co-factors, and GIPC expression modulate this interaction to tune agonist trafficking. Myosin VI is differentially regulated by distinct GPCR C-tails, suggesting a mechanism to shape spatiotemporal signaling profiles in different ligand and physiological contexts. Our biophysical and structural insights may advance orthogonal therapeutic strategies for targeting GPCRs through cytoskeletal motor proteins.

 Cardiovascular diseases claim over 10 million lives annually, highlighting the critical need for long-term monitoring and early detection of cardiac abnormalities. Existing techniques like electrocardiograms (ECG) and Holter are accurate but suffer from discomfort caused by body-attached electrodes. While wearable devices using photoplethysmography offer more convenience, they sacrifice accuracy and are susceptible to environmental interference. Here we present a radio frequency (RF)-based (60 to 64 GHz) sensing system that monitors long-term heart rate variability (HRV) with clinical-grade accuracy. Our system successfully overcomes the orders-larger interference from respiration motion in far-field conditions without any model training. By identifying previously undiscovered frequency ranges (beyond 10-order heartbeat harmonics) where heartbeat information predominates over other motions, we generate prominent heartbeat patterns with harmonics typically considered detrimental. Extensive evaluations, including a large-scale outpatient setting involving 6,222 eligible participants and a long-term daily life scenario, where sleep data was collected over 5 separate random nights over two months and a continuous 21-night period, demonstrate that our system can monitor HRV and identify abnormalities with comparable performance to clinical-grade ECG-based systems. This RF-based HRV sensing system has the potential to support active self-assessment and revolutionize medical prevention with long-term and precise health monitoring.

 During the boreal winter, the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) influences the East Asia-western North Pacific (WNP) climate by triggering an anomalous WNP anticyclone (WNPAC). Analysis of a suite of coupled model projections under symmetric CO2 ramp-up (RU) and ramp-down (RD) scenarios, the results reveal that WNPAC strengthens with increasing CO2 concentrations, peaks early in the CO2 RD phase, and then gradually weakens without fully returning to its initial state when CO2 concentrations restore. The irreversible recovery of WNPAC is related to enhanced negative precipitation anomalies in the tropical WNP and positive precipitation anomalies in the equatorial central and eastern Pacific. These changed precipitation anomalies are primarily driven by the climatological equatorial Pacific El Niño-like warming pattern due to various external and internal feedback processes. Our findings indicate that the irreversible change of WNPAC to CO2 forcing may hinder the winter monsoon and exacerbate climate risks in the East Asia-WNP region."

 The hydrological cycle in South America during austral summer, including extreme precipitation and floods, is significantly influenced by northerly low-level jets (LLJs) along the eastern Andes. These synoptic weather events have been associated with three different types of LLJs (Central, Northern, and Andes) and are sensitive to remote large-scale forcings. This study investigates how tropical forcings related to El Niño/Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) regulate the duration and frequency of each LLJ type and their impacts on extreme precipitation. Our analysis reveals that ENSO and PDO are important in driving the variability of LLJs over the past 65 years. Specifically, the Central LLJ type is more prevalent during El Niño and Warm/Neutral PDO phases, leading to heightened extreme precipitation in southern South America. Conversely, La Niña years during Cold PDO phases tend to favor the Northern and Andes LLJs, which are associated with increased precipitation extremes in the western Amazon and southeastern South America. Central and Andes LLJs tend to persist longer during these favored conditions, causing more pronounced precipitation events in the areas under their influence. This study enhances our understanding of the influence of large-scale atmospheric forcings on the regional precipitation dynamics in South America."

 Under global warming, summer precipitation over East China was projected to increase by current state-of-the-art climate models, but a large inter-model spread exists. Here we try to reduce the projection uncertainty by imposing constraints. Our procedure consists of first decomposing the projected future precipitation into inter-model principal components. The two leading modes (region-wide uniform monopole and north-south dipole, accounting for 55% of variability), by emergent constraints, are then linked to the simulation of historical precipitation in the northwest Pacific and the tropical Pacific (constraining areas). This allows us to reduce the uncertainties by 23% and obtain a smaller increase of projected precipitation in East China, relative to previous multi-model ensemble projections. Quasi-uniform increases, although weak, are obtained for the first mode, while the second mode shows a contrast pattern with a decrease in the south and an increase in the north, which both contribute to the spatial structure of constrainted projection. It is also shown that the emergent relations of both modes are physically consistent, with an enhancement of future zonal land-sea thermal contrast and a La Niña-like pattern, respectively. The use of emergent constraints inspires more confidence in the future regional precipitation projection and helps policymakers and stakeholders adjust their management policies."

 Bacterial lipid branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) are a valuable tool for reconstructing past temperatures. However, a gap remains regarding the influence of bacterial communities on brGDGT profiles. Here, we identified two distinct patterns of brGDGTs from the surface sediments of 38 Tibetan Plateau lakes using an unsupervised clustering technique. Further investigation revealed that salinity and pH significantly change bacterial community composition, affecting brGDGT profiles and causing brGDGT-based temperatures to be overestimated by up to 2.7 ± 0.7 °C in haloalkaline environments. We subsequently used the trained clustering model to examine the patterns of bacterial assemblages in the global lacustrine brGDGT dataset, confirming the global applicability of our approach. We finally applied our approach to Holocene brGDGT records from the Tibetan Plateau, showing that shifts in bacterial clusters amplified temperature variations over timescales. Our findings demonstrate that microbial ecology can robustly diagnose and constrain site-specific discrepancies in temperature reconstruction.

 Active landslides pose significant global risks, underscoring precise displacement monitoring for effective geohazard management and early warning. The Three Gorges Reservoir Area (TGRA) in China, a pivotal section of the world’s largest water conservancy project, has developed thousands of landslides due to unique hydrogeological conditions and reservoir operations. Many of these landslides are oriented north–south and covered by seasonal vegetation, which complicates the conventional remote sensing-based displacement monitoring, particularly in estimating the three-dimensional (3D) deformation and long-term time series displacement. To address these challenges, we propose an approach that integrates interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), pixel offset tracking (POT), stacking, and priori kinematic models to fully utilize the phase and amplitude information of multi-platform, multi-band SAR images (i.e., L-band ALOS-1, C-band Sentinel-1, and X-band TerraSAR-X). This approach is employed to scrutinize the long-term spatiotemporal deformation and evolution mechanism of two slow-moving, north-facing reservoir landslides in the TGRA. The results reveal for the first time the 15-year-long displacement evolution of these landslides before and after reservoir impoundment, highlighting the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of landslide deformation induced by hydrologic triggers. The impoundment in September 2008 induced transient acceleration in both landslides, followed by a relatively stable, step-like deformation pattern subject to rainfall and reservoir water level (RWL) fluctuations. Rainfall, with a lag of approximately 20 days, predominantly affects both landslides, while RWL fluctuations mainly influence the deformation at landslide toes. Notably, as the distance from the reservoir increases, the influence of RWL diminishes, with lag times increasing from 8 to about 40 days. This quantitative characterization of landslide responses to triggers represents a crucial step towards improved hazard mitigation capabilities."

 Recently, the frequency of heatwaves has increased worldwide, with significant implications for public health, the environment, and socio-economic stability. In densely populated urban areas such as Hong Kong, heatwave events are of particular concern owing to their potential to exacerbate air pollution and modulate weather patterns, including extreme precipitation events. Despite extensive research on these phenomena, there exists a gap in understanding the interconnections of heatwaves, pollution, and extreme precipitation in subtropical urban climates. Utilising in-situ meteorological data from the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO), we investigated the characteristics of heatwaves and explored their impact on pollution and local rainfall. We observed a significant increase in the frequency, intensity, and duration of heatwaves in Hong Kong, particularly after 2010. Synoptic analysis indicates that these heatwaves are often associated with persistent high-pressure systems or tropical cyclones periphery downdrafts, as these patterns could induce subsidence and reduce cloud cover, which contributes to temperature increase. Additionally, heatwaves significantly elevated concentrations of ground-level ozone and particulate matter owing to increased photochemical reactions and stagnant air conditions. These pollution spikes coincide with heatwaves, aggravating public health risks. Furthermore, the increased frequency of heatwaves has altered the composition of local precipitation, with heatwave-following extreme precipitation events occurring more frequently, suggesting a thermal-driven amplification of the hydrological cycle. Our results highlight the urgent need for integrated urban planning and health policies that address the compounding effects of heatwaves, pollution, and subsequent extreme precipitation, underscoring the importance of adapting to and mitigating these linked phenomena amid a changing climate."

In this study, analysis of the hemagglutinin (HA) from the first-reported human-infecting bovine H5N1 virus (A/Texas/37/2024, Texas) revealed avian-type receptor binding preference. Notably, a Gln226Leu substitution switched Texas HA binding specificity to human-type receptors, which was enhanced when combined with an Asn224Lys mutation. Crystal structures of the Texas HA with avian receptor analog LSTa and its Gln226Leu mutant with human receptor analog LSTc elucidated the structural basis for this preferential receptor recognition.

However, current synthetic aperture radar (SAR)-based methods face challenges related to extensive labeled training data, compromised classification accuracy, and limited applicability across different satellite systems and resolutions. In response to these challenges, our research introduces a pioneering unsupervised SAR-based flood mapping algorithm, inspired by artificial general intelligence principles. Notably, the innovative method demonstrates flexibility, performing effectively across various SAR satellites with differing resolutions and sensors, eliminating the need for satellite-specific algorithms. Our algorithm enhances processing speed and scalability by eliminating labor-intensive labeling of training data and manual intervention. To validate its performance, we conducted tests in three distinct regions using meter-level imagery from HISEA-1, Gaofen-3, and Sentinel-1 satellites. Consistently outperformed prevalent unsupervised techniques like Kmeans and Otsu, and even a Supervised-convolutional neural network segmentation algorithm by AI-Earth, with F1-scores exceeding 0.91. This outstanding performance showcases its accuracy, irrespective of the satellite systems or regions utilized. Furthermore, the seamless integration of our algorithm with high-performance cloud computing platforms such as Google Earth Engine enhances its adaptability and scalability, enabling continuous monitoring of global floods.

However, evidence for this proposed tipping is sparse and relies heavily on observations on short time scales from remote sensing data and space-for-time substitutions. Here we make use of an extensive pollen data set including 239 records of large lakes to investigate the existence of alternative stable forest cover states in the boreal forest and its adjacent biomes during the last 8000 years. By using a multimodality measure on time series of reconstructed tree cover we find very little multimodality in pollen data. To test whether this lack of multimodality is caused by limitations in the paleo data set we perform surrogate experiments. Surrogate data with alternative stable states based on the paleo vegetation–climate relationship were generated and significant multimodality was found more often than for the pollen-based tree cover (24.7% and 5.3% respectively). The response of tree cover to climate may, therefore, be more gradual and not as abrupt as would be expected from remote sensing analyses on stability. The apparent alternative stability hypothesized in the analyses of climate–vegetation relationships could be due to the strong spatial heterogeneity of environmental factors and vegetation responses as an artifact of space-for-time substitutions. Even though current and upcoming shifts in the boreal forest are indisputable and a reason for strong concern, these changes could happen gradually without going through large-scale tipping between alternative stable states. To aid adaptation and conservation measures, more knowledge is needed about boreal forest drivers and their spatial heterogeneity."

While physics-driven approaches are able to dynamically simulate temporally and spatially varying compound flooding generated by multiple drivers with correlations between some of them, computational burdens limit their capability to explore the full range of conditions that contribute to compound coastal hazards. Data-driven statistical approaches address some of these computational challenges; however, they are also unable to explore all possible forcing combinations due to short observational records, and projections are typically limited to a few locations. This study proposes a hybrid statistical–dynamical framework for compound coastal flooding analysis that integrates a stochastic generator of compound flooding drivers, a hydrodynamic model, and machine learning-based surrogate models. The framework was demonstrated in San Francisco Bay (SF) over the past 500 years with accuracy similar to the physics-driven approach but with much higher computational efficiency. The stochastic generator of compound flooding drivers is developed by coupling a sea surface temperature (SST) reconstruction model with a climate emulator, weather generator, and model of the hydrological and reservoir system. Using reconstructed SSTs as input, the generator of compound flooding drivers is employed to simulate time series of the forcing factors contributing to compound flooding (e.g. surge, waves, river discharge, etc) in SF Bay. A process-based hydrodynamic model is built to predict total water levels varying in time and space throughout SF Bay based on stochastically generated drivers. The machine learning-based surrogate models are then developed from a relatively small library (several hundred) of hydrodynamic model simulations to efficiently predict water levels for compound flooding analysis under the full range of stochastic drivers. This study contributes a hybrid statistical–dynamical framework to better understand the spatial distribution and temporal evolution of compound coastal-fluvial flooding, along with the relative contributions of drivers in complex nearshore, estuarine, and river environments for centennial timescales under past, present, and future climates."

This negative correlation between the WSTMW and ESTMW modulates the depth of the permanent pycnocline and directly contributes to the east–west contrast between the two water masses in their core layer properties, especially, during negative phase of the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation since 2000."

Singapore, amidst rapid urbanisation, experiences frequent flooding, exacerbated by its tropical-monsoon climate and climate change. Utilising high-temporal-resolution rainfall data from 2017 onwards, we examined the dynamics of urban flooding in Singapore. In total, 108 flooding events were reported for the period 2017–2023, all of a transient nature, primarily linked to cloudbursts. Based on the unique precipitation characteristics associated with urban flash flooding, the term ‘burst flooding’ is introduced to refer to urban floods caused by intense, short-duration rainfall events.

By tracing water masses from the mixed layer into the deeper ocean in late winter, we identified the newly-subducted North Pacific Subtropical Mode Water (NPSTMW) and therefore investigated its temperature changes. The temperature of newly-subducted NPSTMW showed significant warming during 1981–1999, but the warming was suppressed during 1999–2017. The newly-subducted NPSTMW temperature generally agreed with the March–April mixed layer temperature in the subduction region, but was half a degree lower. A mixed layer heat budget analysis indicates that the suppressed warming was caused by the combination of reduced warming effects of shortwave radiation due to the deepened mixed layer, strengthening of sea surface latent heat loss due to the warmer sea surface and enhanced cooling effects of vertical entrainment due to the strengthened subsurface stratification in the subduction region. Our results imply that the oceanic response to global warming can exert a cooling effect on the newly-subducted NPSTMW through these three mechanisms.

Changes in crop yields can destabilize the global food system and pose challenges to food security. Moreover, crop production is crucial, as biofuels are becoming increasingly important contributors to climate change mitigation measures aimed at limiting global warming. This study uses the Integrated Model to Assess the Global Environment integrated assessment model framework to analyze different indicators related to food security and climate change mitigation under varying climate change impacts on crop yields. Twelve spatially explicit crop productivity projections were taken from the full archive of the Global Gridded Crop Model Intercomparison of 120 climate-crop model combinations, forced by CMIP6-based climate scenarios. The selection includes two average-performing climate-crop model combinations, two pessimistic combinations that perform one standard deviation below the mean, and two optimistic model combinations that perform one standard deviation above the mean. To single out the effect of climate change on productivity changes, we drew samples from two representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6 and RCP8.5). These productivity projections were applied within an otherwise uniform scenario (SSP2) and analyzed for their effect on total calorie demand, crop prices, and number of people at risk of undernourishment to quantify food security. Risks to climate change mitigation targets were explored by modeling the total bioenergy supply, emissions, and global mean temperature. The results revealed significant differences in the risk of food security and mitigation potential between different regions and climate change scenarios. Across scenarios, the crop area extent can vary up to 2 million km2 due to changing crop yields. The projected change in global hunger ranges from 60 to 160 million undernourished people, indicating uncertainty between climate and crop model combinations. Low-income regions are especially impacted because of their high sensitivity to changes in food prices. Global climate change mitigation ambitions can also deviate by the latter part of the 21st century, as changes in yields will impact biofuel production as well as agriculture, forestry and other land use emissions. The quantitative insights generated by this study highlight the need for global policy efforts to make the agricultural system more adaptive to climate change to handle potential negative impacts."

The model reproduced the temporal variation in and spatial distributions of electricity consumption and temperature well in summer and winter. The partial air conditioning was the most critical factor, significantly affecting the value of anthropogenic heat emission. 
 We propose a simple dynamic anthropogenic heat (QF) parameterisation for the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) single-layer urban canopy model (SLUCM). The SLUCM is a remarkable physically based urban canopy model that is widely used. However, a limitation of SLUCM is that it considers a statistically based diurnal pattern of QF. Consequently, QF is not affected by outdoor temperature changes, and the diurnal pattern of QF is constant throughout the simulation period. To address these limitations, based on the concept of a building-energy model (BEM), which has been officially introduced in WRF, we propose a parameterisation to dynamically and simply simulate QF from buildings (QFB) through a physically based calculation of the indoor heat load and input parameters for BEM and SLUCM. This method allows users to simulate the dynamic QF and the electricity consumption (EC) as the outdoor temperature, building insulation, and heating and air conditioning (HAC) performance change. This is achieved via the simple selection of certain QF options among the urban parameters of WRF. The new parameterisation, SLUCM+BEM, was shown to simulate temporal variations in QFB and EC for HAC (ECHAC) and broadly reproduce the ECHAC estimates of more sophisticated BEM and ECHAC observations in the world's largest metropolis, Tokyo."

However, this paper reports the important roles of reactive oxidative species (ROS) generated from dioxygen and water under only UV222 radiation. Multiple ROSs are identified, including hydroxyl radical (HO·), singlet oxygen (1O2), superoxide radical anion (·O2–), and ozone (O3). HO· is the major ROS for the degradation of 18 organic micropollutants under UV222 radiation, with an observed quantum yield of 0.447 and the concentration of 10–13 M at pH 7. Dioxygen is the initial source of ROS, while water mainly serves as a medium to react with the photolytic intermediate of O3 (i.e., O(1D)) to form HO·. Water matrix components of HCO3– and natural organic matter can inhibit the HO· concentration, whereas NO3– significantly enhances it. In drinking water, UV222 alone removes 18 micropollutants more efficiently than the typical UV254/H2O2 AOP (150 μM), with reduced energy consumption.

Here, an extradiol dioxygenase EstN1 from strain ES2–1 involved in the ring-A cleavage of E2 was reported. It catalyzed the 4,5-seco reaction of 4-hydroxyestrone (4-OH-E1, a key E2-oxidized intermediate) with the support of the electron transport chain consisting of ferredoxin EstN2 and ferredoxin reductase EstN3, resulting in a ring-A meta-cleaved product. Interestingly, Fe(III)-assisted strain ES2–1 consolidated the opening of rings A and B in E2 by reinforcing the expression of estO1 and estN1 genes, consequently enhancing E2 metabolism. Compared to Fe(III) starvation, the biodegradation half-life of E2 was sharply reduced from 1.35 to 0.59 d after Fe(III) supplementation. Simultaneously, the transcription of estO1 and estN1 genes increased clearly from 4.3 to 47.5 times and 6.6 to 246.8 times after Fe(III) induction, respectively, accompanied by remarkable improvement in the abundance of ring-A/B cleavage products and their pyridine derivatives.

The focus is on an in‐depth understanding of the atmospheric dynamical processes that influence the HC subsiding edge. Two sets of experiments were performed: one utilizing the default OSA, and the other employing the comprehensive OSA that accounts for realistic physical mechanisms. The results show that implementing the comprehensive OSA simulates an El Niño‐like warming pattern in reference to the default experiment, which leads to an HC contraction. Examination of zonal mean momentum dynamics in the upper troposphere reveals that variations in meridional winds, crucial for determining the HC extent, are primarily driven by the differences in the horizontal eddy momentum flux derivative. The findings indicate that the equatorward shift in meridional temperature gradients enhances subtropical zonal winds and baroclinicity along their equatorial flanks, amplifying equatorward‐propagating Rossby waves. This, in turn, alters the eddy momentum flux, reshaping the pattern of the derivatives of horizontal eddy momentum flux, constraining meridional winds, and resulting in the equatorward movement of the HC subsiding edge. A scaling theory further supports the results of the HC contraction, showing that the increased subtropical zonal winds and the equatorward shift of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) elevate the atmospheric angular momentum and eventually limit the expansion of the HC."

Considering variations in the trailing seismicity factor, we derive different Magnitude Threshold for Acceptable Seismicity maps for various injection‐induced activities, including hydraulic fracturing and fluid disposal activities. Extended versions of the Magnitude Threshold for Acceptable Seismicity maps could allow for safety factors pertinent to critical infrastructure in a particular area, incorporating other factors beyond the population distribution and warranting a different tolerance level.

In particular, probabilistic simulations of future hazard impacts can improve these assessments by explicitly quantifying uncertainty and by better simulating dependence structures between the complex multivariate drivers of hazards. In this study, a regional‐scale probabilistic assessment of climate change induced coastal hazards is conducted for the Cascadia region (Northern Washington to Northern California), USA during the 21st century. Three co‐produced hazard proxies for beach safety, erosion, and flooding are quantified to identify areas of high hazard impacts and determine hazard uncertainty under three sea‐level rise scenarios. A novel chronic coastal hazard hotspot indicator is introduced that identifies areas that may experience significant increases in hazard impacts compared to present day conditions. We find that beaches near the California‐Oregon border and in Northern Washington have larger hazard impacts and hazard uncertainty due to their morphologic setting. Erosional hazards, relative to beach safety and coastal flooding, will increase the most in Cascadia during the 21st century under all sea‐level rise scenarios. Finally, we find that hazard uncertainty associated with wave and water level variability exceeds the uncertainty associated with sea‐level rise for most of the 21st century."

 The generation of plausible crystal structures is often the first step in predicting the structure and properties of a material from its chemical composition. However, most current methods for crystal structure prediction are computationally expensive, slowing the pace of innovation. Seeding structure prediction algorithms with quality generated candidates can overcome a major bottleneck.

Trained on millions of CIF files, CrystaLLM focuses on modeling crystal structures through text. CrystaLLM can produce plausible crystal structures for a wide range of inorganic compounds unseen in training, as demonstrated by ab initio simulations. Our approach challenges conventional representations of crystals, and demonstrates the potential of LLMs for learning effective models of crystal chemistry, which will lead to accelerated discovery and innovation in materials science.

 Cellular target engagement technologies enable quantification of intracellular drug binding; however, simultaneous assessment of drug-associated phenotypes has proven challenging. Here, we present cellular target engagement by accumulation of mutant as a platform that can concomitantly evaluate drug-target interactions and phenotypic responses using conditionally stabilized drug biosensors. We observe that drug-responsive proteotypes are prevalent among reported mutants of known drug targets. Compatible mutants appear to follow structural and biophysical logic that permits intra-protein and paralogous expansion of the biosensor pool. We then apply our method to uncouple target engagement from divergent cellular activities of MutT homolog 1 (MTH1) inhibitors, dissect Nudix hydrolase 15 (NUDT15)-associated thiopurine metabolism with the R139C pharmacogenetic variant, and profile the dynamics of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1/2 (PARP1/2) binding and DNA trapping by PARP inhibitors (PARPi). Further, PARP1-derived biosensors facilitated high-throughput screening for PARP1 binders, as well as multimodal ex vivo analysis and non-invasive tracking of PARPi binding in live animals. This approach can facilitate holistic assessment of drug-target engagement by bridging drug binding events and their biological consequences.

However, a tug-of-war between the natural and anthropogenic signals led to a near stalling of the weakening since the early 2010s. 
 The current state-of-the-art climate models when combined together suggest that the anthropogenic weakening of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) has already begun since the mid-1980s. However, continuous direct observational records during the past two decades have shown remarkable resilience of the AMOC. To shed light on this apparent contradiction, here we attempt to attribute the interdecadal variation of the historical AMOC to the anthropogenic and natural signals, by analyzing multiple climate and surface-forced ocean model simulations together with direct observational data. Our analysis suggests that an extensive weakening of the AMOC occurred in the 2000s, as evident from the surface-forced ocean model simulations, and was primarily driven by anthropogenic forcing and possibly augmented by natural variability. However, since the early 2010s, the natural component of the AMOC has greatly strengthened due to the development of a strong positive North Atlantic Oscillation. The enhanced natural AMOC signal in turn acted to oppose the anthropogenic weakening signal, leading to a near stalling of the AMOC weakening. Further analysis suggests that the tug-of-war between the natural and anthropogenic signals will likely continue in the next several years.

A counterfactual approach employing artificial intelligence can provide novel insights into the efficacy of mitigation policies. 
 Groundwater systems play a pivotal role in ensuring food and water security while maintaining vital ecosystem functions. The depletion of numerous global aquifers, however, raises concerns regarding the sustainability of groundwater withdrawals and environmental flows. Despite efforts to mitigate this decline, there remains a striking gap in proving the effectiveness of these measures. Our research focuses on the karstic Edwards Aquifer system in Texas to assess how effectively current mitigation strategies are protecting groundwater levels and spring flows, which are essential for biodiversity and water security. Using counterfactual artificial intelligence, we address the critical question: ‘What would have happened and may happen in the absence of the mitigation measures?’. This approach offers deep insights into both historical impacts and future projections under intermediate- and high-emission climate scenarios. By simulating what might have happened and could happen in the future without these mitigation measures, our approach provides a robust analysis of the real-world benefits of groundwater management strategies, highlighting their role in enhancing climate resilience and ensuring the sustainability of aquifers.

We found that by 2100 under the highest emission scenario, 248 out of 250 sites were exposed to extreme climate events. Forest natural world heritage sites may face increasing pressure to complex extreme phenomena under emission rise. In tropical regions, where high temperatures may magnify the vulnerability of biodiversity, we identify 14 natural world heritage sites to be prioritised that are poor in biodiversity and expected to face high temperatures. Hence, there is an urgent need for enhanced climate change adaptation at heritage sites to minimise loss of irreplaceable values. Under high emission scenarios, 248 global natural heritage sites are projected to be exposed to extreme climate events by 2100, and the forest sites are mainly at risk, according to an analysis that combines world heritage site data and climate scenarios."

 Global Positioning System (GPS) instruments capture the daily crustal 3D deformation responding elastically to terrestrial water storage (TWS) variations, providing a powerful tool for hydrological studies. Here, we further expand the application of GPS in flood potential assessment. GPS vertical and horizontal crustal deformation are inverted into TWS variations using a 3D-Inversion model, and then a novel GPS-based modified flood potential index (GMFPI) is developed to assess and attribute the spatiotemporal patterns of flood potential in Brazil. The 3D-Inversion-derived TWS estimates show more spatial details compared to those derived from vertical deformation (1D-Inversion), with annual water thickness amplitudes of about 900 mm in the middle Amazon River, which is consistent with the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment Mascon solutions but is greater than the 1D-Inversion estimates. The comparison between in-situ discharge data and GMFPI indicates that GMFPI performs well in monitoring flood potential, showing Accuracy (ACC) values greater than 0.8 at basin scales. In four reported flood events, the spatial patterns of GMFPI and discharge show that the locations of those floods are accurately characterized by GMFPI. The attribution analysis of flood dynamics shows that precipitation in coastal regions can rapidly increase flood potential, while a large amount of precipitation in inland regions first replenishes unsaturated soil water and groundwater. Additionally, the daily GMFPI exhibits good consistency with daily discharge, demonstrating a capacity for monitoring floods at a sub-monthly scale. Our study highlights the improvement of 3D-Inversion to TWS estimates and the novel application of GPS in flood potential assessing with high spatiotemporal resolution, providing valuable insights for flood early warning and prevention."

 Sunlit and shaded components are commonly present in both airborne and satellite remote sensing images. In vegetated ecosystems, shaded component often result from sunlight being obstructed by topographic relief or canopy structures, and shaded component may impact plant growth, leaf photosynthesis, and ultimately carbon sequestration. To accurately estimate the fractional cover of the shaded and sunlit components, including both green and non-green vegetation within vegetated ecosystems, a novel method called the quasi-Hue-Saturation-Lightness (quasi-HSL) method is proposed in this study. Inspired by the RGB to HSL conversion, this method utilizes near-infrared, green, and red bands to compute hue (and normalized hue), saturation, and lightness. Subsequently, two indices, namely Hue-Lightness Index (HLI) and Saturation-Lightness Index (SLI), are introduced to construct a triangular space for estimating the fractional cover of the three components. Through unmanned aerial vehicle field experiments conducted in two forested areas, the accuracy of fractional cover estimation for three components reaches an R2 value of 0.50–0.67. Furthermore, this fractional cover estimation approach can be extended to a four-component estimation, including sunlit green vegetation, sunlit non-green vegetation, shaded green vegetation, and shaded non-green vegetation. With this detailed fractional cover estimation in vegetated area, the fractional vegetation coverage can be retrieved. Cross-validated with the fractional vegetation coverage retrieved by NDVI, the accuracy reaches R2 = 0.92. The advantages of the proposed method are (1) estimating fractional cover of shaded component without blue band, which is easily impacted by atmospheric conditions and sensor performance, and (2) differentiating the sunlit green and non-green vegetation components in the vegetated ecosystem."

 Long-term climate change significantly affects the spatiotemporal dynamics of soil erosion. To explore this, remote sensing technology, future climate scenarios, and deep learning are combined to model the historical and future variations in soil erosion, investigating its spatiotemporal dynamics influenced by climate change. This paper uses the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) to assess the historical changes in erosion in northeast China from 1980 to 2020. A soil erosion simulation (SES) model was developed, incorporating deep learning models, to forecast future trends in soil erosion under various climate scenarios. The SES model achieves an R-squared (R2) value of 0.7513. The SES model can simulate the Spatiotemporal dynamics of soil erosion influenced by long-term climate change. Soil erosion from 2001 to 2020 is lower than that from 1980 to 2000, indicating a decrease in soil erosion under natural variability conditions. Unlike historical trends, future soil erosion demonstrates significant variation across three scenarios: SSP1-RCP1.9 (SSP119), SSP2-RCP4.5 (SSP245), and SSP5-RCP8.5 (SSP585). The simulation results show that the SSP119 climate scenario has a minor impact on soil erosion, whereas the SSP245 scenario leads to a gradual increase in soil erosion. The SSP585 scenario, characterized by high social vulnerability and substantial radiative forcing, exacerbates the risk of soil erosion. The study provides valuable references for maintaining soil stability and managing surface runoff."

 The distribution, sources and the cancer risk of human exposure to PM2.5-bound polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were investigated in this work. Airborne particulate samples were obtained at the Winneba highway junction (WHJ) and Apam fish-smoking community (AFC) in the Central Region of Ghana from July 2022 to June 2023. PM2.5 particulates were collected using a Gent sampler equipped with a Gast pump and a stacked filter unit. 24-hour sampling was done two times a month using Teflon filters. Dichloromethane and gas chromatography with a mass spectrometer (GC-MS) were used to extract and analyse the samples, respectively, to identify 14 PAH compounds. The study discovered average PAH concentrations of 67.38 ng/m3 at WHJ and 41.59 ng/m3 at AFC. PAH profile was predominated with Phenanthrene, accounting for 25–27 % of total PAHs. The distribution pattern of PAHs was LMW > HMW > MMW at the two research sites. A strong correlation was found among BaA, BkF, BbF and BeP. The diagnostic ratio model revealed that PAHs stemmed from pyrogenic sources. The carcinogenic PAHs (BaP, BaA, Chr, BbF, BkF, BghiP) contributed approximately 90 % to the carcinogenic activity of total PAHs, denoting a high cancer potential of PAHs. The mean levels of BaP were about 8–10 times higher than the permissible limit of 1 ng/m3.

 Snowfall plays a crucial role in the mountainous cryosphere cycle and is significantly influenced by climate change. This study utilizes the global climate models (GCMs) from Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) with multivariate bias correction (MBC) to explore potential future variations in snowfall and its elevation dependency across the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Findings indicate a consistent decline in annual snowfall across the majority of the TP by the end of the century, except for certain high-elevation regions in the northwest. The decreasing trend is projected to intensify with strengthen Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios and exhibits elevation dependency below 5000 m. Specifically, under the SSP5–8.5 scenario, snowfall over the TP is expected to decrease by 39.74 % in the far future (2071–2100), with the elevation zone below 2000 m experiencing the most intense decline of approximately 62 %. This trend is largely attributed to the significant warming, which reduces the snow fraction as more precipitation falls as rain rather than snow. This shift is evidenced by the identification of turning points in snow fraction in the mid-2040s to 2050s, coinciding with rapid temperature increases. Furthermore, substantial decreases in future (heavy) snowfall days contribute to the overall reduction in snowfall. However, complex interplay between increased precipitation and temperature effects results in a slight increase in snowfall over high elevation areas in the northern edge. Uncertainty analysis indicates model uncertainty as the dominant source in snowfall projections, accounting for over 50 % of total variance. The projected declines in snowfall and snow fraction, as well as shortened snowfall days could considerably impact the cryosphere, hydrological and ecological systems of the TP."

However, no clear guidelines have been established to regulate their hybrid characteristics owing to limited understanding of their adsorption mechanism. This study investigates the effects of the particle size of a flexible-robust MOF on its adsorption and structural transition behaviors. The robust nature originates from the structural transition of a metastable guest-free structure, while its flexible nature arises from another guest-free structure. The type of guest-free structure is predominantly determined by the particle size; particles below the critical size are trapped in the metastable guest-free structure. Notably, the critical size varies with the type of guest molecule to be removed; consequently, the difference in critical size results in guest-memory characteristics, enabling guest-free structure switching. These results underscore the importance of controlling the particle size to fine-tune hybrid adsorption characteristics of flexible-robust MOFs."

To address this, we assessed whether primary and metastatic tumors more closely resemble their tissues of origin or target tissues in terms of gene expression. We analyzed expression profiles from multiple cancer types and normal tissues, including single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing data from both paired and unpaired patient cohorts. Primary tumors were overall more transcriptomically similar to their tissues of origin, while metastases shifted toward their target tissues. However, pathway-level analysis highlighted critical metabolic and immune transcriptomic changes toward target tissues during metastasis in both primary and metastatic tumors. In addition, primary tumors exhibited higher activity in cancer hallmarks such as “Activating Invasion and Metastasis” when compared to metastases. This comprehensive analysis provides a transcriptome-wide view of the processes through which cancer tumors adapt to their metastatic environments before and after metastasis."

Here, we link data on antidepressant use of 277,344 small-town residents to a nationwide online social network. The data enable us to examine how individuals’ mental health care is related to the spatial characteristics of their social networks including their ties in the local community and connections to distant communities. We find that, besides the cohesion of social networks around home, the diversity of connections to distant places is negatively correlated with the probability of antidepressant use. Spatial diversity of social networks is also associated with decreasing dosage in subsequent years. This relationship is independent from the local access to antidepressants and is more prevalent for young individuals.

We show thatDrosophilaclassical and operant olfactory conditioning rely on distinct neuronal pathways leading to different behavioral responses. Plasticity in both pathways cannot be formed simultaneously. If plasticity occurs at both pathways, interference between them occurs and learning is disrupted. Activity of the navigation center is required to prevent plasticity in the classical pathway and enable it in the operant pathway.

We implemented five methods to estimate these fluxes over a 5-year period across 47 sites. This is the first dataset representing such large spatial and temporal coverage of soil and plant exchanges, and it has many potential applications, such as examining the response of ecosystems to weather extremes and climate change. 
 Long-term time series of transpiration, evaporation, plant net photosynthesis, and soil respiration are essential for addressing numerous research questions related to ecosystem functioning. However, quantifying these fluxes is challenging due to the lack of reliable and direct measurement techniques, which has left gaps in the understanding of their temporal cycles and spatial variability. To help address this open challenge, we generated a dataset of these four components by implementing five (conventional and novel) approaches to partition total evapotranspiration (ET) and CO2 fluxes into plant and soil fluxes across 47 National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) sites. The final dataset (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12191876; Zahn and Bou-Zeid, 2024) spans a 5-year period and covers various ecosystems, including forests, grasslands, and agricultural terrain. This is the first comprehensive dataset covering such a wide spatial and temporal distribution. Overall, we observed good agreement across most methods for ET components, increasing confidence in these estimates.  Partitioning of CO2 components, on the other hand, was found to be less robust and more dependent on prior knowledge of water use efficiency. This highlights some limitations of these present methods that we discuss, emphasizing the broader challenge posed by the lack of an accurate reference method to validate against. Despite these limitations, this dataset has several potential applications, especially in addressing critical questions regarding the response of ecosystems to extreme weather events, which are expected to become more severe and frequent with climate change."

 Methane is an important greenhouse gas but the magnitude of global emissions in particular from natural sources remain highly uncertain. To estimate methane emissions on large spatial scales, methane flux data sets from field measurements collected and processed by many different researchers must be combined. We hypothesize that considerable uncertainty might be introduced into such data synthesis products by the many different approaches used to collect, process and quality control chamber measurements of methane fluxes within the flux community. Existing guidelines on chamber measurements promote more standardized measurement and processing techniques but to our knowledge, so far, no study has investigated which methods are actually used within the flux community.

Herein, by pyrolyzing rice straw (RS) and pine wood (PW) at 350 and 700 °C, we prepared a series of biochar (RS350, RS700, PW350, and PW700) and investigated their impacts on the abundance and pathogenicity of HBPs. Compared with PW biochar, RS biochar effectively reduced the abundance of HBPs by 6.3–40.1%, as well as their pathogenicity, evidenced by an 8.2–10.1% reduction in the abundance of VFGs. Mechanistically, more persistent free radicals (PFRs) were formed in RS biochar than that of PW biochar during pyrolysis, and PFRs triggered the degradation of N-butyryl-l-homoserine lactone (C4-HSL) from 1.05 to 0.68 ng/kg, thereby disturbing the quorum sensing (QS) of HBPs. Once the QS was disturbed, the communications among HBPs were hindered, and their virulence factors were reduced, which ultimately lowered the abundance and pathogenicity of HBPs.

These risks propagate both along the life cycle and across national boundaries in a multilayer network. However, most previous studies are either only based on static network measures or focused on individual layers, ignoring dynamic cascading risks and interconnected and interdependent relationships along life cycle stages and across economies. Here, we integrated trade-linked material flow and complex network analyses to investigate intricate interconnections, interdependencies, and systematic risks of the global lithium supply chain. Both static and dynamic measures of the global lithium supply chain network exhibit a “robust-yet-fragile” property: robust for random shocks yet fragile for targeted shocks and robust for small or local disruptions yet fragile for large or cascading failures.

Here, we find that such AO–SCWP relationship is nonstationary and controlled by the remote Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). Especially, the relationship between positive AO and SCWP is significantly weakened during the warm phase of AMO. Observational analyses and idealized Atlantic pacemaker simulations indicate that warm AMO forcing is accompanied by a teleconnection wave train extending eastward from the North Atlantic to West Pacific and the western North Pacific sea surface temperature warming, which together induce northerly wind anomalies over South China by enhancing the land–ocean pressure gradient. Such climate background state changes associated with the warm AMO prohibit the positive AO induced water vapor transport to South China, thereby weakening the AO–SCWP relationship."

Interlinked flux tubes will form only if the x‐line is short; when the x‐line is long enough, the regular flux ropes are formed instead.

The safety of ships navigating along these routes will be severely threatened by low visibility caused by Arctic sea fog. Here, we utilize ship and coastal site observations spanning 1979–2023 to investigate the climatological features and mechanisms of Arctic sea fog from June to September. We find that the Northern Sea Route (NSR, along the Russian coast) experiences a mean fog frequency of 20.0%, significantly higher than the 11.5% fog frequency observed along the Northwest Passage (NWP, along the Canadian coast). Fog frequency shows null correlation with sea ice but a strong negative correlation (−0.80) with surface air temperature. The lower mean surface air temperature in the NSR region enhances relative humidity and atmospheric stability, which are conducive to fog formation and maintenance. We further reveal that fog formation mechanisms differ between the NSR and NWP. Along the NSR, fog is usually advection fog, associated with upper boundary layer warming and moistening; in contrast, along the NWP, fog is typically radiation fog linked to near‐surface cooling.

If countries that rely on shared transboundary water resources have contradictory WEF plans, that could diminish the expected outcomes, both nationally and regionally. Egypt as the most downstream Nile country is concerned about ongoing and future developments upstream, which could exacerbate Egypt's water scarcity and affect its ability to meet its WEF objectives.

 This study introduces an Entropy-based index: the Lorenz-entropy (LE) index, which we have developed by integrating Light Detection And Ranging (LiDAR), econometrics, and forest ecology. The main goal of the LE is to bridge the gap between theoretical entropy concepts and their practical applications in monitoring vertical structural complexity of tropical forest ecosystems. The LE index quantifies entropy by analyzing Relative Height (RH) metrics (representing a one-dimensional (1D) canopy structure metric) distributions from full-waveform LiDAR across successional stages in a tropical dry forest (TDF) and a tropical rainforest. To validate the LE trends derived from LiDAR, we extended the analysis using inventory-based two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) metrics, specifically basal area and biomass. The consistency of trends between the 1D LiDAR-derived LE and the inventory-based 2D and 3D metrics reinforces the LE's ability to capture and monitor structural complexity reliably across different measurement dimensions.Our findings demonstrated that LE captures the changes in entropy as a function of successional stages, reflecting how canopy structure evolves towards homogeneity and complexity. Our statistical analysis revealed significant differences between successional stages (ANOVA, α = 0.05, p < 2e-16), with LE increasing substantially from early to late stages and plateauing at climax, where vertical structure (entropy) stabilizes. The mean LE increased by 1.70×10−2 between late and climax stages, with a small effect size (Cohen's d = 0.25), indicating minor differences in complexity. The LE index, calculated from biomass and basal area, confirming that as forests mature, entropy and vertical structural complexity increase. Furthermore, the sensitivity analysis showed that LE is most responsive to RHs variability during intermediate stages, suggesting that structural development is most dynamic during this phase. These results demonstrate the potential of the LE index as a tool for ecological analysis and monitoring forest dynamics."

 Under the background of climate change and global warming, extreme drought events in China are becoming increasingly frequent. Drought is one of the primary natural causes of damage to China’s agriculture, economy, and environment, making timely, accurate, and high-resolution drought monitoring particularly crucial. The global standardized precipitation − evapotranspiration index database (SPEIbase) is a widely accepted and used global-scale drought monitoring product. However, limited by its spatial resolution of 0.5 degrees, it is difficult to describe the local spatio-temporal structure of drought. How to improve its spatial resolution while maintaining spatio-temporal consistency is one of the current research hotspots. Based on the response of vegetation growth status to drought, this paper proposes a simple and feasible SPEI prediction method, which improves the resolution of SPEIbase from 0.5 degrees to 1 km. Sixteen remote sensing inversion indices, reflectance and elevation data related to drought were selected from Google Earth Engine (GEE) as features. After preprocessing such as gridding and sample balancing, a random forest regression model was constructed to achieve high spatial resolution prediction of SPEI. SPEI with time scales of 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 24 months in July 2020, August 2019 and August 2018 in China was selected for experiments. The accuracy of 1 km resolution SPEI was evaluated through metrics such as root mean square error (RMSE), Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and determination coefficient (R2). At the same time, it was compared with the existing 1 km resolution SPEI dataset and the site-scale SPEI values. The results show that the method in this paper can obtain accurate prediction results more stably. The PCC and R2 of different months and multiple time scales are all higher than 0.9 and 0.8, and the RMSE is lower than 0.4, showing a good application prospect. Despite the good consistency between the Proposed SPEI and SPEIbase with the site-scale SPEI values, there is still significant room for improvement."

 Recently Guangzhou and Foshan in China are experiencing significant urbanization and economic development. However, the accelerated urbanization process has contributed significantly to urban land subsidence, causing huge economic losses and endangering safety of infrastructure. This intricate activities on urban surfaces can also lead to pseudo danger in interpreting InSAR-based urban surface deformation, resulting in hazard misidentification in two cities. In order to more accurately identify the hazard of urban surface deformation, we innovatively present a combination of InSAR technology with multi-temporal optical remote sensing data. It can also analyze the specific causes of urban deformation at SAR pixel level in two cities. The SBAS-InSAR method was adopted to obtain an urban subsidence map from 2017 to 2020 based on 110 Sentinel-1 SAR image scenes. To obtain an urban surface change map with a high accuracy, an improved SwiT-UNet++ model was applied based on multi optical Google Earth imagery. By a combined analysis of SAR and optical images, we discovered multiple irregular funnels with subsidence at different scales in both cities, that are mostly relatable to urban surface constructions such as foundation compression, building demolition, and the construction of public facilities. Furthermore, to identify detailed hazard around surface changes, the buffer analysis based on InSAR surface deformation and urban surface change maps was conducted. It revealed the surface deformation signals around certain urban surface change areas are more obvious and pose certain hazard. Finally additional high-risk areas are found in the two cities. By subtracting the optical surface change detection map from the InSAR-based urban subsidence map, the “pseudo danger” caused by urban activities in the interpretation of InSAR-based urban surface deformation is eliminated, enabling precise identification of actual land subsidence hazards. It is realized through a risk assessment experiment in the research area by adding factors of urbanization processes. By combining multiple sources of data and using advanced analytical techniques, we could identify the determining factors contributing to urban subsidence and the detailed hazards and thus, provide valuable information for future urban developments."

 Glacier velocity is one of the crucial parameters in the research of glacier dynamics. Synthetic aperture radar (SAR), as an active microwave sensor, represents a common method to monitor glacier velocity. However, the changes of glacier surface could cause the data missing of glacier velocity due to incoherence. To meet the demand for glacier velocity monitoring, this paper employs the SAR images of Sentinel-1 in long time series and optical images of Sentinel-2 to investigate the velocity of Petermann glacier in 2021. Firstly, the time series of glacier velocity in the whole year of 2021 is obtained by using SAR images. The glacier velocity extracted from the optical image pairs is used as the initial value of the large missing part of the glacier velocity field. Then the spatiotemporal glacier velocity matrix is constructed and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis is carried out. Among them, the glacier velocity is reconstructed by the glacier velocity estimation method based on confidence, and the complete glacier velocity time series is obtained by iterating to minimize the error of the reconstructed glacier velocity. Finally, the obtained time series of Petermann Glacier velocity in 2021 were statistically analyzed. The statistical results quantified the seasonal differences of Petermann Glacier. In addition, the analysis results show that the temporal and spatial variations of Petermann Glacier velocity are affected by topography and temperature."

The sensitivity of the NWP model assessments to the acoustic propagation is investigated. We demonstrate the limitations of a parametrized attenuation solely driven by atmospheric fields at the infrasound station (a method previously used due to its computational efficiency) by comparing it with an explicit simulation retaining the whole 3D atmospheric fields. Importantly, in the microbarom simulations, we account for the array response to allow one‐to‐one comparisons with observations. We also highlight an observed intermittent semi‐diurnal periodicity, whose occurrence depends on middle‐atmospheric conditions, pointing at arrivals from the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Hence, its variability needs to be accounted for in the simulations.

 A comprehensive (1-year-long) daily-resolved filter-based PM2.5 chemical speciation database was built over Cyprus (Eastern Mediterranean), encompassing various sites with different typologies (urban traffic, urban background and regional background). Such experimental strategy was designed and implemented with the view to quantify the contribution of local (Cypriot cities) versus regional (Eastern Mediterranean & Middle East) pollution sources on fine PM levels in Cyprus using the “Lenschow” approach. On an annual basis, fine PM fraction originated mainly from regional sources (53–61 %), while during winter a totally different pattern was observed, with local PM sources being the dominant ones (up to 70 %) due to enhanced biomass burning for domestic heating and unfavorable meteorological conditions enhancing stagnation and accumulation of air pollution close to the ground. At that period, the urban PM2.5 was found to be predominantly made of carbonaceous species (>70 %). Dust from local sources unexpectedly dominated the summertime local PM2.5 (37–47 %).The results derived from “Lenschow” approach were quantitatively compared against an independent PM source apportionment approach using Positive Matrix Factorization (US EPA PMF 5.0) to assess “more-local” versus “more-regional” PM sources. We show here that both approaches applied over Cyprus have led to consistently similar results, further cross-validating the robustness of the two techniques. The influence of regional hotspots was further confirmed by using the Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) model which pinpointed the Middle East as the main source region of fine PM pollution affecting Cyprus."

 Drought forecasting is important for water resources management and effective response to drought, and the predictability of drought may change under a changing environment. Most of the studies have focused on developing drought forecasting techniques, but limited attention has been made to the theory of drought predictability, such as dynamics of meteorological drought predictability and possible driving mechanism. Here, we characterized the predictability of meteorological drought, based on the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE"") coefficient of support vector machine regression model. Then we measured the spatial distribution, agglomeration, and dynamic changes of drought predictability, and quantitatively analyzed the main driving forces and relationships of the spatial and temporal dynamics. The Loess Plateau (LP), which is a drought-prone region with frail ecological environment in China, was chosen as a case study. Results indicated that: (1) drought predictability in the western region was higher than that in the eastern region of the LP, with the hot spots concentrated in the western sandy land and agricultural irrigation; (2) meteorological drought predictability in the LP showed a downward trend from 1962 to 2019 under the changing environment, which the autumn drought predictability declined significantly; (3) meteorological, terrestrial factors and air-sea coupling elements dominated the spatial-temporal pattern of meteorological drought predictability via strongly affecting the coefficient of variation of drought index series, and related causal paths were explored.

The Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) was developed to indicate the danger due to wildfires in boreal and temperate forests in Canada in the second half of the 20th century. Over time, the FWI has been adapted all over the world and is considered the most widely used fire weather index. This study provides a comprehensive review and meta-analysis of 750 research papers, generalizing the adoption of the FWI across 18 global environmental zones. The objective was to determine FWI values for various fire danger classes worldwide, from very low to extreme. The values of FWI and hydrometeorological variables were compared with wildfire occurrence. Key findings indicate that in drier and warmer climates, higher FWI values (around 50) correspond to high fire danger, whereas in cooler and moister climates, lower FWI values (around 25) signify extreme danger. The analysis of hydrometeorological variables reveals that relative humidity, aridity index, and vapor pressure deficit are significant factors influencing extreme minimum FWI, while average solar radiation has minimal impact. These insights have critical implications for developing effective wildfire prevention and management strategies tailored to specific environmental conditions. By establishing new fire danger classes reflective of regional meteorological and hydroclimatic characteristics, this study enhances the global applicability of the FWI. The ability to quickly adapt the FWI for fire danger forecasting in new areas is particularly beneficial for regions with previously low study coverage. The results underscore the importance of integrating regional climate variables into fire danger assessment frameworks to improve early warning systems and mitigate wildfire risks. The conclusions highlights the effectiveness of the FWI in diverse geographic contexts and its potential to enhance fire danger forecasting globally, thereby aiding in the prevention and management of wildfires."

As ozone formation is highly non-linear, we apply a global–regional chemistry–climate model with a source attribution method (tagging) to quantify the contribution of anthropogenic emissions to ozone. Our analysis shows that the contribution of European anthropogenic emissions largely increases during large ozone periods, indicating that emissions from these sectors drive ozone values. 
 Emissions of land transport and anthropogenic non-traffic emissions (e.g. industry, households and power generation) are significant sources of nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). These emissions are important precursors of tropospheric ozone and affect air quality.  The contribution of the emission sectors to ozone cannot be measured directly but can only be calculated using sophisticated  atmospheric chemistry models. For this study we apply the MECO(n) model system (MESSy-fied ECHAM and COSMO models nested n times) equipped with a source attribution method to investigate the contribution of various sources to ground-level ozone in Europe. Compared to previous source apportionment studies for Europe, for the first time we apply a combined NOx–VOC tagging implemented in an online nested global–regional chemistry–climate model to achieve a finer resolution over central Europe (12 km) but concurrently incorporating the effect of long-range transport. We distinguish 10 different source sectors and 4 geographical source regions, analysing especially the contribution from the land transport sector. Our analysis focuses on large ozone events during summer in four different regions, two major polluted regions (Po Valley and Benelux) and two more remote regions (Iberian Peninsula and Ireland). The analysis concentrates on results for summer 2017, during which  measurement campaign EMeRGe took place. Measurement data from this campaign are used for model evaluation. Our analysis shows that European land transport emissions contribute largely (42 % and 44 %, respectively) to ground-level NOy mixing ratios over Benelux and the Po Valley. Due to the overall lower ozone production efficiency over Benelux compared to the Po Valley, however, the contributions to ground-level ozone are larger in the Po Valley (12 %) compared to Benelux (8 %). In line with previous publications using different source apportionment methods, our results underline the large importance of long-range transport of ozone, especially from North America (Benelux, Ireland), but also from Africa (Iberian Peninsula), and provide additional information about the sectoral contribution not available before. Our analysis shows that the contributions of European emissions from land transport and anthropogenic non-traffic sectors strongly increase with increasing values of MDA8 (daily maximum 8 h average) ozone over the Po Valley and in the Benelux region. Accordingly, these two sectors drive large MDA8 values in these regions. Inter-comparisons of results for 2018 and with a coarser model resolution (50 instead of 12 km) show that these results are robust with respect to inter-annual variability and model resolution. Comparing our results with results from other source attribution methods we find that the contributions to ozone from individual sectors, which have large NOx but rather low VOC emissions, are estimated to be lower, if their emissions of NOx and VOCs are regarded concurrently."

This comprehensive dataset, which includes time series of up to 70 years (median 46 years), enables advanced research on water flow and environmental trends and supports the development of hydrological models. 
 Comprehensive large-sample hydrological datasets, particularly the CAMELS datasets (Catchment Attributes and MEteorology for Large-sample Studies), have advanced hydrological research and education in recent years. These datasets integrate extensive hydro-meteorological observations with landscape features, such as geology and land use, across numerous catchments within a national framework. They provide harmonised large-sample data for various purposes, such as assessing the impacts of climate change or testing hydrological models on a large number of catchments. Furthermore, these datasets are essential for the rapid progress of data-driven models in hydrology in recent years. Despite Germany's extensive hydro-meteorological measurement infrastructure, it has lacked a consistent, nationwide hydrological dataset, largely due to its decentralised management across different federal states. This fragmentation has hindered cross-state studies and made the preparation of hydrological data labour-intensive. The introduction of CAMELS-DE represents a step forward in bridging this gap. CAMELS-DE includes 1582 streamflow gauges with hydro-meteorological time series data covering up to 70 years (median length of 46 years and a minimum length of 10 years), from January 1951 to December 2020. It includes consistent catchment boundaries with areas ranging from 5 to 15 000 km2 along with detailed catchment attributes covering soil, land cover, hydrogeologic properties, and data on human influences. Furthermore, it includes a regionally trained long short-term memory (LSTM) network and a locally trained HBV (Hydrologiska Byråns Vattenbalansavdelning) model that were used as quality control and that can be used to fill gaps in discharge data or act as baseline models for the development and testing of new hydrological models. Given the large number of catchments, including numerous relatively small ones (636 catchments < 100 km2), and the time series length of up to 70 years (166 catchments with 70 years of discharge data), CAMELS-DE is one of the most comprehensive national CAMELS datasets available and offers new opportunities for research, particularly in studying long-term trends and runoff formation in small catchments and in analysing catchments with strong human influences.

We used the MultiVI algorithm, which employs satellite images from various angles to enhance accuracy. Our method outperformed traditional statistical methods compared to field measurements, enabling precise large-scale mapping of vegetation cover for improved environmental monitoring and planning. 
 Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC) is an important vegetation structure factor for applications in agriculture, forestry, ecology, etc. Due to its simplicity, the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI)-based mixture model is widely used to estimate FVC from remotely sensed data. However, the accuracy and efficiency of FVC estimation require the precise calculation of two key parameters: the NDVI of fully covered vegetation and bare soil. Despite their importance, these two endmember NDVI values have not yet been produced as large-scale maps. Traditional statistical methods for obtaining endmember NDVI from satellite datasets highly rely on the assumption that a certain amount of pure pixels of vegetation and soil must be present, which is often invalid for many areas. This study generated 30 m resolution maps of endmember NDVI across China using the MultiVI algorithm incorporating multi-angle remote sensing data. The quality and accuracy of the endmember NDVI maps were evaluated using various validation data, including statistically obtained pure NDVI, soil spectra from a soil library, and field-measured FVC. The NDVI values for bare soil derived from the MultiVI algorithm were consistent with those obtained from the soil spectral library. Additionally, the FVC estimated using the MultiVI-derived endmember NDVI and the VI-based mixture model exhibited reasonable accuracy when compared to the field measurements. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) values for MultiVI FVC were below 0.13 in the Heihe, Hebei, and Three Gorges Reservoir regions of China. Furthermore, the MultiVI FVC outperformed those calculated using the statistical methods. The endmember NDVI maps provide a convenient and reliable source of key parameters for the accurate and rapid estimation of FVC at large scales.

Common statistical downscaling techniques preserve expected co-variances during convective precipitation (a stationary phenomenon). However, they dampen future intensification of frontal precipitation (a non-stationary phenomenon) captured in global climate models and dynamical downscaling. Our study quantifies a ramification of the stationarity assumption underlying statistical downscaling. 
 There has been widespread adoption of downscaled products amongst practitioners and stakeholders to ascertain risk from climate hazards at the local scale (e.g., ∼ 5 km resolution). Such products must nevertheless be consistent with physical laws to be credible and of value to users. Here we evaluate statistically and dynamically downscaled products by examining local co-evolution of downscaled temperature and precipitation during convective and frontal precipitation events (two mechanisms testable with just temperature and precipitation). We find that two widely used statistical downscaling techniques (Localized Constructed Analogs version 2, LOCA2,  and Seasonal Trends and Analysis of Residuals Empirical Statistical Downscaling Model, STAR-ESDM) generally preserve expected co-variances during convective precipitation events over the historical and future projected intervals as compared to European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) and two observation-based data products (Livneh and nClimGrid-Daily). However, both techniques dampen future intensification of frontal precipitation that is otherwise robustly captured in global climate models (i.e., prior to downscaling) and with process-based dynamical downscaling across five different regional climate models. In the case of LOCA2, this leads to appreciable underestimation of future frontal precipitation event intensity. This study is one of the first to quantify a likely ramification of the stationarity assumption underlying statistical downscaling methods and identify a phenomenon where projections of future change diverge depending on data production method employed. Finally, our work proposes expected co-variances during convective and frontal precipitation as useful evaluation diagnostics that can be universally applied to a wide range of statistically downscaled products."

Striking a balance between a high CO2 adsorption capacity and long-term stability under practical conditions is crucial for effectively capturing CO2 from flue gas. In this study, a series of functionalized MFM-136 adsorbents were synthesized in which -NO2 and -NH2 groups were grafted onto the kagome lattice of MFM-136. Modifications with -NH2 groups were found to be highly effective for CO2 adsorption, specifically, the CO2 adsorption capacity peaked at 4.35 mmol/g for NH2(0.6)-MFM-136, representing a 55% enhancement more than MFM-136. Concurrently, the CO2/N2 selectivity for NH2(0.6)-MFM-136 was increased  1.57 times. Verification of novel adsorption sites introduced by NH2–H2L4 was conducted by using in situ DRIFT analysis and DFT calculations. It turns out that NH2–H2L4 modification can effectively mitigate the chemical deposition from the impurity gases and significantly improve the adsorbent’s hydrophobicity and its tolerance to impurity gases. Remarkably, the reduction in the CO2 absorption capacity for NH2(0.6)-MFM-136 was 34% less than that for MFM-136 after 24 h of exposure to simulated flue gas, making NH2(0.6)-MFM-136 a promising candidate for the potential application of stable and selective CO2 capture under industrial flue gas conditions."

High throughput quantitative PCR was used to quantify ARGs, whereas gut microbiomes of collembolans and mites were characterized using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing, and potential pathogens were identified. Our results revealed that ZT exposure significantly elevated the abundance of ARGs (e.g., AAC(6’)-Ir) in soil collembolan microbiomes. With the increase of ARGs in prey collembolan microbiomes, an increase of ARGs in predatory mite microbiomes was observed through trophic transfer. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) significantly contribute to the transmission of ARGs within this food chain. Additionally, co-occurrence analysis indicated a strong association between gut resistomes and pathogens, such as Brevundimonas diminuta, in the collembolans and predatory mites.

Our findings indicate substantial changes in the magnitude and partitioning of Antarctic freshwater discharge over the coming decades and centuries, particularly under very‐high warming scenarios, driven by the progressive collapse of the West Antarctic ice shelves. We project a shift in the form and location of Antarctic freshwater sources, as liquid sub‐shelf melting increases under the two climate scenarios considered, and surface meltwater runoff could potentially become a dominant contributor under extreme atmospheric warming."

 Quantum error correction [1, 2, 3, 4] provides a path to reach practical quantum computing by combining multiple physical qubits into a logical qubit, where the logical error rate is suppressed exponentially as more qubits are added. However, this exponential suppression only occurs if the physical error rate is below a critical threshold. Here, we present two below-threshold surface code memories on our newest generation of superconducting processors, Willow: a distance-7 code, and a distance-5 code integrated with a real-time decoder. The logical error rate of our larger quantum memory is suppressed by a factor of

             when increasing the code distance by two, culminating in a 101-qubit distance-7 code with 0.143% ± 0.003% error per cycle of error correction. This logical memory is also beyond break-even, exceeding its best physical qubit’s lifetime by a factor of

            . Our system maintains below-threshold performance when decoding in real time, achieving an average decoder latency of 63 μs at distance-5 up to a million cycles, with a cycle time of 1.1 μs. We also run repetition codes up to distance-29 and find that logical performance is limited by rare correlated error events occurring approximately once every hour, or

 Asteroid discoveries are essential for planetary-defense efforts aiming to prevent impacts with Earth1, including the more frequent2 megaton explosions from decameter impactors3−6. While large asteroids (≥100 km) have remained in the main belt since their formation7, small asteroids are commonly transported to the near-Earth object (NEO) population8,9. However, due to the lack of direct observational constraints, their size-frequency distribution —which informs our understanding of the NEOs and the delivery of meteorite samples to Earth—varies significantly among models10−14. Here, we report 138 detections of the smallest asteroids (⪆ 10 m) ever observed in the main belt, which were enabled by JWST’s infrared capabilities covering the asteroids’ emission peaks15 and synthetic tracking techniques16−18. Despite small orbital arcs, we constrain the objects’ distances and phase angles using known asteroids as proxies, allowing us to derive sizes via radiometric techniques. Their size-frequency distribution exhibits a break at ~ 100 m (debiased cumulative slopes of q = − 2.66 ± 0.60 and  − 0.97 ± 0.14 for diameters smaller and larger than ~ 100 m, respectively), suggestive of a population driven by collisional cascade. These asteroids were sampled from multiple asteroid families —most likely Nysa, Polana and Massalia— according to the geometry of pointings considered here. Through additional long-stare infrared observations, JWST is poised to serendipitously detect thousands of decameter-scale asteroids across the sky, probing individual asteroid families19 and the source regions of meteorites13,14 “in-situ”."

Here, the authors provide evidence for an impaired vascular fibrous repair response involving transforming growth factor-ß2-regulated collagen synthesis and cell differentiation as central mechanisms. 
 Type 2 diabetes is associated with cardiovascular disease, possibly due to impaired vascular fibrous repair. Yet, the mechanisms are elusive. Here, we investigate alterations in the fibrous repair processes in type 2 diabetes atherosclerotic plaque extracellular matrix by combining multi-omics from the human Carotid Plaque Imaging Project cohort and functional studies. Plaques from type 2 diabetes patients have less collagen. Interestingly, lower levels of transforming growth factor-ß distinguish type 2 diabetes plaques and, in these patients, lower levels of fibrous repair markers are associated with cardiovascular events. Transforming growth factor-ß2 originates mostly from contractile vascular smooth muscle cells that interact with synthetic vascular smooth muscle cells in the cap, leading to collagen formation and vascular smooth muscle cell differentiation. This is regulated by free transforming growth factor-ß2 which is affected by hyperglycemia. Our findings underscore the importance of transforming growth factor-ß2-driven fibrous repair in type 2 diabetes as an area for future therapeutic strategies.

 Recent advances unveiled physical neural networks as promising machine learning platforms, offering faster and more energy-efficient information processing. Compared with extensively-studied optical neural networks, the development of mechanical neural networks remains nascent and faces significant challenges, including heavy computational demands and learning with approximate gradients. Here, we introduce the mechanical analogue of in situ backpropagation to enable highly efficient training of mechanical neural networks. We theoretically prove that the exact gradient can be obtained locally, enabling learning through the immediate vicinity, and we experimentally demonstrate this backpropagation to obtain gradient with high precision. With the gradient information, we showcase the successful training of networks in simulations for behavior learning and machine learning tasks, achieving high accuracy in experiments of regression and classification. Furthermore, we present the retrainability of networks involving task-switching and damage, demonstrating the resilience.

 The SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein is indispensable for viral RNA genome processing. Although the N-terminal domain (NTD) is suggested to mediate specific RNA-interactions, high-resolution structures with viral RNA are still lacking. Available hybrid structures of the NTD with ssRNA and dsRNA provide valuable insights; however, the precise mechanism of complex formation remains elusive. Similarly, the molecular impact of nucleocapsid NTD mutations that have emerged since 2019 has not yet been fully explored. Using crystallography and solution NMR, we investigate how NTD mutations influence structural integrity and RNA-binding. We find that both features rely on a core network of residues conserved in Betacoronaviruses, crucial for protein stability and communication among flexible loop-regions that facilitate RNA-recognition. Our comprehensive structural analysis demonstrates that contacts within this network guide selective RNA-interactions. We propose that the core network renders the NTD evolutionarily robust in stability and plasticity for its versatile RNA processing roles.

Here, the authors develop a platform for the generation of patient-derived B-cell lymphoma models (termed lymphomoids) which maintain the lymphoid tissue architecture, to enable drug screening. 
 The efficacy of anti-cancer therapies depends on the genomic composition of the tumor, its microenvironment, spatial organization, and intra-tumor heterogeneity. B-cell lymphomas are a heterogeneous group of tumors emerging from B-cells at different stages of differentiation and exhibiting tumor-specific interactions with the tumor microenvironment. Thus, the effect of drug treatments can be influenced by the tumor composition and functional interactions among immune cells. Here, we develop a platform to maintain small fragments of human lymphoma tissue in culture for several days, and use them to test response to small molecules. We collect 27 patient samples representative of different lymphoma subtypes, and establish ex vivo tissue fragments that retain histological, cellular, and molecular characteristics of the original tissue, here referred to as lymphomoids. Using lymphomoids, we test sensitivity to several clinically approved drugs in parallel and examine tissue remodeling upon treatment. Moreover, when this information is available, we show that the effect of the inhibitors observed in lymphomoids is consistent with the patients’ response in the clinic.

 The basolateral amygdala (BLA) is crucial for the encoding and expression of fear memory, yet it remains unexplored how neural activity in this region is dynamically influenced by distributed circuits across the brain to facilitate expression of fear memory of different ages. Using longitudinal multisite electrophysiological recordings in male mice, we find that the recall of older contextual fear memory is accompanied by weaker, yet more rhythmic, BLA gamma activity which is distally entrained by theta oscillations in both the hippocampal CA1 and the anterior cingulate cortex. Computational modeling with Light Gradient Boosting Machine using extracted oscillatory features from these three regions, as well as with Transformer using raw local field potentials, accurately classified remote from recent memory recall primarily based on BLA gamma and CA1 theta. These results demonstrate in a non-biased manner that multi-regional control of BLA activity serves as reliable neural signatures for memory age-dependent recall mechanisms.

 The world faces multiple water crises, including overextraction, flooding, ecosystem degradation and inequitable safe water access. Insufficient funding and ineffective implementation impede progress in water access, while, in part, a misdiagnosis of the causes has prioritized some responses over others (for example, hard over soft infrastructure). We reframe the responses to mitigating the world’s water crises using a ‘beyond growth’ framing and compare it to mainstream thinking. Beyond growth is systems thinking that prioritizes the most disadvantaged. It seeks to decouple economic growth from environmental degradation by overcoming policy capture and inertia and by fostering place-based and justice-principled institutional changes.

 The vulnerability of US offshore wind energy to tropical cyclones is a pressing concern, particularly along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts, key areas for offshore wind energy development. Assessing the impact of projected climate change on tropical cyclones, and consequently on offshore wind resources, is thus critical for effective risk management. Herein, we investigate the evolving risk to offshore wind turbines posed by Atlantic tropical cyclones in a non-stationary climate using a synthetic tropical cyclone model. Integrated with climate model simulations, projections show widespread increases in tropical cyclone exposure, with historical 20-year storms occurring every  ~12.7 years on average, increasing in intensity by about 9.3 ms−1. Subsequent fragility analysis reveals that the probabilities of turbine yielding and buckling from a 20-year tropical cyclone could increase by about 37% and 13%, respectively, with regional increases reaching up to 51%. These findings carry substantial implications for the operation and future expansion of offshore wind farms.

 Optimizing hydropower generation from the Nile upstream mega-dams during prolonged droughts while minimizing the downstream water deficit is the cornerstone in resolving the ongoing major water conflict in the Eastern Nile River Basin. A decade of negotiation and mediation has been unsuccessful, mainly due to the hydraulic uncertainties associated with operating the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam during prolonged droughts. Based on the negotiation outcomes, we provide comprehensive assessments of the efficiency of multiple drought-mitigation policies for the impact of dam operation. Our results suggest it can generate almost optimal hydropower without a noticeable downstream deficit during wet, average, and temporary drought flow conditions. For prolonged drought, we identify an ideal operation policy allowing the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam to generate a sustainable energy of 87% of its optimal hydropower without generating additional downstream water deficit. Furthermore, we provide four intermediate policies demonstrating enhanced upstream hydropower generation while minimizing dam-induced downstream water deficits. Our findings attempt to bridge the negotiation disparities in the Nile hydropower mega-dams operations during prolonged drought and foster an actionable and collaborative framework.

 High-quality and continuous satellite data are essential for land surface studies such as monitoring of land surface phenology, but factors such as cloud contamination and sensor malfunction degrade the quality of remote sensing images and limit their utilization. Filling gaps and recovering missing information in time series of remote sensing images are vital for a wide range of downstream applications, such as land surface phenology extraction. Most existing gap-filling and cloud removal methods focus on individual or multi-temporal image reconstruction, but struggle with continuous and overlapping missing areas in time series data. In this study, we propose a Temporal Attention-Based Multi-Scale Generative Adversarial Network (TAMGAN) to reconstruct time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data. TAMGAN leverages a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) with a 3-dimensional Convolution Neural Networks (3DCNN) in its generator to reconstruct the missing areas in the annual time series of remote sensing images simultaneously. The temporal attention blocks are designed to capture the changing trends of surface reflectance over time. And multi-scale feature extraction and progressive concatenation are introduced to enhance spectral consistency and provide detailed texture information. Experiments are carried out on MOD09A1 products to evaluate the performance of the proposed network. The results show that TAMGAN outperformed the comparison methods across various evaluation metrics, particularly in handling large and continuous missing areas in the time series. Furthermore, we showcase an example of downstream application by extracting phenological information from the gap-filled products. By effectively filling gaps and removing clouds, our method offers spatial-temporal continuous MODIS surface reflectance data, benefiting downstream applications such as phenology extraction and highlighting the potential of artificial intelligence technique in remote sense data processing."

Moreover, the analysis evaluates the partial role of urban vegetation in impacting all biogenic emissions. We found substantial increases in ozone due to these emissions, and about 10% of this increase is attributable to vegetation within urban areas. 
 The paper evaluates the long-term (2007–2016) impact of biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions on urban ozone patterns over central Europe, specifically focusing on the contribution of urban vegetation using a regional climate model coupled offline to a chemistry transport model. BVOCs are emitted by terrestrial ecosystems, and their impact is considered especially important over NOx-rich environments such as urban areas. The study evaluates the impact of BVOC emissions on ozone (O3), formaldehyde (HCHO), and hydroxyl radical (OH) near-surface concentrations, showing an increase in summer ozone by 6 %–10 % over large areas in central Europe due to their emissions. It also demonstrates a substantial increase in formaldehyde concentrations. Additionally, the impact of BVOC emissions on hydroxyl radical concentrations shows a decrease over most of the modeled region by 20 %–60 %, with some increases over urban areas. Impacts on peroxy radicals (HO2 and higher RO2) are shown too.Importantly, the study explores the partial role of urban vegetation in modulating ozone and evaluates its contribution to the overall ozone formation due to all BVOC emissions. The findings reveal that urban BVOC emissions contribute to around 10 % of the total impact on ozone and formaldehyde concentrations in urban areas, indicating their significant but localized influence.The study also conducts sensitivity analyses to assess the uncertainty arising from the calculation of the urban fraction of BVOC emissions. The results show that the impact of urban BVOC emissions responds to their magnitude nearly linearly, with variations up to 4-fold, emphasizing the importance of accurately quantifying the urban BVOC fluxes. Overall, the study sheds light on the intricate relationship between urban vegetation, BVOC emissions, and their impact on atmospheric chemistry, providing valuable insights into the regional chemistry of BVOC emissions over central Europe and the causes of urban ozone pollution."

Terminal velocity is fastest at Nyalam and slowest at Lhasa.  Five microphysical characteristics exhibit different correlations with altitude. Z–I relationships differ by site, and both exponential and gamma distributions fit DSD, with gamma parameters varying with altitude. 
 To enhance the precision of precipitation forecasting in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau region, a comprehensive study of both macro- and micro-characteristics of local precipitation is imperative. In this study, we investigated the particle size distribution, droplet velocity, droplet number density, Z–I (radar reflectivity–rainfall intensity) relationship, and gamma distribution of precipitation droplet spectra with a single precipitation duration of at least 20 min and precipitation of 5 mm or more at four stations (Nyalam, Lhasa, Shigatse, and Naqu) in Tibet during recent years from June to August. The results are as follows: (1) in the fitting relationship curve between precipitation raindrop spectral particle size and falling speed at the four stations in Tibet, when the particle size was less than 1.5 mm, the four lines essentially coincided. When the particle size exceeded 1.5 mm, the speed in Nyalam was the highest, followed by Naqu, and the speed in Lhasa was the lowest. The falling speed of particles correlated with altitude. (2) The five microphysical characteristics (mean diameter (Dm), average volume diameter (Dv), mode diameter (Dd), dominant diameter (Dp), and median diameter (Dnd)) at the four stations have different correlation relationships with altitude under different rainfall intensities. Dm exhibits a negative correlation with altitude at the same rainfall intensity; in contrast, Dv shows a positive correlation with altitude. For microphysical parameters such as Dd and Dp, a rainfall intensity of 10 mm h−1 serves as the boundary line, and they have different correlation relationships with altitude under the same rainfall intensity level. (3) The Z–I relationships at the four stations exhibited variations. Owing to the proximity in altitude between Lhasa and Shigatse, as well as between Nyalam and Nagqu, the coefficient a and index b in the Z–I relationships of the two groups of sites were relatively similar. (4) The fitting curves of the exponential and gamma distributions of the precipitation particle size at the aforementioned four stations are largely comparable. The exponential distribution fitting exhibits a slightly better effect. The parameter μ in the gamma distribution decreases with an increase in altitude, while N0 and λ in the exponential distribution show a clear upward trend with altitude."

Uncertainty in Vs impacts seismic hazard predictions. Stochastic procedures model this uncertainty, but must be calibrated using detailed geological data and Vs databases. This paper provides a new Vs profile database for Piedmont (NW Italy), integrating geological modeling and geophysical data, supporting similar studies in other regions. 
 The prediction of earthquake ground motions, and consequent seismic hazard of a specific area of study, is usually based on ground response evaluations of a statistical representative sample of possible soil and rock profiles. With this aim shear wave velocity (Vs) properties of the profiles are of paramount importance, given that uncertainty in this parameter play a major role in ground motion prediction and in its variability. Usually, stochastic procedures are adopted to model this uncertainty, and several stochastic approaches have been developed. These approaches should be however calibrated on detailed geological-geomorphological information and specific Vs profiles databases. Within this context the present paper is aimed to provide a new extensive database of Vs profiles over the Piedmont Region (NW Italy). These data are obtained through a specific workflow developed for their evaluation at the regional scale merging the information of specific geological-geomorphological modelling and devoted geophysical data collection. The obtained database (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13685087) could be used as the basis of Vs randomization approaches also in different geological contexts and results from the specific data analyses performed could be adopted as reference for similar materials in analogous geological contexts."

These innovations improve understanding of livestock seasonal dynamics and provide data for effective livestock management and policy-making. 
 Understanding the spatial-temporal distribution of grazing livestock is crucial for assessing the sustainability of livestock systems, managing animal diseases, mitigating climate change risks, and controlling greenhouse gas emissions. In China, grazing ruminants are mostly distributed across the vast grasslands in semi-humid and alpine areas. However, existing datasets of gridded distribution of grazing ruminants in China do not distinguish grazing ruminants with other livestock production systems, nor capture their long-term and seasonal dynamics, and tend to overestimate grazing livestock distribution. This study uses the county-level data from the Grassland Ecological Protection Subsidies to differentiate grazing livestock from other forms of livestock rearing. Interpretable machine learning models were used to detect the seasonality of grazing pasture and map the China’s long-term annual ruminant livestock distribution in grazing livestock production systems from 2000 to 2021 (CLRD-GLPS). The model's internal ten-fold cross-validation results (adjusted R2) for cattle ranged from 0.850 to 0.952 and for sheep from 0.780 to 0.836. External validation using province-level livestock meat production data yielded Pearson correlation coefficients of 0.83–0.88 for cattle and 0.92–0.94 for sheep, respectively. The CLRD-GLPS datasets provide more detailed, gridded information on local livestock distribution than census-based data. Compared to actual census data and the GLW datasets, they better capture the spatial-temporal dynamics of livestock distribution. Spatially, the largest cattle numbers on seasonal pastures were in the south-eastern edge of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP), while the largest sheep numbers were in north-eastern Qinghai and Xinjiang. Temporally (2000–2021), cattle numbers increased near the Three-River Source National Park and Helan Mountains, while sheep numbers decreased on seasonal pastures on the QTP, with no significant changes on year-round pastures in Inner Mongolia. The datasets provide essential information for understanding the spatial-temporal dynamics of grazing ruminants and formulating relevant livestock management policies, among other applications. Additionally, the research framework developed in this study can serve as a new framework for creating livestock distribution datasets in other regions and livestock production systems."

It combines prior sedimentation scenarios with chronological information such as dated horizons, dated intervals, stratigraphic links and (for ice cores) Δdepth observations. Paleochrono-1.1 is available under an open-source license. 
 Past climate and environmental changes can be reconstructed using paleoclimate archives such as ice cores, lake and marine sediment cores, speleothems, tree rings, and corals. The dating of these natural archives is crucial for deciphering the temporal sequence of events and rates of change during past climate changes. It is also essential to provide quantified estimates of the absolute and relative errors associated with the inferred chronologies. However, this task is complex since it involves combining different dating approaches at different paleoclimatic sites and often on different types of archives. Here we present Paleochrono-1.1, a new probabilistic model to derive a common and optimized chronology for several paleoclimatic sites with potentially different types of archives. Paleochrono-1.1 is based on the inversion of an archiving model: a varying deposition rate (also named growth rate, sedimentation rate or accumulation rate) and also (for ice cores) a lock-in depth of air (since, in the absence of significant surface melt, the air is trapped in the ice at about 50–120 m below the surface) and a thinning function (since glacier ice undergoes flow). Paleochrono-1.1 integrates several types of chronological information: prior knowledge of the archiving process, independently dated horizons, depth intervals of known duration, undated stratigraphic links between records, and (for ice cores) Δdepth observations (depth differences between events recorded synchronously in the gas and solid phases of a certain core). The optimization is formulated as a least-squares problem, assuming that all probability densities are near-Gaussian and that the model is nearly linear in the vicinity of the best solution. Paleochrono-1.1 is the successor of IceChrono, which produces common and optimized chronologies for ice cores. Paleochrono-1.1 outperforms IceChrono in terms of computational efficiency, ease of use and accuracy. We demonstrate the ability of Paleochrono-1.1 in an experiment involving only the MSL speleothem in Hulu Cave (China), and we compare the resulting age model with the Speleothem Isotope Synthesis and Analysis version 2 (SISALv2) age models. We then demonstrate the multi-archive capabilities of Paleochrono in a new ice-core–speleothem dating experiment, which combines the Antarctic Ice Core Chronology 2023 dating experiment, based on records from five polar ice cores, with data from two speleothems from Hulu Cave, dated using uranium / thorium radiometric techniques.

It shows that elemental mercury (Hg0) transfer velocity is more sensitive to wind speed. These findings may elucidate the discrepancies in previous estimations and offer insights into global Hg cycling. 
 The air–sea exchange of elemental mercury (Hg0) plays an important role in the global Hg cycle. Existing air–sea exchange models for Hg0 have not considered the impact of sea surfactants and wave breaking on the exchange velocity, leading to insufficient constraints on the flux of Hg0. In this study, we have improved the air–sea exchange model of Hg0 in the three-dimensional ocean transport model MITgcm (MIT General Circulation Model) by incorporating sea surfactants and wave-breaking processes through parameterization, utilizing the total organic carbon concentration and significant wave height data. The inclusion of these factors results in an increase of 62 %–225 % in the global transfer velocity of Hg0 relative to the baseline model. Air–sea exchange flux is increased in mid-latitude to high-latitude regions with high wind and wave-breaking efficiency, while it is reduced by surfactant and concentration change at low latitudes with low wind speeds and in nearshore areas with low wave heights. Compared with previous parameterizations, the updated model demonstrates a stronger dependence of Hg0 air–sea exchange velocity on wind speed. Our results also provide a theoretical explanation for the large variances in estimated transfer velocity between different schemes."

 This study presents DalROMS-NWA12 v1.0, a coupled ocean circulation–sea ice–biogeochemistry modelling system for the northwest Atlantic Ocean (NWA) in which the circulation and biogeochemistry modules are based on ROMS (Regional Ocean Modeling System). The circulation module is coupled to a sea ice module based on the Community Ice CodE (CICE), and the physical ocean state simulated by the circulation module drives the biogeochemical module. Study of the biological carbon pump in the NWA is one of the main intended applications of this model. Global atmospheric and ocean reanalyses are used to force DalROMS-NWA12 at the sea surface and as part of its lateral boundary input, respectively. The modelling system is also forced by tides, riverine freshwater input, and continental runoff. The physical ocean state and sea ice from two simulations of the period 2015–2018, with and without nudging of the simulated temperature and salinity towards a blend of observations and reanalysis, are examined in this study. Statistical comparisons between model results and observations or reanalyses show that the control (nudged) simulation outperforms the prognostic (un-nudged) simulation in reproducing the paths of the Gulf Stream and the West Greenland Current, as well as propagation of the estuarine plume in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. The prognostic simulation performs better in simulating the sea ice concentration. The biogeochemical module, which is run only in the control simulation, performs reasonably well in reproducing the observed spatiotemporal variations in oxygen, nitrate, alkalinity, and total inorganic carbon. To examine the effects of tides and sea ice on the physical fields in the study area, results of simulations from which either component is absent are compared to results of the prognostic simulation. In the absence of tides, Ungava Bay in summer experiences a simulated surface salinity that is higher by up to ∼7 psu than in the simulation with tides, as well as experiencing changes in horizontal distributions of surface temperature and sea ice. Without coupling to the sea ice module, the circulation module produces summertime sea surface temperatures that are higher by up to ∼5 °C in Baffin Bay."

The newly developed HCMROMS is expected to become an effective modeling tool for studying the multi-scale and multi-sphere interactions associated with ENSO in the tropical Pacific. 
 The El Niño and Southern Oscillation (ENSO) constitutes the most prominent interannual climate variation mode in the climate system, originating from ocean-atmosphere interactions in the tropical Pacific. Accurately modeling ENSO variation has consistently posed a great challenge, exhibiting strong model-dependent representations and simulations of ENSO. This study presents a novel Hybrid Coupled Model (HCM), denoted as HCMROMS, built upon the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) that has been widely used for regional modeling studies. For basin-wide applications to the tropical Pacific, here, the ROMS is incorporated with a statistical atmospheric model, which is based on singular value decomposition (SVD), capturing interannual relationships of atmospheric perturbations such as wind stress and freshwater flux anomalies with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. The model is constructed in a flexible way so that various components representing atmospheric forcing and oceanic biogeochemistry can be easily included as a module in the HCMROMS. Results demonstrate that the HCMROMS can simulate a stable quasi-three-year ENSO cycle when the interannual wind stress coupling coefficient, ατ , is set at 1.5. The HCMROMS reproduces the three-dimensional (3D) evolution of ENSO-related anomalies, revealing that the most pronounced temperature anomalies occur beneath the surface at 150 m. The interannual temperature anomaly budget highlights the dominance of the advection process in the simulated ENSO. Vertical mixing contributes negatively to ENSO anomalies, damping temperature anomalies from the surface due to the turbulent heat flux feedback. This newly developed HCMROMS is poised to serve as an efficient modeling tool for ENSO research in the future."

Our algorithm's main advantage is loss-less utilization of atmospheric information provided by numerical weather prediction models. 
 Electromagnetic signals commonly used in geodetical applications, such as the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS), undergo bending and delay in the neutral gas atmosphere of the Earth. The least-travel-time (LTT) concept is one of the approaches to model signal slant delays via a ray tracing (RT) procedure. In this study, we developed an LTT-based RT algorithm (LTT v2), where the 3-dimensional refractivity field of the atmosphere is based on the atmospheric model data. This representation is complete in a sense that the domain of the RT conforms to the native grid geometry of the atmospheric model. In addition, some physical and numerical approximations are improved compared to the previous version (LTT v1). The atmospheric states are generated using a global numerical weather prediction model, the Open Integrated Forecast System of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. The slant delays of LTT v2 are compared with the products of the original least-travel-time GNSS delay model (LTT v1) and the products of the state-of-the-art VieVS Ray Tracer (RADIATE). The skill of slant delay estimation is assessed using metrics that are indicative of the quality of GNSS products derived using the GROOPS (Gravity Recovery Object Oriented Programming System) orbit solver software toolkit of the Graz University of Technology. Employment of slant delay products of the LTT RT algorithm shows radical improvement in GNSS processing. When using LTT v2 delay estimates, the GNSS orbit midnight discontinuities are reduced by more than 10 % compared to RADIATE, and more than 2 % compared to LTT v1.

Copper bioavailability depended on the phytoplankton Cu nutritional state and whether Cu′ diffusion to the cell surface was sufficient to meet the cellular demands for growth. Under Cu-limiting conditions when [Cu′] was less than the diffusion concentration threshold (DCT: 10–14.13 M), growth rate was a hyperbolic function of [Cu-L]. Increasing [Cu′] above the DCT caused growth rate to increase proportionally, but growth rate also increased with increasing [Cu-L] so that both Cu′ and Cu-L were bioavailable. Short-term photosynthesis assays conducted under Cu-limiting conditions showed a similar response to Cu speciation. In contrast, the growth rate of Cu-inhibited cells at high [Cu′] varied inversely with [Cu2+] and was independent of [Cu-L], as previously reported.

In this study, we investigated the surface structures and desorption-free energies of U(VI) species (UO22+) and As(V) species (H2AsO4– and HAsO42–) complexed at different edge surface reactive sites of a cis-vacant montmorillonite layer using first-principles molecular dynamics (FPMD). We show that U(VI) forms bidentate and tridentate complexes on montmorillonite edge surfaces, whereas As(V) monodentate complexes are the most stable. Then, we constrained a state-of-the-art surface complexation model (SCM) with surface acid–base chemistry and surface complexation properties obtained from the molecular-level simulation results. While our results highlighted the complexity of the interfacial chemistry controlling the complexation of inorganic contaminants on clay mineral surfaces, they also evidenced the reliability of an integrated workflow using modern multiscale simulation techniques to address the challenge of predicting heterogeneities in mineral surface reactivity."

This study evaluated the transformation of AFFF-derived ECF-based precursors in aerobic soil microcosms amended with a historically used AFFF formulation (3M Light WaterTM). Fifteen classes of PFAS, including AFFF components and transformation products, were identified or tentatively identified by suspect screening/nontargeted analysis (SSA/NTA) throughout a 308-day incubation. This study demonstrates that AFFF-derived ECF-based precursors serve as sources of perfluoroalkane sulfonamides (FASAs) and perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs), which are commonly detected at AFFF-impacted sites. Temporal sampling provided evidence for biotransformation of multiple precursors including tri- or dimethyl ammonio propyl perfluoroalkane sulfonamides. Additionally, the environmental stability (i.e., resistance to transformation) of ECF-based precursors was found to depend upon structural characteristics, including perfluoroalkyl chain length, presence of sulfonamide or carboxamide groups, and functional groups (e.g., a branch of carboxyalkyl group) attached to the nitrogen atoms. These findings provide insights into the transformation pathways of AFFF-derived PFAS and other structurally similar ECF-based PFAS, which will support the management and remediation of PFAS contamination at legacy AFFF-impacted sites."

In a panel study of 110 nonsmoking, healthy college students in Lhasa, Tibet, indoor PM2.5 was monitored using calibrated low-cost sensors for two multiweek periods, in over 40 dormitories where participants resided. We also repeatedly measured fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), an acute respiratory inflammation biomarker, for each participant. Time-averaged indoor PM2.5 concentrations in individual dormitories ranged from 3.2 to 30 μg/m3 in the summer and from 3.6 to 57 μg/m3 in the fall, in most cases exceeding the outdoor level (4.3 and 4.9 μg/m3, respectively). The hourly mean indoor PM2.5 concentrations displayed a clear trimodal diel pattern, with peaks coincident with periods of increased activities. Further questionnaire-based analysis suggests that incense burning and smoking contributed to elevated levels of indoor PM2.5. Overnight PM2.5 levels in the dormitories were significantly associated with increased FeNO the following morning, with the effects attenuated as the hourly lag increased. In contrast, inconclusive associations were observed for ambient PM2.5.

We also evaluated the partitioning behavior of the viruses between the liquid and solid fractions of influent wastewater. We found that assaying the liquid fraction of the wastewater resulted in more sensitive detection of the viruses despite the fact that the viral RNA was enriched in the solid fraction due to the low solids content of the influent wastewater. Finally, we investigated the stability of measles, mumps, and rubella RNA in wastewater samples spiked with viruses over 28 days at two different concentrations and two temperatures (4 °C and room temperature) and through freeze–thaw and observed limited viral decay.

Phytoplankton exhibit trade-offs in functional traits between growth rate and antipredation defense, thereby regulating these trophic interactions. However, the combined effects of eutrophication and such trait-based regulation on plankton communities and interactions remain poorly understood. In the present study, we investigated these effects by integrating trait-based mechanistic modeling and field observations in China’s eutrophic Pearl River Estuary. Our model predicted that the species with the weakest defensive capacities dominated under nutrient-poor conditions. As eutrophication increased, a concave growth–defense trade-off favored species with high growth rates and strong defense capacities, whereas a convex trade-off curve favored species that were either the least or the most well-defended. High grazing pressure accelerated these shifts. In the estuary, similar patterns emerged in the relative abundance of different phytoplankton species along a gradient of the nitrogen to phosphorus ratio (N:P), indicating changes from high nutrient uptake and low grazing under oligotrophic conditions to eutrophic conditions, in which some phytoplankton face considerable grazing pressure despite high nutrient uptake, whereas others grow slowly with less grazing pressure. These results enhance our understanding of trait-based plankton interactions in eutrophic bodies of water and provide support for more effective conservation and management strategies."

A key process is the co-boiling at the water–NAPL interface, which lowers the boiling point due to combined vapor pressures, potentially reducing energy needs. However, determining the optimal end time for heating is challenging due to the invisible nature of underground NAPL, often resulting in excessive energy use. The initial NAPL pool size and distance from the heat source influence the spatiotemporal evolution of the NAPL–water interface, defining three zones: the co-boiling equilibrium zone, a nonequilibrium zone, and an unaffected zone. The temperature data collected by fixed temperature sensors can reflect the spatiotemporal evolution of these zones, offering valuable insights into NAPL removal. This study tackles these challenges using a two-dimensional visualized sandbox integrated with real-time image processing and an array of temperature sensors to monitor the NAPL removal and temperature variation. The results reveal semiquantitatively the impact of different initial NAPL amounts and spatial distributions on temperature variations. An optimized strategy is proposed for temperature sensor positioning, and a qualitative relationship is established between the temperature increase and NAPL removal.

This study estimates net GHG emissions of nations from the consumption perspective, considering both GHG sources and sinks influenced by human activities.

GHG footprints in tropical nations would be significantly underestimated if only sources are considered and sink changes are neglected, especially in Indonesia (counting 65% of its GHG footprints) and Africa (44%). After considering sink changes, the consumption of processed foods and animal products exerted larger impacts on GHG footprints of tropical nations, which is mainly attributed to emissions from forest conversion; and the GHG leakage through international trade from tropical nations (e.g., Indonesia) to other nations (e.g., India and the United States) was more prominent.

The Great Plains low‐level jet (GPLLJ) is one of the major sources of moisture transport into this region, and concerns over moisture extremes already seen in the interior U.S. have been linked to changes in GPLLJ. However, the relationship between GPLLJ and precipitation in this region remains uncertain, with studies showing conflicting results that may be related to distinct types of jet events. Here, we use daily GPLLJ data to study connections between different types of jet events and precipitation, integrated water vapor transport, and synoptic conditions to better understand GPLLJ‐streamflow linkages. We assess GPLLJ conditions during historical flood events and potential future changes using CMIP6 projections. We find: (a) in May–September, GPLLJ is associated with 29%–46% of monthly precipitation and with increased precipitation intensity; (b) GPLLJ has a consistently positive impact on Missouri River streamflow over the warm season; (c) coupled jets have a larger impact on moisture transport than uncoupled jets, but streamflow impact is reduced, likely due to seasonal timing; (d) unusual jet conditions preceded historical warm‐season flood events; and (e) future projections indicate relatively small changes in GPLLJ meridional wind velocities along with large increases in moisture transport driven by humidity increases. Although future streamflow will be partially dependent on snowmelt from the upper basin, the projected intensification of warm‐season moisture transport to the Missouri River suggests possible increases in future flood risk."
10.1029/2024JD041566,False,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文主要研究华北地区干旱与土壤-大气耦合之间的关系。它利用ERA5再分析数据，定义了干耦合和湿耦合两种状态，并提出了一个标准化耦合干旱指数(SCDI)来描述干旱的时空演变。研究发现，干耦合加剧了土壤干旱和大气干燥，而湿耦合则有利于干旱的恢复。该研究关注的是陆面过程与大气环流的相互作用，而非大气环境遥感技术本身。虽然研究使用了再分析数据，但这是一种数据产品，而非遥感技术的直接应用。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['soil moisture', 'vapor pressure deficit', 'land-atmosphere coupling', 'drought monitoring', 'meteorological reanalysis']",Shuwen Zhang;Lan Wang;Chentao He,Dry Coupling Aggravates Soil Drought and Atmospheric Aridity Over North China,"The north China region frequently experiences drought during the warm season, significantly impacting the local water cycle and socioeconomic life. To better understand the role that local land‐atmosphere (L‐A) coupling plays in the modulation of drought, we utilize 40 years of the fifth generation of European Re‐Analysis (ERA5) data set. With the aid of two metrics, that is, convective triggering potential (CTP) and low‐layer humidity index (HI) that classify the local L‐A coupling into four regimes, we identify days characterized by dry and wet coupling patterns in the region and define a standardized coupling drought index (SCDI) based on the relative number of dry and wet coupling days over a period of time. The results show that on the dry coupling day, the atmosphere exhibits a higher demand for moisture with an increased net radiation and surface sensible heat flux, and a reduced latent heat flux, so the dry coupling promotes drying. Similarly, the wet coupling promotes wetting. During the dry coupling events (i.e., multiple days with similar coupling states), the positive feedback between soil moisture and atmospheric humidity, along with atmospheric conditions unfavorable for precipitation, result in a continuous decrease in soil moisture and an increase in vapor pressure deficit, which sustain and intensify both soil drought and atmospheric aridity. In contrast, wet coupling events are conducive to drought recovery. The SCDI effectively captures the spatiotemporal evolution of drought across varying intensities, showing that dry and wet coupling play an important role in the persistence and recovery of drought in north China."

In this paper, we present the first time‐resolved leader spectra of the optical component associated with a downward TGF. The TGF was observed by the Telescope Array Surface Detector (TASD) simultaneously with other lightning detectors, including a Lightning Mapping Array (LMA), an INTerFerometer (INTF), a Fast Antenna (FA), and a spectroscopic system. The spectroscopic system recorded leader spectra at 29,900 frames per second (33.44 μ ${\upmu }$s time resolution), covering a spectral range from 400 to 900 nm, with 2.1 nm per pixel. The recordings of the leader spectra began 11.7 ms before the −18 ${-}18$ kA return stroke and at a height of 2.37 km above the ground. These spectra reveal that optical emissions of singly ionized nitrogen and oxygen occur between 167 μ ${\upmu }$s before and 267 μ ${\upmu }$s after the TGF detection, while optical emissions of neutrals (H I, 656 nm; N I, 744 nm, and O I, 777 nm) occur right at the moment of the detection. The time‐dependent spectra reveal differences in the optical emissions of lightning leaders with and without downward TGFs."

 Paratyphoid B fever (PTB) is caused by an invasive lineage (phylogroup 1, PG1) of Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi B (SPB). However, little was known about the global population structure, geographic distribution, and evolution of this pathogen. Here, we report a whole-genome analysis of 568 historical and contemporary SPB PG1 isolates, obtained globally, between 1898 and 2021. We show that this pathogen existed in the 13th century, subsequently diversifying into 11 lineages and 38 genotypes with strong phylogeographic patterns. Following its discovery in 1896, it circulated across Europe until the 1970s, after which it was mostly reimported into Europe from South America, the Middle East, South Asia, and North Africa. Antimicrobial resistance recently emerged in various genotypes of SPB PG1, mostly through mutations of the quinolone-resistance-determining regions of gyrA and gyrB. This study provides an unprecedented insight into SPB PG1 and essential genomic tools for identifying and tracking this pathogen, thereby facilitating the global genomic surveillance of PTB.

 Driven by human ingenuity and creativity, the discovery of super-resolution techniques, which circumvent the classical diffraction limit of light, represent a leap in optical microscopy. However, the vast space encompassing all possible experimental configurations suggests that some powerful concepts and techniques might have not been discovered yet, and might never be with a human-driven direct design approach.

Here, the authors show that cyanobacterial endosymbionts expressing plastidic ADP/ATP carrier translocases from red algae and glaucophyte support photosynthesis-driven bioenergetic endosymbiosis, but not those from green land plants. 
 Cyanobacterial photosynthesis (to produce ATP and NADPH) might have played a pivotal role in the endosymbiotic evolution to chloroplast. However, rather than meeting the ATP requirements of the host cell, the modern-day land plant chloroplasts are suggested to utilize photosynthesized ATP predominantly for carbon assimilation. This is further highlighted by the fact that the plastidic ADP/ATP carrier translocases from land plants preferentially import ATP. Here, we investigate the preferences of plastidic ADP/ATP carrier translocases from key lineages of photosynthetic eukaryotes including red algae, glaucophytes, and land plants. Particularly, we observe that the cyanobacterial endosymbionts expressing plastidic ADP/ATP carrier translocases from red algae and glaucophyte are able to export ATP and support ATP dependent endosymbiosis, whereas those expressing ADP/ATP carrier translocases from land plants preferentially import ATP and are unable to support ATP dependent endosymbiosis. These data are consistent with a scenario where the ancestral plastids may have exported ATP to support the bioenergetic functions of the host cell. Cyanobacterial bioenergetics may have driven chloroplast evolution.

Here, authors identify two molecularly distinct sympathetic pathways that independently control the adrenal medulla and intestine. 
 The sympathetic nervous system is crucial for responding to environmental changes. This regulation is coordinated by the spinal sympathetic preganglionic neurons (SPNs), innervating both postganglionic neurons and the adrenal gland. Despite decades of research supporting the concept of selective control within this system, the neural circuit organization responsible for the output specificity remains poorly understood. Here, by combining recent single-cell transcriptome data with viral-genetic toolkits in mice, we identify two subtypes of SPNs in the lower thoracic spinal cord, defined at the molecular level, exhibiting nonoverlapping patterns of innervation: one specifically projecting to the celiac/superior mesenteric ganglia, and the other targeting the adrenal grand. Chemogenetic manipulations on these distinct SPN subtypes revealed selective impacts on the motility of the gastrointestinal tracts or glucose metabolism mediated by the adrenal gland, respectively. This molecularly delineated parallel labeled-line organization in sympathetic outflows presents a potential avenue for selectively manipulating organ functions. How individual organs are specifically regulated by the sympathetic neurons at the cellular level remains not fully understood.

Here, the authors present a self-repairing Pd-C laterally condensed catalyst that improves selectivity, prevents sub-surface hydride formation, and achieves high ethylene productivity, effectively bridging the gap between powder catalysts and single-crystal model catalysts. 
 Future carbon management strategies require storage in elemental form, achievable through a sequence of CO2 hydrogenation reactions. Hydrogen is recycled from molecular intermediates by dehydrogenation, and side product acetylene selectively hydrogenated to ethylene. Existing Pd alloy catalysts for gas purification underperform in concentrated feeds, necessitating novel concepts. Atomistic simulations unveil superior selectivity of Pd:C solid solutions that optimize chemisorption energies and preclude sub-surface hydrides, verified here with model thin films. Multiple design criteria deduced from conventional catalysts facilitate synthesizing a self-repairing Pd:C system of a laterally condensed catalyst (LCC). A Pd layer prepared on a designated SiO2 buffer layer enables control of reactive interface, sub-surface volume and extended functional interface towards the buffer. Function and metric are supervised by operando micro-spectroscopy. This catalyst design shows, ethylene productivity >1 kmolC2H4/gPd/hour is reproducibly achieved and benchmarked against known catalysts. Photovoltaics deposition technologies enable scalability on real-world substrates saving active metal. A design-of-experiment approach demonstrates the improvement potential of the LCC approach. The selective hydrogenation of trace acetylene to ethylene is a well-established process for purifying fossil-derived ethylene streams.

The strongest warming occurred at cold bedrock at the highest elevations and latitudes or after permafrost degraded. 
 Mountain permafrost, constituting 30% of the global permafrost area, is sensitive to climate change and strongly impacts mountain ecosystems and communities. This study examines 21st century permafrost warming in European mountains using decadal ground temperature data from sixty-four boreholes in the Alps, Scandinavia, Iceland, Sierra Nevada and Svalbard. During 2013–2022, warming rates at 10 metres depth exceed 1 °C dec−1 in cases, generally surpassing previous estimates because of accelerated warming and the use of a comprehensive data set. Substantial permafrost warming occurred at cold and ice-poor bedrock sites at high elevations and latitudes, at rates comparable to surface air temperature increase. In contrast, latent heat effects in ice-rich ground near 0 °C reduce warming rates and mask important changes of mountain permafrost substrates. The warming patterns observed are consistent across all sites, depths and time periods. For the coming decades, the propagation of permafrost warming to greater depths is largely predetermined already.

 Anthropogenic nitrogen inputs from the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin have caused substantial environmental challenges in the northern Gulf of Mexico, such as coastal eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and seasonal hypoxia. Addressing these issues requires a better understanding of the complex sources of nitrogen, which include fertilizers, groundwater, manure, and sewage. In this study, we analyzed the nitrogen isotopic composition of dissolved nitrate and particulate nitrogen from the Wax Lake Delta, a major distributary of the Mississippi-Atchafalaya River Basin that flows into the Gulf of Mexico. Our findings revealed that during the wet season, δ15N values of both nitrate and particulate nitrogen were consistently 2-3‰ lower compared to the dry season. This suggests that fertilizer-derived nitrogen, which has lower δ15N, is predominantly exported to the Gulf of Mexico during periods of high water discharge. These findings imply that adjusting fertilizer application timing could help reduce nitrogen loading and mitigate its environmental impact on the Gulf of Mexico.

 Urban planners and other stakeholders often view trees as the ultimate panacea for mitigating urban heat stress; however, their cooling efficacy varies globally and is influenced by three primary factors: tree traits, urban morphology, and climate conditions.

 NASA's Global Ecosystem Dynamic Investigation (GEDI) mission provides billions of lidar samples of canopy structure over the Earth's temperate and pantropical forests. Using the GEDI sample data alone, gridded height and biomass products have been created at a spatial resolution of 1 km or coarser. However, this resolution may be too coarse for some applications. In this study, we present a new method of mapping high spatial resolution forest height across large areas using fusion of data acquired by GEDI and TanDEM-X (TDX) Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR). Our method utilizes GEDI waveforms to provide vertical profiles of scatterers needed to invert a physically-based InSAR model to solve for canopy height. We then use 2-year GEDI canopy height and adaptive wavenumber (kZ)-based calibration models to reduce errors in the inverted canopy height caused by the limited penetration capability of the X-band signal in dense tropical forests and the impact of terrain. We apply this novel method over large areas including Gabon, Mexico, French Guiana and most of the Amazon basin, and generate continuous forest height products at 25 m and 100 m. After validating against airborne lidar data, we find that our canopy height products have a bias of 0.31 m and 0.46 m, and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 8.48 m (30.02 %) and 6.91 m (24.08 %) at 25 m and 100 m respectively, for all sites combined. Compared to existing data products that integrate GEDI with passive optical data using machine learning approaches, our method reduces bias, has a lower RMSE, and does not saturate for tall canopy heights up to 56 m. A key feature of this study is that our canopy height product is complemented with an uncertainty of prediction map which provides information on the predictor's uncertainty around the actual value —an advancement over the standard error maps used in earlier studies, which provide uncertainty around the expectation of the predicted value. This integration approach enables the first-ever accurate and high-resolution mapping of forest canopy heights at unprecedented large areas from GEDI and TDX InSAR data fusion, serving as an essential foundation for pantropical aboveground biomass mapping."

 Domain adaptation is crucial for information integration of remote sensing systems, such as satellite constellations and space stations, to intelligently achieving full domain awareness. The conventional methods focus on aligning spatial features without fully considering the topological structure and semantic information in the scene, resulting in loss of useful information and suboptimal classification results. This situation becomes more severe and further complicated to deal with under the condition of few labels available in the source domain. To address the above problems, a spatial-topological-semantic alignment method called STSA is proposed to implement unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) with few source labels, fully exploring multiple types of information and their complementarity in remote sensing images (RSIs). The proposed method is applied to complete the classification task on a multi-modal cross-domain datasets with synthetic aperture radar (SAR), thermal infrared (TI), near infrared (NI), and short wavelength infrared (SW) images derived from Chinese Tiangong-2 manned spacecraft, as well as a Single modal cross-domain datasets with optical images. Compared with the state of the art UDA methods, even with only one labeled RSI in the source domain, the proposed methods still perform better and achieve satisfying accuracy.

 Effectively leveraging landslide spatial location information is crucial for improving the accuracy of deep learning in predicting landslide susceptibility and exploring the impacts of predisposing factors. Current single deep learning models for landslide susceptibility assessment require enhancements in both prediction accuracy and robustness. Inclusion of non-interrelated positional information among samples leads to reduced prediction accuracy and challenges in quantifying landslide risk covariates. This study proposes a landslide susceptibility assessment method that integrates ensemble learning with geographically weighted concepts. Using a stacking method, a 1D convolutional neural network (1D-CNN), a recurrent neural network (RNN), and a long short-term memory (LSTM) network were combined to form the CRNN-LSTM ensemble model. Additionally, we constructed a deep learning geographically weighted regression (GW-DNN) model based on the deep learning principles and geographically weighted regression to quantify the impacts of landslide-predisposing factors.The experimental results show that the CRNN-LSTM model achieved AUC values of 0.977 and 0.961 on the training and validation sets, significantly outperforming the individual classifiers (AUC of 0.944 and 0.940 for the 1D-CNN model, 0.950 and 0.948 for the RNN model, and 0.956 and 0.952 for the LSTM model). Additionally, the GW-DNN model achieved R2 coefficients of 0.876 and 0.860 during the training and validation phases. These findings indicate that our proposed method not only highly accurately predicts landslide susceptibility but also provides a precise quantitative assessment of the impact of landslide-predisposing factors at specific spatial points (landslide units) in high-risk areas. These findings offer valuable technical support for landslide disaster prevention and mitigation."

 Building generalization is an essential task in generating multi-scale topographic maps. The progress of deep learning offers a new paradigm to overcome the coordination challenges faced by conventional building generalization algorithms. Some studies have confirmed the feasibility of several original semantic segmentation networks, such as U-Net and its variants and the conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN), for building generalization in image maps. However, they suffer from critical deformation effects, especially for large and geometrically complex buildings. Since learning building generalization essentially means modeling the subtle transformation of building footprints across scales, we argue that the spatial awareness of a neural network, for instance, regarding building size and shape, is crucial to effective learning. Thus, we propose a spatially-aware generative adversarial network, SpaGAN. It takes a representative cGAN, pix2pix, as the backbone, and modifies two modules: In the U-Net-based generator, an atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) module replaces the conventional convolutional module to extract multi-scale features of buildings of varying sizes and shapes; in the PatchGAN-based discriminator, a signed distance map (SDM) module is used to capture the fine-grained shape difference for discrimination. The proposed network was comprehensively evaluated with a synthetic and a real-world dataset. The results demonstrate that SpaGAN outperforms existing baseline models (U-Net, ResU-Net, pix2pix) for building generalization, particularly in the real-world dataset. The new model can achieve more reasonable aggregation, simplification, and squaring generalization operators."

 In 2021, an exceptionally intense autumn rainfall event occurred in West China (WC), breaking historical precipitation records since 1961. A notable northward migration of rainfall center was observed during the season. This study utilized real-time forecast data from the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts) and CMA (China Meteorological Administration) models under the S2S (Subseasonal-to-Seasonal Prediction) project to examine the subseasonal predictability of the extreme ARWC event and its associated systems, providing a theoretical basis for forecasting extreme autumn rainfall. The results showed that both models underestimated the observed anomalous precipitation, however, ECMWF was able to predict the spatial distribution and intensity of different phases of the event up to 8 days in advance, while the CMA model exhibited poor skill. ECMWF and CMA both successfully predicted the intraseasonal northward migration of the rainfall 8 days and 5 days in advance, respectively. Further analysis revealed that ECMWF and CMA can reproduce the mid–high-latitude wave patterns associated with the intraseasonal variations in the EAWJ at lead times of 1–10 days, contributing to better predictions of the intraseasonal northward migration of the rainfall. Their ability to predict the tropical convection differed, with ECMWF more accurately reproducing the anomalous dipole tropical convection activities over the Indo-Pacific Warm Pool and the central-eastern Pacific 1–22 days in advance, and the characteristic that the convection eventually weakens over the maritime continent. This led to better predictions of the intraseasonal variations of the WPSH, giving the ECMWF model a higher forecasting skill for both periods of the extreme ARWC in 2021 compared to the CMA model."

 A deep convective system affected the southern Mediterranean on 3–4 December 2022 causing heavy rains and wind gusts over three Italian regions (Sicily, Calabria, and Apulia) and a tornado in Calabria. We study the forecast sensitivity of this multi-hazard weather event to different physical parameterizations and configuration settings of the WRF (Weather Research and Forecasting) model, used at convection permitting horizontal resolution; in particular, we performed sensitivity tests on the role of the initial and boundary conditions, on the Sea Surface Temperature (SST), on the model horizontal resolution and on the cumulus parameterization. Moreover, a 6 h rapid update data assimilation analysis (3DVAR)/forecast cycle was investigated to further study the short-term forecast capabilities of the modeling system. Most of the WRF configurations are able to well simulate the characteristics of the weather system, even if there are differences among the configurations, especially at the local scale, which causes differences in forecast performances. We found that the quality of the forecast is sensitive to the initial and boundary conditions with the best members having a probability of detection around 30–40 % for rainfall intensities of 40–50 mm/6 h. Most of the forecasts decrease their performance for larger precipitation thresholds, with few exceptions. Specifically, we found that increasing the horizontal resolution was beneficial for the case study as the probability of detection remains larger than 0.2 for rainfall thresholds larger than 60 mm/6 h and up to 100 mm/6 h. In addition, the forecast with lightning and radar reflectivity data assimilation has a probability of detection larger than 0.4 for the same intense thresholds; in both cases false alarms are not increased.

Gas-phase chemistry greatly underestimated formic and acetic acid, indicating missing sources, while cloud chemistry was a key source of oxalic acid. More studies of organic acids are required to better constrain their sources. 
 Organic acids represent an important class of compounds in the atmosphere,  but there is limited research investigating their chemical production, particularly in the northeast United States. To improve our understanding of organic acid sources, a modeling analysis was performed for air masses reaching the summit of Whiteface Mountain (WFM), New York,  where measurements of organic acids in cloud water have been collected. The analysis focuses on a pollution event associated with a heat wave that occurred on 1–2 July 2018 that exhibited unusually high concentrations of formic (HCOOH), acetic (CH3COOH), and oxalic (OxAc) acid in cloud water.  The gas-phase production of organic acids for this pollution event was modeled using a combination of the regional transport model Weather Research and Forecasting Model with Chemistry (WRF-Chem), which gives information on transport and environmental factors affecting air parcels reaching WFM, and the Lagrangian chemical box model BOXMOX, which allows analysis of chemistry with different chemical mechanisms. Two chemical mechanisms are used in BOXMOX:  (1) the Model for Ozone and Related chemical Tracers (MOZART T1) and (2) the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) version 3.3.1.  The WRF-Chem results show that air parcels sampled during the pollution event at WFM originated in central Missouri, which has strong biogenic emissions of isoprene. Many air parcels were influenced by emissions of nitrogen oxides (NOx) from the Chicago metropolitan area. The gas-phase oxidation of isoprene and its related oxidation products was the major source of HCOOH and CH3COOH,  but both mechanisms substantially underproduced both acids compared to observations. A simple gas–aqueous mechanism was included to investigate the role of aqueous chemistry in organic acid production. Aqueous chemistry did not produce more HCOOH or CH3COOH, suggesting missing chemical sources of both acids. However this aqueous chemistry was able to explain the elevated concentrations of OxAc. Anthropogenic NOx emissions from Chicago had little overall impact on the production of all three organic acids.

 High-resolution three-dimensional (3D) wind velocity measurements are of major importance for the characterization of atmospheric turbulence. The use of a multi-beam wind lidar focusing on a measurement volume from different directions is a promising approach for obtaining such wind data. This paper provides a detailed study of the propagation of measurement uncertainty of a three-beam wind lidar designed for mounting on airborne platforms with geometrical constraints that lead to increased measurement uncertainties of the wind components transverse to the main axis of the system. The uncertainty analysis is based on synthetic wind data generated by an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process as well as on experimental wind data from airborne and ground-based 3D ultrasonic anemometers. For typical atmospheric conditions, we show that the measurement uncertainty of the transverse components can be reduced by about 30 %–50 % by applying an appropriate post-processing algorithm. Optimized post-processing parameters can be determined in an actual experiment by characterizing measured data in terms of variance and correlation time of wind fluctuations, allowing for the optimized design of a multi-beam wind lidar with strong geometrical limitations."

 This work presents a cross-shaped moored array dataset (MASCS 1.0) comprising five buoys and four moorings with synchronous atmospheric and oceanic data in the northern South China Sea during 2014–2015. The atmospheric data are observed by two meteorological instruments at the buoys. The oceanic data consist of sea surface waves measured using a wave recorder, temperature, and salinity from the surface to a depth of 400 m and at 10 and 50 m above the ocean bottom using conductivity, temperature, and depth recorders. They also include currents from the surface to a depth of 850 m measured using acoustic Doppler current profilers and measured at 10, 50, and 100 m above the floor using current meters. Additional measurements were taken for sea surface radiation, air visibility, chlorophyll, turbidity, and chromophoric dissolved organic matter at buoy 3 located at the center of the moored array. The data reveal air–sea interactions and oceanic processes in the upper and bottom ocean, especially the transition of the air–sea interface and ocean conditions from summer to winter monsoon and the effects of six tropical cyclones on the moored array. Multiscale processes were also recorded, such as air–sea fluxes, tides, internal waves, and low-frequency flows.

Dias,Tracer-based Rapid Anthropogenic Carbon Estimation (TRACE),"We infer ocean gas exchange and circulation from ocean tracer measurements and use this to create code to estimate the amount of carbon dioxide dissolved in the ocean that is there due to human emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. The code works across the ocean depths for the past, present, or future from information about the location, temperature, and saltiness of the seawater. We produce a data product with estimates throughout the ocean throughout the last ~300 and next ~500 years. 
 The ocean is one of the largest sinks for anthropogenic carbon (Canth) and its removal of CO2 from the atmosphere has been valued at hundreds of billions of US dollars in climate mitigation annually. The ecosystem impacts caused by planet-wide shifts in ocean chemistry resulting from marine Canth accumulation are an active area of research. For these reasons, we need accessible tools to quantify ocean Canth inventories and distributions and to predict how they might evolve in response to future emissions and mitigation activities. Unfortunately, Canth estimation methods are typically only accessible to trained scientists and modelers with access to significant computational resources. Here we make modifications to the transit-time-distribution approach for Canth estimation that render the method more accessible. We also release software called “Tracer-based Rapid Anthropogenic Carbon Estimation version 1” (TRACEv1) that allows users—with one line of code—to obtain Canth and water mass age estimates throughout the global open ocean from user-supplied values of coordinates, salinity, temperature, and the estimate year. We use this code to generate a data product of global gridded open-ocean Canth distributions (TRACEv1_GGCanth, Carter, 2024) that ranges from the preindustrial era through 2500 c.e. under a range of shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs, or atmospheric CO2 concentration pathways). We quantify the skill of these estimates by reconstructing Canth in models with known distributions of Canth and transient tracers and by conducting perturbation tests. In the model-based reconstruction test, TRACEv1 reproduces the global ocean Canth inventory with reasonable skill (within ±12 % in 1980 and 2015). We discuss implications of the projected Canth distributions and highlight ways that the estimation strategy might be improved. One finding is that the ocean will continue to increase its net Canth inventory at least through 2500 due to deep ocean ventilation even with the SSP where intense mitigation successfully decreases atmospheric Canth by ~60 % in 2500 relative to the 2024 concentration."

We have focused on collection processes, where the hydrometeor number transfer is often estimated in proportion to the mass transfer. The impact of these parameterizations on a convective system and the prospects for more realistic estimates of secondary parameters (reflectivity, hydrometeor size) are shown in a first test on an idealized case. 
 A full two-moment microphysics parameterization of the LIMA scheme (with LIMA standing for Liquid Ice Multiple Aerosols and hereafter named LIMA v2.0) has been developed and successfully implemented in the Meso-NH cloud-resolving model. The novelty of the scheme is a set of prognostic equations of the number concentration of each precipitating ice category (snow/aggregates, graupel, and hail), in addition to the prediction of the mass mixing ratios. As a result, new microphysical conversion rates are introduced and explicitly computed using the size distributions of the hydrometeors.The new LIMA v2.0 scheme has been tested for an idealized deep convection case against the original LIMA scheme characterized by an empirical number-concentration–mixing-ratio relationship applied to the precipitating ice. Inclusion of number concentration equations for the snow/aggregates and graupel significantly alters the microphysical structure and dynamical evolution of the simulated supercell. When comparing to the results obtained with the previous version of LIMA, the new v2.0 of the scheme tends to increase the pristine ice mixing ratio; to decrease the other ice hydrometeors by slowing down the growing processes of snow/aggregates, graupel, and hail; and to enhance the feedbacks between raindrops and the ice-phase hydrometeors. This comparison also emphasizes the unreasonable diagnostic approach used to estimate the number concentration of precipitating ice particles in the previous version of the scheme. The new scheme is more efficient at producing earlier raindrops at ground level and reducing hail precipitation."

While reduced sulfur deposition is a key cause, an increasing role of hydrologic mechanisms as a result of cleaner air and progressing climate change has been repeatedly suggested. How these controls act remains however unclear. Here we examine over 30 years of organic carbon concentration and discharge data from four reference streams located across Norway to pinpoint consistent hydrologic changes that may promote water browning. Stable slopes with changing intercepts of the concentration-discharge relations indicate that the influence of air pollution on soil solution chemistry is plausible, supporting available chemical explanations from a hydrologic perspective. Decreasing ratios of concentration to discharge variability, observed in autumn over the years, point to less spatial heterogeneity of the sources of organic carbon. A clear rise in the frequency of runoff events, which increases the opportunities for dissolved organic carbon to transit from soil to streams, also indicates higher hydrologic connectivity and more even mobilization of carbon sources. More connected sources and more frequent runoff events, which jointly enhance the likelihood of organic carbon reaching rivers, may thus contribute to the observed browning of northern waters."

Despite high traffic burden in NY's environmental justice communities, this reduction has not been evaluated through an environmental justice lens—our objective in this analysis. We obtained census tract‐level traffic congestion data from Google traffic maps hourly for 2018–2020. We defined congestion as the percent of streets in a census tract with heavy traffic (red‐ or maroon‐color). We used the Index of Concentration at the Extremes (ICE) to measure racialized economic segregation and the CDC's Environmental Justice Index (EJI) as a measure of combined environmental, social, and chronic disease burden. We divided census tracts into quintiles of ICE and EJI and used linear mixed models stratified by ICE and EJI quintile in an interrupted time series design. Prior to NY on Pause, less marginalized and burdened census tracts (Q5) tended to have higher levels of traffic congestion; during NY on Pause, this trend reversed. For both ICE and EJI, more marginalized and burdened (Q1–Q2 vs. Q4–Q5) tracts had smaller absolute decreases in percent traffic congestion. For example, percent traffic congestion in ICE Q5 decreased by 7.8% (% change: −36.6%), but in Q1, it decreased by 4.2% (% change: −51.7%). NY on Pause, while protecting residents during COVID‐19, may have resulted in inequitable reductions in traffic congestion.

In contrast, the cleavage of inert aromatic carbon-carbon bonds remained largely unfeasible due to the unfavourable energetics of disrupting aromaticity on ring opening. For non-aromatic structures, alkene metathesis catalysed by transition metal alkylidenes is established as one of the most versatile carbon-carbon bond-forming and breaking reactions2,3.

 The microbiota colonizes each barrier site and broadly controls host physiology1. However, when uncontrolled, microbial colonists can also promote inflammation and induce systemic infection2. The unique strategies employed at each barrier tissue to control the coexistence of the host with its microbiota remain largely elusive. Here we uncover that, within the skin, host-microbiota symbiosis depends on the remarkable ability of the skin to act as an autonomous lymphoid organ. Notably, an encounter with a new skin commensal promotes two parallel responses, both under the control of Langerhans cells. On one hand, skin commensals induce the formation of classical germinal centers within the lymph node associated with IgG1 and IgG3 antibody responses. On the other hand, microbial colonization also leads to the development of tertiary lymphoid organs within the skin that can locally sustain IgG2b and IgG2c responses. These phenomena are supported by the ability of regulatory T cells to convert into T follicular helper cells. Skin autonomous production of antibodies is sufficient to control local microbial biomass, as well as subsequent systemic infection with the same microbe. Collectively, these results reveal a striking compartmentalization of humoral responses to the microbiota allowing for control of both microbial symbiosis and potential pathogenesis."

The key chemical step in these biosyntheses is amide bond formation between aminoacyl building blocks, catalyzed by the condensation (C) domain 3. There has been much debate over the mechanism of this reaction 3-12. NRPS condensation has been difficult to fully characterize because it is one of many successive reactions in the NRPS synthetic cycle and because the canonical substrates are each attached transiently as thioesters to mobile carrier domains, which are often both contained in the same very flexible protein as the C domain. We have produced a dimodular NRPS protein in two parts, modified each with appropriate non-hydrolysable substrate analogs 13,14 assembled the two parts with protein ligation 15, and solved structures of the substrate- and product-bound states. The structures show precise orientation of the megaenzyme preparing the nucleophilic attack of its key chemical step, and allow biochemical assays and quantum mechanical simulations to precisely interrogate the reaction.

The structure consists of a large globular N-terminal domain and a ~61 nm long continuous amphipathic β-sheet that wraps around the LDL particle like a belt. Distributed quasi-symmetrically across the two sides of the “β-belt” are 9 strategically located inter-strand inserts that extend across the lipid surface to provide additional structural support through a network of long-range interactions.

 Zorya is a recently identified and widely distributed bacterial immune system that protects bacteria from viral (phage) infections. Three Zorya subtypes have been discovered, each containing predicted membrane-embedded ZorAB complexes paired with soluble subunits that differ among Zorya subtypes, notably ZorC and ZorD in type I Zorya systems1,2. Here, we investigate the molecular basis of Zorya defense using cryo-electron microscopy, mutagenesis, fluorescence microscopy, proteomics, and functional studies. We present cryo-EM structures of ZorAB and show that it shares stoichiometry and features of other 5:2 inner membrane ion-driven rotary motors. The ZorA5B2 complex contains a dimeric ZorB peptidoglycan binding domain and a pentameric α-helical coiled-coil tail made of ZorA that projects approximately 70 nm into the cytoplasm. We also characterize the structure and function of the soluble Zorya components, ZorC and ZorD, finding that they harbour DNA binding and nuclease activity, respectively. Comprehensive functional and mutational analyses demonstrate that all Zorya components work in concert to protect bacterial cells against invading phages. We provide evidence that ZorAB operates as a proton-driven motor that becomes activated upon sensing of phage invasion. Subsequently, ZorAB transfers the phage invasion signal through the ZorA cytoplasmic tail to recruit and activate the soluble ZorC and ZorD effectors, which facilitate degradation of the phage DNA. In summary, our study elucidates the foundational mechanisms of Zorya function as an anti-phage defense system."

 The ubiquitous skin colonist Staphylococcus epidermidis elicits a CD8+ T cell response pre-emptively, in the absence of an infection1. However, the scope and purpose of this anti-commensal immune program are not well defined, limiting our ability to harness it therapeutically. Here, we show that this colonist also induces a potent, durable, and specific antibody response that is conserved in humans and non-human primates. A series of S. epidermidis cell-wall mutants revealed that the cell surface protein Aap is a predominant target. By colonizing mice with a strain of S. epidermidis in which the parallel β-helix domain of Aap is replaced by tetanus toxin fragment C, we elicit a potent neutralizing antibody response that protects mice against a lethal challenge. A similar strain of S. epidermidis expressing an Aap-SpyCatcher chimera can be conjugated with recombinant immunogens; the resulting labeled commensal elicits high antibody titers under conditions of physiologic colonization, including a robust IgA response in the nasal and pulmonary mucosa. Thus, immunity to a common skin colonist involves a coordinated T and B cell response, the latter of which can be redirected against pathogens as a novel form of topical vaccination."

 Cancer immunotherapies with antibodies blocking immune checkpoint molecules are clinically active across multiple cancer entities and have markedly improved cancer treatment1. Yet, response rates are still limited, and tumour progression commonly occurs2. Soluble and cell-bound factors in the tumour microenvironment negatively affect cancer immunity. Recently, growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15), a cytokine that is abundantly produced by many cancer types, was shown to interfere with antitumour immune response. In preclinical cancer models, GDF-15 blockade synergistically enhanced the efficacy of anti-PD-1-mediated checkpoint inhibition3. In a first-in-human phase 1–2a study (GDFATHER-1/2a trial, 
              NCT04725474
              
            ), patients with advanced cancers refractory to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 therapy (termed generally as anti-PD-1/PD-L1 refractoriness) were treated with the neutralizing anti-GDF-15 antibody visugromab (CTL-002) in combination with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab. Here we show that durable and deep responses were achieved in some patients with non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer and urothelial cancer, two cancer entities identified as frequently immunosuppressed by GDF-15 in an in silico screening of approximately 10,000 tumour samples in The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Increased levels of tumour infiltration, proliferation, interferon-γ-related signalling and granzyme B expression by cytotoxic T cells were observed in response to treatment. Neutralizing GDF-15 holds promise in overcoming resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition in cancer. A study reporting the results of a clinical trial co-administering the GDF-15-blocking antibody visugromab with the anti-PD-1 antibody nivolumab demonstrates that neutralizing GDF-15 can overcome resistance to immune checkpoint inhibition in cancer."

 Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a severe X-linked recessive disorder marked by progressive muscle wasting leading to premature mortality1,2. Discovery of the DMD gene encoding dystrophin both revealed the cause of DMD and helped identify a family of at least ten dystrophin-associated proteins at the muscle cell membrane, collectively forming the dystrophin–glycoprotein complex (DGC)3–9. The DGC links the extracellular matrix to the cytoskeleton, but, despite its importance, its molecular architecture has remained elusive. Here we determined the native cryo-electron microscopy structure of rabbit DGC and conducted biochemical analyses to reveal its intricate molecular configuration. An unexpected β-helix comprising β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan forms an extracellular platform that interacts with α-dystroglycan, β-dystroglycan and α-sarcoglycan, allowing α-dystroglycan to contact the extracellular matrix. In the membrane, sarcospan anchors β-dystroglycan to the β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycan trimer, while in the cytoplasm, β-dystroglycan’s juxtamembrane fragment binds dystrophin’s ZZ domain. Through these interactions, the DGC links laminin 2 to intracellular actin. Additionally, dystrophin’s WW domain, along with its EF-hand 1 domain, interacts with α-dystrobrevin. A disease-causing mutation mapping to the WW domain weakens this interaction, as confirmed by deletion of the WW domain in biochemical assays. Our findings rationalize more than 110 mutations affecting single residues associated with various muscular dystrophy subtypes and contribute to ongoing therapeutic developments, including protein restoration, upregulation of compensatory genes and gene replacement.

 Pre-eclampsia is a placental disorder that affects 3–5% of all pregnancies and is a leading cause of maternal and fetal morbidity worldwide1,2. With no drug available to slow disease progression, engineering ionizable lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) for extrahepatic messenger RNA (mRNA) delivery to the placenta is an attractive therapeutic option for pre-eclampsia. Here we use high-throughput screening to evaluate a library of 98 LNP formulations in vivo and identify a placenta-tropic LNP (LNP 55) that mediates more than 100-fold greater mRNA delivery to the placenta in pregnant mice than a formulation based on the Food and Drug Administration-approved Onpattro LNP (DLin-MC3-DMA)3. We propose an endogenous targeting mechanism based on β2-glycoprotein I adsorption that enables LNP delivery to the placenta. In both inflammation- and hypoxia-induced models of pre-eclampsia, a single administration of LNP 55 encapsulating vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA resolves maternal hypertension until the end of gestation. In addition, with our VEGF mRNA LNP 55 therapeutic, we demonstrate improvements in fetal health and partially restore placental vasculature, the local and systemic immune landscape and serum levels of soluble Fms-like tyrosine kinase-1, a clinical biomarker of pre-eclampsia1. Together, these results demonstrate the potential of this mRNA LNP platform for treating placental disorders such as pre-eclampsia. A platform for mRNA lipid nanoparticle delivery to the placenta to treat pre-eclampsia is shown to improve fetal and maternal health in mice and has potential clinical applications in obstetric disorders and women’s health."

 In the quest for environmental sustainability, the rising demand for electric vehicles and renewable energy technologies has substantially increased the need for efficient lithium extraction methods. Traditional lithium production, relying on geographically concentrated hard-rock ores and salar brines, is associated with considerable energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, groundwater depletion and land disturbance, thereby posing notable environmental and supply chain challenges. On the other hand, low-quality brines—such as those found in sedimentary waters, geothermal fluids, oilfield-produced waters, seawater and some salar brines and salt lakes—hold large potential owing to their extensive reserves and widespread geographical distribution. However, extracting lithium from these sources presents technical challenges owing to low lithium concentrations and high magnesium-to-lithium ratios. This Review explores the latest advances and continuing challenges in lithium extraction from these demanding yet promising sources, covering a variety of methods, including precipitation, solvent extraction, sorption, membrane-based separation and electrochemical-based separation. Furthermore, we share perspectives on the future development of lithium extraction technologies, framed within the basic principles of separation processes. The aim is to encourage the development of innovative extraction methods capable of making use of the substantial potential of low-quality brines.

 Amniote integumentary appendages constitute a diverse group of micro-organs, including feathers, hair and scales. These structures typically develop as genetically controlled units1, the spatial patterning of which emerges from a self-organized chemical Turing system2,3 with integrated mechanical feedback4,5. The seemingly purely mechanical patterning of polygonal crocodile head scales provides an exception to this paradigm6. However, the nature and origin of the mechanical stress field driving this patterning remain unclear. Here, using precise in ovo intravenous injections of epidermal growth factor protein, we generate Nile crocodile embryos with substantially convoluted head skin, as well as hatchlings with smaller polygonal head scales resembling those of caimans. We then use light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to quantify embryonic tissue-layer geometry, collagen architecture and the spatial distribution of proliferating cells. Using these data, we build a phenomenological three-dimensional mechanical growth model that recapitulates both normal and experimentally modified patterning of crocodile head scales. Our experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate that crocodile head scales self-organize through compressive folding, originating from near-homogeneous skin growth with differential stiffness of the dermis versus the epidermis. Our experiments and theoretical morphospace analyses indicate that variation in embryonic growth and material properties of skin layers provides a simple evolutionary mechanism that produces a diversity of head-scale patterns among crocodilian species.

 Apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) is a structural component of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and a ligand for the LDL receptor (LDLR)1. Mutations in apoB100 or in LDLR cause familial hypercholesterolaemia, an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by a marked increase in LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and a higher risk of cardiovascular disease2. The structure of apoB100 on LDL and its interaction with LDLR are poorly understood. Here we present the cryo-electron microscopy structures of apoB100 on LDL bound to the LDLR and a nanobody complex, which can form a C2-symmetric, higher-order complex. Using local refinement, we determined high-resolution structures of the interfaces between apoB100 and LDLR. One binding interface is formed between several small-ligand-binding modules of LDLR and a series of basic patches that are scattered along a β-belt formed by apoB100, encircling LDL. The other binding interface is formed between the β-propeller domain of LDLR and the N-terminal domain of apoB100. Our results reveal how both interfaces are involved in LDL dimer formation, and how LDLR cycles between LDL- and self-bound conformations. In addition, known mutations in either apoB100 or LDLR, associated with high levels of LDL-C, are located at the LDL–LDLR interface. Cryo-electron microscopy structures of apolipoprotein B100 (apoB100) in complex with the LDL receptor (LDLR) provide insight into binding interfaces and explain how mutations in apoB100 or in LDLR can give rise to familial hypercholesterolaemia."

 Tailored light–matter interactions in the strong coupling regime enable the manipulation and control of quantum systems with up to unit efficiency1,2, with applications ranging from quantum information to photochemistry3–7. Although strong light–matter interactions are readily induced at the valence electron level using long-wavelength radiation8, comparable phenomena have been only recently observed with short wavelengths, accessing highly excited multi-electron and inner-shell electron states9,10. However, the quantum control of strong-field processes at short wavelengths has not been possible, so far, because of the lack of pulse-shaping technologies in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV) and X-ray domain. Here, exploiting pulse shaping of the seeded free-electron laser (FEL) FERMI, we demonstrate the strong-field quantum control of ultrafast Rabi dynamics in helium atoms with high fidelity. Our approach reveals a strong dressing of the ionization continuum, otherwise elusive to experimental observables. The latter is exploited to achieve control of the total ionization rate, with prospective applications in many XUV and soft X-ray experiments. Leveraging recent advances in intense few-femtosecond to attosecond XUV to soft X-ray light sources, our results open an avenue to the efficient manipulation and selective control of core electron processes and electron correlation phenomena in real time.

 The dystrophin glycoprotein complex (DGC) has a crucial role in maintaining cell membrane stability and integrity by connecting the intracellular cytoskeleton with the surrounding extracellular matrix1–3. Dysfunction of dystrophin and its associated proteins results in muscular dystrophy, a disorder characterized by progressive muscle weakness and degeneration4,5. Despite the important roles of the DGC in physiology and pathology, its structural details remain largely unknown, hindering a comprehensive understanding of its assembly and function. Here we isolated the native DGC from mouse skeletal muscle and obtained its high-resolution structure. Our findings unveil a markedly divergent structure from the previous model of DGC assembly. Specifically, on the extracellular side, β-, γ- and δ-sarcoglycans co-fold to form a specialized, extracellular tower-like structure, which has a central role in complex assembly by providing binding sites for α-sarcoglycan and dystroglycan. In the transmembrane region, sarcoglycans and sarcospan flank and stabilize the single transmembrane helix of dystroglycan, rather than forming a subcomplex as previously proposed6–8. On the intracellular side, sarcoglycans and dystroglycan engage in assembly with the dystrophin–dystrobrevin subcomplex through extensive interaction with the ZZ domain of dystrophin. Collectively, these findings enhance our understanding of the structural linkage across the cell membrane and provide a foundation for the molecular interpretation of many muscular dystrophy-related mutations.

 The automated synthesis of small organic molecules from modular building blocks has the potential to transform our capacity to create medicines and materials1–3. Disruptive acceleration of this molecule-building strategy broadly unlocks its functional potential and requires the integration of many new assembly chemistries. Although recent advances in high-throughput chemistry4–6 can speed up the development of appropriate synthetic methods, for example, in selecting appropriate chemical reaction conditions from the vast range of potential options, equivalent high-throughput analytical methods are needed. Here we report a streamlined approach for the rapid, quantitative analysis of chemical reactions by mass spectrometry. The intrinsic fragmentation features of chemical building blocks generalize the analyses of chemical reactions, allowing sub-second readouts of reaction outcomes. Central to this advance was identifying that starting material fragmentation patterns function as universal barcodes for downstream product analysis by mass spectrometry. Combining these features with acoustic droplet ejection mass spectrometry7,8 we could eliminate slow chromatographic steps and continuously evaluate chemical reactions in multiplexed formats. This enabled the assignment of reaction conditions to molecules derived from ultrahigh-throughput chemical synthesis experiments.

The rapid development of highly effective vaccines2,3 against SARS-CoV-2 has altered the trajectory of the pandemic, and antiviral therapeutics4 have further reduced the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and deaths.

 Non-ribosomal peptide synthetases are assembly line biosynthetic pathways that are used to produce critical therapeutic drugs and are typically arranged as large multi-domain proteins called megasynthetases1. They synthesize polypeptides using peptidyl carrier proteins that shuttle each amino acid through modular loading, modification and elongation2 steps, and remain challenging to structurally characterize, owing in part to the inherent dynamics of their multi-domain and multi-modular architectures3. Here we have developed site-selective crosslinking probes to conformationally constrain and resolve the interactions between carrier proteins and their partner enzymatic domains4,5. We apply tetrazine click chemistry to trap the condensation of two carrier protein substrates within the active site of the condensation domain that unites the first two modules of tyrocidine biosynthesis and report the high-resolution cryo-EM structure of this complex. Together with the X-ray crystal structure of the first carrier protein crosslinked to its epimerization domain, these structures highlight captured intermodular recognition events and define the processive movement of a carrier protein from one catalytic step to the next. Characterization of these structural relationships remains central to understanding the molecular details of these unique synthetases and critically informs future synthetic biology design of these pathways.

 The human body contains trillions of cells, classified into specific cell types, with diverse morphologies and functions. In addition, cells of the same type can assume different states within an individual’s body during their lifetime. Understanding the complexities of the proteome in the context of a human organism and its many potential states is a necessary requirement to understanding human biology, but these complexities can neither be predicted from the genome, nor have they been systematically measurable with available technologies. Recent advances in proteomic technology and computational sciences now provide opportunities to investigate the intricate biology of the human body at unprecedented resolution and scale. Here we introduce a big-science endeavour called π-HuB (proteomic navigator of the human body). The aim of the π-HuB project is to (1) generate and harness multimodality proteomic datasets to enhance our understanding of human biology; (2) facilitate disease risk assessment and diagnosis; (3) uncover new drug targets; (4) optimize appropriate therapeutic strategies; and (5) enable intelligent healthcare, thereby ushering in a new era of proteomics-driven phronesis medicine. This ambitious mission will be implemented by an international collaborative force of multidisciplinary research teams worldwide across academic, industrial and government sectors.

 During translation initiation, mRNA molecules must be identified and activated for loading into a ribosome1–3. In this rate-limiting step, the heterotrimeric protein eukaryotic initiation factor eIF4F must recognize and productively interact with the 7-methylguanosine cap at the 5′ end of the mRNA and subsequently activate the message1–3. Despite its fundamental, regulatory role in gene expression, the molecular events underlying cap recognition and mRNA activation remain unclear3. Here we generate a single-molecule fluorescence imaging system to examine the dynamics with which eIF4F discriminates productive and non-productive locations on full-length, native mRNA molecules. At the single-molecule level, we observe stochastic sampling of eIF4F along the length of the mRNA and identify allosteric communication between the eIF4F subunits that ultimately drive cap-recognition and subsequent activation of the message. Our experiments uncover functions for each subunit of eIF4F and we conclude by presenting a model for mRNA activation that precisely defines the composition of the activated message. This model provides a general framework for understanding how mRNA molecules may be discriminated from one another and how other RNA-binding proteins may control the efficiency of translation initiation.

 The functionality of materials is determined by their composition1–4 and microstructure, that is, the distribution and orientation of crystalline grains, grain boundaries and the defects within them5,6. Until now, characterization techniques that map the distribution of grains, their orientation and the presence of defects have been limited to surface investigations, to spatial resolutions of a few hundred nanometres or to systems of thickness around 100 nm, thus requiring destructive sample preparation for measurements and preventing the study of system-representative volumes or the investigation of materials under operational conditions7–15.

 The complete blood count (CBC) is an important screening tool for healthy adults and a common test at periodic exams. However, results are usually interpreted relative to one-size-fits-all reference intervals1,2, undermining the precision medicine goal to tailor care for patients on the basis of their unique characteristics3,4. Here we study thousands of diverse patients at an academic medical centre and show that routine CBC indices fluctuate around stable values or setpoints5, and setpoints are patient-specific, with the typical healthy adult’s nine CBC setpoints distinguishable as a group from those of 98% of other healthy adults, and setpoint differences persist for at least 20 years. Haematological setpoints reflect a deep physiologic phenotype enabling investigation of acquired and genetic determinants of haematological regulation and its variation among healthy adults. Setpoints in apparently healthy adults were associated with significant variation in clinical risk: absolute risk of some common diseases and morbidities varied by more than 2% (heart attack and stroke, diabetes, kidney disease, osteoporosis), and absolute risk of all-cause 10 year mortality varied by more than 5%. Setpoints also define patient-specific reference intervals and personalize the interpretation of subsequent test results. In retrospective analysis, setpoints improved sensitivity and specificity for evaluation of some common conditions including diabetes, kidney disease, thyroid dysfunction, iron deficiency and myeloproliferative neoplasms. This study shows CBC setpoints are sufficiently stable and patient-specific to help realize the promise of precision medicine for healthy adults.

 Natural tissues are composed of diverse cells and extracellular materials whose arrangements across several length scales—from subcellular lengths1 (micrometre) to the organ scale2 (centimetre)—regulate biological functions. Tissue-fabrication methods have progressed to large constructs, for example, through stereolithography3 and nozzle-based bioprinting4,5, and subcellular resolution through subtractive photoablation6–8. However, additive bioprinting struggles with sub-nozzle/voxel features9 and photoablation is restricted to small volumes by prohibitive heat generation and time10. Building across several length scales with temperature-sensitive, water-based soft biological matter has emerged as a critical challenge, leaving large classes of biological motifs—such as multiscalar vascular trees with varying calibres—inaccessible with present technologies11,12. Here we use gallium-based engineered sacrificial capillary pumps for evacuation (ESCAPE) during moulding to generate multiscalar structures in soft natural hydrogels, achieving both cellular-scale (<10 µm) and millimetre-scale features. Decoupling the biomaterial of interest from the process of constructing the geometry allows non-biocompatible tools to create the initial geometry. As an exemplar, we fabricated branched, cell-laden vascular trees in collagen, spanning approximately 300-µm arterioles down to the microvasculature (roughly ten times smaller). The same approach can micropattern the inner surface of vascular walls with topographical cues to orient cells in 3D and engineer fine structures such as vascular malformations. ESCAPE moulding enables the fabrication of multiscalar forms in soft biomaterials, paving the way for a wide range of tissue architectures that were previously inaccessible in vitro.

 The unusual properties of superconductivity in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) have sparked considerable research interest1–13. However, despite the dedication of intensive experimental efforts and the proposal of several possible pairing mechanisms14–24, the origin of its superconductivity remains elusive. Here, by utilizing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with micrometre spatial resolution, we reveal flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG, where MATBG is unaligned with its hexagonal boron nitride substrate11. These replicas show uniform energy spacing, approximately 150 ± 15 meV apart, indicative of strong electron–boson coupling. Strikingly, these replicas are absent in non-superconducting twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) systems, either when MATBG is aligned to hexagonal boron nitride or when TBG deviates from the magic angle. Calculations suggest that the formation of these flat-band replicas in superconducting MATBG are attributed to the strong coupling between flat-band electrons and an optical phonon mode at the graphene K point, facilitated by intervalley scattering. These findings, although they do not necessarily put electron–phonon coupling as the main driving force for the superconductivity in MATBG, unravel the electronic structure inherent in superconducting MATBG, thereby providing crucial information for understanding the unusual electronic landscape from which its superconductivity is derived.

 The most distant galaxies detected were seen when the Universe was a scant 5% of its current age. At these times, progenitors of galaxies such as the Milky Way were about 10,000 times less massive. Using the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) combined with magnification from gravitational lensing, these low-mass galaxies can not only be detected but also be studied in detail. Here we present JWST observations of a strongly lensed galaxy at zspec = 8.296 ± 0.001, showing massive star clusters (the Firefly Sparkle) cocooned in a diffuse arc in the Canadian Unbiased Cluster Survey (CANUCS)1. The Firefly Sparkle exhibits traits of a young, gas-rich galaxy in its early formation stage. The mass of the galaxy is concentrated in 10 star clusters (49–57% of total mass), with individual masses ranging from 105M⊙ to 106M⊙. These unresolved clusters have high surface densities (>103M⊙ pc−2), exceeding those of Milky Way globular clusters and young star clusters in nearby galaxies. The central cluster shows a nebular-dominated spectrum, low metallicity, high gas density and high electron temperature, hinting at a top-heavy initial mass function.

 The ability of cells to maintain distinct identities and respond to transient environmental signals requires tightly controlled regulation of gene networks1–3. These dynamic regulatory circuits that respond to extracellular cues in primary human cells remain poorly defined. The need for context-dependent regulation is prominent in T cells, where distinct lineages must respond to diverse signals to mount effective immune responses and maintain homeostasis4–8. Here we performed CRISPR screens in multiple primary human CD4+ T cell contexts to identify regulators that control expression of IL-2Rα, a canonical marker of T cell activation transiently expressed by pro-inflammatory effector T cells and constitutively expressed by anti-inflammatory regulatory T cells where it is required for fitness9–11. Approximately 90% of identified regulators of IL-2Rα had effects that varied across cell types and/or stimulation states, including a subset that even had opposite effects across conditions. Using single-cell transcriptomics after pooled perturbation of context-specific screen hits, we characterized specific factors as regulators of overall rest or activation and constructed state-specific regulatory networks. MED12 — a component of the Mediator complex — serves as a dynamic orchestrator of key regulators, controlling expression of distinct sets of regulators in different T cell contexts. Immunoprecipitation–mass spectrometry revealed that MED12 interacts with the histone methylating COMPASS complex. MED12 was required for histone methylation and expression of genes encoding key context-specific regulators, including the rest maintenance factor KLF2 and the versatile regulator MYC. CRISPR ablation of MED12 blunted the cell-state transitions between rest and activation and protected from activation-induced cell death. Overall, this work leverages CRISPR screens performed across conditions to define dynamic gene circuits required to establish resting and activated T cell states.

 Zeolites are crystalline microporous materials constructed by corner-sharing tetrahedra (SiO4 and AlO4), with many industrial applications as ion exchangers, adsorbents and heterogeneous catalysts1–4. However, the presence of micropores impedes the use of zeolites in areas dealing with bulky substrates. Introducing extrinsic mesopores, that is, intercrystal/intracrystal mesopores, in zeolites is a solution to overcome the diffusion barrier5–8. Still, those extrinsic mesopores are generally disordered and non-uniform; moreover, acidity and crystallinity are always, to some extent, impaired9. Thus, synthesizing thermally stable zeolites with intrinsic mesopores that are of uniform size and crystallographically connected with micropores, denoted here as intrinsic mesoporous zeolite, is highly desired but still not achieved. Here we report ZMQ-1 (Zeolitic Materials, Qingdao Institute of Bioenergy and Bioprocess Technology, no. 1), an aluminosilicate zeolite with an intersecting intrinsic meso-microporous channel system delimited by 28 × 10 × 10-rings, in which the 28-ring has a free diameter of 22.76 Å × 11.83 Å, which reaches the mesopore domain.

The position of the organic structure-directing agent (OSDA) used for ZMQ-1 synthesis was determined from three-dimensional electron diffraction (3D ED) data, which shows the unique structure-directing role of the OSDA in the formation of the intrinsic meso-microporous zeolite. This provides an incentive for preparing other stable mesopore-containing zeolites.

 Nanoscale detection and control of the magnetic order underpins a spectrum of condensed-matter research and device functionalities involving magnetism. The key principle involved is the breaking of time-reversal symmetry, which in ferromagnets is generated by an internal magnetization. However, the presence of a net magnetization limits device scalability and compatibility with phases, such as superconductors and topological insulators. Recently, altermagnetism has been proposed as a solution to these restrictions, as it shares the enabling time-reversal-symmetry-breaking characteristic of ferromagnetism, combined with the antiferromagnetic-like vanishing net magnetization1–4. So far, altermagnetic ordering has been inferred from spatially averaged probes4–19. Here we demonstrate nanoscale imaging of altermagnetic states from 100-nanometre-scale vortices and domain walls to 10-micrometre-scale single-domain states in manganese telluride (MnTe)2,7,9,14–16,18,20,21. We combine the time-reversal-symmetry-breaking sensitivity of X-ray magnetic circular dichroism12 with magnetic linear dichroism and photoemission electron microscopy to achieve maps of the local altermagnetic ordering vector. A variety of spin configurations are imposed using microstructure patterning and thermal cycling in magnetic fields. The demonstrated detection and controlled formation of altermagnetic spin configurations paves the way for future experimental studies across the theoretically predicted research landscape of altermagnetism, including unconventional spin-polarization phenomena, the interplay of altermagnetism with superconducting and topological phases, and highly scalable digital and neuromorphic spintronic devices3,14,22–24.

 The ring-shaped chaperonin T-complex protein ring complex (TRiC; also known as chaperonin containing TCP-1, CCT) is an ATP-driven protein-folding machine that is essential for maintenance of cellular homeostasis1,2. Its dysfunction is related to cancer and neurodegenerative disease3,4. Despite its importance, how TRiC works in the cell remains unclear. Here we structurally analysed the architecture, conformational dynamics and spatial organization of the chaperonin TRiC in human cells using cryo-electron tomography. We resolved distinctive open, closed, substrate-bound and prefoldin-associated states of TRiC, and reconstructed its duty cycle in situ. The substrate-bound open and symmetrically closed TRiC states were equally abundant. Closed TRiC containing substrate forms distinctive clusters, indicative of spatial organization. Translation inhibition did not fundamentally change the distribution of duty cycle intermediates, but reduced substrate binding for all states as well as cluster formation. From our in-cell structures, we identified the programmed cell death protein 5 (PDCD5) as an interactor that specifically binds to almost all open but not closed TRiC, in a position that is compatible with both substrate and prefoldin binding. Our data support a model in which TRiC functions at near full occupancy to fold newly synthesized proteins inside cells.

Here authors show how addition of a heavy inert gas can increase the thickness uniformity of the films on complex objects. 
 Semiconductor devices are constructed from stacks of materials with different electrical properties, making deposition of thin layers central in producing semiconductor chips. The shrinking of electronics has resulted in complex device architectures which require deposition into holes and recessed features. A key parameter for such deposition is the step coverage (SC), which is the ratio of the thickness of material at the bottom and at the top. Here, we show that adding a co-flow of a heavy inert gas affords a higher SC for deposition by chemical vapor deposition (CVD). By adding a co-flow of Xe to a CVD process for boron carbide using a single source precursor with a lower molecular mass than the atomic mass of Xe, the SC increased from 0.71 to 0.97 in a 10:1 aspect ratio feature. The concept was further validated by a longer deposition depth in lateral high aspect ratio structures. We suggest that competitive co-diffusion is a general route to conformal CVD.

 Hsp90, a crucial molecular chaperone, regulates diverse client proteins, impacting both normal biology and disease. Central to its function is its conformational plasticity, driven by ATPase activity and client interactions. However, comprehensive insights into Hsp90’s dynamic molecular transitions remain elusive. Using solution NMR spectroscopy, we reveal how ATP binding, hydrolysis, and client engagement drive conformational and dynamic shifts in E. coli Hsp90, HtpG, through its chaperone cycle. Pronounced conformational fluctuations occur, especially in regions crucial for nucleotide binding and conformational transitions. ATP binding induces slow-exchanging conformations, representing discrete on-path transition states from open to closed forms, while ATP hydrolysis shifts HtpG into a compact conformation. Client binding acts as an allosteric switch, dynamically priming HtpG for elevated chaperone activity and, therefore, its efficient remodeling. Here, we provide atomic-level insights into Hsp90’s functional mechanism, highlighting the interplay of conformation, dynamics, nucleotide, and client interactions.

 Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma cell free DNA (cfDNA) of cancer patients is associated with poor prognosis, but is challenging to detect from low plasma volumes. In metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), ctDNA assays are needed to prognosticate outcomes of patients treated with androgen receptor (AR) inhibitors. We develop a custom targeted cfDNA sequencing assay, named AR-ctDETECT, to detect ctDNA in limiting plasma cfDNA available from mCRPC patients in the Alliance A031201 randomized phase 3 trial of enzalutamide with or without abiraterone. Of 776 patients, 59% are ctDNA-positive, with 26% having high ctDNA aneuploidy and 33% having low ctDNA aneuploidy but displaying AR gain or structural rearrangement, MYC/MYCN gain, or a pathogenic mutation. ctDNA-positive patients have significantly worse median overall survival than ctDNA-negative patients (29.0 months vs. 47.4 months, respectively).

 Clinical studies of the urinary tract microbiome, termed urobiome, suggest a direct, antibiotic-dependent, impact of the urobiome on kidney physiology. However, evidence for kidney bacteria comes from indirect sources or infected tissue. Further, it is unclear how antibiotics impact kidney bacteria. Here we show direct evidence for the presence of bacteria in the kidneys, with microniches in nephrons. In murine kidneys, administration of cefazolin, a commonly used perioperative antibiotic, led to a loss of uroprotective Lactobacillus spp. and proliferation of Enterobacteriaceae (which includes many known uropathogens). This effect was dependent on treatment duration, with recovery post treatment. Uroprotective L. crispatus and a strain of stone-associated E. coli differentially influenced calcium oxalate (CaOx) crystallization through the incorporation of CaOx inhibitors or promoters, respectively. In humans, microbial signatures were identified in the kidney, with unique niches between the glomeruli and tubules, established through RNA sequencing analysis and direct imaging of two independent populations. Collectively, findings support the hypothesis that the kidneys harbor a stable and antibiotic-responsive microbiota that can influence CaOx lithogenesis. The presence of unique, age-dependent microbial signatures in the glomeruli and tubuli carry implications for non-infectious kidney diseases. Here, the authors provide evidence that the renal microbiome can be disrupted by antibiotics, leading to differential effects on anti-lithogenic taxa like Lactobacillus and pro-lithogenic bacteria such as Enterobacteriaceae."

Here, authors use a combination of imaging and mechanical tests to model the kinematics and dynamics of wing deployment in Drosophila. 
 During their final transformation, insects emerge from the pupal case and deploy their wings within minutes. The wings deploy from a compact origami structure, to form a planar and rigid blade that allows the insect to fly. Deployment is powered by a rapid increase in internal pressure, and by the subsequent flow of hemolymph into the deployable wing structure. Using a combination of imaging techniques, we characterize the internal and external structure of the wing in Drosophila melanogaster, the unfolding kinematics at the organ scale, and the hemolymph flow during deployment. We find that, beyond the mere unfolding of the macroscopic folds, wing deployment also involves wing expansion, with the stretching of epithelial cells and the unwrinkling of the cuticle enveloping the wing. A quantitative computational model, incorporating mechanical measurements of the viscoelastic properties and microstructure of the wing, predicts the existence of an operating point for deployment and captures the dynamics of the process. This model shows that insects exploit material and geometric nonlinearities to achieve rapid and efficient reconfiguration of soft deployable structures.

 Biomolecular condensates are membraneless organelles that can concentrate hundreds of different proteins in cells to operate essential biological functions. However, accurate identification of their components remains challenging and biased towards proteins with high structural disorder content with focus on self-phase separating (driver) proteins. Here, we present a machine learning algorithm, PICNIC (Proteins Involved in CoNdensates In Cells) to classify proteins that localize to biomolecular condensates regardless of their role in condensate formation. PICNIC successfully predicts condensate members by learning amino acid patterns in the protein sequence and structure in addition to the intrinsic disorder. Extensive experimental validation of 24 positive predictions in cellulo shows an overall ~82% accuracy regardless of the structural disorder content of the tested proteins. While increasing disorder content is associated with organismal complexity, our analysis of 26 species reveals no correlation between predicted condensate proteome content and disorder content across organisms. Overall, we present a machine learning classifier to interrogate condensate components at whole-proteome levels across the tree of life.

 Land use/land cover (LULC) is one of the most impactful global change phenomenon. As a result, considerable effort has been devoted to creating large-scale LULC products from remote sensing data, enabling the scientific community to use these products for a wide range of downstream applications. Unfortunately, uncertainty associated with these products is seldom quantified because most approaches are too computationally intensive. Furthermore, uncertainty maps developed for large regions might fail to perform adequately at the spatial scale in which they will be used and might need to be customized to suit the specific applications of end-users.In this study, we describe the class-conditional conformal statistics method, an approach that quantifies uncertainty more uniformly for each class but that requires more calibration data than the conventional conformal method. Using the class-conditional method, we show that it is possible to create customized local uncertainty maps using local calibration data without requiring remote sensing and modeling work and that these local uncertainty maps outperform uncertainty maps calibrated based on global data. We use empirical data from Brazil (i.e., Dynamic World LULC product and Mapbiomas validation data) to demonstrate this methodology. The analysis of these data reveals substantial heterogeneity in observations of the same LULC class between Brazilian states, an indication that national-level data are not representative of the focal state, thus explaining why uncertainty maps calibrated using focal state-level data outperform maps calibrated using national-level data. Importantly, we develop straight-forward approaches to determine the spatial extent over which calibration data are still representative of the area of interest, ensuring that these data can be used to reliably quantify uncertainty. We illustrate the class-conformal methodology by creating uncertainty maps for a selected number of sites in Brazil. Finally, we show how these uncertainty maps can yield valuable insights for LULC map producers.Our methodology paves the way for users to generate customized local uncertainty maps that are likely to be better than uncertainty maps calibrated based on global data while at the same time being more relevant for the specific applications of these users. A tutorial is provided to show how this methodology can be implemented without requiring remote sensing and modeling expertise to generate uncertainty maps."

 The concentration of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) in the UK has been decreasing in the last few decades but remains the leading environmental health risk. As a consequence of changing population, behaviour, activity factors, emissions and regulation, it is likely that the sources of PM2.5 in the UK are changing but a quantitative source apportionment has not been reported for many years. This study analyses the characteristics and sources of PM2.5 collected in 2021 and 2022 at two urban background sites: Birmingham Air Quality Supersite (BAQS) and Ladywood (LW) in Birmingham. Results indicate a notable decrease in the contribution (concentration) of (NH4)2SO4 to PM2.5 from 25% (2.9 μg m−3) in 2007 to 15% (1.5 μg m−3) in 2022. In contrast, the contribution of NH4NO3 (20–22%) to PM2.5 remains consistent with that in 2007, despite various air quality actions implemented over the years. These shifts are attributed to changes in SO2 and NOx emissions, coupled with relatively stable NH3 levels—key precursors for (NH4)2SO4 and NH4NO3, which altered the formation dynamics of these compounds, ultimately affecting their contribution to PM2.5 concentrations. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis showed that biomass burning factors (25%), resuspended dust and traffic-related emissions (22%), and secondary aerosols (25%) are the major contributors to PM2.5 mass. Furthermore, PMF and Aethalometer-model analyses consistently showed that biomass burning aerosol concentrations are approximately seven times higher (1.5 μg m−3) than those observed in studies from 2008 to 2010. These findings suggest that targeted measures to reduce wood burning and road traffic have the greatest potential to reduce PM2.5-related health risks in the West Midland region."

This ability is not innate; rather, it develops with experience early in life. We show that, when mice are naïve to an odor object, perceptual constancy is absent across increasing concentrations. The perceptual change coincides with a rapid reduction in activity from a single olfactory receptor channel that is most sensitive to the odor. This drop in activity is not a property of circuit interactions within the olfactory bulb; instead, it is due to a sensitivity mismatch of olfactory receptor neurons within the nose. We show that, after forming an association of this odor with food, the sensitivity of the receptor channel is matched to the odor object, preventing transmission failure and promoting perceptual stability.

Two of these genetically verified regulators are cyclophilin D (CypD) and the adenine nucleotide translocase (ANT) family. We investigated the ANT/CypD relationship in mPTP dynamics and I/R injury. Despite lacking all ANT isoforms, Ca2+-dependent mPTP opening persisted in cardiac mitochondria but was desensitized. This desensitization conferred resistance to I/R injury in ANT-deficient mice. CypD is hypothesized to trigger mPTP opening through isomerization of ANTs at proline-62. To test this, we generated mice that expressed a P62A mutated version of ANT1. These mice showed similar mPTP dynamics and I/R sensitivity as the wild type, indicating that P62 is dispensable for CypD regulation.

Here, using cellular models and in vitro studies, we show the spatiotemporal formation and material properties of p53 condensates that might dictate its function. In particular, p53 forms liquid-like condensates in the nucleus of cells, which can bind to DNA and perform transcriptional activity. However, cancer-associated mutations promote misfolding and partially rigidify the p53 condensates with impaired DNA binding ability. Irrespective of wild-type and mutant forms, the partitioning of p53 into cytoplasm leads to the condensate formation, which subsequently undergoes rapid solidification. In vitro studies show that abundant nuclear components such as RNA and nonspecific DNA promote multicomponent phase separation of the p53 core domain and maintain their liquid-like property, whereas specific DNA promotes its dissolution into tetrameric functional p53. This work provides mechanistic insights into how the life cycle and DNA binding properties of p53 might be regulated by phase separation."

Haploinsufficiency of mixed-lineage leukemia (MLL/KMT2A) protein causes Wiedemann-Steiner syndrome (WSS), a neurodevelopmental disorder associated with microcephaly.

Crucially, the unencapsulated device displays excellent stability under light, heat, and bias, maintaining 98% of its initial PCE after 1500 hours of maximum power point tracking.

However, most HEMs are burdened by cost-, energy-, and carbon-intensive extraction, synthesis, and manufacturing protocols. Recycling and reusing HEMs are challenging because their design relies on high fractions of expensive and limited-supply elements in massive solid solutions. Therefore, we review the basic sustainability aspects of HEMs. Solutions include using feedstock with lower carbon and energy footprints, sustainable primary synthesis routes from minerals, attenuation of the equimolar alloying rule, and a preference for scrap and dumped waste for secondary and tertiary synthesis. The high solubility, compositional flexibility, and chemical robustness of HEMs offer pathways for using higher fractions of mixed and contaminated scrap and waste feedstocks, which are not admissible for synthesizing conventional materials. We also discuss thermodynamic and kinetic design strategies to reconcile good material properties with high impurity tolerance and variable compositions."

We describe the newest version of the global hydrological model WaterGAP, which has been used for numerous water resource assessments since 1996. We show the effects of new model features, as well as model evaluations, against water abstraction statistics and observed streamflow and water storage anomalies. The publicly available model output for several variants is described. 
 Water – Global Assessment and Prognosis (WaterGAP) is a modeling approach for quantifying water resources and water use for all land areas of the Earth that has served science and society since 1996. In this paper, the refinements, new algorithms, and new data of the most recent model version v2.2e are described, together with a thorough evaluation of the simulated water use, streamflow, and terrestrial water storage anomaly against observation data. WaterGAP v2.2e improves the handling of inland sinks and now excludes not only large but also small human-made reservoirs when simulating naturalized conditions. The reservoir and non-irrigation water use data were updated. In addition, the model was calibrated against an updated and extended data set of streamflow observations at 1509 gauging stations. The modifications resulted in a small decrease in the estimated global renewable water resources. The model can now be started using prescribed water storages and other conditions, facilitating data assimilation and near-real-time monitoring and forecast simulations. For specific applications, the model can consider the output of a glacier model, approximate the effect of rising CO2 concentrations on evapotranspiration, or calculate the water temperature in rivers. In the paper, the publicly available standard model output is described, and caveats of the model version are provided alongside the description of the model setup in the ISIMIP3 framework."

However, environmental exposure routes from the associated medicinal herb cultivation fields have received little attention. We reveal through liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis of over 400 soil samples collected from three different Aristolochiaceae herb cultivation fields that AAs, which are nephrotoxic and carcinogenic, and aristoloxazines (AXs), a family of recently identified neurotoxic and genotoxic AA analogues, are widespread pollutants in these areas. In particular, aristoloxazine C was detected for the first time in the environment and was found in 318 out of 320 soil samples, at concentrations as high as 2.8 mg/kg, from an Asarum heterotropoides cultivation field. We show that in fact AXs are ecotoxic, inhibiting plant growth and significantly reducing the soil microorganism population. With the extensive cultivation of Aristolochiaceae herbs in order to meet their market demand, we believe our study points to an important environmental hazard that may place food crops and non-AA/AX-producing medicinal herbs at risk of AA/AX contamination.

In an increasingly populated world with growing food demands, a precise and high-resolution spatial prediction of agricultural N2O emissions becomes essential in reducing global emissions. In this study, an integrated assessment model coupled with the land cover downscaling module is employed to predict crop-specific N2O emissions at a 0.05° resolution under various SSP-RCP scenarios from 2025 to 2100. Our findings show that global agricultural N2O emissions will peak around 2065, ranging from 5.2 to 6.6 Tg N a–1. Corn cultivation is the primary N2O contributor, while rice production will produce fewer emissions and peak before 2025. The emission hotspots are concentrated in western Europe, India, eastern China, and the west coast and east-central region of the USA. By 2100, the crop-specific N2O emissions in China are predicted to decrease below the levels observed in 2015, while the emissions in the USA and India may double in some socio-economic pathways.

Flue gas from steam injection boilers typically contains 10–15% CO2 and 80–85% N2, both of which serve as effective gas displacement agents. Injecting flue gas or CO2/N2 mixtures into reservoirs can reduce carbon emissions, sequester CO2, and enhance recovery. Therefore, this study proposes a concept of enriching rather than capturing flue gas for storage, with a focus on how N2 as an impurity affects the safety of CO2 storage. This study examines interactions between gas mixtures with varying CO2 enrichment rates (with N2 impurities) and minerals. It performs microarea analyses of aged rocks using ultradepth-of-field microscope and atomic force microscopy (AFM), assesses calcite wettability via contact angle tests, and evaluates CO2 storage column height under experimental conditions. Results indicate that with a CO2 enrichment of at least 50%, adding N2 creates additional dissolution pits on calcite surfaces. The calcite matrix exhibits optimal water-wettability at 50–75% CO2 enrichment, facilitating greater CO2 storage column heights. This suggests coinjecting N2 and CO2 can enhance long-term CO2 storage safety and reduce capture costs."

The results showed that 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS) gradually replaced perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) in China’s electroplating industry. The conventional reduction-sedimentation process hardly removed 6:2 FTS from chromium-plating wastewater, while the special air flotation process resulted in over 60% of PFOS entering the chromium sludge cake. Based on the full-scale evaluation, GAC and AER adsorption were feasible technologies for removing PFAS from chromium-plating wastewater, among which AER had higher adsorption capacity and removal efficiency for PFAS but poorer selectivity for 6:2 FTS than for PFOS. It is estimated that GAC and AER adsorption have the potential to reduce the discharge of PFAS by 5030–8000 kg/year in China.

While the existence of free radicals in aged plastics has been known for over half a century, only recently has significant research on a new type of environmentally risky substance, namely environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs), present in aged MPs and their environmental effects, been started, but it is still in its infancy. To address these issues, this work examines EPFR generation on MPs and their environmental effect by reviewing publications from 2012 to 2023. The aging processes and mechanisms of MPs in the environment are first summarized. Then, the occurrence and formation mechanisms of EPFRs on aged MPs are specifically discussed. Additionally, the reactivity of EPFRs on aging MPs and their influencing factors are comprehensively considered, such as their physicochemical properties, oxygen content, and coexisting substances. Due to their reactivity, EPFRs can interact directly with some substances (e.g., p-nitrophenol and proteins, etc.) or induce the generation of reactive oxygen species, leading to diverse environmental effects, including pollutant transformation, biotoxicity, and health risks. Finally, research challenges and perspectives for EPFRs formation on aging MPs and related environmental implications are presented.

However, the interference from chlorine ions (Cl–) can generate reactive chlorine species (RCS), potentially leading to the production of undesirable chlorinated byproducts. A novel approach involving the cathodic oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for in situ H2O2 production has emerged as a promising strategy to counteract this issue. This study systematically investigated the dynamics and transformation of RCS and reactive oxygen species (ROS) in an ORR/chloride-containing EO (EO-Cl) system, elucidating their respective roles in organic removal and chlorinated byproduct minimization. Distinct generation rates and patterns were observed for free chlorine and H2O2 in the ORR/EO-Cl system. The rapid generation of free chlorine at the anode quickly reached a dynamic equilibrium, which contrasted with the moderate, continuous cathodic production of H2O2, resulting in considerable H2O2 accumulation over time. This difference established kinetics-driven ROS and RCS formation and distribution, influencing the subsequent organic degradation process. Three distinct stages were identified in the degradation process. In stage I, free chlorine was the primary species, along with reactive species including Cl2•–, 1O2, ClO•, HO•, and Cl•. In stage II, the gradual accumulation of H2O2 consumed free chlorine, favoring the formation of 1O2 and HO•. In stage III, excessive H2O2 quenched the free radicals. Insights into these multistage mechanisms reveal that the rapid degradation of chlorinated byproducts by 1O2 and HO• occurs in stage II of the ORR/EO-Cl system."

There are emerging concerns around TWPs due to their potential high numbers of particles released, outnumbering microplastics, as well as the leaching of toxic additives such as 6-PPD which has been linked to the death of salmon even when present at very low levels (<0.1 μg/L).

Here we show that an intrinsic variability in the Indian Ocean, the Central Indian Ocean (CIO) mode, when combined with a machine learning (ML) algorithm, can produce skillful predictions of intraseasonal precipitation over the monsoon region with a lead time of over 15 days, which is close to the theoretical predictability limit. This remarkable skill improvement stems from the fact that the CIO mode is dynamically related to the intraseasonal monsoon rainfall, while the data‐driven ML algorithm suppresses unwanted high‐frequency noise. Using the CIO mode and the ML algorithm, the forecast system hybridizes physical fundamentals and versatility of data‐driven algorithms. The identification of CIO mode and the verification of its significant contribution to intraseasonal predictions advance our understanding of the coupled monsoon system and also underscores the great potential of ML techniques in weather forecasts and climate predictions."

Uncertainties in ocean circulation and biological carbon export are essential causes for model‐data mismatch. We quantify the impact of these factors by calibrating the Max Planck Institute‐ESM. A shallower and weaker glacial Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) than the present day, achieved by decreasing background vertical diffusivity, enables capturing the main features in observed δ13C ${\delta }^{13}\mathrm{C}$, 14C $\mathrm{C}$ and CO32− ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{3}^{2-}$. A prognostic sinking scheme responding to changing dust deposition and biological production enhances glacial ocean organic matter export efficiency in high latitudes. Together, the shallower AMOC and a comprehensive sinking scheme substantially improve model‐data comparison and carbon storage in the glacial Atlantic but not in the Pacific and Indian oceans, mainly due to reduced primary production. Our results yield that representing glacial‐interglacial ocean carbon storage in ESMs requires both constraining ocean circulation and improved biogeochemical processes."

Prein;Yun Qian,An Evaluation of Dynamical Downscaling Methods Used to Project Regional Climate Change,"In the past decade, dynamical downscaling using “pseudo‐global‐warming” (PGW) techniques has been applied frequently to project regional climate change. Such techniques generate signals by adding mean global climate model (GCM)‐simulated climate change signals in temperature, moisture, and circulation to lateral and surface boundary conditions derived from reanalysis. An alternative to PGW is to downscale GCM data directly. This technique should be advantageous, especially for simulation of extremes, since it incorporates the GCM's full spectrum of changing synoptic‐scale dynamics in the regional solution. Here, we test this assumption, by comparing simulations in Europe and Western North America. We find that for warming and changes in temperature extremes, PGW often produces similar results to direct downscaling in both regions. For mean and extreme precipitation changes, PGW generally also performs surprisingly well in many cases. Moisture budget analysis in the Western North America domain reveals why. Large fractions of the downscaled hydroclimate changes arise from mean changes in large‐scale thermodynamics and circulation, that is, increases in temperature, moisture, and winds, included in PGW by design. The one component PGW may have difficulty with is the contribution from changes in synoptic‐scale variability. When this component is large, PGW performance could be degraded. Global analysis of GCM data shows there are regions where it is large or dominant. Hence, our results provide a road map to identify, through GCM analyses, the circumstances when PGW would not be expected to accurately regionalize GCM climate signals."

This study carries out a global investigation on the future CFHWs under three scenarios based on 11 models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6). Results reveal a 7.5‐fold increase in global annual CFHW days by 2100 under the intermediate greenhouse‐gas‐emission scenario SSP2‐4.5 compared to that in 1980. Under SSP2‐4.5, population exposure in low‐income countries in the late future (2071–2090) will be about 9‐fold higher than in high‐income countries compared to baseline period (1995–2014). Moreover, exposure of the poor groups living on less than $6.85/day will increase by nearly 28.1‐fold. Eastern Africa and South Asia are identified as particularly high‐risk regions, where large populations living in poverty face rapidly increasing CFHWs. These findings indicate that climate inequality will become more pronounced if climate warming continues without immediate effective measures.

Landschützer,Improving GCM‐Based Decadal Ocean Carbon Flux Predictions Using Observationally‐Constrained Statistical Models,"An essential step toward meeting agreed climate targets and policies is the ability to understand and predict near‐term changes in global carbon cycle, and importantly, ocean carbon uptake. Initialized climate model simulations have proven skillful for near‐term predictability of the key physical climate variables, for example, temperature, precipitation, etc. By comparison, predictions of biogeochemical fields like ocean carbon flux, are still emerging. Initial studies indicate skillful predictions are possible for lead‐times up to 6 years at global scale for some CMIP6 models. However, unlike core physical variables, biogeochemical variables are not directly initialized in existing decadal prediction systems, and extensive empirical parametrization of ocean‐biogeochemistry in Earth System Models introduces a significant source of uncertainty. Here we propose a new approach for improving the skill of decadal ocean carbon flux predictions using observationally‐constrained statistical models, as alternatives to the ocean‐biogeochemistry models. We use observations to train multi‐linear and neural‐network models to predict the ocean carbon flux. To account for observational uncertainties, we train using six different observational estimates of the flux. We then apply these trained statistical models using input predictors from the Canadian Earth System Model (CanESM5) decadal prediction system to produce new decadal predictions. Our hybrid GCM‐statistical approach significantly improves prediction skill, relative to the raw CanESM5 hindcast predictions over 1990–2019. Our hybrid‐model skill is also larger than that obtained by any available CMIP6 model. Using bias‐corrected CanESM5 predictors, we make forecasts for ocean carbon flux over 2020–2029. Both statistical models predict increases in the ocean carbon flux larger than the changes predicted from CanESM5 forecasts. Our work highlights the ability to improve decadal ocean carbon flux predictions by using observationally‐trained statistical models together with robust input predictors from GCM‐based decadal predictions."

Assessing the mechanisms and impacts of the policies of pilot programs of green industrial parks on urban carbon emissions offers critical insights into the efficacy and application of green and low‐carbon development. This study utilizes a staggered difference‐in‐differences model to examine the impact of green industrial park pilot policies. The results demonstrate that green industrial parks have effectively reduced carbon emissions of the studied counties in terms of total and intensity. The economic scales and the administrative levels of any given city significantly influence the implementation effect of green industrial park policy. In applying the green industrial park policy, reducing the carbon emissions is more pronounced in cities with larger economic scales and higher administrative levels. Environmental regulation policies and green industrial park pilot policies exhibit a certain degree of substitution effect. The green industrial parks drive urban carbon emission reduction through three main channels: enhancing green technologies, optimizing industrial structures, and elevating economic agglomeration levels. Overall, this study provides a new perspective, a methodological reference, and empirical evidence for promoting green and low‐carbon development for industrial parks in the different regions and developing countries."

 Io experiences tidal deformation due to its eccentric orbit around Jupiter, which provides a primary energy source for Io’s ongoing volcanic activity and infrared emission1. The amount of tidal energy dissipated within Io is enormous and has been hypothesized to support the large-scale melting of Io’s interior and the formation of a global subsurface magma ocean. If Io has a shallow global magma ocean, its tidal deformation would be much larger than in the case of a more rigid, mostly solid interior2. Here we report the measurement of Io’s tidal deformation, quantified by the gravitational tidal Love number k2, enabled by two recent flybys of the Juno spacecraft. By combining Juno3,4 and Galileo5-7 Doppler data from the Deep Space Network and astrometric observations, we recover Re(k2) of 0.125±0.047 (1σ) and the tidal dissipation parameter Q of 11.4±3.6 (1σ). These measurements confirm that a shallow global magma ocean in Io does not exist and are consistent with Io having a mostly solid mantle2. Our results indicate that tidal forces do not universally create global magma oceans, which may be prevented from forming due to rapid melt ascent, intrusion, and eruption8,9, so even strong tidal heating – like that expected on several known exoplanets and super-Earths10 – may not guarantee the formation of magma oceans on moons or planetary bodies."

 Modern humans arrived in Europe more than 45,000 years ago, overlapping at least 5,000 years with Neanderthals1–4. Limited genomic data from these early modern humans have shown that at least two genetically distinct groups inhabited Europe, represented by Zlatý kůň, Czechia3 and Bacho Kiro, Bulgaria2. Here we deepen our understanding of early modern humans by analyzing one high-coverage genome and five low-coverage genomes from ~45,000 year-old remains from Ilsenhöhle in Ranis, Germany4, and a further high-coverage genome from Zlatý kůň. We show that distant familial relationships link the Ranis and Zlatý kůň individuals and that they were part of the same small, isolated population that represents the deepest known split from the Out-of-Africa lineage. Ranis genomes harbor Neanderthal segments that originate from a single admixture event shared with all non-Africans that we date to ~45,000-49,000 years ago. This implies that ancestors of all non-Africans sequenced to-date resided in a common population at this time, and further suggests that modern human remains older than 50,000 years from outside Africa represent different non-African populations."

 Anti-disialoganglioside (GD2) antibody therapy has provided clinical benefit to patients with neuroblastoma however efficacy is likely impaired by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment. We have previously defined a link between intratumoral copper levels and immune evasion. Here, we report that adjuvant copper chelation potentiates anti-GD2 antibody therapy to confer durable tumor control in immunocompetent models of neuroblastoma. Mechanistic studies reveal copper chelation creates an immune-primed tumor microenvironment through enhanced infiltration and activity of Fc-receptor-bearing cells, specifically neutrophils which are emerging as key effectors of antibody therapy. Moreover, we report copper sequestration by neuroblastoma attenuates neutrophil function which can be successfully reversed using copper chelation to increase pro-inflammatory effector functions. Importantly, we repurpose the clinically approved copper chelating agent Cuprior as a non-toxic, efficacious immunomodulatory strategy. Collectively, our findings provide evidence for the clinical testing of Cuprior as an adjuvant to enhance the activity of anti-GD2 antibody therapy and improve outcomes for patients with neuroblastoma.

Here authors used multineuron patch-clamp in alive human brain tissue, resected during neurosurgeries, to show that membrane potential UP/DOWN states, which mimic neural sleep activity, modulate axonal action potentials to boost synaptic strength and plasticity. 
 Synaptic mechanisms that contribute to human memory consolidation remain largely unexplored. Consolidation critically relies on sleep. During slow wave sleep, neurons exhibit characteristic membrane potential oscillations known as UP and DOWN states. Coupling of memory reactivation to these slow oscillations promotes consolidation, though the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we performed axonal and multineuron patch-clamp recordings in acute human brain slices, obtained from neurosurgeries, to show that sleep-like UP and DOWN states modulate axonal action potentials and temporarily enhance synaptic transmission between neocortical pyramidal neurons. Synaptic enhancement by UP and DOWN state sequences facilitates recruitment of postsynaptic action potentials, which in turn results in long-term stabilization of synaptic strength. In contrast, synapses undergo lasting depression if presynaptic neurons fail to recruit postsynaptic action potentials. Our study offers a mechanistic explanation for how coupling of neural activity to slow waves can cause synaptic consolidation, with potential implications for brain stimulation strategies targeting memory performance. Whether and how slow wave activity (SWA) and the underlying membrane potential UP and DOWN states initiate mechanisms that augment memory functions in humans are not fully understood.

Here, the authors illustrate the importance of the reliability of behavioural measurements to accurately investigate brain-behaviour associations using machine learning. 
 Major efforts in human neuroimaging strive to understand individual differences and find biomarkers for clinical applications by predicting behavioural phenotypes from brain imaging data. To identify generalisable and replicable brain-behaviour prediction models, sufficient measurement reliability is essential. However, the selection of prediction targets is predominantly guided by scientific interest or data availability rather than psychometric considerations. Here, we demonstrate the impact of low reliability in behavioural phenotypes on out-of-sample prediction performance. Using simulated and empirical data from four large-scale datasets, we find that reliability levels common across many phenotypes can markedly limit the ability to link brain and behaviour. Next, using 5000 participants from the UK Biobank, we show that only highly reliable data can fully benefit from increasing sample sizes from hundreds to thousands of participants. Our findings highlight the importance of measurement reliability for identifying meaningful brain–behaviour associations from individual differences and underscore the need for greater emphasis on psychometrics in future research.

Here, the authors report that, given sufficient curvature or duration of a fold, these cells can form an actin “bracket” that holds the fold in place. 
 During morphogenesis, epithelial sheets undergo sequential folding to form three-dimensional organ structures. The resulting folds are often irreversible, ensuring that morphogenesis progresses in one direction. However, the mechanism establishing folding irreversibility remains unclear. Here, we report a mechanical property of epithelia that determines folding irreversibility. Using a mechanical assay, we demonstrate that long-term, high-curvature folding induces plastic, irreversible deformations, while short-term or low-curvature folding results in an elastic, shape-restoring response. This elastic-plastic transition occurs in a switch-like manner, with critical thresholds in folding curvature and duration. The transition is induced by F-actin accumulating into a bracket-like structure across the fold, triggered by cells sensing deformations via mechanosensitive signaling pathways, including TRPC 3/6-mediated calcium influx and ligand-independent EGFR activation. These results demonstrate that cells control epithelial folding irreversibility by detecting folding characteristics and adaptively switching between elastic and plastic responses, providing mechanical insight into the directionality of morphogenesis.

 Legume-rhizobium symbiosis provides a sustainable nitrogen source for agriculture.

 Previous studies projected an increasing risk of uncompensable heat stress indoors in a warming climate. However, little is known about the timing and extent of this risk for those engaged in essential outdoor activities, such as water collection and farming. Here, we employ a physically-based human energy balance model, which considers radiative, wind, and key physiological effects, to project global risk of uncompensable heat stress outdoors using bias-corrected climate model outputs. Focusing on farmers (approximately 850 million people), our model shows that an ensemble median 2.8% (15%) would be subject to several days of uncompensable heat stress yearly at 2 (4) °C of warming relative to preindustrial. Focusing on people who must walk outside to access drinking water (approximately 700 million people), 3.4% (23%) would be impacted at 2 (4) °C of warming. Outdoor work would need to be completed at night or in the early morning during these events.

 Space geodetic techniques have achieved centimeter to even millimeter precision in measuring earth surface deformation. However, a large data gap remains in the offshore area. Offshore man-made structures (e.g., oil/gas platforms) anchored to the ocean bottom provide an opportunity to study seafloor motion in some areas. Although satellite InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) has been widely used to study earth surface deformation, its application to offshore regions is extremely limited. Continuous GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) observations at several tens of offshore platforms in the Adriatic Sea have recently been released. Measuring the same platforms with InSAR provides a great opportunity to assess the feasibility of applying this technique to study seafloor motion on a regional scale using offshore structures. We processed a six-year-long time series of SAR images from the Sentinel-1A satellite using the Permanent Scatterer InSAR (PS-InSAR) method. We assessed the feasibility of phase unwrapping using synthetic data with different velocity fields and noise levels. Correct phase unwrapping could be achieved in the Adriatic Sea and two other large offshore oil/gas fields: the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. Different calibration strategies were applied, and we suggest that the InSAR results could be calibrated with limited and even no GNSS stations. Our InSAR results show good agreement with the GNSS measurements and the InSAR observations from the European Ground Motion Service. In addition, our InSAR results provide deformation measurements at about twenty offshore structures where GNSS stations are not present. Most of the offshore structures have a subsidence rate of no more than 5 mm/year, while a few of them reach about 10 mm/year. Our work demonstrates that it is feasible to apply the InSAR technique to measure displacement of discrete offshore man-made structures (fixed to the ocean bottom) on a regional scale but still on a case-by-case basis. Pre-acquired information including geological settings, existing geodetic observations, and human activity records (e.g., hydrocarbon production) are useful information to assess the feasibility and to validate the InSAR results."

 Most existing soil moisture (SM) products from earth observations and land surface models over the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) have coarse resolutions or are mostly generated with high spatial resolutions based on downscaling methods. The former could hinder the applications in hydrological and ecological analyses at the regional scale and the performance of the latter could be limited by the intricate relationship between SM and downscaling factors in regions with complex topography. To address this issue, this paper aims to retrieve a 1 km SM product from 2017 to 2021 using Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations based on a semi-empirical method specific to the QTP region (SMS-1) as different from the previous downscaled SM products. The main interest in our retrievals is that the semi-empirical modeling approach allows exploring the relationships between microwave backscatters and the soil and vegetation parameters spatially based on well-defined mathematics. The SMS-1 retrievals were evaluated against the observations from five in-situ networks over the QTP and against six other existing downscaled 1 km SM products. The temporal evaluation against in-situ measurements showed that SMS-1 retrievals performed better than most 1 km SM products obtained from Machine Learning methods (median R = 0.57, ubRMSD = 0.064 m3/m3, RMSD = −0.107 m3/m3 and bias = −0.042 m3/m3) except for SMSg. Furthermore, the SMS-1 retrievals presented reasonable spatial patterns that are consistent with the spatial distribution of the grassland-type map. Our Sentinel-1 SAR-based method can therefore potentially serve as a foundation for the advance of active microwave remote sensing SM algorithm to retrieve spatially high-resolution SM."

 To enhance the understanding of the cloud and rain microphysical characteristics in Meiyu frontal systems, we performed a detailed analysis of stochastic collision processes in Meiyu frontal precipitation clouds, using observational data collected at the Bright Summit Meteorological Station on Huangshan (118°09′E, 30°08′N). By employing stochastic collection and breakup equations, this study investigates the primary microphysical processes influencing cloud and rain microphysical properties. Key findings are as follows: Compared to periods before and after the Meiyu season, the number concentration of small cloud droplets decreases, whereas the number concentration of large cloud droplets increases within the Meiyu season, because of relatively stronger collision-coalescence. Raindrop accretion of cloud droplets dominates the stochastic collision process, gradually reducing cloud droplet number concentration, especially, number concentration of small cloud droplets. Both cloud mean diameter and standard deviation increases with the decreasing cloud droplet number concentration, and the increase of standard deviation dominates. As a result, the correlation between cloud relative dispersion and number concentration is negative in general, but fluctuates for different number concentration ranges.

 Two back-to-back heavy rainfall events (HREs) produced enormous rainfall over a pilgrim city, Tirupati, located in the southern peninsular India, during 10–12 November 2021 (149.2 mm) and 17–19 November 2021 (234.2 mm). Surface measurements at Yerpedu, Tirupati (13.74°, 79.60°E) showed a drop of 2–3 °C in temperature and 8 hPa in pressure during HREs, indicating that these HREs were associated with two landfalling tropical depressions from the Bay of Bengal. The sporadic HREs in the past three decades caused floods over Tirupati and devastated landslides in the sacred Tirumala hills especially during the second HRE. Fundamental understanding of diurnal cycle of surface radiation is critical to model the climate. The effect of HREs on the surface essential climate variables at diurnal scale indicate a reduction in peak solar and net radiations by 500 W m−2 (> 62.5 %). Similar to observations, ERA5 reanalysis also indicates a significant reduction in net surface solar and thermal radiations, which are nearly equal in terms of % but vary in magnitude. Net solar and thermal radiations show dominant diurnal cycles with a reduced (66.7 % and 74.4 % respectively) diurnal amplitudes from no-rain to HREs. Soil moisture drydown curves at 5- and 10-cm depths shows 3 h long e-folding decay time for HREs, indicating an enhanced soil moisture memory after HREs. The soil drying process takes longer time at 10 cm than at 5 cm depth. Soil temperatures are significantly low at 5 cm to 30 cm depths and less than the 50 cm depth with weak diurnal variation during the events.

In this study, we discovered that phage diversity consistently outstripped the diversity of their bacterial hosts under simple experimental conditions. We assembled and passaged dozens of diverse phage communities on a single, nonevolving strain ofEscherichia coliuntil the phage communities reached equilibrium. In all cases, we found that two or more phage species coexisted stably, despite competition for a single, clonal host population. Phage coexistence was supported through host phenotypic heterogeneity, whereby bacterial cells adopting different growth phenotypes served as niches for different phage species. Our experiments reveal that a rich community ecology of bacteriophages can emerge on a single bacterial host."

It is unknown whether the Sun can generate superflares and, if so, how often they might occur. We used photometry from the Kepler space observatory to investigate superflares on other stars with Sun-like fundamental parameters. We identified 2889 superflares on 2527 Sun-like stars, out of 56,450 observed. This detection rate indicates that superflares with energies >1034erg occur roughly once per century on stars with Sun-like temperature and variability. The resulting stellar superflare frequency-energy distribution is consistent with an extrapolation of the Sun’s flare distribution to higher energies, so we suggest that both are generated by the same physical mechanism."

We found that this “stem cell collision” generates an injury-induced tissue niche containing keratin 5+epithelial cells and plastic Pdgfra+mesenchymal cells. Single-cell analysis revealed that the injury-induced niche is governed by mesenchymal proliferation and Notch signaling, which suppressed Wnt/Fgf signaling in the injured niche. Conversely, loss of Notch signaling rewired alveolar signaling patterns to promote functional regeneration and gas exchange. Signaling patterns in injury-induced niches can differentiate fibrotic from degenerative human lung diseases through altering the direction of Wnt/Fgf signaling. Thus, we have identified an injury-induced niche in the lung with the ability to discriminate human lung disease phenotypes."

We unravel the genetic basis of sexually selected plumage traits to investigate their effects on reproductive isolation in barn swallows. The genetic architecture of sexual traits is characterized by 12 loci on two autosomes and the Z chromosome. Sexual trait loci exhibit signatures of divergent selection in geographic isolation and barriers to gene flow in secondary contact. Linkage disequilibrium between these genes has been maintained by selection in hybrid zones beyond what would be expected under admixture alone. Our findings reveal that selection on coupled sexual trait loci promotes reproductive isolation, providing key empirical evidence for the role of sexual selection in speciation."

One issue lies in the interconnects connecting the transistors, in which the resistivity of metals increases exponentially as their dimensions are scaled down to match those of the transistors. As a result, the total signal processing delay is dominated by the resistance-capacitance (RC) delay from the interconnects rather than the delay from the transistors’ switching speed. This bottleneck has spurred efforts both in academia and industry to explore alternative materials and disruptive device structures.

Moreover, the pressing need to determine when and where NbS should be used raises challenges to socioecological data integration as we overcome spatiotemporal resolutions. Natural and working lands is an effort promoting NbS, particularly emissions reduction and carbon stock maintenance in forests. To overcome the spatiotemporal limitation, we integrated life cycle assessments (LCA), an ecological carbon stock model, and a land cover land use change model to synthesize rates of global warming potential (GWP) within a fine-scale geographic area (30 m). We scaled National Agricultural Statistic Survey land management data to National Land Cover Data cropland extents to assess GWP of cropland management over time and among management units (i.e. counties and production systems). We found that cropland extent alone was not indicative of GWP emissions; rather, rates of management intensity, such as energy and fertilizer use, are greater indicators of anthropogenic GWP. We found production processes for fuel and fertilizers contributed 51.93% of GWP, where 33.58% GWP was estimated from N2O emissions after fertilization, and only 13.31% GWP was due to energy consumption by field equipment. This demonstrates that upstream processes in LCA should be considered in NbS with the relative contribution of fertilization to GWP. Additionally, while land cover change had minimal GWP effect, urbanization will replace croplands and forests where NbS are implemented. Fine-scale landscape variations are essential for NbS to identify, as they accumulate within regional and global estimates. As such, this study demonstrates the capability to harness both LCA and fine-resolution imagery for applications in spatiotemporal and socioecological research towards identifying and monitoring NbS."

Logging is highly selective in the region, with an average of 0.7–4.0 trees harvested per ha, but its direct impact on forest structure and the spatial variation of this impact remain understudied. Here, we investigated the direct impact of logging on forest structure, we related this impact to logging intensity and canopy opening. We compiled unique datasets collecting field measurements and aerial observations in four FSC certified concessions. Our data includes pre- and post-logging inventory of forest plots covering 38 ha, records of over 6000 harvested trees, and drone RGB images covering over 6000 ha. In average, logging activities reduced forest above-ground biomass by 8.8%, stem density by 6.5%, basal-area by 8.5% and canopy cover by 4.4%. Strong relationships were found between the reduction in biomass, stem density, or basal area with logging intensity, canopy opening and the number and volume of harvested trees (relative root mean squared error (rRMSE) between 0.128 and 0.164). Additionally, we demonstrated that canopy opening can be a good indicator to monitor and upscale logging intensity (rRMSE between 0.0005 and 0.0022). This study is the first covering extensive inventory plots and uninhabited aerial vehicle images before and after logging in different locations in Central Africa, providing a valuable reference to evaluate the impact of logging on forest structure. It demonstrates how canopy opening can be used to estimate measurements usually collected in the field and provides to the remote sensing community a unique dataset that will help improving monitoring systems (Dupuis et al 2024 (available at: https://hdl.handle.net/2268/323683)).

Here, we identified biases in the current GEDI L4A AGBD product compared to National Forest Inventory (NFI) data for the Southeast Asian country of Laos, with absolute bias values ranging from −54.24 to 106.23 Mg Ha−1 across different forest types. We optimised the GEDI L4A AGBD model configurations for natural forests in Laos and calibrated them with ancillary variables. The biases were significantly reduced (average bias reduction for all forest types = 42.2 Mg Ha−1), with the greatest reduction for the evergreen (EG) forest type. The calibrated GEDI footprints were aggregated to produce a country-wide map of AGBD for natural forests. The approach also enabled the updating of national-level estimates of average AGBD stock for each forest class in Laos using a model-assisted estimator complementary to the existing NFI design-based estimator.

Additionally, the positive correlation between SOC loss and regional gross domestic product highlights the trade-off between economic development model of urban expansion through cropland encroachment and the resulting substantial SOC loss.

The potential surge in these occurrences threatens both human health and the Arctic ecosystem. Our ongoing research yields insights into spatial patterns and biodiversity, challenging the belief that the Arctic is unsuitable for toxic and harmful algal events. This work underscores the need to comprehend and address the ecological impact of these emerging species in the Arctic environment. 
 The Arctic Ocean is currently undergoing significant transformations due to climate change, leading to profound changes in its microbial plankton communities, including photoautotrophic prokaryotes and eukaryotes (i.e. phytoplankton), as well as hetero-, phago-, and mixotrophic protistan species. Among these unicellular organisms, species of potentially toxic and/or harmful algae (hereafter referred to as HA) are of particular concern, as they pose a threat to human and ecosystem health if they potentially spread into Arctic waters. Despite their importance, the spatiotemporal distribution of these communities in the North American Arctic is poorly understood. To address this gap, we compiled and synthesized a large dataset from various sources, partitioned into nine regions based on the Large Marine Ecosystem classification. Our dataset contains 385 348 georeferenced data points and 18 268 unique sampling events (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10498858, Schiffrine et al., 2024), encompassing 1442 unique taxa, with Heterokontophyta (notably diatoms) and Dinoflagellata being the most dominant phyla. Our results indicate distinct spatial patterns of diversity, with the highest diversity observed in Atlantic-influenced regions of the North American Arctic. An analysis of the maximum latitude of HA species over time shows a gradual increase, with a notable rise towards the 1990s. However, this trend is likely influenced by increased research at higher latitudes, meaning no substantial spread of HA species into the North American part of the Arctic. Our study underscores the importance of extensive and long-term sampling efforts to understand the Arctic's biodiversity, particularly with respect to documenting the presence and distribution of HA species. While the occurrence of HA species in the Arctic is recognized, our findings highlight the need for further detailed investigations to fully grasp their ecological impacts and variability in the region. Overall, our results provide new insights into the spatial patterns and biodiversity of the microbial plankton communities in the North American Arctic and have implications for understanding the ecological functioning and response of this region to ongoing climate change."

The database consists of primary climate variables such as precipitation, temperature, radiation, wind speed, pressure, and atmospheric humidity, but also bioclimatic variables and extreme indices, both useful information for assessing the impact of climate change in this region. These datasets are only available on  https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14364865 
 High spatiotemporal climate datasets are essential to assess the impacts of climate change in high mountains, where the climate is highly variable. However, these regions are characterized by a lack of climatic information, and if any, it is usually short, sparse, or incomplete. This work presents a new series of very high-resolution (1 km) gridded climate datasets for Sierra Nevada (SN), a mountain range classified as a double climate-change hotspot, as it is a semi-arid mountain range in the Mediterranean area that is particularly vulnerable to climate change. The database, called HighResClimNevada, consists of a set of climate data derived from a climate simulation using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for the period from 1991 to 2022 and forced with the ERA5 reanalysis. HighResClimNevada provides hourly/daily primary climate variables (i.e., near-surface temperature, precipitation, near-surface relative humidity, surface pressure, surface net radiation, and wind speed), but also bioclimatic variables, extremes indices from the Expert Team of Climate Change Detection and Indices (ETCCDI), and precipitation-hour indicators, which were postprocessed using aggregated temperature and precipitation values from primary climate variables. To evaluate the database performance, HighResClimNevada temperature and precipitation values were compared with reference datasets from different sources. In general, HighResClimNevada captures reasonably well the spatiotemporal variability of raw temperature but also bioclimatic variables and extreme indices in SN. It displays comparable behavior to other climatic products but with a greater level of detail due to its higher spatial resolution. For precipitation, variable, more uncertain and difficult to characterize, HighResClimNevada exhibits a higher amount of precipitation when compared to station-based, coarse satellite-based, and reanalysis-based products. However, these latter present problems in characterizing precipitation in high mountain regions due to the scarcity of data in areas with high spatiotemporal variability, such as SN. The precipitation from HighResClimNevada is comparable to other climatic products like CHIRPS or CERRA-Land, which captures better the spatiotemporal variability in this region. These findings, therefore, suggest HighResClimNevada as a valuable long-term climate tool for a variety of applications, including land management, hydrometeorological research, flora and fauna phenology, and risk assessment.

We show that using a simpler 2D framework improves robustness, speeds up training, and reduces computational needs by 20 %–30 %. We introduce a training procedure that varies the importance of atmospheric variables over time to speed up training convergence. Decreasing computational demand increases the accessibility of training and working with the model. 
 Data-driven medium-range weather forecasts have recently outperformed classical numerical weather prediction models, with Pangu-Weather (PGW) being the first breakthrough model to achieve this. The Transformer-based PGW introduced novel architectural components including the three-dimensional attention mechanism (3D Transformer) in the Transformer blocks. Additionally, it features an Earth-specific positional bias term which accounts for weather states being related to the absolute position on Earth. However, the effectiveness of different architectural components is not yet well understood. Here, we reproduce the 24 h forecast model of PGW based on subsampled 6-hourly data. We then present an ablation study of PGW to better understand the sensitivity to the model architecture and training procedure. We find that using a two-dimensional attention mechanism (2D Transformer) yields a model that is more robust to training, converges faster, and produces better forecasts compared to using the 3D Transformer. The 2D Transformer reduces the overall computational requirements by 20 %–30 %. Further, the Earth-specific positional bias term can be replaced with a relative bias, reducing the model size by nearly 40 %. A sensitivity study comparing the convergence of the PGW model and the 2D-Transformer model shows large batch effects; however, the 2D-Transformer model is more robust to such effects. Lastly, we propose a new training procedure that increases the speed of convergence for the 2D-Transformer model by 30 % without any further hyperparameter tuning."

We investigate the effect of our updates on different variables with a focus on sea ice and show an improved sea ice representation as compared with observations. 
 In recent years, the Antarctic sea ice has experienced major changes, which are neither well understood nor adequately reproduced by earth system models. To support model development with an aim to improve Antarctic sea ice and upper ocean predictions, the impacts of updating the sea ice model and the atmospheric forcing are investigated. In the new MetROMS-UHel-v1.0 (henceforth MetROMS-UHel) ocean-sea ice model, the sea ice component has been updated from CICE5 to CICE6, and the forcing has been updated from ERA-Interim to ERA5 reanalyses. Both CICE sea ice models were coupled with the regional ROMS ocean model. We find that the update of CICE and ERA reduced the negative bias of the sea ice area in summer. However, the sea ice volume decreases after the CICE update but increase when the atmospheric forcing is updated. As a net result after both updates, the modelled sea ice becomes thinner and more deformed, particularly near the coast. The ROMS ocean model usually yielded a deeper ocean mix layer compared to observations. Using ERA5, the situation was slightly improved. The update from CICE5 to CICE6 resulted in a fresher coastal ocean due to a smaller salt flux from sea ice to the ocean. In the ice shelf cavities, the modelled melt rates are underestimated compared with observations, which could be attributed to missing tides and inadequate model resolution. These identified sea ice and oceanic changes vary seasonally and regionally. By determining sea ice and oceanic changes after the model and forcing updates, and evaluating them against observations, this study informs modellers on improvements and aspects requiring attention with potential model adjustments."

This study presents a machine learning-assisted “shrink-restricted” SERS strategy (SRSS) to monitor molecular changes in the cellular secretome exposure to six types of NPs. Utilizing three-dimensional (3D) Ag@hydrogel-based SRSS, active targeting of molecules within adjustable nanogaps was achieved to track information. Machine learning was employed to analyze the overall spectral profiles, biochemical signatures, and time-dependent changes. Results indicate that environmentally derived NPs exhibited higher toxicity to BEAS-2B and L02 cells. Notably, the “NPs carrier effect,” resulting from pollutant adsorption, proved to be more harmful. This effect altered the death pathway of BEAS-2B cells from a combination of apoptosis and ferroptosis to primarily ferroptosis. Furthermore, L02 cells demonstrated greater metabolic vulnerability to NPs exposure than that of BEAS-2B cells, especially concerning the “NPs carrier effect.” Traditional detection methods for cell death often rely on end point assays, which limit temporal resolution and focus on single or multiple markers.

However, the atomic-level mechanisms by which different iron species, including isolated sites, clusters, and particles, participate in N2O decomposition in the presence of CO still remain poorly understood, which hinders the application of the reaction in practical technology. Herein, through experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we identified that isolated iron sites were active for N2O activation to generate adsorbed O* species, which readily reacted with CO following the Eley–Rideal (E-R) mechanism. In contrast, Fe2O3 particles exhibited a different reaction pathway, directly reacting with CO to generate oxygen vacancies (Ov), which could efficiently dissociate N2O following the Mars-van Krevelen (MvK) mechanism. Moreover, the transformation of iron oxide clusters into undercoordinated FeOx species by CO was also revealed through various techniques, such as CO-temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), and ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. Our study provides deeper insights into the roles of different iron species in N2O-SCR by CO, and is anticipated to facilitate the understanding of multicomponent catalysis and the design of efficient iron-containing catalysts for practical applications."

Existing approaches provide inadequate understandings of the processes regulating metal bioavailability under nonequilibrium conditions. Experiments were conducted to improve our understanding of the metal bioavailability dynamics induced by sediment resuspension and subsequent redeposition (reequilibration). An isotopically modified bioassay, a novel stable isotope tracing technique, was used to measure metal bioavailability (assimilation rates) to clams within short time windows. Changes in metal partitioning were characterized by porewater analysis using in situ extraction and the diffusive gradients in thin-films technique. Results showed that sediment resuspension released metals into porewater, while reequilibration scavenged metals from the porewater. The assimilation rates of Ni, Cu, and Pb increased with the resuspension time, aligning with increasing porewater concentrations. Unexpectedly, during reequilibration, the metal assimilation rates did not decrease. The discrepancies between bioavailability to the clam and porewater extrapolations may be due to differing sustained conditions of metals in sediments. Overall, this study unveils the metal bioavailability dynamics in nonequilibrium sediments, which could not be accurately predicted relying solely on porewater analysis. Incorporating rapid bioassays to determine bioavailability offers a valuable tool for robust ecological risk assessment."

The use of biocontainment such as kill switches is a critical approach to prevent the unintended proliferation of GEMs; however, the effectiveness of kill switches─reported as escape rates, i.e., the ratio of the number of viable microbes when the kill switch is triggered relative to the number when it is not triggered─is typically assessed under laboratory conditions that do not resemble environmental conditions under which biocontainment must perform. In this study, we discovered that the escape rate of an Escherichia coli GEM biocontained with a CRISPR-based kill switch triggered by anhydrotetracycline (aTc) increased by 3–4 orders of magnitude when deployed in natural surface waters as compared to rich laboratory media. We identified that environmental conditions (e.g., pH, nutrient levels) may contribute to elevated escape rates in multiple ways, including by altering the chemical speciation of the kill switch trigger to reduce its uptake and providing limited nutrients required for the kill switch to function.

We found up to 100% ISF for 38 PFAS in six classes, which all contain the carboxylate (CO2–) headgroup, including perfluoro(di)carboxylates (PF(di)CA), omega H/Cl substituted PFCA (ωH/Cl-PFCA), fluorotelomer carboxylates, and perfluoroalkyl ether carboxylates (PFECA). Seven ISF pathways were identified, including direct cleavage of C–CO2–, C–O, and C–C bonds and eliminations of HF/CO2HF through cyclic transition states by the mechanisms of β-elimination, McLafferty rearrangement, or H···F bridging. We found that the loss of CO2 is a prerequisite for most other pathways, explaining the absence of ISF for PFAS without a CO2– headgroup. The elevated bond dissociation energy of C–CO2– explained the reduced ISF for long-chain PFCA and ωH-PFCA. Raising the MS vaporizer and ion transfer tube temperatures significantly aggravated the ISF of most PFAS.

We compare our results from the mid‐latitude Christmas Valley East radar with measurements of the vertical electron density profile from the nearby Boulder Digisonde, finding the changes in 1‐ and 2‐hop ground scatter skip distance are well correlated with the F2 ${F}_{2}$‐layer density response, which lags the peak obscuration by ∼ ${\sim} $30 min. Changes in the line‐of‐sight Doppler shifts are better aligned with the time derivative of eclipse obscuration."
10.1029/2024GL112484,False,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究的是2024年4月8日日全食对电离层-热层系统的影响。研究利用了四个美国的SuperDARN雷达和一个Digisonde探测器在日全食期间的观测数据，重点关注Blackstone SuperDARN雷达的观测结果。研究发现，日全食导致地物散射多普勒速度发生了变化，并且最大影响出现的时间与日全食最大遮挡时间之间存在约45分钟的延迟。SAMI3模拟的结果无法解释这种时间延迟的不对称性，表明中性大气在控制电离层等离子体动力学方面起着重要作用，而这在SAMI3模拟中是被忽略的。总的来说，该研究属于电离层物理学范畴，与大气环境遥感技术（例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）关系不大。,"['ionosphere', 'thermosphere', 'Doppler velocity', 'SuperDARN radar', 'Digisonde', 'eclipse effect', 'SAMI3 simulation']",B.

This rare scenario provided an excellent opportunity to monitor the large‐scale ionospheric response to the eclipse. In this study, we present observations made by the Blackstone (BKS) SuperDARN radar and a Digisonde during the eclipse. Two striking effects were observed by the BKS radar: (a) the Doppler velocities associated with ground scatter coalesced into a pattern clearly organized by the line of totality, with a reversal in sign across this line, and, (b) a delay of ∼ ${\sim} $45 min between time of maximum obscuration and maximum effect on the skip distance. The skip distance estimated using a SAMI3 simulation of the eclipse did not however capture the asymmetric time‐delay.

Since climate controls runoff, streamflow, and erosion regimes, we looked for dependency of drainage basin morphometrics on climate within a near‐global data set. We show that increasingly arid regions have longer channels and narrower drainage basins, and power law scaling between channel length and basin area (Hack's Law) increases monotonically with aridity. We suggest these results arise due to downstream channel extension by rare large floods that erode channels into previously unchanneled terrain, yielding a morphometric signature in drylands that is preserved over long timescales due to a lack of subsequent topographic smoothing. This new understanding of drainage basin morphometrics on Earth may be used to inform interpretations of past climates on our planet and other solar system bodies."

Using a coupled atmosphere‐ocean model, the impacts of the typhoon‐induced sea surface cooling (SSC) on the DWC structure were also examined. In both the coupled and uncoupled simulations, the middle‐level warm‐core (MWC) decayed as the tangential wind expanded outward during the SEF, even in the absence of SSC. Under the thermal wind balance, the cooling of the MWC was an inherent result to ensure the dynamic consistency during the SEF. In contrast to the uncoupled simulation, the upper‐level warm‐core (UWC) decayed under the influence of SSC, significantly contributing to the rapid weakening of Trami. The negative effects of the SSC on the UWC were more detrimental to the intensity of Trami. Results from the potential temperature (PT) budget of improved accuracy indicated that the decrease in the warming due to the radial eddy advection was mainly responsible for the decay of the MWC. The flattened radial gradient of PT during the SEF accounted for the reduction in the dynamical eye warming associated with the asymmetric mixing. In addition to the convectively induced subsidence, the upper‐level asymmetric structures could also be affected by the SSC. Consequently, the increase in the cooling due to the enhanced asymmetry collaborated with the decrease in the adiabatic warming, leading to the decay of the UWC in the coupled simulation."

 The androgen receptor (AR) is central in prostate tissue identity and differentiation, and controls normal growth-suppressive, prostate-specific gene expression. It also drives prostate tumorigenesis when hijacked for oncogenic transcription. The execution of growth-suppressive AR transcriptional programs in prostate cancer (PCa) and the potential for reactivation remain unclear. Here, we use a genome-wide approach to modulate canonical androgen response element (ARE) motifs—the classic DNA binding elements for AR—to delineate distinct AR transcriptional programs. We find that activating these AREs promotes differentiation and growth-suppressive transcription, potentially leading to AR+ PCa cell death, while ARE repression is tolerated by PCa cells but deleterious to normal prostate cells. Gene signatures driven by ARE activity correlate with improved prognosis and luminal phenotypes in PCa patients. Canonical AREs maintain a normal, lineage-specific transcriptional program that can be reengaged in PCa cells, offering therapeutic potential and clinical relevance.

Here they show that the mitochondrial fusion-fission equilibrium can determine the pluripotency of planarian stem cells and that mitonuclear balance is critical for planarian regeneration. 
 Tissue regeneration is a complex process involving large changes in cell proliferation, fate determination, and differentiation. Mitochondrial dynamics and metabolism play a crucial role in development and wound repair, but their function in large-scale regeneration remains poorly understood. Planarians offer an excellent model to investigate this process due to their remarkable regenerative abilities. In this study, we examine mitochondrial dynamics during planarian regeneration. We find that knockdown of the mitochondrial fusion gene, opa1, impairs both tissue regeneration and stem cell pluripotency. Interestingly, the regeneration defects caused by opa1 knockdown are rescued by simultaneous knockdown of the mitochondrial fission gene, drp1, which partially restores mitochondrial dynamics. Furthermore, we discover that Mitolow stem cells exhibit an enrichment of pluripotency due to their fate choices at earlier stages. Transcriptomic analysis reveals the delicate mitonuclear balance in metabolism and mitochondrial proteins in regeneration, controlled by mitochondrial dynamics. These findings highlight the importance of maintaining mitochondrial dynamics in large-scale tissue regeneration and suggest the potential for manipulating these dynamics to enhance stem cell functionality and regenerative processes.

 Accurate crop yield prediction is of utmost importance for informed decision-making in agriculture, aiding farmers, industry stakeholders, and policymakers in optimizing agricultural practices. However, this task is complex and depends on multiple factors, such as environmental conditions, soil properties, and management practices. Leveraging Remote Sensing (RS) technologies, multi-modal data from diverse global data sources can be collected to enhance predictive model accuracy. However, combining heterogeneous RS data poses a fusion challenge, like identifying the specific contribution of each modality in the predictive task. In this paper, we present a novel multi-modal learning approach to predict crop yield for different crops (soybean, wheat, rapeseed) and regions (Argentina, Uruguay, and Germany). Our multi-modal input data includes multi-spectral optical images from Sentinel-2 satellites and weather data as dynamic features during the crop growing season, complemented by static features like soil properties and topographic information. To effectively fuse the multi-modal data, we introduce a Multi-modal Gated Fusion (MMGF) model, comprising dedicated modality-encoders and a Gated Unit (GU) module. The modality-encoders handle the heterogeneity of data sources with varying temporal resolutions by learning a modality-specific representation. These representations are adaptively fused via a weighted sum. The fusion weights are computed for each sample by the GU using a concatenation of the multi-modal representations. The MMGF model is trained at sub-field level with 10 m resolution pixels. Our evaluations show that the MMGF outperforms conventional models on the same task, achieving the best results by incorporating all the data sources, unlike the usual fusion results in the literature. For Argentina, the MMGF model achieves an R2 value of 0.68 at sub-field yield prediction, while at the field level evaluation (comparing field averages), it reaches around 0.80 across different countries. The GU module learned different weights based on the country and crop-type, aligning with the variable significance of each data source to the prediction task. This novel method has proven its effectiveness in enhancing the accuracy of the challenging sub-field crop yield prediction. Our investigation indicates that the gated fusion approach promises a significant advancement in the field of agriculture and precision farming."

 Accurate and timely mapping of rural settlements using medium-resolution satellite imagery, such as Landsat data, is crucial for evaluating rural infrastructure, estimating ecological service values, assessing the quality of life for rural populations, and promoting sustainable rural development. Current mapping techniques, including pixel-based and object-based classifications, primarily focus on identifying artificial surfaces, often failing to capture the complete spatial footprint of rural settlements. These settlements consist of diverse land cover elements, such as houses, roads, agricultural buildings, ponds, parks, and woodlands, which together form entities with distinct local characteristics. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel classification strategy: Entity-Based Image Analysis (EBIA). Inspired by cognitive principles of human visual perception, EBIA groups related land cover elements and differentiates settlements from their background. The key innovation of EBIA lies in its ability to incorporate semantic features within rural settlements, transforming pixel-level land cover classification results (Phase 1) into entity-level settlement mapping results (Phase 2). Our results demonstrate that EBIA effectively maps the comprehensive footprint of rural settlement entities, achieving F1 scores ranging from 0.79 to 0.88 across five globally selected experimental areas. Furthermore, EBIA can be utilized to monitor changes in rural settlements using long-term Landsat imagery.

 Canopy height mapping is critical for assessing forest structure, forest resilience, carbon stocks, habitat, and biodiversity, all of which are threatened by changing climate and weather extremes. While current tools utilizing lidar (e.g., GEDI) and multispectral imagery (e.g., Landsat, Sentinel-2, airborne imagery) produce canopy height products, significant challenges remain, particularly in capturing fine-scale spatial details across large areas with high frequency. PlanetScope CubeSat imagery, with its 3 m spatial resolution and near-daily frequency, offers a unique opportunity to estimate woody plant structure by capturing fine-scale texture and temporal patterns that shift throughout the year. In this study, we adapted a 3D Spatio-Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (ST-CNN) to estimate canopy height at 3 m resolution, utilizing sequential PlanetScope time series over five months, summer Sentinel-1 radar imagery, and solar illumination layers as inputs. We generated a large and diverse reference database covering 2,296 sample scenes (each scene = 768 × 768 m, totaling ∼135,000 ha) using a semi-automatic labeling process that leverages 23 aerial lidar surveys conducted in California between 2016 and 2021. Trained on a random selection of 2,046 scenes, the accuracy assessment on the remaining 250 scenes demonstrates strong performance across various ecoregions, capturing 80.8% of the observed variance in live canopy height with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.6 m and a bias of -0.53 m compared with aerial lidar. Analysis of all 681 GEDI footprints over the same testing scenes estimates the MAE of 6.5 m, bias of -1.82 m, and R2 of 0.58 for the GEDI L2A Vector Canopy Top Height RH98 product. The ST-CNN model accurately identifies heterogeneous canopy structures, and shows sensitivity to canopies reaching 50 to 60 m in height. We found a major contribution from the PlanetScope time series, compared to a single PlanetScope image, and marginal benefits of including Sentinel-1 and terrain-based solar irradiance layers to improve performance on dense canopies or diverse topography. Example applications demonstrate the ability to generalize to different years, maintaining consistent predictions between years and capturing changes in canopy height over a seven year period (2017–2023) within 400 plots representing regrowth, minimal change, selective logging, and clear cut areas. We also demonstrate improved canopy height estimation compared to existing products from Landsat (MAE = 8.41 m) and Sentinel-2 (MAE = 7.19 m). A visualization tool displays our data alongside existing products for the Sierra Nevada in 2022.

 Satellite images have been adopted in recent years for identifying topographical features on the Earth’s surface. Researchers have also published reports on the use of satellite images to analyze shoreline changes or to verify shoreline change in numerical models. But reports that demonstrate the reverse process of using satellite images to estimate the incident waves to a beach are rare, particularly to a place where protective coastal structures exist. This paper describes a once-thriving coastal townsite with two fishing ports in Korea which has been transformed into a typical example that relies on protective structures with occasional artificial nourishment to maintain its shoreline stability in the past 20 years. Unlike many others, this study proposes a new methodology to estimate the deepwater wave heights based on the analysis of shoreline data extracted from satellite images over 5 years (2019–2023) for Wonpyeong-Chogok Beach, its median sediment grain sizes D50, and the known empirical relationship between sediment and waves. The entire shoreline of 2,860 m in length is divided into 39 transects, of which one-half of it is protected by submerged and emergent detached breakwaters, where shoreline has advanced, while the rest has eroded. From the standard deviation values calculated from the extracted shoreline location data, the influence of long-term trends was excluded, and the intrinsic standard deviation is obtained by applying sediment size information, and then the incident deep-water (average annual maximum) wave height of 4.363 m was estimated. Applying this methodology to the beach area where the coastal structure was placed, the wave transmission of the coastal structure was calculated 0.91 and 0.72 for LCSs and TT-DBWs, respectively, through the reduction ratio of the standard deviation. Finally, discussions are made on how the resolution of the Sentinel-2 satellite images in affecting the standard deviation and long-term trend results in the shoreline data."

 A wide variety of spatially explicit modeling algorithms has recently mushroomed in geoinformation research. These algorithms establish local models with data from spatially confined subsets, thereby offering a new impetus for addressing the issue of spatiotemporal non-stationarity. However, a significant challenge persists in literature that local models are primarily predicated on linear assumptions, limiting their capacity to capture the non-linear relationships prevalent in real-world geographical phenomena. This study remedies this gap through proposing a novel approach that integrates the bagging and stacking approaches of ensemble learning into the spatially explicit modeling framework. We specifically develop the SpatioTemporal Random Forest (STRF) and SpatioTemporal Stacking Tree (STST) algorithms1, which capture and interpret the non-linearity in the spatial and temporal context more effectively. Additionally, we introduce the ‘local importance score’ and ‘spatiotemporally accumulated local effects’ as novel interpretable metrics for visualizing and unraveling the dynamics of non-stationarity in spatial analyses. Simulation and real data experiments validate that the STRF and STST outperform over traditional spatially explicit modeling algorithms to a large content. This study contributes to the methodological innovation of spatially explicit modeling by bringing the nonlinearity in spatiotemporal non-stationarity to the fore."

 We investigate the problem of 3D point clouds semantic segmentation. Recently, a large amount of research work has focused on local feature aggregation. However, the foundational framework of semantic segmentation of 3D point clouds has been neglected, where the majority of current methods default to the U-Net framework. In this study, we present U-Next, a small but mighty framework designed specifically for point cloud semantic segmentation. The key innovation of this framework is to capture multi-scale hierarchical features. Specifically, we construct the U-Next by stacking multiple U-Net L1 sub-networks in a dense arrangement to diminish the semantic gap. Concurrently, it integrates feature maps across various scales to proficiently restore intricate fine-grained details. Additionally, a multi-level deep supervision mechanism is introduced for smoothing gradient propagation and facilitating network optimization. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmarks, including the indoor S3DIS dataset, the LiDAR-based outdoor Toronto3D dataset, and the urban-scale photogrammetry-based SensatUrban dataset, demonstrate the superiority of U-Next. The U-Next framework consistently exhibits significant performance enhancements across various benchmarks and baselines, demonstrating its considerable potential as a versatile point-based framework for future endeavors.

 Shallow water environmental information is crucial for the study of marine ecosystems and human activities. There have been numerous satellite remote sensing studies focused on this area. However, accurate information acquisition from remote sensing data remains difficult in this region due to the complexity of the environment and the coupling between benthic reflectance and water column scattering. In this study, we developed a method to retrieve the diffuse attenuation coefficient (Kd), seafloor classification, and bathymetric maps by combining satellite laser altimetry and optical remote sensing imagery in shallow water areas. Firstly, the relationships between remote sensing reflectance (Rrs), water depth, and Kd were established based on radiative transfer theory. This method allows for the retrieval of Kd in shallow water regions, overcoming the limitations present in previous studies. Secondly, we eliminated the water column attenuation and obtained the bottom reflectance index (BRI). The BRI allowed us to determine the bottom reflectance and classify the seafloor using the Gaussian mixture model clustering method. This approach can effectively reduce the error in bathymetric inversion caused by variations in bottom reflectance. Finally, we developed a neural network model for bathymetric inversion. The model inputs consist of Rrs data and spectral shape data containing physical constraint information, aiming to achieve a robust estimation performance. We conducted the study in two experimental areas (the Bimini Islands and the Yongle Atoll) and compared the results with validation data to evaluate the algorithm performance. The results indicated an agreement between the estimated Kd and the validation data (inferred Kd490 values of 0.062 m−1 and 0.058 m−1, compared to a validation data range of 0.055–0.087 m−1 and 0.059–0.070 m−1, respectively). In addition, the seafloor classification accuracy was 86.74 % for the Yongle Atoll area. Finally, the neural network model accurately predicted the bathymetry in the two regions. The accuracy of the bathymetric maps improved significantly with seafloor classification, as indicated by reductions in root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.12 m and 0.15 m, and in mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) by 2.24 % and 5.87 %, respectively. Overall, the proposed method can be used to effectively decouple benthic and water column signals and accurately obtain Kd, bottom reflectance, and bathymetric information for shallow water environments, providing unprecedented information for assessing and monitoring ecosystems and facilitating further research."

 Accurate representation of the stable atmospheric surface layer (ASL) in numerical models has been a challenging task due to the occurrence of different physical processes such as radiative transport, turbulent mixing, and the coupling of vegetation with the atmosphere and underlying soil, as well as aspects of land use heterogeneity, etc. The Monin-Obukhov similarity theory has been widely used to parameterize surface turbulent fluxes in numerical models, which utilize similarity functions to account for the effect of atmospheric stability. Over the years, researchers have proposed various forms of similarity functions, depending on different field experiment datasets around the globe. This study incorporates some of the well-established non-linear similarity functions under stable stratification in the revised MM5 surface layer scheme in the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) Model version 4.2.2 and hence develop a scheme that has various functional forms of similarity functions for computing surface turbulent fluxes under stable stratification. The proposed scheme has been evaluated in simulating near-surface atmospheric variables and surface turbulent fluxes over the domain centered around the location of the Ranchi dataset site (23.412oN, 85.440oE; India) and the CASES-99 experiment site (37.38oN, 96.44oW; Kansas, USA) during the months of January 2009 and October 1999, respectively. The modified scheme is also evaluated for the three contrasting nights representative of intermittently turbulent, fully turbulent, and radiative ASL based on the CASES-99 dataset. In general, all the newly installed similarity functions are found to be consistent in predicting surface turbulent fluxes as well as near-surface atmospheric variables with respect to the default surface layer scheme and the observed data derived from the flux towers over the two domains. However, this study reveals that all the similarity functions are found to be inconsistent during the fully turbulent night while they seem comparable for the first and last nights based on the CASES-99 dataset."

Mechanical-electrical coupled stimulation optimizes balloon electrodes with hemispherical electric field uniformity.

Our study reveals neural zinc finger (Nzf2) as a crucial orchestrator that controls the timing of OL differentiation both during development and myelin repair, contrasting with its previously suggested role in direct myelin gene regulation.Nzf2ablation delays the onset of OL differentiation, while hyperactivation stimulates OL differentiation both during development and remyelination. Using RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, we pinpoint Nkx2.2 as a critical downstream target of Nzf2. Specific binding of Nzf2 in theNkx2.2gene locus inhibits histone deacetylation by disrupting the HDAC1 repressor complex and reducing deacetylase activity. Furthermore, Nzf2 overrides the inhibitory Notch signaling to initiate OL differentiation.

During the rest of the Early Pleistocene, elliptical pockmarks and elongate contour-current furrows show that the central basin was instead scoured by along-slope currents.

It is now recognized that the Bowen ratio (β) implicit in the PT model is too sensitive to temperature. The model also requires the surface net radiation (Rn) as input even though Rn is not an independent external forcing. The maximum evaporation model (MEM) proposed by Yang and Roderick (2019, https://doi.org/10.1002/qj.3481) is a potential candidate for replacing the PT model. Past studies have evaluated the MEM for land ecosystems and for the global ocean. This study represents the first evaluation of the MEM for inland waterbodies. Results are based on eddy‐covariance observation at a large lake and at a small fishpond. Although there were complex error structures and error compensation patterns among its intermediate variables, the MEM was able to reproduce the observed monthly (R2 > 0.95) and interannual variability (R2 > 0.78) in the lake latent heat flux. A key assumption of the MEM, that the incoming and outgoing longwave radiation is coupled, was a reasonable approximation at both the monthly and the annual time scale for the large lake and at the monthly time scale for the small fishpond. This assumption allows the MEM to treat Rn as an intermediate variable instead of a prescribed forcing. These results support the MEM as an alternative to the PT model at locations where Rn measurements are not available. In situations where Rn data is available, a revised PT model with reduced β temperature sensitivity is recommended."

This study identifies critical features associated with PEPEs during boreal summer in this region, such as both cool land surface and air at 850 hPa, indicating strong land‐atmosphere interactions. Vertical soil water flow (VSWF) significantly affects near‐surface soil hydro‐thermodynamics and can potentially enhance the PEPEs' simulation. However, VSWF is often ignored in land surface models. To improve the simulation of PEPEs, the VSWF term is incorporated into the soil heat transfer equation within the Noah‐MP model coupled with the Weather Research and Forecasting model, improving the simulation of PEPEs. Further analysis reveals that incorporating VSWF strengthens the cold features of PEPEs and improves precipitation simulation. Detailed examination shows that incorporating VSWF induces a secondary circulation anomaly and a positive geopotential height anomaly in Southeast China compared to simulations without VSWF. The southeast flank of the anticyclone anomaly reduces water vapor transport, while the northwest flank enhances it. Additionally, the geopotential height anomaly triggers adjustments in downstream regions of Southeast China, depending on changes in downstream circulation patterns of PEPEs. This research contributes to a better understanding of land‐atmosphere interactions, particularly the effects of VSWF on PEPEs in Southeast China."

 Hydraulic traits mediate trade-offs between growth and mortality in plants yet characterizing these traits at the community level remains challenging, particularly in the Amazon, where they vary widely across species and environments. While previous studies have used reflectance-based estimates, hydraulic traits, which arise from wood and/or whole-plant anatomy and physiology, have not been comprehensively explored.For the first time, we comprehensively investigated the use of leaf reflectance to predict hydraulic traits alongside leaf functional traits in tropical evergreen and deciduous trees. For 196 Amazonian trees, we measured water potential, leaf mass per area (LMA), leaf reflectance, hydraulic conductivity curves (e.g., P50), and wood density (WD). We examined the relationships between leaf reflectance and traits using partial least square regression (PLSR).Our findings indicate that leaf reflectance accurately predicts variation in LMA (R2 = 0.8), and reasonably estimates xylem water potential (R2 = 0.51) and WD (R2 = 0.52). However, P50 predictions were much less reliable (R2 = 0.27), with water absorption bands greatly influencing the PLSR model. Leaf phenological strategy had little impact on the results.These findings suggest that reflectance-based remote sensing could monitor water status and forest carbon dynamics through water potential and wood density, respectively. However, our case study applying the PLSR approach to hyperspectral canopy spectra to predict wood density revealed challenges to upscaling. Despite these limitations, remote sensing of forest hydraulic traits at scale could enhance our understanding of drought vulnerability and carbon dynamics in Amazonian forests, with significant implications for conservation."

 Bamboo forests are natural habitat for the giant panda which is one of the most vulnerable mammal species. In structurally complex natural forests, bamboos are normally located under the canopy of taller trees, which makes them difficult to be quantified accurately. Although Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technologies have been well established as the effective tool for forest structure assessment, the use of LiDAR to assess understory bamboo in structurally complex natural forests is less well known. We present a novel vertical vegetation classification (VVC) approach to map the structure of understory bamboos for giant panda forage in natural forests. An optimized demarcation point identification (DPI) model was developed for stratifying different vertical layers from coarse to fine scales. Three-dimensional understory bamboo point clouds were successfully isolated from the forest point cloud, then bamboo structure predictive models were developed through understory bamboo point cloud metrics and applied over the entire study area to generate spatially continuous maps of understory bamboo structure. Our results indicate that the isolation of the understory bamboo point cloud using the developed VVC approach performs well and has small bias, the extracted maximum height is close to field-measured maximum height (R2 = 0.77, rRMSE = 15.02 %). Height-related metrics have higher correlations with bamboo structure (mean natural and true height, basal diameter, and total aboveground biomass) than other metrics (r > 0.8), and understory bamboo structures are estimated with relatively high accuracy (R2 = 0.84 – 0.91, rRMSE = 10.87 – 29.41 %). We also find varying effects of topography on the spatial distribution of different understory bamboo species.

 The boreal forest surrounds the Arctic region and is the most extensive ecosystem on Earth; one-third of its soil is influenced by permafrost and accompanying wetlands. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) technology has been widely utilized to monitor ground surface deformation in Arctic tundra and alpine grassland permafrost environments; however, its application in boreal forest areas is limited due to dense canopy cover and severe interferometric decorrelation. This study investigates the application of C-band InSAR to ground surface deformation monitoring in a southern boreal forest environment at Genhe River watershed in the northern part of the Greater Khingan Mountains, Northeast China. The analysis revealed that freezing-season interferograms have higher interferometric qualities and are more suitable for deformation monitoring. An InSAR pair correction and stacking algorithm was developed for retrieving extensive freezing-season deformation which could maximize the use of low-quality InSAR pairs, and reduce the effects of the snow depth phase and atmospheric distortions. The retrieved multiannual freezing-season deformation ranged from –32.8 mm to 129.1 mm. The uplift regions clearly indicate the extent of low-lying wetlands, which are influenced by frost heave caused by freezing soil water. Additionally, the “subsidence” areas correspond to farmland and evergreen coniferous forest regions in the study area, where liquid water content is higher than in other land cover types, thus resulting in a longer optical path for the radar signal. This study presents the first systematic analysis of applying C-band InSAR to ground surface deformation monitoring in the southern boreal forest environment.

 In numerical modeling, uncertainties in the initial intensity of tropical cyclones (TCs) can lead to track errors. In this study, we analyzed the impact of initial intensity error on the simulated TC tracks based on 1128 simulations using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model for TCs in the western North Pacific between June and November from 2006 to 2018. Results show that the initial TC intensities were largely underestimated compared to observations. In TC cases with the initial intensity error below −10 m s−1, the simulated track position errors (TPEs) were notably greater than TCs in other cases with smaller absolute initial intensity errors. To quantify the positive impact of the improved initial TC intensity on the track simulations, we conducted additional simulations with the dynamical initialization (DI) scheme to enhance the initial TC intensity. Compared to the simulations without the DI scheme, the simulations with the DI scheme performed better in simulating TC tracks, with a 20.3 % reduction in TPE at 72-h. The improvement was understood based on the potential vorticity tendency diagnostic analysis. Results show that the TC motion in the simulations with the DI scheme was controlled by both horizontal and vertical advections, while that without the DI scheme was dominated by horizontal advection only, especially in the early stage of simulations when the TC intensity was considerably underpredicted. The finding highlights the importance of improving the initial TC intensity to the TC track simulations/predictions."

 Atmospheric electric filed (AEF) measured at the earthʼs surface varies in time and space in an irregular manner, which makes interpreting the results of such measurements a challenging task. Simultaneous measurements of the AEF using several sensors make it possible to study the spatiotemporal structure of AEF variations associated with local sources. In one dimension there is an optimal placement of sensors along a straight line with distances between them that are proportional to the divisions in the Golomb ruler such that, with a fixed number of sensors, there is a maximum possible number of different pairwise distances. An array of 7 electric field mills in a line and one more at a distance greater than the total length of the Golomb ruler was used to obtain simultaneous observational data set and estimate temporal and spatial autocorrelation functions of AEF variations in the range of distances 2.5–400 m and frequency range 10−3–1 Hz. In addition, to quantitatively describe and interpret the obtained dependences, the autocorrelation functions of the electric field created over a conducting plane by extended one-dimensional random Gaussian charge distribution with exponential autocorrelation function are analyzed. It is found that autocorrelation functions of observed and modeled electric field can be approximated by incomplete gamma functions with parameters depending on the height of charges and the correlation radius in charge distribution. The integral scales of AEF variations of local nature are examined depending on the same parameters, and the time integral scale is found to be inversely depends on the density of zeros of standardized time series of the AEF. The autocorrelation function of electric field created by charges, which are located at a distance from the earthʼs surface, much less than correlation radius in charge distribution, is the same as for the charges, and the rate of its decline decreases with increasing height of the system of charges."

 Severe hail activities have significant impacts on our society because they damage property and are dangerous to people and animals. However, we have little knowledge on recent changes in geographic locations of severe hail activity center over Canada. Prior to exploring this, we have carried out Canada hail data consistency and reliability checks using solid trend analyses of three independent methods for time series of hail counts and days, and robust verifications of reported hail data by a recently developed approach of sample generation by replacement. Here, we discover for the first time a statistically significant east shift of Canada severe hail activity and total hail activity using discriminant analysis. The spatial shift is from the western portion of continental Canada during 2005–2013 to the eastern Canada with a maritime environment during 2014–2022. With increase of hail severity, the hail activities increase from the colder period 2005–2013 to the warmer period 2014–2022. Our composite analyses show that over the continental Canada, the hail activities are enriched through thermodynamically driven convective instability and precipitable water associated with the warming climate, as well as dynamically driven processes such as vertical wind shear and vertically integrated water vapor flux convergence. Over the maritime Canada with the colder condition, the hail activities are enhanced by dynamically driven moisture advection and convergence as well as vertical wind shear, thermodynamically driven process of precipitable water, and partially due to convective instability. This research promotes our understanding of climate change impact on hail activities, shedding lights on long-term hail projection, adaptation, and mitigation strategies."

Historical climate data from 1985 to 2014, sourced from the Climatic Research Unit Time‐Series, Version 3.22 (CRU TS 3.22), was analyzed to comprehend past climate patterns and establish a baseline for future comparisons. Predictions for future climate conditions (2015–2044) were derived by adjusting the CRU data using temperature projections from the Community Climate System Model 4 under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 scenario. To assess the potential impacts of these climate changes, particularly during the boreal summer season of July‐August‐September (JAS), the study utilized the Hydrology, Entomology, and Malaria Transmission Simulator (HYDREMATS). Findings indicate that surface temperature can intricately influence disease transmission, with varied effects on parameters such as Ro, EIR, prevalence, and immunity index. Observations revealed fluctuations in temperature anomalies over the years, with negative anomalies in 1991–1995 and positive anomalies in subsequent years. Although precise predictions for 2016–2044 are challenging based solely on data trends from 1985 to 2015, continued temperature rises could potentially lead to increased disease prevalence and decreased immunity index. Moreover, the analysis identified a notable temporal increase in mean annual temperature and mean annual maximum temperature from 1999 to 2020, suggesting a faster warming trend in maximum temperatures compared to minimum temperatures. This increase in temperature variability may alter the onset and cessation dates of the rainy season, affecting water availability, accessibility, and consumption, consequently fostering conditions conducive to health‐related diseases. By incorporating predicted long‐term temperature changes due to greenhouse gas emissions while maintaining current inter‐annual climate patterns, this approach allows researchers to anticipate potential future health implications in the studied regions."

 Due to the significant disparities in feature spaces of multi-source images, change detection (CD) of heterogeneous remote sensing images (HRSIs) remains a highly challenging problem. Currently, CD methods based on domain transfer networks (DTNs) have garnered significant attention. However, the computer scientists underutilize knowledge in the field of CD during DTNs design, and the existing CD methods do not fully utilize the heterogeneous complementary features contained in HRSIs. Therefore, this study proposes a novel CD method based on multiple pseudo-homogeneous image pairs. First, a cycle-consistent generative adversarial network with knowledge constraints (named as KCGAN) was designed for obtaining good pseudo-homogeneous images. In detail, both the domain knowledge that there are land cover changes in multi-temporal images and that the objects in an image can be described from different scales were well integrated into the design of KCGAN. Then, a multi-modal difference Siamese fusion network (named as MDSiamF) was proposed to extract change information from the multiple pseudo-homogeneous image pairs generated with KCGAN. Experiments conducted on three datasets showed that: 1) compared to existing domain transfer methods, the unchanged areas in the pseudo-homogeneous images obtained by KCGAN exhibit better feature consistency (with a peak signal-to-noise ratio higher than 20.85 and a PHash value higher than 0.9); 2) compared to state-of-the-art methods for CD of HRSIs, the proposed method shows stable and good CD performance (with an overall accuracy higher than 0.98 and a F1 Score higher than 0.78)."

Our study begins with the reconstruction of missing data and then develops a spatiotemporal fusion model to generate global daily seamless 9-km L-VOD products from 2010 to 2021, which are crucial for understanding the global carbon cycle. The dataset is freely accessible for use in environmental monitoring. 
 Vegetation optical depth (VOD) products provide information on vegetation water content and correlate with vegetation growth status, which are closely related to the global water and carbon cycles. The L-band signal penetrates deeper into the vegetation canopy than the higher frequency bands used for many previous VOD retrievals. Currently, there are only two operational L-band sensors aboard satellites, namely the SMOS satellite launched in 2010 and the SMAP satellite launched in 2015. The former has the limitation of a low spatial resolution of only 25 km, while the latter has improved the resolution to 9 km but has a shorter usable time range. Due to the influence of sensor and atmospheric conditions, as well as the observation methods of polar-orbiting satellites (such as scan gaps and observation revisit times), the daily data provided by both satellites suffer from varying degrees of missing data. In summary, the existing L-VOD products suffer from the defects of missing data and coarse resolution of historical data. There is few research on filling gaps and reconstructing 9-km long-term data for L-VOD products. To solve this problem, our study depends on a penalized least square regression based on three-dimensional discrete cosine transform to firstly generate the seamless global daily L-VOD products. Subsequently, the non-local filtering idea is applied to spatiotemporal fusion between high- and low-resolution data, resulting in a global daily seamless 9-km L-VOD product from 1 January 2010 to 31 July 2021. In order to validate the quality of the products, time series validation and simulated missing regions validation are used for the reconstructed data. The fusion products are validated both temporally and spatially, and also compared numerically with the original 9-km data during the overlapping period. Results show that the seamless SMOS (SMAP) dataset is evaluated with a coefficient of determination R2 of 0.855 (0.947), and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 0.094 (0.073) for the simulated real missing masks. The temporal consistency of the reconstructed daily L-VOD products is ensured with the original time-series distribution of valid values. The spatial information of the fusion product and the original 9-km data in the overlapping period is basically consistent (R2: 0.926–0.958, RMSE: 0.072–0.093, MAE: 0.047–0.064). The temporal variations between the fusion product and the original product are largely synchronized.

We conducted a new set of experiments using a transparent true triaxial cell, which enabled video recording of the temporal evolution of fluid‐driven fracture paths. Using pseudo‐2D samples without macroscale structural discontinuities, we observed multiple occurrences of hydraulic fracture curving and branching under anisotropic boundary stresses. We proposed a theoretical model demonstrating that the stress parallel to the crack line in the solid matrix near the crack tip (i.e., the T‐stress) accounts for the observed fracture curving behavior.

Here we combine a prototype pressure vessel apparatus and Raman spectroscopy to determine sulfur speciation in arc magmatic fluid analogues in situ over a range of geologically relevant pressure–temperature–redox conditions. We find that HS−, H2S and SO2 are the main sulfur species in the experimental fluids, while the concentrations of S6+ species and S2− and S3− sulfur radical ions are negligible, in contrast to previous experimental work. The measured gold solubilities in the experimental fluids are highest when sulfur is dominantly present as HS− and H2S species and greatly exceed thermodynamic predictions. Our results imply that HS−, rather than sulfur radicals, accounts for the high solubilities of gold in magmatic–hydrothermal fluids. We also find that magmatic sulfur degassing is a redox process under oxidizing conditions and may lead to additional magma oxidation beyond that imparted by slab-derived fluxes and crystallization. There are three dominant sulfur species present in arc magmatic fluids: HS−, H2S and SO2. HS− controls the mobilization and transport of gold in arc magmatic–hydrothermal systems, according to in situ experiments on arc magmatic fluid analogues."

 Saturn’s rings have been estimated to be as young as about 100 to 400 million years old according to the hypothesis that non-icy micrometeoroid bombardment acts to darken the rings over time and the Cassini observation indicated that the ring particles appear to be relatively clean. These young age estimates assume that the rings formed out of pure water ice particles with a high accretion efficiency of impacting non-icy micrometeoroid material (η ≳ 10%). Here we show, using numerical simulations of hypervelocity micrometeoroid impacts on a ring particle, that non-icy material may not be as readily accreted as previously thought. We found that the complete vaporization and expansion of non-icy impactor material on energetic collision with a ring particle leads to the formation of charged nanoparticles and ions that are subsequently removed from the rings through collision with Saturn, gravitational escape or electromagnetic drag into Saturn’s atmosphere. Despite uncertainties in our models that assume no porosity, strength or ring particle granularity, we suggest minimal accretion of non-icy materials would occur following micrometeoroid impact. This pollution resistance mechanism implies a low accretion efficiency (η ≲ 1%). Thus we suggest that the apparent youth of Saturn’s rings could be due to pollution resistance, rather than indicative of young formation age. Simulations of micrometeoroid impacts into Saturn’s icy ring particles find limited pollution of the particles by non-icy material, suggesting Saturn’s rings may appear younger than their actual age."

 Histological slides contain numerous artifacts that can significantly deteriorate the performance of image analysis algorithms.

GrandQC allows for high-precision tissue segmentation (Dice score 0.957) and segmentation of tissue without artifacts (Dice score 0.919–0.938 dependent on magnification).

GrandQC improves the performance of downstream image analysis algorithms. We open-source the GrandQC tool, our large manually annotated test dataset, and all QC masks for the entire TCGA cohort to address the problem of QC in digital/computational pathology.

Here the authors show that prior SA exposure induces non-protective CD4+ T cells, which impair IsdB vaccine protection by IL-10 secretion and IL-17A suppression, whereas IL-17A promoting adjuvant CAF01 overcomes this dilemma. 
 Pathobionts have evolved many strategies to coexist with the host, but how immune evasion mechanisms contribute to the difficulty of developing vaccines against pathobionts is unclear. Meanwhile, Staphylococcus aureus (SA) has resisted human vaccine development to date. Here we show that prior SA exposure induces non-protective CD4+ T cell imprints, leading to the blunting of protective IsdB vaccine responses. Mechanistically, these SA-experienced CD4+ T cells express IL-10, which is further amplified by vaccination and impedes vaccine protection by binding with IL-10Rα on CD4+ T cell and inhibit IL-17A production. IL-10 also mediates cross-suppression of IsdB and sdrE multi-antigen vaccine. By contrast, the inefficiency of SA IsdB, IsdA and MntC vaccines can be overcome by co-treatment with adjuvants that promote IL-17A and IFN-γ responses. We thus propose that IL-10 secreting, SA-experienced CD4+ T cell imprints represent a staphylococcal immune escaping mechanism that needs to be taken into consideration for future vaccine development.

 Plant endogenous signaling peptides shape growth, development and adaptations to biotic and abiotic stress. Here, we identify C-TERMINALLY ENCODED PEPTIDEs (CEPs) as immune-modulatory phytocytokines in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our data reveals that CEPs induce immune outputs and are required to mount resistance against the leaf-infecting bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato. We show that effective immunity requires CEP perception by tissue-specific CEP RECEPTOR 1 (CEPR1) and CEPR2. Moreover, we identify the related RECEPTOR-LIKE KINASE 7 (RLK7) as a CEP4-specific CEP receptor contributing to CEP-mediated immunity, suggesting a complex interplay of multiple CEP ligands and receptors in different tissues during biotic stress. CEPs have a known role in the regulation of root growth and systemic nitrogen (N)-demand signaling. We provide evidence that CEPs and their receptors promote immunity in an N status-dependent manner, suggesting a previously unknown molecular crosstalk between plant nutrition and cell surface immunity. We propose that CEPs and their receptors are central regulators for the adaptation of biotic stress responses to plant-available resources.

Here, authors used viral-genetic tools to identify the enzyme ABHD6 in postsynaptic mesoaccumbal neurons is a key determinant of body weight and reward-relevant behaviour. 
 α/β-hydrolase domain 6 (ABHD6) is a lipase linked to physiological functions affecting energy metabolism. Brain ABHD6 degrades 2-arachidonoylglycerol and thereby modifies cannabinoid receptor signalling. However, its functional role within mesoaccumbens circuitry critical for motivated behaviour and considerably modulated by endocannabinoids was unknown. Using three viral approaches, we show that control of the nucleus accumbens by neuronal ABHD6 is a key determinant of body weight and reward-directed behaviour in male mice. Contrary to expected outcomes associated with increasing endocannabinoid tone, loss of ABHD6 in nucleus accumbens, but not ventral tegmental area, neurons completely prevents diet-induced obesity, reduces food- and drug-seeking and enhances physical activity without affecting anxiodepressive behaviour. These effects are explained by attenuated inhibitory synaptic transmission onto medium spiny neurons. ABHD6 deletion in nucleus accumbens neurons and dopamine ventral tegmental area neurons produces contrasting effects on effortful responding for food. Intraventricular infusions of an ABHD6 inhibitor also restrain appetite and promote weight loss. Together, these results reveal functional specificity of pre- and post-synaptic mesoaccumbens neuronal ABHD6 to differentially control energy balance and propose ABHD6 inhibition as a potential anti-obesity tool.

 Gilles de la Tourette Syndrome (GTS) is a chronic tic disorder, characterized by unwanted motor actions and vocalizations. While brain stimulation techniques show promise in reducing tic severity, optimal target networks are not well-defined. Here, we leverage datasets from two independent deep brain stimulation (DBS) cohorts and a cohort of tic-inducing lesions to infer critical networks for treatment and occurrence of tics by mapping stimulation sites and lesions to a functional connectome derived from 1,000 healthy participants. We find that greater tic reduction is linked to higher connectivity of DBS sites (N = 37) with action-related functional resting-state networks, i.e., the cingulo-opercular (r = 0.62; p < 0.001) and somato-cognitive action networks (r = 0.47; p = 0.002). Regions of the cingulo-opercular network best match the optimal connectivity profiles of thalamic DBS. We replicate the significance of targeting cingulo-opercular and somato-cognitive action network connectivity in an independent DBS cohort (N = 10). Finally, we demonstrate that tic-inducing brain lesions (N = 22) exhibit similar connectivity to these networks. Collectively, these results suggest a critical role for these action-related networks in the pathophysiology and treatment of GTS.

 The environmental use of azole fungicides has led to selective sweeps across multiple loci in the Aspergillus fumigatus genome causing the rapid global expansion of a genetically distinct cluster of resistant genotypes. Isolates within this cluster are also more likely to be resistant to agricultural antifungals with unrelated modes of action. Here we show that this cluster is not only multi-azole resistant but has increased propensity to develop resistance to next generation antifungals because of variants in the DNA mismatch repair system. A variant in msh6-G233A is found almost exclusively within azole resistant isolates harbouring the canonical cyp51A azole resistance allelic variant TR34/L98H. Naturally occurring isolates with this msh6 variant display up to 5-times higher rate of mutation, leading to an increased likelihood of evolving resistance to other antifungals. Furthermore, unlike hypermutator strains, the G233A variant conveys no measurable fitness cost and has become globally distributed. Our findings further suggest that resistance to next-generation antifungals is more likely to emerge within organisms that are already multi-azole resistant due to close linkage between TR34/L98H and msh6-G233A, posing a major problem due to the prospect of dual use of novel antifungals in clinical and agricultural settings.

 As energy systems transform to rely on renewable energy and electrification to mitigate climate change, they encounter stronger year-to-year variability in energy supply and demand. Yet, most infrastructure planning relies on a single weather year, risking a potential lack of robustness. In this paper, we optimize capacity layouts for a European energy system under net-zero CO2 emissions for 62 different weather years. Subsequently, we fix the layouts and optimize their operation in every other weather year to assess resource adequacy and CO2 emissions. Our analysis shows a variation of  ± 10% in total system costs across weather years. Layouts designed for years with compound weather events prove more robust, achieving resource adequacy of 99.9% and net-negative CO2 emissions of −0.5% per year relative to 1990 levels. CO2-emitting backup generation regulated by a CO2 tax offers a cost-effective measure to enhance robustness. It increases emissions only marginally, keeping average emissions below 1% of 1990 levels over all layouts.

 Although graphene and graphene-related two-dimensional materials (GR2Ms) hold much potential for various applications, the current methods for their large-scale production rely heavily on graphite minerals and energy-intensive techniques. Here we report a one-step dehydration–condensation method for the economical and green preparation of GR2Ms on a gram scale from biomass at room temperature under atmospheric pressure using only concentrated sulfuric acid. This protocol has been applied successfully to various types of biomass and carbohydrates, delivering a 33% mass yield of GR2M product. The properties of the product are consistent with those of classical reduced graphene oxide (RGO), with the twist that it does not need to be produced from graphite minerals. The mild reaction conditions substantially reduce the energy input, while providing a facile platform for monitoring the kinetics of RGO nucleation and growth. Compared with conventional methods, a 98% reduction in energy consumption is achieved. Overall, the results of this research pave a new avenue to scalable and sustainable GR2M production.

 One mechanism by which the ocean uptakes carbon dioxide is through the biological carbon fixation and its subsequent transport to the deep ocean, a process known as the biological carbon pump. Although the importance of the biological pump in the global carbon cycle has long been recognized, its actual contribution remains uncertain. Here, we quantify the carbon export from the upper ocean via the biological carbon pump by revealing the upper ocean dissolved oxygen balance. Calculations of dissolved oxygen budget quantified net oxygen removals from the upper ocean by physical processes (air–sea exchange, advection, and diffusion) and indicated net biological oxygen production that compensated for those removals. The derived oxygen production is converted to carbon units using the photosynthetic ratio, and inferred an estimated global annual carbon export through the biological pump of 7.36 ± 2.12 Pg C year−1 with providing insights into the overall ocean carbon cycle.

 Timely and reliable rapeseed mapping is crucial for vegetable oil supply and bioenergy industry. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) remote sensing is able to track rapeseed phenology and map rapeseed fields in cloudy regions. However, SAR-based rapeseed mapping is challenging in mountainous areas due to the highly fragmented farming land and terrain-induced distortions on SAR signals. To address this challenge, this study proposed a novel SAR-based automatic rapeseed mapping (SARM) method for all terrain and weather conditions. SARM first composites high-quality dual-aspect Sentinel-1 time series by combining ascending and descending orbits and smoothing temporal noises. Second, SARM embeds a novel terrain-adjustment modeling to mitigate confounding terrain effects on the SAR intensity of sloped pixels. Third, SARM quantifies unique shape and intensity features of SAR signals during the leaf-flower-pod period to estimate the probability of rapeseed cultivation with the aid of automatically extracted local high-confidence rapeseed pixels. SARM was tested at three sites with varying topographic conditions, rapeseed phenology and cultivation systems. Results demonstrate that SARM achieved accurate rapeseed mapping with the overall accuracy 0.9 or higher, and F1 score 0.85 or higher at all three sites. Compared with the existing rapeseed mapping methods, SARM excelled in mapping fragmented rapeseed fields in both flat and sloped terrains. SARM utilizes unique and universal SAR time-series features of rapeseed growth without relying on any prior knowledge or pre-collected training samples, making it flexible and robust for cross-regional rapeseed mapping, especially for cloudy and mountainous regions where optical data is often contaminated by clouds during rapeseed growing stages."

 Northwest Pacific, where the Kuroshio and Oyashio currents intersect, is the most active region of the mid-latitude air-sea interaction. Two dominant patterns of winter cold extremes were determined, i.e., a monopole pattern and a southwest–northeast dipole pattern. Autumn-mean sea surface temperature in northwest Pacific (SSTNWP) significantly impacts the first EOF pattern of the winter cold extremes in China. This research demonstrates that subseasonal SSTNWP reversal—characterized by opposite SSTNWP anomalies between early and late autumn—also affects cold extremes, but mainly on the second EOF pattern. Both observations and numerical experiments demonstrate that the subseasonal SSTNWP reversal in autumn induce an anomalous Eurasian-like pattern in winter. Specifically, early autumn warming followed by late autumn cooling of SSTNWP enhances the northeast China cold vortex, one of the centers of the Eurasian-like pattern, and thus intensified cold advection into northeast China. Concurrently, low-latitude anticyclonic anomalies block the intrusion of northern cold air and induce adiabatic warming in the Sichuan Basin through sinking motion. The second strongest subseasonal SSTNWP reversal resulted in the strongest cold northeast and warm southwest in China in 2001. This study comprehensively illustrated how the mid-latitude SSTNWP regulate the dominant patterns of cold extremes and potentially contributed to better predict extreme climate in China."

They are widespread in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), where over 80% of workers are informally employed, and approximately 70% of the population lack access to improved drinking water. Amidst lags in progress towards SDG 6.1 of universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water, there has been growing interest in the role of these vendors and how co-production between formal and informal water supply actors might improve outcomes for different types of consumers. However, we know little about the coordination mechanisms in place and how they operate in practice. We conduct a scoping review of empirical research over the last 20 years to develop insights regarding the different types of co-production that may increase water access. We reviewed published sources to develop a better understanding of the water sources and delivery methods of informal water vendors, and the mechanisms of coordination between formal and informal sectors. To supplement the findings, we develop illustrative examples of the evolution and dynamics of different coordination mechanisms. The article shows how formal (often public utilities) and informal (often private and small scale) water providers are co-producing service delivery in SSA, with insights regarding the different coordination mechanisms that might help or hinder efforts to increase water access. We find that enforcement capacity is crucial for effective coordination, which creates a dilemma: many regions most dependent on informal water providers are least capable of monitoring, let alone enforcing rules. Consumers can benefit from coordination mechanisms that require less effort, such as quality testing, technical assistance, and preferential rates for bulk resale. By specifying how the formal and informal sectors are linked, further studies on co-produced water systems can contribute to evidence regarding what coordinated service delivery options might offer short- and medium-term solutions."

However, due to the heterogeneity of city landscapes, urban vegetation experiences a diverse range of environmental conditions, potentially leading to differences in growing season timing and length within cities. Here, we investigate physical drivers of urban land surface phenology and timing within a semi-arid city (Denver, CO, USA) using four years (2018–2021) of remotely sensed vegetation indices, modelled air temperature, and land cover datasets. Within the metropolitan region study area, satellite-based vegetation index measurements indicate that growing season length is variable on sub-neighborhood spatial scales. This variability is largely due to differences in the timing of fall senescence, as opposed to early season growth. Areas with substantial fractions of irrigated land cover tend to remain greener for longer, while unirrigated and cooler areas are correlated with an earlier end to the growing season (up to ∼two months shorter). These findings complement those from non-arid cities where surface and air temperature are the dominant environmental control on phenological timing. Results here indicate the importance of soil moisture for phenology in semi-arid regions and suggest unique semi-arid urban growing season dynamics and temperature-vegetation feedbacks. These interactions have implications for water, heat, and vegetation management strategies to maximize ecosystem services in water-limited environments."

Amid rising global water demands and climate change impacts, understanding baseflow dynamics is crucial for water resource management. This study offers new insights by assessing baseflow controls at finer temporal scales and examining their relationship with hydrological drought flows. We investigate how climatic factors influence seasonal baseflow in 7138 global catchments across five major climate regions. Our analysis identifies precipitation as the primary driver, affecting 58.3% of catchments, though its impact varies significantly across different climates. In temperate regions, precipitation dominates (61.9% of catchments), while in tropical regions, evaporative demand is the leading factor (47.3%). Snow fraction is particularly crucial in both snow-dominated (20.8%) and polar regions (48.5%). Negative baseflow trends generally emerge where the effects of evaporative demand or snow fraction outweigh those of precipitation. Specifically, in northern regions and the Rocky Mountains, where snow fraction predominantly controls baseflow changes, a negative trend is evident. Similarly, in tropical catchments, where evaporative demand drives baseflow changes, this also leads to a negative trend. Additionally, our findings indicate that baseflow changes are closely linked to hydrologic drought severity, with concurrent trends observed in 69% of catchments. These findings highlight the relationship between baseflow changes, the severity of hydrologic drought and shifts in precipitation, evaporative demand, and snow dynamics.

However, in this study, it was found that, within the region of 60°–70°N and 110°–150° E, the interannual relationship between summer normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and summer warmth index (SWI) changes from being statistically positive in P1 (1982–2010) to statistically negative in P2 (2011–2021). Also, the interannual relationship between summer NDVI and summer soil moisture changes from being negative in P1 to positive in P2. The reason and possible mechanisms were investigated. On the one hand, the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD) has increased significantly in P2 corresponding to the increasing SWI, and the interannual relationship between the VPD and NDVI transforms into a significantly negative one. This is because, when the atmospheric VPD increases, leaf and canopy photosynthetic rates decline owing to stomatal closure, to protect vegetation from losing too much water. Therefore, the interannual relationship between the NDVI and VPD, and in turn the SWI, transforms into a significantly negative one in P2. On the other hand, it was found that the surface evapotranspiration is energy-limited in P1, but then with the decreasing soil moisture content it becomes soil-moisture-limited in P2. As one of the most important components of surface evapotranspiration, vegetation evapotranspiration is also limited by soil moisture. Therefore, the interannual relationship between soil moisture and NDVI becomes significantly positive in P2."

An integrative review of water entitlements and entitlement failures,"An increasing number of studies find that water sharing—the non-market transfer of privately held water between households—is a ubiquitous informal practice around the world and a primary way that households respond to water insecurity. Yet, a key question about household water sharing remains: is water sharing a viable path that can help advance household water security? Or should water sharing be understood as a symptom of water insecurity in wait for more formalized solutions? Here, we address this question by applying Sen’s entitlement framework in an integrative review of empirical scholarship on household water sharing. Our review shows that when interhousehold water sharing is governed by established and well-functioning norms it can serve as a reliable transfer entitlement that bolsters household water security. However, when water sharing occurs outside of established norms (triggered by broader entitlement failures) it is often associated with significant emotional distress that may exacerbate conditions of water insecurity. These findings suggest that stable, norm-based water sharing arrangements may offer a viable, adaptive solution to households facing water insecurity. Nevertheless, more scholarship is needed to better understand when and how norm-based water transfer entitlements fail, the capacity of water sharing practices to evolve into lasting normative entitlements, and the impact of interhousehold water sharing on intrahousehold water security."

However, in the North China Plain (NCP)—a key food hub in China—the disconnect between livestock farms and croplands limits manure recycling, obscuring its potential environmental benefits and economic costs. This study employs a life cycle assessment method to quantify GHG and ammonia emissions, SOC sequestration, economic performance, and the eco-efficiency of wheat–maize production in the NCP across six livestock–cropland coupling scenarios: farmers’ practice (FP), traditional household farming (HF), modern intensive decoupled systems with low (L), medium (M), and high (H) manure returning rates, and an intensive coupled system with optimum manure returning rate (IC). The results show that increasing manure return rates in intensive systems decreases the net global warming potential (NGWP), emphasizing the importance of livestock–cropland re-coupling. Emissions embodied in the field input supply chain was identified as a major NGWP contributor, while SOC accumulation significantly contributed to net GHG mitigation. The IC scenario is both the most economically viable ($322.8 (t grain)−1) and eco-efficient (1.03 kg CO2-eq USD−1) system. With the same compost application rates, intensive farming reduced the NGWP by 26.1% compared to household farming, despite trade-offs between GHG and NH3 emissions. The FP scenario had the highest climate impact (722.8 kg CO2-eq (t grain)−1) and the lowest eco-efficiency (4.91 kg CO2-eq USD−1).

The extent to which these albedo changes may affect surface energy balances and thus soil temperatures is uncertain, but represents a potentially important component of ecosystem feedbacks to climate change. Here, we apply a well-tested process-rich ecosystem model, ecosys, to examine changes in seasonal surface albedo and soil temperature driven by climate-induced snowpack and vegetation changes across Alaska under a warmer twenty-first century climate. Under the Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5 climate change scenario, the modeled changes in surface albedo exhibited large seasonal and spatial variations. We found spring albedo decreases driven by increases in snow-free periods (>20 d) and an extended growing season length that resulted in greater gains in leaf area index (LAI) in most parts of Alaska. In contrast, we modeled increases in summer and winter albedo (despite modeled increases in LAI) across much of the boreal forest due to an increased proportion of aspen, which has a higher leaf albedo than the currently dominant black spruce. Modeled latent heat fluxes generally increase across the twenty-first century, particularly during the spring and summer. Overall, climate warming and changes in surface energy fluxes resulted in a 3.5 ± 0.50 °C increase in spatial- and annual-averaged top 10 cm surface soil temperatures across Alaskan ecosystems by the year 2100, with larger increases in tundra than boreal forest regions. We conclude that under warmer climates, seasonal variations in albedo and surface energy fluxes are particularly pronounced during the spring and summer, driven by changes in snowpack and vegetation dynamics."

Our models extend previous approaches by directly accounting for producer adaptation and feedback effects in the coupled natural and human system. This analysis reveals that continuing the current path of depletion will decrease corn and wheat production in the region by 6.75% and 1.08% in 2050, with the impacts primarily arriving via reductions in irrigated acreage. We provide evidence of substantial spatial heterogeneity of these impacts, which is notable for a region that employs largely homogeneous technology and management practices throughout.

Historical records of demand typically cover 1–2 decades which may be too short to capture the range of possible demand, particularly for a climate with high interannual variability such as that of Australia. Predicting demand using long records of weather data opens the possibility of more robustly estimating true demand variability. We estimate daily energy demand between 2010 and 2019 for Australian states in the National Electricity Market using machine learning with reanalysis weather variables as predictors. We assess the performance of these models and examine their behaviour to identify which weather variables are most important for predicting demand. We then use the models to estimate demand for the period 1959–2022. We use this 64-year record to quantify how the probability of high demand days can change compared to individual 10-year periods and when conditioned by the phase of the El Ni o Southern Oscillation (ENSO). Energy demand can be accurately predicted with weather, with median errors of 2%–4% on years omitted from the training. We show that the probability of extreme demand over different 10-year periods can vary from half to twice as likely, depending on the decade. When further conditioned on ENSO phase, the probabilities can be up to 7 times higher than when using the 64-year period, implying a risk of overestimating weather-related energy demand if shorter records are used. We conclude that machine learning methods can accurately predict energy demand using only weather data, enabling us to estimate demand variability over longer time horizons than is possible with demand observations. These longer records are important when attempting to quantify tail risks of demand, and so can help to inform the design of energy systems."

However, renewable energy production is heavily dependent on the prevailing weather conditions, which are changing as a result of climate change. It is therefore necessary to build energy systems that are robust to energy shortages caused by weather-dependent changes to energy demand and renewable energy production. To design such systems, we must monitor how changes in the climate are expected to influence future energy production and demand; this is important for policymakers to decide when, where, and by how much renewable energy installed capacities should be increased, for example. In this paper, we study the behaviour of standardised energy indices in future European climate projections, and use this to monitor how characteristics of energy production droughts in Europe are expected to change in the future. We use these results to make suggestions regarding how the energy mix should be adapted in the future to decrease the risk of energy production droughts."

While many studies have focused on heat and cold extremes, which are typically stressful throughout the daytime hours, fewer have examined part-daytime thermal stress conditions, where hours of thermal comfort and discomfort both occur during the daytime. Using a recently developed dataset of the Universal Thermal Climate Index with high spatial (10 km) and temporal (hourly) resolution, we classify daytime outdoor thermal conditions of any day into the following types: full-daytime comfortable, full-daytime stressful (subdivided into ‘full-daytime cold’ and ‘full-daytime hot’), and part-daytime stressful (including ‘part-daytime cold,’ ‘part-daytime cool,’ ‘part-daytime warm,’ ‘part-daytime hot,’ and ‘wide thermal fluctuation’). We then analyze their trends and the balance between changes in heat and cold stress over the past three decades in mid- and low-latitude Asia. Here, we demonstrate that overall daytime outdoor thermal conditions have deteriorated in both low- and mid-latitude Asia. A key feature of the changes in low-latitude regions is the substantial increase in the number of full-daytime hot days and a pronounced escalation in heat stress intensity, which may make outdoor activities during the day increasingly uncomfortable and possibly unsafe. In contrast, notable aspects of the shifts in daytime thermal conditions in mid-latitude regions include a decrease in full-daytime comfortable days (conditions ideal for longer activities such as hiking and camping), and a significant rise in part-daytime hot days, which may lead people to favour shorter activities (e.g., morning walks or neighborhood biking)."

Previous studies have shown a correlation between underprivileged communities and significant impacts due to water related disasters, such as flooding or water related illnesses. As a result, for several decades the international development community has invested in WASH-related infrastructure. Lessons learned through these investments has shown the need for WASH educational outreach to build community awareness and encourage behavioral change, ultimately ensuring the sustainability and impact of the WASH infrastructure. Many WASH infrastructure programs have incorporated WASH education programs, particularly those led by the community. Often this occurs through primary and secondary schools. While WASH STEM education promotes local project ownership, leading to an increased understanding of water management and infrastructure resiliency, these educational programs are not always successful. There is a knowledge gap in understanding what makes WASH STEM education and outreach effective. This research project investigated some of the parameters influencing students’ performance on an assessment of WASH STEM curricula. This was done through deploying two water resource learning modules and assessments to secondary school students in Cambodia, India, Nicaragua, and the United States. The results revealed a correlation between how well the students comprehended the information according to the assessment and how relevant the students found the material to their own lives.

The dataset, with details on distribution and characteristics, aids in understanding permafrost distribution, mountain hydrology, and climate impacts in High Mountain Asia, filling a knowledge gap. 
 Rock glaciers – periglacial landforms commonly found in high-mountain systems – are of significant scientific value for inferring the presence of permafrost, understanding mountain hydrology, and assessing climate impacts on high-mountain environments. However, inventories remain patchy in many alpine regions, and as a result they are poorly understood for some areas of High Mountain Asia such as the Tibetan Plateau. To address this gap, we compiled a comprehensive inventory of rock glaciers for the Tibetan Plateau, i.e., TPRoGI (v1.0), developed using an innovative deep learning method. This inventory consists of a total of 44 273 rock glaciers, covering approximately 6000 km2, with a mean area of 0.14 km2. They are predominantly situated at elevations ranging from 4000 to 5500 m a.s.l., with a mean of 4729 m a.s.l. They tend to occur on slopes with gradients between 10 and 25°, with a mean of 17.7°. Across the plateau, rock glaciers are widespread in the northwestern and southeastern areas, with dense concentrations in the Western Pamir and Nyainqêntanglha, while they are sparsely distributed in the inner part. Our inventory serves as a benchmark dataset, which will be further maintained and updated in the future.

 Evapotranspiration (ET) serves as a key indicator of the water change between the Earth’s surface and atmosphere, significantly influencing the hydrology cycle, surface energy cycle, and carbon cycle. Existing remote sensing models for estimating ET usually necessitate the parameterization of resistance parameters. In this study, we proposed the Remote Sensed Non-Parametric (RSNP) model, which leverages the nonparametric (NP) and Surface Flux Equilibrium-nonparametric (SFE-NP) approaches, and adapted remote sensing and reanalysis datasets of meteorological and surface parameters as model inputs. We estimate global monthly ET from 2001 to 2019 in the spatial resolution of 0.1° with RSNP model. Validation against FLUXNET sites globally yield RMSE of 23 mm/month (278 mm/yr), while regional-scale validation against water-balance ET results in a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 113 mm/yr.

Kaplan,"Modelling framework for asynchronous land-atmosphere coupling using NASA GISS ModelE and LPJ-LMfire: Design, Application and Evaluation for the 2.5ka period","This study presents and demonstrates an experimental framework for asynchronous land-atmosphere coupling using the NASA GISS ModelE and LPJ-LMfire models for the 2.5ka period. This framework addresses the limitation of NASA ModelE, which does not have a fully dynamic vegetation model component. It also shows the role of model performance metrics, such as model bias and variability, and the simulated climate is evaluated against the multi-proxy paleoclimate reconstructions for the 2.5ka climate. 
 While paleoclimate simulations have been a priority for Earth system modelers over the past three decades, little attention has been paid to the period between the mid-Holocene and the Last Millennium, although this is an important period for the emergence of complex societies. Here, we consider the climate of 2500 BP (550 BCE), a period when compared to late preindustrial time, greenhouse gas concentrations were slightly lower, and orbital forcing led to a stronger seasonal cycle in high latitude insolation. To capture the influence of land cover on climate, we asynchronously coupled the NASA GISS ModelE Earth system model with the LPJ-LMfire dynamic global vegetation model. We simulated global climate and assessed our results in the context of independent paleoclimate reconstructions. We also explored a set of combinations of model performance parameters (bias and variability) and demonstrated their importance for the asynchronous coupling framework. The coupled model system shows substantial vegetation albedo feedback to climate. In the absence of a bias correction, while driving LPJ-LMfire in the coupling process, ModelE drifts towards colder conditions in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere in response to land cover simulated by LPJ-LMfire. A regional precipitation response is also prominent in the various combinations of the coupled model system, with a substantial intensification of the Summer Indian Monsoon and a drying pattern over Europe. Evaluation of the simulated climate against reconstructions of temperature from multiple proxies and the isotopic composition of precipitation (δ18Op) from speleothems demonstrated the skill of ModelE in simulating past climate. A regional analysis of the simulated vegetation-climate response further confirmed the validity of this approach. The coupled model system is sensitive to the representation of shrubs and this land cover type requires particular attention as a potentially important driver of climate in regions where shrubs are abundant. Our results further demonstrate the importance of bias correction in coupled paleoclimate simulations."

However, the specific solar excitation wavelengths that drive photodissolution remain unknown, limiting our ability to model and predict photodissolution rates in natural aquatic environments.

We irradiated plastic films using custom-built light-emitting diode (LED) photoreactors that emit light in the range of 275 to 445 nm and found that plastics exhibit a strong wavelength sensitivity, producing the highest DOC release rates for short wavelength ultraviolet (UV) light. We additionally calculated photodissolution quantum yield trends for transparent plastic films and then calculated photodissolution activation spectra.

Tang,A Novel Shear-Detachment Approach for Modeling Dynamics of Membrane Cleaning,"We report a novel shear-detachment (SD) approach to simulate the dynamics of flux recovery in the membrane cleaning process. In this model, the rate of foulant detachment away from the membrane is governed by both the shear intensity and the probability of successful foulant detachment, with the latter modeled by Boltzmann distribution. Our SD predictions exhibit good agreement with experimental results, accurately capturing the dynamics of flux recovery. Modeling outcomes reveal that the time required for fully restoring water flux is largely independent of the initial cake mass but significantly dependent on crossflow-flushing velocity and adhesive energy of foulant to membrane. Higher flushing velocity and/or lower adhesive energy can create a shear-limited condition where almost all shear events bring about successful foulant detachment, facilitating rapid flux recovery. Conversely, a smaller flushing velocity or greater adhesive energy can result in increasingly detachment-limited situations, where the cleaning efficiency is primarily dictated by the probability of foulant detachment. Our study offers profound insights into the importance of shear rate and detachment probability in governing foulant detachment kinetics and self-cleaning behavior, which carry significant implications for membrane preparation and process operation."

Results indicated that the NO3– dynamics were jointly controlled by sources (precipitation, terrestrial inputs, and sediment supply) and processes (hydrological and biological). The monthly NO3– export load from the 444.4 km2 watershed was 3.72 × 105 kg. Groundwater (36 ± 26%) and soil nitrogen (25 ± 17%) were the primary exogenous sources of NO3–.

Yet, how internal soil gross N transformation rates respond to fires remains unexplored globally. Here, we investigate the general response of gross soil N transformations to fire and its consequences for N availability and loss. The results showed that fire increased gross N mineralization rate (GNM; +38%) and ammonium concentration (+47%) as a result of decreased soil C/N ratio but decreased microbial nitrate immobilization (INO3; −56%), resulting in increased nitrous oxide (N2O; +50%) and nitric oxide (+121%) emissions and N leaching (+308%). Time since fire affected soil N cycling and loss. Fire increased GNM, ammonium concentration, and N2O emission, and decreased INO3 only when time since fire was less than one year, while increased N leaching in the short (<one year) and long (>one year) terms. Thus, the consequences of fire were a short-lived increase in N availability and N2O emissions (lasting less than one year) but with persistent risks of N loss by leaching over time. Overall, fire increased the potential risks of N loss by stimulating N production and inhibiting nitrate retention."

Qafoku,Synergetic Effects of Soil Organic Matter Components During Interactions with Minerals,"Mineral-associated soil organic matter (SOM) is critical for stabilizing organic carbon and mitigating climate change. However, mineral-SOM interactions at the molecular scale, particularly synergetic adsorption through organic–organic interaction on the mineral surface known as organic multilayering, remain poorly understood. This study investigates the impact of organic multilayering on mineral-SOM interactions, by integrating macroscale experiments and molecular-scale simulations that assess the individual and sequential adsorption of major SOM compounds–lauric acid (lipid), pentaglycine (amino acid), trehalose (carbohydrate), and lignin onto soil minerals. Ferrihydrite, Al-hydroxide, and calcite are exposed to SOM compounds to determine adsorption affinities and binding energies. Results show that lauric acid has 20–40 times higher Kd than pentaglycine, following the order Kd(ferrihydrite) > Kd(Al-hydroxide) ≫ Kd(calcite). Molecular-scale simulations confirm that lauric acid has a higher binding energy (30.8 kcal/mol) on ferrihydrite than pentaglycine (6.0 kcal/mol), attributed to lipid hydrophobicity. The lower binding energy of pentaglycine results from its hydrophilic amide groups, facilitating partitioning into water. Sequential experiments examine how the first layer of lipid or amino acid affects the adsorption of carbohydrate/lignin, which show little or no individual adsorption affinities. Macroscale results reveal that lipid and amino acid adsorption induce ferrihydrite particle repulsion increasing reactive surface area and enhancing carbohydrate/lignin adsorption independently and synergistically through organic multilayering. Molecular-scale results reveal that amino acid adsorbed on ferrihydrite interacts more readily with lignin macroaggregates (preformed in solution) than with individual lignin units, indicating organic multilayering via H-bonding.

To address this gap, we developed a ventilated artificial lung system that replicates human inhalation exposures in four key aspects: (1) facilitating continuous breathing with adjustable respiratory parameters; (2) distributing inhaled aerosols through transitional airflow fields in 3D-printed airway structures, which enables size-dependent particle deposition; (3) duplicating the warm and humid lung environment to promote inhaled aerosol dynamics, such as hygroscopic growth; and (4) supporting the cultivation of human airway epithelium for aerosol exposure and toxicological analyses. As a proof-of-concept application, we exposed human bronchial epithelial cells to electronic cigarette aerosols in the system. Our results show that electronic cigarette particles undergo significant hygroscopic growth within the artificial lung, leading to a 19% greater deposition dose compared to data collected at room temperature and relative humidity. Additionally, short-term exposure altered epithelial production of the chemokine Fractalkine in a nicotine-dependent manner, but no acute toxic effects were observed.

Here, we greatly amplify this self-purification effect of natural dissolved oxygen (DO) by nonexpendable H2O2 triggering a DRC catalyst with a micro-potential difference surface. This low-energy strategy is mainly realized by lowering the activation energy barriers of endogenous substances and simultaneously opening the mass transfer channels over the Cu–ZnO surface.

Results indicated that elevated CO2 levels significantly increased the relative abundance of seed ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), especially those related to beta-lactam resistance and MGEs.

Metallophores, metabolites secreted by microorganisms and plants, promote mineral dissolution to increase the metal bioavailability. However, interactions between metallophores and Mo-bearing minerals remain unclear. In this study, catecholate protochelin and hydroxamate desferrioxamine B (DFOB) were utilized to examine their effects on dissolution of the common Mo-bearing mineral, molybdenite (MoS2), under both oxic and anoxic conditions. Protochelin promoted molybdenite dissolution under oxic conditions, with the formation of MoO3 on the surface and Mo-siderophore complexes in solution. This was attributed to air-oxidation of both molybdenite and protochelin, as evidenced by lack of dissolution under anoxic conditions but enhanced dissolution by either preoxidized protochelin or preoxidized molybdenite. Liquid chromatography–mass spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry analyses revealed degradation of protochelin and adsorptions of its byproducts on molybdenite surface to promote dissolution. Conversely, DFOB inhibited molybdenite dissolution under both oxic and anoxic conditions, likely attributed to surface adsorption of DFOB and its weak complexation with Mo(VI) at the circumneutral pH. This work highlights the need to consider the balance between promoting and inhibitory effects of different metallophores on Mo-mineral dissolution."

In this work, we conduct multiscale, periodic measurements of methane and carbon dioxide emissions at two US LNG terminals over a 16-month campaign. We find that methane emission intensity varied from 0.007% to 0.045%, normalized to methane in LNG production. Carbon dioxide emissions accounted for over 95% of total GHG emissions using 100-year global warming potential (GWP) for methane. Thus, contrary to observations across other natural gas supply chain segments, we find that reported GHG emissions intensity closely matches measurement informed GHG emissions intensity of 0.24–0.27 kg CO2e/kg CH4.

It is thus crucial to identify the sources and transformations of Hg in TP ecosystems. Here we measured Hg isotopes in water samples collected from two adjacent TP rivers, the Upper Mekong River (UMR) and the Upper Salween River (USR), to better constrain Hg geochemistry and its export under climate changes. We found similar δ202Hg and Δ200Hg variations in the two rivers, which reflect a similarly mixed contribution of atmospheric precipitation and catchment input to both rivers. However, in general, USR shows notably higher Δ199Hg than UMR. As the catchment of USR has a larger glacier-covered area than UMR, we propose that the higher Δ199Hg of USR water samples reflects a higher glacier Hg input, which is typically characterized by extremely positive Δ199Hg. Our study indicates that increasing glacier melting, vegetation greening and precipitation induced by climate changes may enhance Hg export from TP, potentially endangering the fragile Tibetan ecosystem and human health."

UFPs generated from occupant activities or infiltrating from the outdoors can be recirculated and accumulate indoors when they are not successfully filtered by an air handling unit. Monitoring UFPs in real occupied environments is vital to understanding these source and mitigation dynamics, but capturing their rapid transience across multiple locations can be challenging due to high-cost instrumentation. This 9-month field measurement campaign pairs four medium-cost diffusion charger sensors with volumetric airflow rates modulated and monitored in a cloud-based building automation system of an open-plan living laboratory office and dedicated air handling unit to evaluate spatiotemporal particle number and surface area concentrations and migration trends. Particle number flux rates reveal that an estimated daily median of 8 × 1013 UFPs enter the air handling unit from the outdoors. Switching from a MERV14 to a HEPA filter reduces the number of UFPs supplied to the room by tens of trillions of UFPs daily, increasing the median filtration efficiency from 40% to 96%. These results demonstrate the efficacy of an optimal air handling unit’s performance to improve indoor air quality, while highlighting UFP dynamics that are not accounted for in current filtration standards nor in occupant-centered HVAC control. Scalable sensor development can popularize UFP monitoring and allow for future UFP integration within building control and automation platforms.

On Mars, their distribution has been proposed to indicate endo‐ and exogenic drivers, such as tectonic activity and solar‐driven thermal fatigue. Here, we present the first global catalog of 1,383 rockfall‐bearing locations on Mars, derived using MRO HiRISE images and a machine learning‐driven and human‐reviewed mapping approach. Rockfalls are documented between 82°N and 53°S, are heterogeneously distributed, and predominantly occur on the steep walls of craters and fossae. Globally, we do not observe a significant relation between rockfall abundance and terrain age, insolation, volatile abundance, wind speed, and impact or tectonic events, implying that rockfall drivers might act on varying spatiotemporal scales and differ across the planet—dissimilar to rockfalls on other bodies, like the Moon.

10.1029/2023JD040055,False,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究的是最大可能降水量（PMP）的估算方法，PMP用于设计大坝溢洪道和其他高风险建筑物。传统上，PMP是通过对历史上的特大暴雨进行比例放大来估算的。近年来，数值天气预报模型被用来模拟大气湿度增加（称为相对湿度最大化，或RHM）所导致的降水。尽管这代表了重大的改进，但基于模型的PMP依赖于一个关键假设，即历史上的特大暴雨达到了最大效率（水分转化为降水），而该论文重新评估了这一假设。研究人员使用CESM2-LE全球气候模型集合，这是一个非常大的人工记录（约1150年），与历史记录相比，以了解风暴效率和降水的上限。他们对CESM2-LE中最严重的10场暴雨（按总降水量）进行了降尺度分析，并确定了控制降水效率的关键风暴属性（垂直运动、对流和辐合）。与历史风暴相比，他们发现CESM-LE风暴的效率可提高30%，降水量可提高32%，但PMP估算值仅提高8%，这表明模型集合和历史风暴在PMP方面存在一定程度的趋同。这项工作对控制风暴效率的因素的理解，利用了过去专注于湿度的研究成果，并支持开发更可靠的PMP风暴放大指南。虽然该研究与大气科学相关，但其重点是降水和洪水预测，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析。,"['precipitation', 'Probable Maximum Precipitation', 'storms', 'flood', 'numerical weather prediction', 'climate model']",Emilie G.

A Large Model Ensemble Approach,"The flood that would result from the greatest depth of precipitation “meteorologically possible”, or Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) is used in the design of dam spillways and other high‐risk structures. Historically, PMP has been estimated by scaling depth‐area‐duration relationships obtained from severe historical storms. Over the last decade, numerical weather prediction models have been used to instead simulate precipitation resulting from the addition of atmospheric moisture (called relative humidity maximization, or RHM). Despite the major improvement this represents, model‐based PMP relies on a key assumption, which this paper re‐evaluates in Oroville dam's Feather River watershed (California). Model‐based as well as earlier procedures assume that severe historical storms achieved maximum efficiency (moisture conversion to precipitation) and only maximize moisture. We examine the most severe storms found in the CESM2‐LE global climate model ensemble, which constitutes a very large artificial record (∼1,150 years) in comparison with the historical record, to understand the upper bounds of storm efficiency and precipitation. We downscale the 10 most severe CESM2‐LE storms (by precipitation totals), and identify key storm attributes (vertical motion, convection and convergence) that control precipitation efficiency. In comparison with historical storms, we find that CESM‐LE storms can have 30% higher efficiency and 32% higher precipitation, but produce only 8% higher PMP estimates, suggesting some convergence of model ensemble and historical storms in terms of PMP. The understanding of the controls on storm efficiency that our work provides leverages past work focused on moisture and supports the development of more reliable PMP storm amplification guidance."

In this study, we investigated the contribution of historical climate change to the heavy snowfall event using large ensemble simulation data sets and two pseudo global warming (PGW) methods. We classified the large ensemble simulation data sets by the pressure pattern and identified the extratropical cyclone event. Composite analyses reveal that the development of the extratropical cyclone can be attributed to historical climate change. We ran the PGW method with the classified meteorological data as the input data and found that the development of the extratropical cyclone resulted in enhanced water vapor transport and intensified local convergence in the lower troposphere, causing heavy precipitation. We also found that oceanic warming made a minimal contribution to the precipitation in this event.

 The phylum Apicomplexa comprises eukaryotic parasites that cause fatal diseases affecting millions of people and animals worldwide. Their mitochondrial genomes have been significantly reduced, leaving only three protein-coding genes and highly fragmented mitoribosomal rRNAs, raising challenging questions about mitoribosome composition, assembly and structure. Our study reveals how Toxoplasma gondii assembles over 40 mt-rRNA fragments using exclusively nuclear-encoded mitoribosomal proteins and three lineage-specific families of RNA-binding proteins. Among these are four proteins from the Apetala2/Ethylene Response Factor (AP2/ERF) family, originally known as transcription factors in plants and Apicomplexa, now repurposed as essential mitoribosome components. Cryo-EM analysis of the mitoribosome structure demonstrates how these AP2 proteins function as RNA binders to maintain mitoribosome integrity. The mitoribosome is also decorated with members of lineage-specific RNA-binding proteins belonging to RAP (RNA-binding domain abundant in Apicomplexa) proteins and HPR (heptatricopeptide repeat) families, highlighting the unique adaptations of these parasites.

 High-velocity stars and peculiar G objects orbit the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*). Together, the G objects and high-velocity stars constitute the S cluster.

Based on periodic changes in the radial velocity, we find an orbital period of 372±3 days for the two components.

Here, the authors use yeast cells to show that macronucleophagy can act as a break to limit micronucleophagy, another mode of autophagic degradation of nuclear components, and that this may play a role in protection against starvation. 
 Lysosome/vacuole-mediated intracellular degradation pathways, collectively known as autophagy, play crucial roles in the maintenance and regulation of various cellular functions. However, little is known about the relationship between different modes of autophagy. In the budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, nitrogen starvation triggers both macronucleophagy and micronucleophagy, in which nuclear components are degraded via macroautophagy and microautophagy, respectively. We previously revealed that Atg39-mediated macronucleophagy is important for cell survival under nitrogen starvation; however, the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here, we reveal that defective Atg39-mediated macronucleophagy leads to the hyperactivation of micronucleophagy, resulting in the excessive transport of various nuclear components into the vacuole. Micronucleophagy occurs at the nucleus–vacuole junction (NVJ). We show that nuclear membrane proteins localized to the NVJ, including Nvj1, which is responsible for micronucleophagy, are degraded via macronucleophagy. Therefore, defective Atg39-mediated macronucleophagy results in the accumulation of Nvj1, which contributes to micronucleophagy enhancement. Blocking micronucleophagy almost completely suppresses cell death caused by the absence of Atg39, whereas enhanced micronucleophagy correlates with death in Atg39-mutant cells under nitrogen starvation. These results suggest that macronucleophagy modulates micronucleophagy in order to prevent the excess removal of nuclear components, thereby maintaining nuclear and cellular homeostasis during nitrogen starvation.

The authors here describe a gorgonopsian from the early–middle Permian of Mallorca, suggesting that therapsids originated in tropical regions and diversified quickly over 10 million years. 
 Therapsids were a dominant component of middle–late Permian terrestrial ecosystems worldwide, eventually giving rise to mammals during the early Mesozoic. However, little is currently known about the time and place of origin of Therapsida. Here we describe a definitive therapsid from the lower–?middle Permian palaeotropics, a partial skeleton of a gorgonopsian from the island of Mallorca, western Mediterranean. This specimen represents, to our knowledge, the oldest gorgonopsian record worldwide, and possibly the oldest known therapsid. Using emerging relaxed clock models, we provide a quantitative timeline for the origin and early diversification of therapsids, indicating a long ghost lineage leading to the evolutionary radiation of all major therapsid clades within less than 10 Myr, in the aftermath of Olson’s Extinction. Our findings place this unambiguous early therapsid in an ancient summer wet biome of equatorial Pangaea, thus suggesting that the group originated in tropical rather than temperate regions.

 Throughout adulthood and ageing our brains undergo structural loss in an average pattern resembling faster atrophy in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Using a longitudinal adult lifespan sample (aged 30-89; 2–7 timepoints) and four polygenic scores for AD, we show that change in AD-sensitive brain features correlates with genetic AD-risk and memory decline in healthy adults. We first show genetic risk links with more brain loss than expected for age in early Braak regions, and find this extends beyond APOE genotype. Next, we run machine learning on AD-control data from the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative using brain change trajectories conditioned on age, to identify AD-sensitive features and model their change in healthy adults. Genetic AD-risk linked with multivariate change across many AD-sensitive features, and we show most individuals over age ~50 are on an accelerated trajectory of brain loss in AD-sensitive regions. Finally, high genetic risk adults with elevated brain change showed more memory decline through adulthood, compared to high genetic risk adults with less brain change. Our findings suggest quantitative AD risk factors are detectable in healthy individuals, via a shared pattern of ageing- and AD-related neurodegeneration that occurs along a continuum and tracks memory decline through adulthood.

 Mutations in the NRF2-KEAP1 pathway are common in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and confer broad-spectrum therapeutic resistance, leading to poor outcomes. Currently, there is no means to non-invasively identify NRF2 activation in living subjects.

 Unfit cells with defective signalling or gene expression are eliminated through competition with neighbouring cells. However, physiological roles and mechanisms of cell competition in vertebrates remain unclear. In addition, universal mechanisms regulating diverse cell competition are unknown. Using zebrafish imaging, we reveal that cell competition ensures robust patterning of the spinal cord and muscle through elimination of cells with unfit sonic hedgehog activity, driven by cadherin-mediated communication between unfit and neighbouring fit cells and subsequent activation of the Smad-Foxo3-reactive oxygen species axis. We identify Foxo3 as a common marker of loser cells in various types of cell competition in zebrafish and mice. Foxo3-mediated physiological cell competition is required for eliminating various naturally generated unfit cells and for the consequent precise patterning during zebrafish embryogenesis and organogenesis. Given the implication of Foxo3 downregulation in age-related diseases, cell competition may be a defence system to prevent abnormalities throughout development and adult homeostasis.

 Accurate building height estimation is essential to support urbanization monitoring, environmental impact analysis and sustainable urban planning. However, conducting large-scale building height estimation remains a significant challenge. While deep learning (DL) has proven effective for large-scale mapping tasks, there is a lack of advanced DL models specifically tailored for height estimation, particularly when using open-source Earth observation data. In this study, we propose T-SwinUNet, an advanced DL model for large-scale building height estimation leveraging Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 multispectral time series. T-SwinUNet model contains a feature extractor with local/global feature comprehension capabilities, a temporal attention module to learn the correlation between constant and variable features of building objects over time and an efficient multitask decoder to predict building height at 10 m spatial resolution. The model is trained and evaluated on data from the Netherlands, Switzerland, Estonia, and Germany, and its generalizability is evaluated on an out-of-distribution (OOD) test set from ten additional cities from other European countries. Our study incorporates extensive model evaluations, ablation experiments, and comparisons with established models. T-SwinUNet predicts building height with a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.89 m, outperforming state-of-the-art models at 10 m spatial resolution. Its strong generalization to the OOD test set (RMSE of 3.2 m) underscores its potential for low-cost building height estimation across Europe, with future scalability to other regions. Furthermore, the assessment at 100 m resolution reveals that T-SwinUNet (0.29 m RMSE, 0.75 R2) also outperformed the global building height product GHSL-Built-H R2023A product(0.56 m RMSE and 0.37 R2).

 Rapid, accurate, and nondestructive estimation of grain number per panicle (GNPP) in winter wheat is crucial to accelerate smart breeding, improve precision crop management, and ensure food security. As two (panicle number per unit ground area and GNPP) of three commonly used yield components, GNPP was much less quantified with remotely sensed data than the former through visual counting. The limited research suffered from either low accuracies with ground canopy spectra or low efficiency with proximal panicle imaging systems. No studies have been reported on estimating GNPP with unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) imagery, underscoring its strong advantages in high-resolution and efficient monitoring. To address these issues, this study proposed a practical approach for estimating GNPP in winter wheat by integrating UAV imagery and meteorological data with meta-learning ensemble regression. The potential contributions of different variables were examined for understanding the improvement in the spectral estimation of GNPP, including spectral indices (SIs), the optimal canopy height (CH) metric, and absorbed photosynthetic active radiation (APAR).The results demonstrated that CHP99 (CH at the 99th percentile in the region of interest) derived from red-green-blue (RGB) imagery exhibited the strongest correlation with measured plant height among all RGB- or multispectral (MS)-derived CH metrics. The incorporation of remotely sensed APAR and RGB-derived CHP99 improved the accuracy of GNPP estimation over using merely color indices or SIs. Among all feature combinations, Comb. #6 (SIs + APARMS + CHP99) yielded the highest overall accuracies in estimating GNPP for individual and multiple stages. Compared with the best anthesis models for Combs. #5–7 (Rval2 = 0.52–0.64, RMSE = 2.85–2.47, RRMSE = 6.01–5.21 %), the multi-stage (heading + anthesis) models exhibited higher accuracies in independent validation (Rval2 = 0.60–0.65, RMSE = 2.60–2.42, RRMSE = 5.48–5.10 %). The findings suggest this study has opened a new avenue for estimating GNPP with UAV remote sensing. The proposed method for the synergistic use of UAV imagery and meteorological data has great potential in the prediction of GNPP and grain yield over various regions with satellite imagery and climate datasets."

 Change detection (CD) aims to compare and analyze images of identical geographic areas but different dates, whereby revealing spatio-temporal change patterns of Earth’s surface. With the implementation of the High-Resolution Earth Observation Project, an integrated sky-to-ground observation system has been continuously developed and improved. The accumulation of massive multi-modal, multi-angle, and multi-resolution remote sensing data have greatly enriched the CD data sources. Among them, high-resolution optical remote sensing images contain abundant spatial detail information, making it possible to interpret fine-grained scenes and greatly expand the application breadth and depth of CD. Generally, traditional optical remote sensing CD methods are cumbersome in steps and have a low level of automation. In contrast, artificial intelligence (AI) based CD methods possess powerful feature extraction and non-linear modeling capabilities, thereby gaining advantages that traditional methods cannot match. As a result, they have become the mainstream approaches in the field of CD. This review article systematically summarizes the datasets, theories, and methods of CD for optical remote sensing image. It provides a comprehensive analysis of AI-based CD algorithms based on deep learning paradigms from the perspectives of algorithm granularity. In-depth analysis of the performance of typical algorithms are further conducted.

We propose a deep network model utilizing an encoder–decoder framework that integrates Transformer and convolution for comprehensive defect extraction. The proposed model utilizes an encoder that integrates a hierarchical Transformer backbone with an efficient attention mechanism to fully explore complete information at multi-scale granularities. In the decoder, multi-scale information is initially aggregated using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) module. Additionally, the Stacking Filters with Atrous Convolutions (SFAC) module are implemented to enhance the perception of the complete defect scope. Furthermore, a Boundary-aware Attention Module (BAM) is implemented to enhance edge information to improve the detection of defects. With this well-designed decoder, the multi-scale information from the encoder can be fully aggregated and exploited for complete defect detection.

 The assessment of the impact of passive remediation approaches to improve indoor air quality requires the real-scale investigation of technologies. Plasters are identified as relevant materials to mitigate indoor pollution. Interestingly, lime-cement plasters can be formulated with activated carbon sorbent to expand their uptake properties. This work provides a full-scale and replicable evaluation methodology to address the passive remediation properties of materials with regard to experimental facilities and the diversity of pollution scenarios. This methodology is applied to lime-cement plaster formulated or otherwise with activated carbon and subsequently set in IRINA experimental room (40 m3). Both materials are successively submitted to CO2, ozone and VOC transient pollution events. Specific attention is paid to the behaviour of formaldehyde. First, both fresh plasters demonstrate high mitigation capacities towards CO2. This behaviour has to be compared to the ageing of materials. Similarly, excellent decomposition capacities are evidenced towards ozone. Both pollution scenarios highlight a higher mitigation of lime-cement compared to activated carbon. Regarding VOC pollution scenarios, the effective removal of formaldehyde is evidenced. However, formaldehyde decay follows second-order kinetics, due to surface reactive processes, preventing the calculation of the clean air delivery rate (CADR). Mitigation of other VOCs is considerably promoted by activated carbon in the plaster. Abatement of different classes of pollutants is discussed taking CADR into consideration. Results evidence the effectiveness of combining carbon-based sorbent with plaster in order to benefit from complementary uptake properties. Finally, the CADR of selected pollutants are compared with classically determined equivalent data for active remediation technologies. This full-scale comparison demonstrates that passive mitigation approaches offer equivalent remediation capacities compared to widespread active and destructive air treatment technologies."

 We investigated the performance of mass transfer from cloud water to rainwater, commonly referred to as ‘autoconversion’, in cloud microphysical schemes within high-resolution numerical models, such as the Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF). The proper choice of autoconversion rate in the numerical model is crucial for droplet growth and conversion rates to form precipitation. The liquid water content and cloud properties, varying from shallow to convective clouds, are highly sensitive to autoconversion rates, and their sensitivity is closely linked with model biases. A parcel-bin model guided by observations can provide significant insights for selecting a more suitable suite of autoconversion rates for the forecasting model. The parcel-bin model is important for the explicit representation of hydrometeors population and calculating microphysical process rates. We calculated drop size distribution, relative dispersion, diffusion growth rate coefficient, and autoconversion rates for two environmental conditions using a small-scale model based on in situ airborne measurement data from the Cloud-Aerosol Interaction and Precipitation Enhancement Experiment (CAIPEEX) over the Indian subcontinent.

 Seasonal Forecasting of the Arabian Peninsula (AP) Surface Air Temperature (SAT) during boreal summer (June–July-August; JJA) season is essential for socio-economic sectors of the region. In present study, the multi-model boreal summer seasonal mean SAT prediction skill is investigated using Copernicus Climate Change Services (C3S) and Saudi-KAU Seasonal Forecasting Systems for the period 1993 to 2016. The models are validated against ERA5 reanalysis dataset. The observed maximum SAT variability over the central and northern AP region is captured well by 80 % of the models. We further defined AP temperature index (APTI) based on SAT anomaly over the central and northern AP. A statistically significant negative correlation of −0.52 (95 % confidence level) is noted in ERA5 between El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and APTI. Most of the models successfully capture the ENSO and SAT teleconnections with varying magnitude, except CMCC and DWD models, where opposite relationship is noted. During La Niña (cold ENSO phase) the positive geopotential anomalies over Eurasia strengthen due to the upper-level divergence over the Western Pacific and Eastern Indian Ocean through Sverdrup balance, which favour sinking motion and leads to above-normal temperature anomalies over AP. The opposite tends to happen during El Niño. The deterministic and probabilistic skill of the models are also assessed. Most of the models show reasonable prediction skill in representing ENSO and atmospheric circulation anomalies over Eurasia that modulate AP summer SAT anomalies, except CMCC and DWD. The SEAS5, METEOF, Saudi-KAU, UKMO and JMA models show reasonable probabilistic skill as well as potential predictability (PP) of SAT in the central and northern AP, aligning well with the actual skill during boreal summer season over the AP region."

Under summertime heat wave conditions, the urban atmosphere becomes stable at night, which inhibits turbulent motions. Under those specific conditions, urban parks and woods cool much more efficiently than the surrounding built-up neighbourhoods in the evening and through the night, providing cooler air temperatures by 4 to 6° C depending on park size. 
 The added heat in cities amplifies the health risks of heat waves. At night under calm winds and cloud-free skies, the air in the urban canopy layer can be several degrees warmer than in rural areas. This lower nocturnal cooling in the built-up settings poses severe health risks to the urban inhabitants, as indoor spaces cannot be ventilated effectively. With heat waves becoming more frequent and more intense in future climates, many cities are expanding their green spaces with the aim to introduce cooling through shading, evaporation and lower heat storage capacities. In this study, we assessed how the evening and nighttime cooling effect of urban parks (relative to nearby built-up settings) varies with the park size and the mesoscale atmospheric conditions during warm summer periods. Using a combination of meteorological surface station data and compact radiosondes, the cooling effect is quantified for several urban parks (about 15 ha) and urban woods (about 900 ha). A profiling Doppler wind lidar deployed in the city centre is used to measure turbulent vertical mixing conditions in the urban boundary layer. We find that the maximum nocturnal cooling effects in urban parks range around 1–5 °C during a 1-week heat wave event in mid-July 2022 but also in general during summer 2022 (June–August). Three atmospheric stability and mixing regimes are identified that explain the night-to-night variability in the park cooling effect. We find that very low turbulent vertical mixing in the urban boundary layer (<0.05 m2 s−2) results in the strongest evening cooling in both rural settings and urban parks and the weakest cooling in the built-up environment. This regime specifically occurs during heat waves in connection with large-scale advection of hot air over the region and corresponding subsidence. When nocturnal turbulent vertical mixing above the city is stronger, the evening cooling in urban green spaces is less efficient, so the atmospheric stratification above both urban parks and woods is less stable, and temperature contrasts compared to the built-up environment are less pronounced. These results highlight the fact that urban green spaces have a significant cooling potential during heat waves, with maximum effects at night as advection and mixing transport processes are minimal. This suggests adapting the opening hours of public parks to enable residents to benefit from these cooling islands."

Link;Rileigh Robertson;Tyler Boyle;Dustin Poppendieck,Methodology and uncertainty estimation for measurements of methane leakage in a manufactured house,"Methane leaks into houses that use natural gas from appliances, pipes, and fittings. We measured methane emitted from a manufactured house under different ventilation conditions using indoor and outdoor concentration measurements. We injected methane at prescribed rates into the house and then measured the emissions using our method. We report the error in the calculation based on these tests. We also describe the method and provide guidance on conducting this type of experiment. 
 Methane emissions from natural gas appliances and infrastructure within buildings have historically not been captured in greenhouse gas inventories, leading to under-estimates, especially in urban areas. Recent measurements of these post-meter emissions have indicated non-negligible emissions within residences, with impacts on both indoor air quality and climate. As a result, methane losses from residential buildings have been included in the latest US national inventory, with emission factors determined from a single study of homes in California. To facilitate future additional studies investigating building methane emissions, we conducted a controlled experiment to document a methodology for such measurements and estimated associated uncertainties. We determined whole-house methane emission rates with a mass balance approach using near-simultaneous measurements of indoor and outdoor methane mole fractions at a manufactured house. We quantified the uncertainty in whole-house methane emission rates by varying the forced outdoor air ventilation rate of the manufactured house, measuring the outdoor air change rate using both sulfur hexafluoride and carbon dioxide tracers, and performing methane injections at prescribed rates. We found that the whole-house quiescent methane emission rate (i.e., emission rate when all gas appliances were off) in the manufactured house averaged 0.33 g d−1 with methodological errors in the calculated emission rates of approximately 19 % (root-mean-square deviation). We also measured the quiescent leakage from the manufactured house over 3 months to find 26 % (1σ) variability in emissions over two seasons. Our findings can be used to inform plans for future studies quantifying indoor methane losses downstream of residential meters using similar methods. Such quantification studies are sorely needed to better understand building methane emissions and their drivers to inform inventories and plan mitigation strategies."

We found that the model did well simulating past ocean conditions like temperature, and nutrient and oxygen levels, and can even reproduce metrics used by and important to ecosystem managers. 
 Regional ocean models enable generation of computationally-affordable and regionally-tailored ensembles of near-term forecasts and long-term projections of sufficient resolution to serve marine resource management. Climate change, however, has created marine resource challenges, such as shifting stock distributions, that cut across domestic and international management boundaries and have pushed regional modeling efforts toward “coastwide” approaches. Here we present and evaluate a multidecadal hindcast with a Northeast Pacific (NEP) regional implementation of the Modular Ocean Model version 6 with sea ice and biogeochemistry that extends from the Chukchi Sea to the Baja California Peninsula at 10-km horizontal resolution (MOM6-COBALT-NEP10k, or “NEP10k”). This domain includes an Arctic-adjacent system with a broad shallow shelf seasonally covered by sea ice (the Eastern Bering Sea, EBS), a sub-Arctic system with upwelling in the Alaska Gyre and predominant downwelling winds and large freshwater forcing along the coast (the Gulf of Alaska, GoA), and a temperate, eastern boundary upwelling ecosystem (the California Current Ecosystem, CCE). The coastwide model was able to recreate seasonal and cross-ecosystem contrasts in numerous ecosystem-critical properties including temperature, salinity, inorganic nutrients, oxygen, carbonate saturation states, and chlorophyll. Spatial consistency between modeled quantities and observations generally extended to plankton ecosystems, though small to moderate biases were also apparent. Fidelity with observed zooplankton biomass, for example, was limited to first-order seasonal and cross-system contrasts. Temporally, simulated monthly surface and bottom temperature anomalies in coastal regions (< 500 m deep) closely matched estimates from data-assimilative ocean reanalyses. Performance, however, was reduced in some nearshore regions coarsely resolved by the model’s 10-km resolution grid, and the time series of satellite-based chlorophyll anomaly estimates proved more difficult to match than temperature. System-specific ecosystem indicators were also assessed. In the EBS, NEP10k robustly matched observed variations, including recent large declines, in the area of the summer bottom water “cold pool” (< 2 °C) which exerts a profound influence on EBS fisheries. In the GoA, the simulation captured patterns of sea surface height variability and variations in thermal, oxygen and acidification risk associated with local modes of inter-annual to decadal climate variability. In the CCE, the simulation robustly captured variations in upwelling indices and coastal water masses, though discrepancies in the latter were evident in the Southern California Bight. Enhanced model resolution may reduce such discrepancies, but any benefits must be carefully weighed against computational costs given the intended use of this system for ensemble predictions and projections. Meanwhile, the demonstrated NEP10k skill level herein, particularly in recreating cross-ecosystem contrasts and the time variation of ecosystem indicators over multiple decades, suggests considerable immediate utility for coastwide retrospective and predictive applications."

By bridging the gap between computational efficiency and physical detail, PALM-SLUrb broadens PALM's potential for urban climate research. 
 Urban areas are recognized as critical zones for climate research due to the high number of people living in these areas and their significant impacts on local and regional climates. However, understanding urban boundary layer processes remains a challenge, as existing mesoscale models cannot resolve their fine-scale features and dynamics, while microscale fluid dynamics simulations remain computationally expensive or unfeasible for the full extent of the urban atmosphere. To address this gap, we present PALM-SLUrb, a single-layer urban canopy model for the PALM model system, offering a computationally efficient and physics-based model to represent urban surfaces on non-building-resolving grids. Together with the model description, we present sensitivity tests and a model comparison against grid-resolved urban canopies to demonstrate the model’s performance. The results demonstrate the model's ability to extend the representation of key urban–atmosphere interactions in PALM into coarser grid resolutions on the order of 10 metres.

This study evaluates a continuous monitoring approach for detecting MPs in wastewater effluents using a combination of biological early warning systems (BEWS). Three BEWS with Chlorella vulgaris, Daphnia magna, and Gammarus pulex were operated in parallel in a full-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant. Concentrations of MPs were monitored by simultaneous online chemical analysis using high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (MS2Field). Over 5 weeks, behavioral changes observed in the BEWS occasionally exceeded acute toxicity thresholds, triggering alarms. These changes were related to MPs identified by the MS2Field, to abiotic factors, or to operational parameters of the BEWS. For one toxic event, behavioral responses were linked to a pesticide, not authorized in Switzerland, at concentrations close to literature EC50 values.

In this work, we present a novel uranium recovery method using programmable electroactive living materials (ELMs). Utilizing Shewanella oneidensis, this approach leverages the intrinsic extracellular electron transfer capability of exoelectrogenic species, combining their adaptability and programmability with the robustness of engineered multicellular systems. These exoelectrogenic cells were endowed to selectively capture and enhance U(VI) reduction by expressing uranyl-binding proteins, coupled with a reconfigured transmembrane Mtr electron nanoconduit. By incorporating biofilm-promoting circuits, we improved cell-to-cell interactions and biofilm formation, enabling the stable assembly of ELMs with robust structural integrity. The ELMs demonstrated superior electrogenic activity, achieving a 3.30-fold increase in current density and a 3.15-fold increase in voltage output compared to controls in microbial electrochemical and fuel cells. When applied for uranium recovery, the ELMs exhibited robust U(VI) capture, reduction, and accumulation capabilities, with a maximum capacity of 808.42 μmol/g.

Here, we interestingly found that LDR specifically elevated the percentage of CD4+IFNγ+ Th1 splenocytes, both in vitro and in vivo, without affecting the percentage of CD8+IFNγ+ Tc1 cells and regulatory T cells. A similar phenomenon was found in T cells from peripheral blood. Mechanistically, we found that LDR can induce mitochondrial damage, which stimulated the STING signaling pathway, leading to the enhanced expression of T-bet, the master transcriptional factor of Th1-cell differentiation. The specific STING signal inhibitor can abrogate the effect of LDR on Th1 differentiation, confirming the central role of the STING pathway. To further validate the immunoregulatory role of LDR, we exposed mice with whole body LDR and evaluated if LDR could protect mice against triple-negative breast cancer through enhanced antitumor immunity. As expected, LDR significantly delayed tumor development and promoted cell death. Meanwhile, LDR resulted in increased tumor-infiltrating Th1 cells, while the proportion of Tc1 and Treg cells remained unchanged. Furthermore, the infiltration of antitumor macrophages was also increased.

The extracellular organic matter (EOM) secreted by algae omnipresent in eutrophic waters may affect MnOx dissolution thus the fate of organic micropollutants. This study investigates the mechanisms of MnOx reductive dissolution mediated by EOM and examines the effects of this process on 17α-ethinylestradiol degradation. The influences of EOM concentration (1.0–20.0 mgC/L) and pH (6.0–9.0) in both dark and irradiated conditions were assessed. In the dark, EOM was found to facilitate MnOx reductive dissolution via the ligand-to-metal charge transfer (LMCT). The dissolution was further enhanced under irradiation, with the participation of superoxide ions (O2•–). Higher EOM concentrations increased the contents of available reducing substances and O2•–, accelerating the reductive dissolution. Higher pH slowed the photoreductive dissolution rates, while O2•–-mediated reduction became more important. Polyphenols and highly unsaturated carbon and phenolic formulas in EOM were found to drive the reductive dissolution.

However, a more prominent atmospheric blocking high (i.e., Alaskan Ridge) initiated and intensified the extreme heat during the second winter warm spell. Increased incoming solar radiation and positive sensible heat flux due to a dry surface fostered extreme heat during the second winter warm spell event. Warm air advection throughout both winter warm spell events supported the extreme surface temperatures. Discovering potential crucial drivers to winter warm spells identifies the sources of predictability to improve prediction of these extreme heat events."

Most studies documenting the impacts of CAFOs rely almost exclusively on CAFO locations known from incomplete public records. Poultry CAFOs generate dry waste and operate without federal permits; thus, their environmental justice (EJ) impacts are undocumented. North Carolina (NC), a leading poultry producer, has seen a significant increase in poultry CAFOs, particularly since the 1997 swine CAFO moratorium. Using literature‐derived heuristics, this study refined the locations of poultry CAFOs derived based on Earth Observation (EO) data and deep learning, reducing the overestimation of poultry CAFO density by 54% after heuristic adjustments. We removed 51.8% of misclassified features in NC and 61.5% across the US, significantly improving data set accuracy. Spatial analysis, including Local Indicators of Spatial Association, revealed that poultry CAFOs often cluster in census tracts with high Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) scores, indicating potential EJ issues. Notably, one‐third of NC's census tracts with high poultry CAFO density also have high SVI, primarily in rural eastern regions. Similar patterns were observed in the South and Southeast of the US. However, not all high‐density CAFO areas correspond with high SVI, suggesting a complex relationship between CAFO locations and community vulnerabilities. This study highlights the critical need for comprehensive, high‐quality data on unpermitted poultry CAFOs derived using AI algorithms to fully understand their impacts on communities and accurately inform EJ evaluations."

 Human treponemal infections are caused by a family of closely related Treponema pallidum that give rise to the diseases yaws, bejel, pinta and, most famously, syphilis1. Debates on both a common origin for these pathogens and the history of syphilis itself has weighed evidence for the “Columbian hypothesis”2, which argues for an American origin, against that for the “pre-Columbian hypothesis”3, which argues for presence of the disease in Eurasia in the Medieval period and possibly earlier. While molecular data has provided a genetic basis for distinction of the typed subspecies4, deep evolution of the complex has remained unresolved due to limitations in the conclusions that can be drawn from the sparse paleogenomic data currently available. Here we explore this evolutionary history through analyses of five pre- and peri-contact ancient treponemal genomes from the Americas that represent ancient relatives of the T. pallidum pallidum (syphilis), T. pallidum pertenue (yaws) and T. pallidum endemicum (bejel) lineages. Our data indicate unexplored diversity and an emergence of T. pallidum that post-dates human occupation in the Americas. Together these results support an American origin for all T. pallidum characterized at the genomic level, both modern and ancient."

 Diamond is an exceptional material with great potential across various fields owing to its interesting properties1,2. However, despite extensive efforts over the past decades3–5, producing large quantities of desired ultrathin diamond membranes for widespread use remains challenging. Here we demonstrate that edge-exposed exfoliation using sticky tape is a simple, scalable and reliable method for producing ultrathin and transferable polycrystalline diamond membranes. Our approach enables the mass production of large-area (2-inch wafer), ultrathin (sub-micrometre thickness), ultraflat (sub-nano surface roughness) and ultraflexible (360° bendable) diamond membranes. These high-quality membranes, which have a flat workable surface, support standard micromanufacturing techniques, and their ultraflexible nature allows for direct elastic strain engineering and deformation sensing applications, which is not possible with their bulky counterpart. Systematic experimental and theoretical studies reveal that the quality of the exfoliated membranes depends on the peeling angle and membrane thickness, for which largely intact diamond membranes can be robustly produced within an optimal operation window. This single-step method, which opens up new avenues for the mass production of high-figure-of-merit diamond membranes, is expected to accelerate the commercialization and arrival of the diamond era in electronics, photonics and other related fields.

 Cellular identity requires the concerted action of multiple transcription factors (TFs) bound together to enhancers of cell-type-specific genes. Despite TFs recognizing specific DNA motifs within accessible chromatin, this information is insufficient to explain how TFs select enhancers1. Here we compared four different TF combinations that induce different cell states, analysing TF genome occupancy, chromatin accessibility, nucleosome positioning and 3D genome organization at the nucleosome resolution. We show that motif recognition on mononucleosomes can decipher only the individual binding of TFs. When bound together, TFs act cooperatively or competitively to target nucleosome arrays with defined 3D organization, displaying motifs in particular patterns. In one combination, motif directionality funnels TF combinatorial binding along chromatin loops, before infiltrating laterally to adjacent enhancers. In other combinations, TFs assemble on motif-dense and highly interconnected loop junctions, and subsequently translocate to nearby lineage-specific sites. We propose a guided-search model in which motif grammar on nucleosome fibres acts as signpost elements, directing TF combinatorial binding to enhancers.

 Calorie restriction (CR) is a dietary intervention used to promote health and longevity1,2. CR causes various metabolic changes in both the production and the circulation of metabolites1; however, it remains unclear which altered metabolites account for the physiological benefits of CR. Here we use metabolomics to analyse metabolites that exhibit changes in abundance during CR and perform subsequent functional validation. We show that lithocholic acid (LCA) is one of the metabolites that alone can recapitulate the effects of CR in mice. These effects include activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), enhancement of muscle regeneration and rejuvenation of grip strength and running capacity. LCA also activates AMPK and induces life-extending and health-extending effects in Caenorhabditis elegans and Drosophila melanogaster. As C. elegans and D. melanogaster are not able to synthesize LCA, these results indicate that these animals are able to transmit the signalling effects of LCA once administered. Knockout of AMPK abrogates LCA-induced phenotypes in all the three animal models. Together, we identify that administration of the CR-mediated upregulated metabolite LCA alone can confer anti-ageing benefits to metazoans in an AMPK-dependent manner.

 Lithocholic acid (LCA) is accumulated in mammals during calorie restriction and it can activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to slow down ageing1. However, the molecular details of how LCA activates AMPK and induces these biological effects are unclear. Here we show that LCA enhances the activity of sirtuins to deacetylate and subsequently inhibit vacuolar H+-ATPase (v-ATPase), which leads to AMPK activation through the lysosomal glucose-sensing pathway. Proteomics analyses of proteins that co-immunoprecipitated with sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) identified TUB-like protein 3 (TULP3), a sirtuin-interacting protein2, as a LCA receptor. In detail, LCA-bound TULP3 allosterically activates sirtuins, which then deacetylate the V1E1 subunit of v-ATPase on residues K52, K99 and K191. Muscle-specific expression of a V1E1 mutant (3KR), which mimics the deacetylated state, strongly activates AMPK and rejuvenates muscles in aged mice. In nematodes and flies, LCA depends on the TULP3 homologues tub-1 and ktub, respectively, to activate AMPK and extend lifespan and healthspan. Our study demonstrates that activation of the TULP3–sirtuin–v-ATPase–AMPK pathway by LCA reproduces the benefits of calorie restriction. The molecular mechanism underlying how lithocholic acid recapitulates the lifespan and healthspan benefits of calorie restriction is revealed to involve TULP3, sirtuins, v-ATPase and AMPK."

 RNA conformational diversity has fundamental biological roles1–5, but direct visualization of its full conformational space in solution has not been possible using traditional biophysical techniques. Using solution atomic force microscopy, a deep neural network and statistical analyses, we show that the ribonuclease P (RNase P) RNA adopts heterogeneous conformations consisting of a conformationally invariant core and highly flexible peripheral structural elements that sample a broad conformational space, with amplitudes as large as 20–60 Å in a multitude of directions, with very low net energy cost. Increasing Mg2+ drives compaction and enhances enzymatic activity, probably by narrowing the conformational space. Moreover, analyses of the correlations and anticorrelations between spatial flexibility and sequence conservation suggest that the functional roles of both the structure and dynamics of key regions are embedded in the primary sequence. These findings reveal the structure–dynamics basis for the embodiment of both enzymatic precision and substrate promiscuity in the RNA component of the RNase P.

 After nearly 50 years of searching, the vacuum ultraviolet 229Th nuclear isomeric transition has recently been directly laser excited1,2 and measured with high spectroscopic precision3. Nuclear clocks based on this transition are expected to be more robust4,5 than and may outperform6,7 current optical atomic clocks. These clocks also promise sensitive tests for new physics beyond the standard model5,8–12. In light of these important advances and applications, a substantial increase in the need for 229Th spectroscopy targets in several platforms is anticipated. However, the growth and handling of high-concentration 229Th-doped crystals5 used in previous measurements1–3,13,14 are challenging because of the scarcity and radioactivity of the 229Th material. Here we demonstrate a potentially scalable solution to these problems by performing laser excitation of the nuclear transition in 229ThF4 thin films grown using a physical vapour deposition process, consuming only micrograms of 229Th material. The 229ThF4 thin films are intrinsically compatible with photonics platforms and nanofabrication tools for integration with laser sources and detectors, paving the way for an integrated and field-deployable solid-state nuclear clock with radioactivity up to three orders of magnitude smaller than typical 229Th-doped crystals1–3,13. The high nuclear emitter density in 229ThF4 also potentially enables quantum optics studies in a new regime.

 The global aim to move away from fossil fuels requires efficient, inexpensive and sustainable energy storage to fully use renewable energy sources. Thermal energy storage materials1,2 in combination with a Carnot battery3–5 could revolutionize the energy storage sector. However, a lack of stable, inexpensive and energy-dense thermal energy storage materials impedes the advancement of this technology. Here we report the first, to our knowledge, ‘trimodal’ material that synergistically stores large amounts of thermal energy by integrating three distinct energy storage modes—latent, thermochemical and sensible. The eutectic mixture of boric and succinic acids undergoes a transition at around 150 °C, with a record high reversible thermal energy uptake of 394 ± 5% J g−1. We show that the transition involves melting of the boric acid component, which simultaneously undergoes dehydration into metaboric acid and water that dissolve into the liquid. Being retained in the liquid state allows the metaboric acid to readily rehydrate to re-form boric acid on cooling. Thermal stability is demonstrated over 1,000 heating–cooling cycles.

 Aquatic life is strongly structured by the distribution of light, which, besides attenuation in intensity, exhibits a continuous change in the spectrum with depth1. The extent to which these light changes are perceived by phytoplankton through photoreceptors is still inadequately known. We addressed this issue by integrating functional studies of diatom phytochrome (DPH) photoreceptors in model species2 with environmental surveys of their distribution and activity. Here, by developing an in vivo dose–response assay to light spectral variations mediated by DPH, we show that DPH can trigger photoreversible responses across the entire light spectrum, resulting in a change in DPH photoequilibrium with depth. By generating dph mutants in the diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, we also demonstrate that under simulated low-blue-light conditions of ocean depth, DPH regulates photosynthesis acclimation, thus linking optical depth detection with a functional response. The latitudinal distribution of DPH-containing diatoms from permanently stratified regions to seasonally mixed regions suggests an adaptive value of DPH functions in coping with vertical displacements in the water column. By establishing DPH as a detector of optical depth, this study provides a new view of how information embedded in the underwater light field can be exploited by diatoms to modulate their physiology throughout the photic zone.

 Old age is associated with a decline in cognitive function and an increase in neurodegenerative disease risk1. Brain ageing is complex and is accompanied by many cellular changes2. Furthermore, the influence that aged cells have on neighbouring cells and how this contributes to tissue decline is unknown. More generally, the tools to systematically address this question in ageing tissues have not yet been developed. Here we generate a spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics brain atlas of 4.2 million cells from 20 distinct ages across the adult lifespan and across two rejuvenating interventions—exercise and partial reprogramming. We build spatial ageing clocks, machine learning models trained on this spatial transcriptomics atlas, to identify spatial and cell-type-specific transcriptomic fingerprints of ageing, rejuvenation and disease, including for rare cell types. Using spatial ageing clocks and deep learning, we find that T cells, which increasingly infiltrate the brain with age, have a marked pro-ageing proximity effect on neighbouring cells. Surprisingly, neural stem cells have a strong pro-rejuvenating proximity effect on neighbouring cells. We also identify potential mediators of the pro-ageing effect of T cells and the pro-rejuvenating effect of neural stem cells on their neighbours. These results suggest that rare cell types can have a potent influence on their neighbours and could be targeted to counter tissue ageing. Spatial ageing clocks represent a useful tool for studying cell–cell interactions in spatial contexts and should allow scalable assessment of the efficacy of interventions for ageing and disease. A spatially resolved single-cell transcriptomics map of the mouse brain at different ages reveals signatures of ageing, rejuvenation and disease, including ageing effects associated with T cells and rejuvenation associated with neural stem cells."

 Controlling the functional properties of quantum materials with light has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, leading to the discovery of various light-induced phases of matter, such as superconductivity1, ferroelectricity2,3, magnetism4–6 and charge density waves7. However, in most cases, the photoinduced phases return to equilibrium on ultrafast timescales after the light is turned off, limiting their practical applications. Here we use intense terahertz pulses to induce a metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. The metastable state becomes increasingly robust as the temperature approaches the antiferromagnetic transition point, suggesting that critical order parameter fluctuations play an important part in facilitating the extended lifetime. By combining first-principles calculations with classical Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations, we find that the displacement of a specific phonon mode modulates the exchange couplings in a manner that favours a ground state with finite magnetization near the Néel temperature. This analysis also clarifies how the critical fluctuations of the dominant antiferromagnetic order can amplify both the magnitude and the lifetime of the new magnetic state. Our discovery demonstrates the efficient manipulation of the magnetic ground state in layered magnets through non-thermal pathways using terahertz light and establishes regions near critical points with enhanced order parameter fluctuations as promising areas to search for metastable hidden quantum states. Intense terahertz pulses are used to induce metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in a van der Waals antiferromagnet, FePS3."

 The formation of the vertebrate body involves the coordinated production of trunk tissues from progenitors located in the posterior of the embryo. Although in vitro models using pluripotent stem cells replicate aspects of this process1–10, they lack crucial components, most notably the notochord—a defining feature of chordates that patterns surrounding tissues11. Consequently, cell types dependent on notochord signals are absent from current models of human trunk formation. Here we performed single-cell transcriptomic analysis of chick embryos to map molecularly distinct progenitor populations and their spatial organization. Guided by this map, we investigated how differentiating human pluripotent stem cells develop a stereotypical spatial organization of trunk cell types. We found that YAP inactivation in conjunction with FGF-mediated MAPK signalling facilitated WNT pathway activation and induced expression of TBXT (also known as BRA). In addition, timely inhibition of WNT-induced NODAL and BMP signalling regulated the proportions of different tissue types, including notochordal cells. This enabled us to create a three-dimensional model of human trunk development that undergoes morphogenetic movements, producing elongated structures with a notochord and ventral neural and mesodermal tissues. Our findings provide insights into the mechanisms underlying vertebrate notochord formation and establish a more comprehensive in vitro model of human trunk development. This paves the way for future studies of tissue patterning in a physiologically relevant environment.

 Focal gene amplifications are among the most common cancer-associated mutations1 but have proven challenging to engineer in primary cells and model organisms. Here we describe a general strategy to engineer large (more than 1 Mbp) focal amplifications mediated by extrachromosomal DNAs (ecDNAs)2 in a spatiotemporally controlled manner in cells and in mice. By coupling ecDNA formation with expression of selectable markers, we track the dynamics of ecDNA-containing cells under physiological conditions and in the presence of specific selective pressures. We also apply this approach to generate mice harbouring Cre-inducible Myc- and Mdm2-containing ecDNAs analogous to those occurring in human cancers. We show that the engineered ecDNAs spontaneously accumulate in primary cells derived from these animals, promoting their proliferation, immortalization and transformation. Finally, we demonstrate the ability of Mdm2-containing ecDNAs to promote tumour formation in an autochthonous mouse model of hepatocellular carcinoma. These findings offer insights into the role of ecDNA-mediated gene amplifications in tumorigenesis. We anticipate that this approach will be valuable for investigating further unresolved aspects of ecDNA biology and for developing new preclinical immunocompetent mouse models of human cancers harbouring specific focal gene amplifications.

 Much of the human genome is transcribed into RNAs1, many of which contain structural elements that are important for their function. Such RNA molecules—including those that are structured and well-folded2—are conformationally heterogeneous and flexible, which is a prerequisite for function3,4, but this limits the applicability of methods such as NMR, crystallography and cryo-electron microscopy for structure elucidation. Moreover, owing to the lack of a large RNA structure database, and no clear correlation between sequence and structure, approaches such as AlphaFold5 for protein structure prediction do not apply to RNA. Therefore, determining the structures of heterogeneous RNAs remains an unmet challenge. Here we report holistic RNA structure determination method using atomic force microscopy, unsupervised machine learning and deep neural networks (HORNET), a novel method for determining three-dimensional topological structures of RNA using atomic force microscopy images of individual molecules in solution. Owing to the high signal-to-noise ratio of atomic force microscopy, this method is ideal for capturing structures of large RNA molecules in distinct conformations. In addition to six benchmark cases, we demonstrate the utility of HORNET by determining multiple heterogeneous structures of RNase P RNA and the HIV-1 Rev response element (RRE) RNA. Thus, our method addresses one of the major challenges in determining heterogeneous structures of large and flexible RNA molecules, and contributes to the fundamental understanding of RNA structural biology.

 A central question in neuroscience is how synaptic plasticity shapes the feature selectivity of neurons in behaving animals1. Hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons display one of the most striking forms of feature selectivity by forming spatially and contextually selective receptive fields called place fields, which serve as a model for studying the synaptic basis of learning and memory. Various forms of synaptic plasticity have been proposed as cellular substrates for the emergence of place fields. However, despite decades of work, our understanding of how synaptic plasticity underlies place-field formation and memory encoding remains limited, largely due to a shortage of tools and technical challenges associated with the visualization of synaptic plasticity at the single-neuron resolution in awake behaving animals. To address this, we developed an all-optical approach to monitor the spatiotemporal tuning and synaptic weight changes of dendritic spines before and after the induction of a place field in single CA1 pyramidal neurons during spatial navigation. We identified a temporally asymmetric synaptic plasticity kernel resulting from bidirectional modifications of synaptic weights around the induction of a place field. Our work identified compartment-specific differences in the magnitude and temporal expression of synaptic plasticity between basal dendrites and oblique dendrites. Our results provide experimental evidence linking synaptic plasticity to the rapid emergence of spatial selectivity in hippocampal neurons, a critical prerequisite for episodic memory.

 The last giant impact on Earth is thought to have formed the Moon1. The timing of this event can be determined by dating the different rocks assumed to have crystallized from the lunar magma ocean (LMO). This has led to a wide range of estimates for the age of the Moon between 4.35 and 4.51 billion years ago (Ga), depending on whether ages for lunar whole-rock samples2–4 or individual zircon grains5–7 are used. Here we argue that the frequent occurrence of approximately 4.35-Ga ages among lunar rocks and a spike in zircon ages at about the same time8 is indicative of a remelting event driven by the Moon’s orbital evolution rather than the original crystallization of the LMO. We show that during passage through the Laplace plane transition9, the Moon experienced sufficient tidal heating and melting to reset the formation ages of most lunar samples, while retaining an earlier frozen-in shape10 and rare, earlier-formed zircons. This paradigm reconciles existing discrepancies in estimates for the crystallization time of the LMO, and permits formation of the Moon within a few tens of million years of Solar System formation, consistent with dynamical models of terrestrial planet formation11. Remelting of the Moon also explains the lower number of lunar impact basins than expected12,13, and allows metal from planetesimals accreted to the Moon after its formation to be removed to the lunar core, explaining the apparent deficit of such materials in the Moon compared with Earth14.

 The demand for the three-dimensional (3D) integration of electronic components is steadily increasing. Despite substantial processing challenges, the through-silicon-via (TSV) technique emerges as the only viable method for integrating single-crystalline device components in a 3D format1,2. Although monolithic 3D (M3D) integration schemes show promise3, the seamless connection of single-crystalline semiconductors without intervening wafers has yet to be demonstrated. This challenge arises from the inherent difficulty of growing single crystals on amorphous or polycrystalline surfaces after the back-end-of-the-line process at low temperatures to preserve the underlying circuitry. Consequently, a practical growth-based solution for M3D of single crystals remains unknown. Here we present a method for growing single-crystalline channel materials, specifically composed of transition metal dichalcogenides, on amorphous and polycrystalline surfaces at temperatures low enough to preserve the underlying electronic components. Building on this developed technique, we demonstrate the seamless monolithic integration of vertical single-crystalline logic transistor arrays. This accomplishment leads to the development of unprecedented vertical complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) arrays composed of grown single-crystalline channels. Ultimately, this achievement provides opportunities for M3D integration of various electronic hardware in the form of single crystals.

 Four, eight or twenty C3 symmetric protein trimers can be arranged with tetrahedral, octahedral or icosahedral point group symmetry to generate closed cage-like structures1,2.

 Recent observations have found a large number of supermassive black holes already in place in the first few hundred million years after the Big Bang, many of which seem to be overmassive relative to their host galaxy stellar mass when compared with local relation1–9. Several different models have been proposed to explain these findings, ranging from heavy seeds to light seeds experiencing bursts of high accretion rate10–16. Yet, current datasets are unable to differentiate between these various scenarios. Here we report the detection, from the JADES survey, of broad Hα emission in a galaxy at z = 6.68, which traces a black hole with a mass of about 4 × 108M⊙ and accreting at a rate of only 0.02 times the Eddington limit. The black hole to host galaxy stellar mass ratio is about 0.4—that is, about 1,000 times above the local relation—whereas the system is closer to the local relations in terms of dynamical mass and velocity dispersion of the host galaxy. This object is most likely an indication of a much larger population of dormant black holes around the epoch of reionization. Its properties are consistent with scenarios in which short bursts of super-Eddington accretion have resulted in black hole overgrowth and massive gas expulsion from the accretion disk; in between bursts, black holes spend most of their life in a dormant state.

Here the authors compare expression profiles between different human inflammatory skin diseases and identify gene modules such as cytokines or inflammatory mediators and a molecular map to assist in diagnosis and treatment. 
 Previous advances have identified immune pathways associated with inflammatory skin diseases, leading to the development of targeted therapies. However, there is a lack of molecular approaches that delineate these pathways at the individual patient level for personalized diagnostic and therapeutic guidance. Here, we conduct a cross-comparison of expression profiles from multiple inflammatory skin diseases to identify gene modules defining relevant immune pathways. Seven modules are identified, representing key immune pathways: Th17, Th2, Th1, Type I IFNs, neutrophilic, macrophagic, and eosinophilic. These modules allow the development of a molecular map with high diagnostic efficacy for inflammatory skin diseases and clinico-pathologically undetermined cases. Aligning dominant modules with treatment targets offers a rational framework for treatment selection, improving response rates in both treatment-naïve patients and non-responders to targeted therapies. Overall, our approach offers precision medicine for inflammatory skin diseases, utilizing transcriptional modules to support diagnosis and guide personalized treatment selection.

 Affinity chromatography is the method of choice for the rapid purification of proteins from cell extracts or culture supernatants. Here, we present the light-responsive Azo-tag, a short peptide comprising p-(phenylazo)-L-phenylalanine (Pap), whose side chain can be switched from its trans-ground state to the metastable cis-configuration by irradiation with mild UV light. Since only trans-Pap shows strong affinity to α-cyclodextrin (α-CD), a protein exhibiting the Azo-tag selectively binds to an α-CD chromatography matrix under daylight or in the dark but elutes quickly under physiological buffer flow when illuminating the column at 355 nm. We demonstrate the light-controlled single-step purification – termed Excitography – of diverse proteins, including enzymes and antibody fragments, without necessitating competing agents or harsh buffer conditions as normally applied. While affinity chromatography has so far been governed by chemical interactions, introducing control by electromagnetic radiation as a physical principle adds another dimension to this widely applied separation technique.

 Phase stability, and the limits thereof, are a central concern of materials thermodynamics. However, the temperature limits of equilibrium liquid stability in chemical systems have only been widely characterized under constant (typically atmospheric) pressure conditions, whereunder these limits are represented by the eutectic. At higher pressures, the eutectic will shift in both temperature and chemical composition, opening a wide thermodynamic parameter space over which the absolute limit of liquid stability, i.e., the limit under arbitrary values of the thermodynamic forces at play (here pressure and concentration), might exist. In this work, we use isochoric freezing and melting to measure this absolute limit for the first time in several binary aqueous brines, and nodding to the etymology of “eutectic”, we name it the “cenotectic” (from Greek “κοινός-τῆξῐς”, meaning “universal-melt”). We discuss the implications of our findings on ocean worlds within our solar system and cold ocean exoplanets; estimate thermodynamic limits on ice crust thickness and final ocean depth (of the cenotectic or “endgame” ocean) using measured cenotectic pressures; and finally provide a generalized thermodynamic perspective on (and definition for) this fundamental thermodynamic invariant point.

The authors here elucidate cryo-EM structures of CB1 bound to peripherally restricted inhibitors to explain these drugs’ molecular mechanism of action. 
 The cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1R) regulates synaptic transmission in the central nervous system, but also has important roles in the peripheral organs controlling cellular metabolism. While earlier generations of brain penetrant CB1R antagonists advanced to the clinic for their effective treatment of obesity, such molecules were ultimately shown to exhibit negative effects on central reward pathways that thwarted their further therapeutic development. The peripherally restricted CB1R inverse agonists MRI-1867 and MRI-1891 represent a new generation of compounds that retain the metabolic benefits of CB1R inhibitors while sparing the negative psychiatric effects. To understand the mechanism of binding and inhibition of CB1R by peripherally restricted antagonists, we developed a nanobody/fusion protein strategy for high-resolution cryo-EM structure determination of the GPCR inactive state, and used this method to determine structures of CB1R bound to either MRI-1867 or MRI-1891. These structures reveal how these compounds retain high affinity and specificity for CB1R’s hydrophobic orthosteric site despite incorporating polar functionalities that lead to peripheral restriction. Further, the structure of the MRI-1891 complex along with accompanying molecular dynamics simulations shows how differential engagement with transmembrane helices and the proximal N-terminus can propagate through the receptor to contribute to biased inhibition of β-arrestin signaling. Peripherally restricted CB1 inhibitors retain the weight loss benefits of this drug class while sparing the negative psychiatric side effects.

Here, authors present a simple method for creating pseudosymmetric hetero-oligomers from input symmetrical proteins. 
 Pseudosymmetric hetero-oligomers with three or more unique subunits with overall structural (but not sequence) symmetry play key roles in biology, and systematic approaches for generating such proteins de novo would provide new routes to controlling cell signaling and designing complex protein materials. However, the de novo design of protein hetero-oligomers with three or more distinct chains with nearly identical structures is a challenging unsolved problem because it requires the accurate design of multiple protein-protein interfaces simultaneously. Here, we describe a divide-and-conquer approach that breaks the multiple-interface design challenge into a set of more tractable symmetric single-interface redesign tasks, followed by structural recombination of the validated homo-oligomers into pseudosymmetric hetero-oligomers. Starting from de novo designed circular homo-oligomers composed of 9 or 24 tandemly repeated units, we redesigned the inter-subunit interfaces to generate 19 new homo-oligomers and structurally recombined them to make 24 new hetero-oligomers, including ABC heterotrimers, A2B2 heterotetramers, and A3B3 and A2B2C2 heterohexamers which assemble with high structural specificity. The symmetric homo-oligomers and pseudosymmetric hetero-oligomers generated for each system have identical or nearly identical backbones, and hence are ideal building blocks for generating and functionalizing larger symmetric and pseudosymmetric assemblies.

Here, the authors identify the key role of collagen signaling and ECM stiffness in regulating stem cell multipotency in glandular epithelia. 
 Glandular epithelia, including mammary gland (MG) and prostate, are composed of luminal and basal cells. During embryonic development, glandular epithelia arise from multipotent stem cells (SCs) that are replaced after birth by unipotent basal and unipotent luminal SCs. Different conditions, such as basal cell transplantation, luminal cell ablation, and oncogene expression can reinduce adult basal SC (BaSCs) multipotency in different glandular epithelia. The mechanisms regulating the reactivation of multipotency are incompletely understood. Here, we have found that Collagen I expression is commonly upregulated in BaSCs across the different multipotent conditions. Increasing collagen concentration or stiffness of the extracellular matrix (ECM) promotes BaSC multipotency in MG and prostate organoids. Single cell RNA-seq of MG organoids in stiff conditions have uncovered the importance of β1 integrin/FAK/AP-1 axis in the regulation of BaSC multipotency.

 The three-runway system expansion project of the Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA) began with the land reclamation to the north of its original runway. To facilitate quick stabilization, the Deep Cement Mixing (DCM) in this project was featured as the novel reclamation method firstly applied in Hong Kong. Understanding ground deformation and underground consolidation is crucial for subsequent soil improvement, civil construction, and future planning at the new platform. Synthetic Aperture Radar Interferometry (InSAR) is used to investigate the spatiotemporal characteristics of land deformation following the completion of the third runway pavement. A combined strategy of persistent scatterer (PS) and distributed scatterer (DS) interferometry was implemented to address low radar coherence at the site. The new reclamation is subject to varying degrees of land subsidence, with a maximum monitored sinking rate to be ∼150 mm/year during September 2021 and October 2023. Whereas the 3rd runway was urgently transformed to operation, spatial details of consolidation status of this new land were not yet evaluated. We applied the Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to identify the underlying sources leading to the measured deformation from InSAR. Three distinct sources have been unveiled, including an exponential decay signal (a quick compaction subsidence of surficial materials), a linear signal (a continuous subsiding from marine deposits) and a periodic signal (thermal effects correlated with buildings and bridges). Notably, the linear deformation component is mainly located in areas with prefabricated vertical drains (PVD), which is strongly correlating with the current monitored subsidence pattern. We incorporated the Terzaghi consolidation theory to further characterize InSAR displacement and estimate the subsidence decay property, consolidation time, ultimate primary settlement and consolidation degree at the 3rd runway, with unprecedented spatial details. Our results indicate the DCM method achieves geological stability more rapidly than the PVD method, with a time advantage of approximately 0.08–1.39 years. Meanwhile, DCM can effectively control the primary settlement to 29 % - 83 % of the PVD method. This research benefits our understanding of the consolidation process at the 3rd runway and offer reliable and detailed data of underground properties. This facilitates more accurate planning of follow-up reinforcement measures at specific locations if needed, which also serves as a valuable reference for future reclamation practices in Hong Kong, particularly using the DCM method."

 Hyperspectral image (HSI) classification based on deep learning has demonstrated promising performance. In general, using patch-wise samples helps to extract the spatial relationship between pixels and local contextual information. However, the presence of background or other category information in an image patch that is inconsistent with the central target category has a negative effect on classification. To solve this issue, a patch confidence-enhanced transformer (PCET) approach for HSI classification is proposed. To be specific, we design a patch quality assessment (PQA) branch model to evaluate the input patches during training process, which effectively filters out the intrusive non-central pixels. The output confidence of the branch model serves as a quantitative indicator of the contribution degree of the input patch to the overall training efficacy, which is subsequently weighted in the loss function, thereby endowing the model with the capability to dynamically adjust its learning focus based on the qualitative of the inputs. Second, a spectral–spatial multi-feature fusion (SSMF) module is devised to procure scores of representative information simultaneously and fully exploit the potential of multi-scale feature HSI data. Finally, to enhance feature discrimination, global context is efficiently modeled using the efficient additive attention transformer (EA2T) module, which streamlines the attention process and allows the model to learn efficient and robust global representations for accurate classification of the central pixel. A series of experimental results executed on real HSI datasets have substantiated that the proposed PCET can achieve outstanding performance, even when only 10 samples per category are used for training."

 Northern ecosystems, encompassing boreal forests, tundra, and permafrost areas, are increasingly affected by the amplified impacts of climate change. These ecosystems play a crucial role in determining the global carbon budget. To improve our understanding of carbon uptake in these regions, we evaluate the effectiveness of employing the physically-based Plant Phenology Index (PPI) to estimate gross primary productivity across ten different ecosystems. Based on eddy-covariance measurements from 65 sites, the vegetation index (VI)-driven GPP models (six different algorithms) are calibrated and validated. Our findings highlight that the Michaelis–Menten algorithm has the best performance and PPI is superior to the other five VIs, including NDVI, NIRv, EVI-2, NDPI, and NDGI, at predicting gross primary productivity (GPP) rates on a weekly scale (with an average R2 of 0.64 and RMSE of 1.70 g C m−2 d−1), regardless of short-term environmental constraints on photosynthesis. Through our scaled-up analysis, we estimate the annual GPP of the vast 37 million km2 study region to be around 22 Pg C yr−1, aligning with other recently developed products such as GOSIF-GPP, FluxSat-GPP, and FLUXCOM-X GPP. Derived from a climate-independent approach, the PPI-GPP product offers distinct advantages in exploring relationships between climate variables and terrestrial ecosystem productivity and phenology. Furthermore, this product holds significant value for assessing forestry and agricultural production in northern regions and for benchmarking terrestrial biosphere models and Earth system models."

 Glacial lakes (GLs), which serve as natural reservoirs, are also prospective sources of risk, and their risk levels are continuously increasing as a result of global climate warming. Nevertheless, GLs are situated in mountainous and valley regions, which are distinguished by their complex terrain and unpredictable weather conditions. This leads to restricted availability of optical imagery as a consequence of the frequent cloud cover. Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), however, encounters issues with geometric distortion. This paper introduces an unsupervised method based on geometric distortion detection (without orbit state information) and historical positioning using dual-orbit SAR imagery to research GL extraction effectively. This method detects low-quality pixels from dual-orbit SAR imagery through geometric distortion. It extracts GLs using a majority voting integration of unsupervised classification algorithms constrained by historical GL center points. The Southeastern Tibetan Plateau (SETP) was chosen as a representative region for the study, and experiments were conducted from July to August 2018 using dual-orbit Sentinel-1 imagery. A total of 600 refined samples were used for comparative verification. The results demonstrate that this method is capable of reliably identifying the active and passive geometric distortions in SAR imagery. The fusion of dual-orbit SAR based on geometric distortion can effectively enhance the classification performance of remote sensing imagery and achieve the acquisition of GL water storage area during the flood season. The geometric distortion rate was reduced from 29.9% to 7.9% after fusion correction, and the accuracy, recall rate, precision, Intersection over Union (IoU), and F1-Score were 0.989, 0.900, 0.908, 0.825, and 0.904, respectively.

 The Canopy Live Fuel Moisture Content (LFMC) is a pivotal factor in wildfire risk assessment within the fire triangle model, representing the ratio of canopy moisture content to its dry weight. Against the backdrop of degraded Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) performance and the underutilization of Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) in LFMC inversion, this study harnessed the coupled radiative transfer models (RTMs) to probe the spectral sensitivity of the VIIRS to LFMC and pinpoint the optimal band combination for LFMC inversion. To tackle the challenge of ill-posed inversion, we leveraged the correlation coefficient matrix to mitigate erroneous combinations of free parameters in the construction of the lookup table. Results showcase that VIIRS-based LFMC inversion yields marginally superior accuracy (R2= 0.57, R2= 0.32) for both grassland and forest types, with VIIRS-based inversion demonstrating a lower relative root mean square error (rRMSE = 5.84%), compared to results from the MODIS. By scrutinizing LFMC trends alongside precipitation (PP) data in four forest fires spanning from 2019 to 2022 in southwest China, varied degrees of LFMC decrease preceding fire outbreaks. Those results substantiated the validity of the proposed method for wildfire warning. Consequently, our study asserts the reliability of VIIRS in LFMC inversion, positioning it as a viable substitute and extension of MODIS.

 The influence of microphysical processes on surface wind speeds is primarily indirect, primarily occurring through downdraft cooling and latent heat variations. The Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model was adopted in this study to simulate a squall line that occurred in South China from May 6 to 7, 2023, during which the strongest observed surface wind reached 40.1 m s−1. This study analyzed the impact of microphysical processes on the strong surface winds of the squall line. The results showed that all four microphysics schemes—Thompson, Thompson aerosol-aware (Thompson-A), Morrison, and WSM6—could reproduce the strong winds of the squall line. The Thompson scheme was best suited for simulating the extremely high winds associated with the squall line process selected for this experiment. This scheme generated the strongest winds, largely owing to a concentrated precipitation area that produced strong negative buoyancy in localized regions. This effect was further intensified by high rates of rain evaporation and precipitation particle drag, which reduced downdraft interference and concentrated strong winds in specific areas. Additionally, the smaller raindrop sizes in both the Thompson and Thompson-A schemes enhanced evaporation, increased cooling, and strengthened downdrafts. However, the Thompson scheme achieved greater wind intensities than the Thompson-A scheme because of higher localized evaporation rates and a more focused precipitation distribution. In contrast, the Morrison and WSM6 schemes resulted in more dispersed cooling effects and weaker surface winds owing to broader evaporation areas and increased downdraft interference. However, in the Thompson-A scheme, the actual evaporation was somewhat weaker, likely influenced by the environmental temperature, which, along with the broader precipitation distribution, resulted in weaker surface winds than in the Thompson scheme. The Morrison scheme showed interference among downdrafts as they spread at the surface, leading to weaker surface winds. In the WSM6 scheme, a wider evaporation region and multiple negative buoyancy centers dispersed the effects of negative buoyancy because of broad precipitation and evaporation regions, further weakening the surface winds."

NDI1 is a yeast NADH dehydrogenase enzyme that complements the loss of mammalian mitochondrial complex I electron transport function and is insensitive to pharmacologic mitochondrial complex I inhibitors including metformin. We demonstrate that NDI1 expression attenuates metformin’s ability to lower blood glucose levels under standard chow and high-fat diet conditions.

M1 also encodes a subcomponent of muscle activity evoked by these afferent activities, corresponding to spinal reflexes. Furthermore, selective disruption of the afferent pathway specifically reduced this subcomponent of muscle activity, suggesting that M1 output drives muscle activity not only through direct descending pathways but also through the “transafferent” pathway composed of descending plus subsequent spinal reflex pathways.

In addition, we demonstrate that disrupting CIN pauses via continuous optogenetic stimulation reversibly impairs the updating of goal-directed behaviors. Overall, we demonstrate that CIN burst firing, which increases ACh release, promotes extinction learning, aiding the extinguishment of learned behaviors.

Now, there are no mutation-agnostic approaches to treat RP. Here, we utilized a single adeno-associated virus (AAV)–based CRISPR activation system to activate phosphodiesterase 6B (Pde6b) to mitigate the severe degeneration inPde6anmf363mice. We demonstrate that transcriptional activation ofPde6bcan rescue the loss ofPde6a, with preservation of retinal structure, restoration of electroretinography responses, and improvement of visual function as assessed by optokinetic response and looming-induced escape behaviors. These findings demonstrate the therapeutic potential of a dCasMINI-mediated activation strategy that provides a mutation-independent treatment for retinal degeneration. This study offers a promising therapeutic approach for RP and potentially other forms of genetic diseases."

The subtype GlyRα3 expressed in nociceptive sensory neurons of the spinal dorsal horn is a key regulator of physiological pain perception. Disruption of spinal glycinergic inhibition is associated with chronic inflammatory pain states, making GlyRα3 an attractive target for pain treatment. GlyRα3 activity is modulated by numerous endogenous and exogenous ligands that consequently affect pain sensitization. To understand the mechanism of two such endogenous modulators, Zn2+and protons, we have used cryo–electron microscopy to determine structures of full-length human GlyRα3 in various functional states. Whereas acidic pH reduces peak glycine response, Zn2+displays biphasic modulation in a concentration-dependent manner. Our findings reveal the effector sites and also capture intermediate conformations in the gating cycle. Combined with molecular dynamics simulations and electrophysiology, this work provides important insights into GlyRα3 activation and regulation."

The electron transfer from LaFeO3to LaNiO3and the subsequent rearrangement of the Fe 3d band create an unexpected metallic ground state within the LaFeO3layer, strongly influencing the in-plane transport properties across the superlattice. Moreover, we establish a direct correlation between interfacial charge transfer and in-plane electrical transport properties, providing insights for designing functional oxide heterostructures with emerging properties."

Dealloying, by contrast, acts like a penalty: a corrosive counteracting process of selectively removing elements from alloys or compounds, degrading their structural integrity over time. We show that when these two opposite metallurgical processes meet in a reactive vapor environment, profound sustainable alloy design opportunities become accessible, enabling bulk nanostructured porous alloys directly from oxides, with zero carbon footprint. We introduce thermodynamically well-grounded treasure maps that turn the intuitive opposition between alloying and dealloying into harmony, facilitating a quantitative approach to navigate synthesis in such an immense design space.

Hep@Gel resembled the barrier function of the EBM regarding surface-confined binding, long-time sequestration, and progressive degradation of IL-1, TGF-β, and PDGF-BB, which robustly inhibited the apoptosis and myofibroblast transition of keratocytes. Animal models of rabbits and nonhuman primates confirmed that Hep@Gel effectively limited the influx of inflammatory and fibrotic cytokines from the epithelium into the stroma to down-regulate the wound healing cascade, contributing to better vision quality with 73% reduced fibrosis.

We focused on the model's ability to simulate mid-level clouds in summer and winter. By combining observational data from two different field campaigns, we show that an increase in the horizontal resolution and a more advanced cloud microphysics scheme is strongly beneficial for cloud representation. 
 The rise in computational power in recent years has enabled research and national weather services to conduct high-resolution simulations down to the kilometric (Δx=𝒪(1 km)) and even to hectometric (Δx=𝒪(100 m)) scales for both weather and climate applications. We investigate with the state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model ICON how mid-level clouds are represented on a mesh size of 1 km and 65 m, respectively, and for two bulk microphysics schemes, namely one-moment and two-moment cloud microphysics. For this analysis, we leverage the abundant observational data from two independent field campaigns in Switzerland (CLOUDLAB; hilly terrain) and Austria (CROSSINN; complex terrain). With four case studies, we show that while the temperature fields around the campaign sites are well represented in both mesh sizes, the 65 m resolution simulates a more realistic vertical velocity structure that is beneficial for cloud formation. Therefore, the largest differences for the representation of clouds lie in the two mesh sizes. The 1 km simulation in hilly terrain does not capture the observed clouds in both cloud microphysics schemes. Here, the higher resolution of the vertical velocities in the 65 m proves to be crucial for representing the investigated cloud types, and the two-moment microphysics scheme in general performs better with respect to the cloud characteristics because it considers variations in cloud droplet and ice crystal number concentrations. In complex terrain, the differences between the mesh sizes and the cloud microphysics schemes are surprisingly small, but the 65 m simulations with two-moment cloud microphysics show the most realistic cloud representation."

 Permafrost landscapes in the Arctic are highly vulnerable to warming, with rapid changes underway. High-resolution remote sensing, especially aerial datasets, offers valuable insights into current permafrost characteristics and thaw dynamics. Here, we present a new dataset of very high resolution orthomosaics, point clouds, and digital surface models that we acquired over permafrost landscapes in northwestern Canada and northern and northwestern Alaska for the purpose of better understanding the impacts of climate change on permafrost landscapes. The imagery was collected with the Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS) during aerial campaigns conducted by the Alfred Wegener Institute in the summers of 2018, 2019, and 2021. The MACS was specifically developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) for operation under challenging light conditions in polar environments. It features cameras in the optical and the near-infrared wavelengths with up to a 16 MP resolution. We processed the images to four-band (blue–green–red–near-infrared) orthomosaics and digital surface models with spatial resolutions of 7 to 20 cm as well as 3D point clouds with point densities of up to 41 points m−2. The dataset collection features 102 subprojects from 35 target regions (1.4–161.1 km2 in size). Project sizes range from 4.8 to 336 GB. In total, 3.17 TB were published. The horizontal precision of the datasets is in the range of 1–2 px and vertical precision is better than 0.10 m. The datasets are not radiometrically calibrated. Overall, these very high resolution images and point clouds provide significant opportunities for mapping permafrost landforms and generating detailed training datasets for machine learning, can serve as a baseline for change detection for thermokarst and thermo-erosion processes, and help with upscaling of field measurements to lower-resolution satellite observations.

By sampling both open ocean and island areas, these data can show how plankton size, diversity and abundance change with different environments. We also highlight the usefulness of high-speed plankton sampling when it is not possible to slow the boat during sailing, and its value in extending sampling coverage and frequency. 
 This paper presents the quantitative imaging datasets collected during the Tara Pacific Expedition (2016–2018) on the schooner Tara. The datasets cover a wide range of plankton sizes, from micro-phytoplankton > 20 μm to meso-zooplankton of a few cm, as well as non-living particles such as plastic and detrital particles. It consists of surface samples collected across the North and South Pacific Ocean from open ocean stations (a total of 357 samples) and from stations located in coastal waters, lagoons or reefs of 32 Pacific islands (a total of 228 samples). As this expedition involved long distances and long sailing times, we designed two sampling systems to collect plankton while sailing at speeds up to 9 knots. To sample microplankton, surface water was pumped onboard using a customised pumping system and filtered through a 20 µm mesh size plankton net (here after Deck-Net (DN). A High Speed Net (HSN; 330 μm mesh size) was developed to sample the mesoplankton. In addition, a Manta net (330 µm) was also used when possible, to collect mesoplankton and plastics simultaneously. We could not deploy these nets in reef and lagoon stations of islands. Instead, two Bongo nets (20 µm) attached to an underwater scooter were used to sample microplankton. Microplankton (20–200 μm) from the DN and Bongo nets was imaged directly on-board Tara using the FlowCam (Fluid imaging, Inc.) while the mesoplankton (> 200 μm) from the HSN and Manta nets was analyzed in the laboratory with the ZooScan system. Organisms and other particles were taxonomically and morphologically classified using the web application EcoTaxa automatic sorting tools, followed by taxonomic expert validation or correction. More than 300 different taxonomic and morphological groups were identified. The datasets include the metadata with the raw data from which morphological traits such as size (ESD) and biovolume have been calculated for each particle, as well as a number of quantitative descriptors of the surface plankton communities. These include abundance, biovolumes, Shannon diversity index and normalised biovolume size spectra, allowing the study of their structures (e.g. taxonomic, functional, size structure, trophic structure, etc.) according to a wide range of environmental parameters at the basin scale. In addition to describing and presenting the datasets, the complementary aim of this paper is to investigate and quantify the potential sampling biases associated with the two high speed sampling systems and the different net types, in order to improve further ecological interpretations."

 Organic matter (OM) composition plays a central role in microbial respiration of dissolved organic matter and subsequent biogeochemical reactions. Here, a direct connection of organic matter chemistry and thermodynamics to reactive transport simulators has been achieved through the newly developed Lambda-PFLOTRAN workflow tool that succinctly incorporates carbon chemistry data generated from Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) into reaction networks to simulate organic matter degradation and the resulting biogeochemistry. Lambda-PFLOTRAN is a Python-based workflow, executed through a Jupyter notebook interface, that digests raw FTICR-MS data, develops a representative reaction network based on substrate-explicit thermodynamic modeling (also termed lambda modeling due to its key thermodynamic parameter λ used therein), and completes a biogeochemical simulation with the open source, reactive flow and transport code PFLOTRAN. The workflow consists of the following five steps: configuration, thermodynamic (lambda) analysis, sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, and simulation output and visualization. Two test cases are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the Lambda-PFLOTRAN workflow. The first test case uses laboratory incubation data of temporal oxygen depletion to fit lambda parameters (i.e., maximum utilization rate and microbial carrying capacity). A slightly more complex second test case fits multiple lambda formulation and soil organic matter release parameters to temporal greenhouse gas generation measured during a soil incubation.

The configuration is validated for the period 2000–2020 and improves significant errors in a low-resolution model. Oceanic properties are well represented. Patterns of freshwater associated with the Amazon River are well captured, and the mean flows of ocean waters across multiple passages in the Caribbean Sea agree with observations. 
 A new Community Earth System Model/Modular Ocean Model 6 (CESM/MOM6) ocean-only regional 1/12° configuration of the Caribbean Sea is presented and validated. The model configuration was developed as a response to the rising need for high-resolution models for climate impact applications. The configuration is validated for the period covering 2000–2020 against ocean reanalysis and a suite of observation-based datasets. Particular emphasis is paid to the configuration's ability to represent the dynamical regime and properties of the region across sub-seasonal, seasonal, and inter-annual timescales. Near-surface fields of temperature, salinity, and sea surface height are well represented. In particular, the seasonal cycle of sea surface salinity and the spatial pattern of the low salinity associated with the Amazon and Orinoco river plumes is well captured. Surface speeds compare favorably against reanalysis and show that the mean flows within the Caribbean Sea (CS) are well represented. The model reproduces known pathways and timing for river plume waters intruding the region. The seasonal cycle of the mixed-layer depth is also well represented, with biases of <3 m when comparing to ocean reanalysis. The vertical structure and stratification across the water column is represented favorably against ship-based observations, with the largest simulated biases in the near-surface water mass and the sub-surface salinity maximum associated with the sub-tropical underwater mass. The temperature and salinity variability in the vertical structure is well represented in the model solution. We show that mean ocean mass transport across the multiple passages in the eastern Caribbean Sea compares favorably to observation-based estimates, but the model exhibits smaller variability and underestimates the mean Yucatán Channel transport when compared to observations and ocean reanalysis estimates. Furthermore, a brief comparison against a 1° CESM global ocean configuration shows that the higher-resolution regional model better represents the extent and seasonality of the Amazon River plume and hence better represents near-surface salinity and mixed-layer depth in the CS. Overall, the regional model reproduces the processes within the Caribbean Sea to a good degree and opens the possibility of regional ocean climate studies in support of decision-making within CESM."

It uniquely considers snow grain shape flexibly, based on recent insights showing that snow does not behave as a collection of ice spheres but instead as a random medium. TARTES is user-friendly yet performs comparably to more complex models. 
 The Two-streAm Radiative TransfEr in Snow (TARTES) model computes the spectral albedo and the profiles of spectral absorption, irradiance, and actinic fluxes for a multi-layer plane-parallel snowpack. Each snow layer is characterized by its specific surface area, density, and impurity content, in addition to shape parameters. In the landscape of snow optical numerical models, TARTES distinguishes itself by taking into account different shapes of the particles through two shape parameters, namely the absorption enhancement parameter B and the asymmetry factor g. This is of primary importance as recent studies working at the microstructure level have demonstrated that snow does not behave as a collection of equivalent ice spheres, a representation widely used in other models. Instead, B and g take specific values that do not correspond to any simple geometrical shape, which leads to the concept of the “optical shape of snow”. Apart from this specificity, TARTES combines well-established radiative transfer principles to compute the scattering and absorption coefficients of pure or polluted snow, as well as the δ-Eddington two-stream approximation to solve the multi-layer radiative transfer equation. The model is implemented in Python, but conducting TARTES simulations is also possible without any programming through the SnowTARTES web application, making it very accessible to non-experts and for teaching purposes. Here, after describing the theoretical and technical details of the model, we illustrate its main capabilities and present some comparisons with other common snow radiative transfer models (AART, DISORT-Mie, SNICAR-ADv3) as a validation procedure. Overall the agreement on the spectral albedo, when in compatible conditions (i.e., with spheres), is usually within 0.02 and is better in the visible and near-infrared range compared to longer wavelengths."

We coupled a recently validated boundary layer model with a building effect model within an NWP. Validation has been performed under idealized atmospheric conditions by benchmarking the coupled model with a fine-scale numerical model. Subsequently, the improvements and limitations are investigated aided by observations in real case simulations. 
 Understanding and modeling the turbulent transport of surface layer fluxes plays a critical role in a numerical weather forecasting model. The presence of heterogeneous surface obstacles (buildings) that have dimensions comparable to the model vertical resolution requires further complexity and design in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme. In this study, we develop the numerical method to couple one of the recently validated PBL schemes, TKE-ACM2, with the multi-layer Building Effect Parameterization (BEP) model in WRF. Subsequently, the performance of TKE-ACM2+BEP has been examined under idealized convective atmospheric conditions with a simplified building layout. Furthermore, its reproducibility is benchmarked with one of the state-of-the-art large-eddy simulation models, PALM, which can explicitly resolve the building aerodynamics. The result indicates that TKE-ACM2+BEP outperforms the other operational PBL scheme (Boulac) coupled with BEP by reducing the bias in both the potential temperature (θ) and wind speed (u). Following this, real case simulations are conducted for a highly urbanized domain, i.e., the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in China. The high-resolution wind speed LiDAR observations suggest that TKE-ACM2+BEP can mitigate the overestimation in the lower part of the boundary layer compared to the Bulk method at a LiDAR site located in a densely built environment. In addition, the surface temperature and relative humidity can be improved in TKE-ACM2+BEP at surface stations in urbanized areas compared to TKE-ACM2 without BEP. However, it is revealed that BEP may not always imply a better reproduction of surface wind speed as it could exert excessive aerodynamic drag."

 Rice cultivation faces multiple challenges of rising food demand while increasing water scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions, intensifying the tension of the food-water-climate nexus. Process-based modeling of the nexus is pivotal for developing effective measures to address these challenges. However, current models struggle to simulate their complex relationships under different water management schemes, primarily due to inadequate representation of critical physiological effects and the absence of efficient spatially explicit modeling strategies. Here, we propose an advancing framework that addresses these problems by integrating a process-based soil-crop model with vital physiological effects, a novel method for model upscaling, and the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm at a parallel computing platform. Applying the framework accounted for 52 %, 60 %, 37 %, and 94 % of the experimentally observed variations in rice yield, irrigation water use, and methane and nitrous oxide emissions in response to irrigation schemes. Compared with the origin model using traditional parameter upscaling methods, the advancing framework significantly reduced simulation errors by 35 %−85 %. Moreover, it well reproduced the multivariable synergies and tradeoffs observed in China’s rice fields and identified additional 18 % areas feasible for irrigation optimization, along with an additional 11 % and 14 % reduction potentials of water use and methane emissions, without compromising production. Over 90 % of the potentials could be realized at the cost of 4 % less yield increase and 25 % higher nitrous oxide emissions under multiple objectives. Overall, this study provides a valuable tool for multi-objective optimization of rice irrigation schemes. The advancing framework also has implications for other process-based modelling improvements efforts."

Developing an OWF in the central North Sea requires more copper and aluminum due to large distances to shore and thus incurs higher embodied CO2-eq per MWh. These areas also overlap with several protected areas and thus remain the least favorable for OWE development. The future emergent OWE technological developments for 2040 such as the installation of larger turbines with an extended lifetime alone could, on average, lead to reductions of ∼0.06 kg in steel demand (∼35%), ∼ 0.15 g in copper demand (∼31%), and ∼10.97 kg of CO2-eq (∼41%) per MWh produced. Future OWFs incorporating these technological developments, when placed in the most suitable locations, have the potential to substantially lower OWF environmental impacts across the full turbine life cycle."

However, its widespread application has been limited by the high energy costs involved. To facilitate the commercialization of BDI technology, it is crucial to develop innovative integrated BDI systems that utilize sustainable energy sources and assess their practical performance for desalination of natural seawater. In this study, we construct the first photovoltaic-driven battery deionization system, termed PV-BDI, capable of continuously and simultaneously removing multiple ions from natural seawater. The system successfully produced freshwater with a total dissolved solids (TDS) level of 704 mg L–1, meeting the maximum acceptable TDS limits recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) for drinking water standards, which specify a maximum TDS limit of 1000 mg L–1. The mass-specific energy consumption for salt removal to obtain drinking water from natural seawater via this system has been reduced to 0.036 kW·h kg–1, surpassing the performance of other state-of-the-art PV-driven electrochemical-based desalination technologies such as electrodialysis and capacitive deionization (0.068–2.100 kW·h kg–1). This work presents a pioneering proof-of-concept integrated PV-BDI system and demonstrates its practical performance for desalinating natural seawater, thereby laying the foundation for expanding BDI systems in the near future for environmentally friendly and sustainable industrial-scale seawater desalination."

Demand for oilseed-based biofuels is associated with particularly complex market and supply chain dynamics, which must be considered. Using the global partial equilibrium model GLOBIOM, this study explores the uncertainty in market-mediated impacts and ILUC-related emissions from increasing demand for soybean biodiesel in the United States in the period 2020–2050. A one-at-a-time (OAT) analysis and a Monte Carlo (MC) analysis are performed to assess the sensitivity of modeled ILUC-GHG emissions intensities (gCO2e/MJ) to varying key economic and biophysical model parameters. Additionally, the influence of the approach on the simulation of future ILUC effects is explored using two alternative ILUC-GHG metrics: a comparative-static approach for 2030 and a recursive-dynamic approach using model outputs through 2050. We find that projected ILUC-GHG values largely vary based on which vegetable oils replace diverted soybean oil, market responses to coproducts, and the carbon content of land converted for agricultural use. These are all, in turn, subject to decision uncertainty through the choice of the modeling approach and the time horizon considered for each ILUC-GHG metric. Given the longer simulation period, ILUC-GHG emission uncertainty ranges increase under the recursive-dynamic approach (42.4 ± 25.9 gCO2e/MJ) compared to the comparative-static approach (40.8 ± 20.5 gCO2e/MJ). The combination of MC analysis with other techniques such as Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is powerful for understanding model behavior and clarifying the sensitivity of market responses, ILUC, and associated GHG emissions to specific model parameters when simulated with global economic models. The BART reveals that biophysical parameters generate more linear ILUC-GHG responses to changes in assumed parameter values while changes in economic parameters lead to more nonlinear ILUC-GHG results as multiple effects at the interplay of food, feed, and fuel uses overlap. The choice of the recursive-dynamic metric allows capturing the longer-term evolution of ILUC while generating additional uncertainties derived from the baseline definition."

The land-ocean aquatic continuum (LOAC) has received large quantities of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from various sources, which is an ideal interface for PE research. Here, we investigated the PE process by utilizing such a coastal environment to explore the turnover of DOM in the LOAC system. Suwannee River natural organic matter was selected as the background, and various external environmental samples were introduced to track the changes of organic carbon. The PE process together with the variations of DOM sources, compositions, and structures was characterized. Generally, river and estuary environments exhibited a positive PE, while the offshore zone showed a negative effect. Additionally, nutrients, salinity, and DOM composition all contributed to the PE. After the incubation, the feature of carbon sources transferred from terrestrial to autochthonous. The carbonyl and alcohol functional groups significantly decomposed, while the methyl and methylene groups increased and heteroatoms further accelerated the PE process. The data also shows that special parameters and molecular markers can be utilized to track the carbon response to the PE. This research indicates that the change of carbon flux and the imbalance of its budget in aquatic systems could be partially explained from the perspective of the PE."

However, the kinetics of this process and the impact of environmental factors remain unclear. Herein, we investigated U(VI) reduction by chemically reduced nontronite (rNAu-2) in the presence of EDTA and bicarbonate. U(VI) was completely reduced within 192 h by rNAu-2 alone, and higher Fe(II) in rNAu-2 resulted in a higher U(VI) reduction rate. However, the presence of EDTA and NaHCO3 initially inhibited U(VI) reduction by forming stable U(VI)–EDTA/carbonato complexes and thus preventing U(VI) from adsorbing onto the rNAu-2 surface. However, over time, EDTA facilitated the dissolution of rNAu-2, releasing Fe(II) into solution. Released Fe(II) competed with U(VI) to form Fe(II)–EDTA complexes, thus freeing U(VI) from negatively charged U(VI)–EDTA complexes to form positively charged U(VI)–OH complexes, which ultimately promoted U(VI) adsorption and triggered its reduction. In the NaHCO3 system, U(VI) complexed with carbonate to form U(VI)–carbonato complexes, which partially inhibited adsorption to the rNAu-2 surface and subsequent reduction. The reduced U(IV) largely formed uraninite nanoparticles, with a fraction present in the rNAu-2 interlayer.

We employ a novel regional setup for an atmospheric convection‐permitting model alongside the pseudo‐global warming (PGW) approach to address climate change impacts on the weather‐climate system of Africa during a short period of high‐impact weather. Our findings indicate that the AEJ and WAM may intensify in a future warming climate scenario.

Despite extensive theoretical and experimental work to understand the nature of its superconductivity4–29, the requirement of extreme pressure restricts the use of many experimental probes and limits its application potential. Here, we present signatures of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 thin films at ambient pressure, facilitated by the application of epitaxial compressive strain. The onset Tc varies approximately from 26 K to 42 K, with higher Tc values correlating with smaller in-plane lattice constants. We observed the co-existence of other Ruddlesden-Popper phases within the films and dependence of transport behavior with ozone annealing, suggesting that the observed low zero resistance Tc of around 2 K can be attributed to stacking defects, grain boundaries, and oxygen stoichiometry.

 The evolution of the lunar dynamo is essential for deciphering the deep interior structure, thermal history, and surface environment of the Moon1-4. Previous palaeomagnetic investigations on samples returned from the nearside of the Moon have established the general variation of the lunar magnetic field5-7. However, limited spatial and temporal palaeomagnetic constraints leave the evolution of the lunar dynamo ambiguous. The Chang'e-6 mission returned the first farside basalts dated at ca. 2.8 billion years ago (Ga)8,9, offering a unique opportunity to investigate a critical spatiotemporal gap in the evolution of the global lunar dynamo. Here we report palaeointensities (~5–21 μT) recovered from the Chang’e-6 basalts, providing the first constraint on the magnetic field from the lunar farside and a critical anchor within the large gap between 3 and 2 Ga. The new results record a rebound of the field strength after its prior sharp decline around 3.1 Ga, which attests to an active lunar dynamo at ca. 2.8 Ga in the mid-early stage and argues against the suggestion that the lunar dynamo may have remained in a low-energy state after 3 Ga until its demise. The result suggests the lunar dynamo was most likely driven by either a basal magma ocean and/or precession, probably supplemented by other mechanisms such as core crystallisation."

 Discrete protein assemblies ranging from hundreds of kilodaltons to hundreds of megadaltons in size are a ubiquitous feature of biological systems and perform highly specialized functions1,2. Despite remarkable recent progress in accurately designing new self-assembling proteins, the size and complexity of these assemblies has been limited by a reliance on strict symmetry3. Here, inspired by the pseudosymmetry observed in bacterial microcompartments and viral capsids, we developed a hierarchical computational method for designing large pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials. We computationally designed pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric components and used them to create discrete, cage-like protein assemblies with icosahedral symmetry containing 240, 540 and 960 subunits. At 49, 71 and 96 nm diameter, these nanocages are the largest bounded computationally designed protein assemblies generated to date. More broadly, by moving beyond strict symmetry, our work substantially broadens the variety of self-assembling protein architectures that are accessible through design.

Here, the authors describe a simple and reliable approach for constructing strongly inducible synthetic yeast promoters, which are validated for use in large-scale protein production. 
 Inducible promoters are essential for precise control of target gene expression in synthetic biological systems. However, engineering eukaryotic promoters is often more challenging than engineering prokaryotic promoters due to their greater mechanistic complexity. In this study, we describe a simple and reliable approach for constructing strongly inducible synthetic promoters with minimum leakiness in yeasts. The results indicate that the leakiness of yeast-inducible synthetic promoters is primarily the result of cryptic transcriptional activation of heterologous sequences that may be avoided by appropriate insulation and operator mutagenesis. Our promoter design approach has successfully generated robust, inducible promoters that achieve a > 103-fold induction in reporter gene expression. The utility of these promoters is demonstrated by using them to produce various biologics with titers up to 2 g/L, including antigens designed to raise specific antibodies against a SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant through chicken immunization.

 Bats are presumed reservoirs of diverse coronaviruses (CoVs) including progenitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the evolution and diversification of these coronaviruses remains poorly understood. Here we use a Bayesian statistical framework and a large sequence data set from bat-CoVs (including 589 novel CoV sequences) in China to study their macroevolution, cross-species transmission and dispersal. We find that host-switching occurs more frequently and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha- than beta-CoVs, and is more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus Rhinolophus. Our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance.

Forecast skill diminishes as lead time increases in both DYN and STAT forecasts, with peak accuracy occurring post-northern hemisphere spring predictability barrier and preceding seasons. The DYN forecasts outperform STAT forecasts with a pronounced advantage in forecasts initiated from late boreal winter through spring. The analysis uncovers an asymmetry in predicting the onset of cold and warm ENSO episodes, with warm episode onsets being better forecasted than cold onsets in both DYN and STAT models. The DYN forecasts are found to be valuable for predicting warm and cold ENSO episode onsets at least several months in advance, while STAT forecasts are less informative about ENSO phase transitions. The results indicate that predicting ENSO onset is challenging and that the ability to do so is both model- and event-dependent."

 The seasonal cycle of vertical mixing is crucial for lake ecosystems, yet its future under climate change remains uncertain. While lake stratification shifts have been widely studied, the annual overturning duration changes are less clear. Using sub-daily simulations from a fully coupled numerical Earth system model, we assess phenological changes in stratification and overturning in Northern Hemisphere ice-covered lakes. We find the total stratification duration (comprising both summer and winter phases) is projected to decrease by 0.7, 4.6, and 6.9 days in 2029, 2067, and 2096, respectively, under global temperature increases of 1.5 °C, 3 °C, and 4.5 °C.

 Critical minerals are essential for advancing the energy transition. However, the public’s perception of these minerals and their application is still not well understood. Here, we investigate public awareness and perceptions of critical minerals in the United States, based on a nationally representative survey of 1200 online respondents. While only 38% of respondents stated familiarity with critical minerals, over 80% recognized the importance of minerals in the energy transition. Participants were most supportive of strategies focused on mineral research and improving the environmental impacts of mining, while domestic mining received less support. Regression analysis shows that individuals who perceive mineral criticality based on their importance to clean energy support multiple mineral policies, whereas those concerned about import dependency or shortages prefer domestic mining. Individuals who believe environmental impacts should govern criticality designation oppose domestic mining and support mineral recycling and improving mining’s environmental impacts.

 Deep decarbonization is essential for achieving the Paris Agreement goals, and carbon dioxide removal is required to address residual emissions and achieve net-zero targets. However, the implications of delaying the deployment of removal technologies remain unclear. We quantify how different carbon removal methods and their deployment timing affect achieving net zero emissions by 2050 in the United States. Our findings show that postponing novel technologies until mid-century forces accelerated decarbonization of energy-intensive sectors, reducing residual emissions by at least 12% compared with near-term deployment of carbon dioxide removal. This delay increases transition costs, requiring carbon prices 59–79% higher than with near-term deployment. It also heightens the risk of premature fossil fuel retirement in the electricity sector, leading to 128–220 billion USD losses compared to gradual scale up starting now.

 Perennial grasses are an option to mitigate global warming, increase energy security, and alleviate environmental pressures within agricultural landscapes. Their cultivation alters near-surface temperature in ways that are still largely unclear. Here, a regional climate model with an enhanced representation of perennial grasses shows that converting today’s cropland areas in Europe induces annual mean temperature reductions in summer and autumn (up to –1 °C), which are primarily driven by a later harvest of perennial grasses relative to annual crops. Cultivation of perennial grasses where they deliver stronger biogeophysical cooling can achieve a similar annual mean temperature reduction on half of the land. This cooling can counteract up to 50% of the projected future warming and it is three times larger than what is achieved via carbon emission reductions.

 Middle Triassic paleogeography is essential for the paleoclimate change and ecosystem recovery after the end-Permian mass extinction, but is highly debated in the Paleo-Tethys Ocean and North China Craton, eastern Pangaea. Here we report a detailed provenance fingerprinting dataset from Middle Triassic sediments across the North China Craton, Qinling and Songpan-Ganzi and identify the paleo-uplift in the northern North China Craton as a primary sediment source. We propose that a Middle Triassic transcontinental drainage system flowed from the northern North China Craton through the central Qinling into the eastern Paleo-Tethys Ocean along the gradually descending landform, challenging the suggestion that the North China Craton was a great endorheic basin.

 Accurately predicting truck origin–destination (OD) flows is essential for optimizing logistics systems and promoting coordinated regional development. Existing methods typically assume a monotonic decrease in truck OD flows with increasing geospatial distance, which oversimplifies the complex non-monotonic distribution patterns observed in practice. Moreover, these methods overlook interregional socioeconomic distances and their interaction with geospatial distances, thereby limiting the prediction accuracy and reliability. This study introduces a gravity-inspired model that integrates both geospatial and socioeconomic distances (GSD-DG) to explicitly represent their combined influence on truck OD flows. Specifically, we 1) develop a geospatial distance relation graph using the Weibull function to model the complex spatial distribution patterns of truck OD flows with varying geospatial distances; 2) propose a gravity-inspired representation learning method based on graph attention mechanism to quantify the influence of socioeconomic distance on truck OD flows; and 3) construct a deep gravity model that integrates these distances and their interactions to capture their non-linear relationship with truck OD flows. Extensive experiments on four datasets with varying spatial scale and economic development levels demonstrate that the GSD-DG model improves the robustness and prediction accuracy across diverse spatial distribution patterns, reducing RMSE by 14.2%–85.8% and MSE by 23.5%–92.5% compared to the six baseline models. Incorporating socioeconomic distance and its interaction with geospatial distance further reduces RMSE by 8.5%–36.0%. Additionally, explainable artificial intelligence techniques highlight how these distances affect truck OD flows, providing valuable policy insights for logistics planning and coordinated regional development."

 The indoor map is an indispensable component to visualize human users’ real-time locations and guided routes to find their destinations in large and complex buildings efficiently. The map design in existing mobile indoor navigation systems mostly considers either the user locations or the route segments but seldom considers the adaptation of the base map scale. Due to uneven densities of spatial elements, the complexity of routes, and the diversity of spatial distribution of navigation decision points, the base map information of indoor navigation maps varies greatly. Hence, it is inevitable to cause an inappropriate amount of map information at different locations and routes. Additionally, existing multi-scale representations of indoor maps are limited to certain scales but not adapted to building locations. Users have to adjust the map scales frequently through multiple interactions with the navigation system. In this study, we propose a method that considers the dynamic elements of indoor maps to quantify the map information for scale adaptation. The indoor navigation map information calculation includes both geometry information and spatial distribution information of static base map elements (area elements, POIs) and dynamic route elements (segments, decision points). The total map information is quantified by setting the weights of the two types of elements. An empirical study on indoor navigation map selection was conducted. Results show that the quantified map information using the proposed method can reflect a user-desired map better than the traditionally used scales."

We found that MAVS, through its central intrinsically disordered domain, directly interacted with the 3′ untranslated regions of cellular messenger RNAs. Elimination of RNA by ribonuclease treatment disrupted the MAVS signalosome, including RNA-modulated MAVS interactors that regulate RLR signaling and viral restriction, and inhibited phosphorylation of transcription factors that induce interferons.

The realization of top-performing radiation detectors typically relies on careful crystal selection from broad candidate groups, as residual strain remains unavoidable during the SC growth process, which often leads to the formation of ferroelastic domains with varied orientations. Here, we introduce an in-line tempering strategy to alleviate microstrain and homogenize the domain orientation across methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite SCs. The progressive strain relief during the phase transition in situ, demonstrated by the removal of ferroelastic domain walls, substantially enhances the crystallinity and the optoelectronic properties of the MAPbI3SCs. As a result, the gamma-ray energy spectrum detector leveraging these strain-relaxed SCs achieves an energy resolution of 7.2% at 59.5 keV for a241Am gamma-ray source, and the 25-pixel device performs highly uniformly with concentrated current distribution, which paves the way for its implementation in high-resolution radiation spectroscopy."

We leveraged a unique opportunity to answer this question in a real-world setting: the 2023 referendum for the Swiss climate protection law (CPL), which was supported by a public statement of 252 renowned scientists across disciplines. We conducted a pre-registered, two-wave, quasi-field experiment (npre-vote = 1,622, npost-vote = 891) to test how scientists’ collective support for the law affected public trust in scientists and voting behavior. We found that scientists’ advocacy was associated with greater public trust, particularly among left-leaning individuals; only a minority viewed these scientists as not objective. However, perceptions of scientists’ role in society and policymaking and voting behavior remained largely unaffected when participants were reminded of the CPL advocacy. Although we studied a restrained form of policy advocacy in a somewhat unique setting, our study challenges the widespread assumption that policy advocacy undermines public trust in scientists."

This requires making assumptions on future population trajectories. Although access to modern energy can affect population dynamics, this feedback has not yet been accounted for in demographic models. Access to modern energy leads to fertility declines as it reduces child mortality, improves health, increases women’s access to information, education and employment. In this paper we present a demographic model that endogenizes the effect of increased access to modern energy on population dynamics and estimates the size of this effect on total final energy use by households for the case of Zambia. To do so, we built a microsimulation model to project future population size and composition, accounting for how fertility depends on access to modern energy and education. We used these population projections to then estimate household energy demand of the Zambian population until 2070, under different scenarios. We found that in 2070, while electricity consumption is higher in a universal access scenario compared to a baseline scenario, total energy demand is 29% lower, partly due to a strong decline in the use of inefficient traditional cooking fuels. We also found that reduced population growth due to universal energy access contributes to lowering the energy demand by 56% by 2050, compared to a more limited expansion in energy access, and this contribution increases over time. Although the challenge of achieving universal access to modern energy seems daunting, our results suggest that this could have co-benefits with achieving climate goals. Our study also reveals that accounting for the energy–population dividend in energy models will scale down the currently assumed energy needs to ensure a decent life for all."

In this study, we elucidated the phytoplankton responses during MHWs in the NEP between 1998 and 2022 and revealed contrasting phytoplankton chlorophyll anomalies between the north and south of the Transition Zone Chlorophyll Front (TZCF). Specifically, chlorophyll shows a marked increase north of the TZCF but a decrease south of it, with the most pronounced negative anomalies centered on the TZCF. Additionally, this chlorophyll response exhibits a remarkable seasonality, consistent with the seasonal migration of the TZCF. Weakened subpolar southward Ekman transport, which may have resulted in reduced phytoplankton nutrient supply, is likely to be the major contributor to the negative chlorophyll response in this frontal region. Our results highlight the importance of previously unrecognized spatial and temporal heterogeneity of phytoplankton responses to MHWs in the NEP, which may provide insights for future ecosystem conservation and fisheries management in the NEP under MHWs."

Climate change poses a growing threat to global food and nutrition security, but existing climate risk assessments often overlook the critical roles of both terrestrial and aquatic nutrient-rich foods that are vital for dietary diversity and micronutrient supply. In this study, we introduce an innovative framework that integrates data on future climate extremes, nutrient supply dependencies, and diet-related climate vulnerability. Our comprehensive analysis assesses nutrition-sensitive climate risk to five essential micronutrients across production systems. By mid-century (2041–2060), we estimate that 75% of calcium, 30% of folate, 39% of iron, 68% of vitamin A, and 79% of vitamin B12 produced in primary food products will face frequent climate extremes (at least every other year) globally. Nearly fifty countries are projected to face high domestic climate risk for two or more micronutrients during this period, with ten countries facing high risk across all five. We outline distinct climate risk profiles to offer data-driven entry points into strategies for bolstering the resilience of micronutrient supply chains and advancing progress toward global nutrient targets in the face of a changing climate."

Climate model simulations, in particular, often exhibit systemic biases when compared to observations. These biases may persist in future climate simulations, affecting the results of many climate change impact assessment studies. Empirical quantile mapping (QM) is a widely used method to correct these biases by mapping quantiles between observed and simulated cumulative distribution functions (CDFs). However, empirical QM faces a fundamental challenge when the CDF of future simulations differs from historical simulations, potentially leading to extreme values falling outside the historical CDF range. To address this issue, our study introduces a novel approach to extrapolate future extreme values for bias correction, preserving the rank order of simulated future extremes. By construction, our approach ensures that bias-corrected values are not exaggerated and retain the rank structure of the original simulated data while preserving climate change signals in the bias-corrected outputs. In addition, our approach includes a technique to adjust the wet-day frequency for precipitation by preserving the ratio of wet-day frequency between observations and historical model simulations."

An analysis of the theoretical housing potential of under-occupied dwellings in the European building stock,"The standard response to the shortage of housing across the political spectrum is to build new housing units. From an environmental perspective, there is a need to decarbonise the housing sector as quickly as possible and to reduce land and resource consumption. This contradiction could be resolved by making more efficient use of dwellings that are under-occupied (for example, after children have moved out). In this article, we analyse the theoretical housing potential of under-occupied living space. To this end, we use established occupancy regulations of Swiss cooperatives and municipal housing authorities, where the number of residents must always be at least equal to the number of rooms minus one or minus two. This defines an upper limit for ‘needs-based living’ that has been tested in practice and is comparatively broadly legitimised. Using this threshold, and based on Data from the EU Statistics on Income and Living Conditions, we identify a theoretical housing potential in the EU stock of approximately 152 million rooms. This implies a theoretical space in the building stock for 50 million additional three-room flats, which equates to housing for 100 million people or 23 % of the EU population. Significant potential exists in all types of regions: cities, towns and rural areas. The under-occupancy is lower in countries with a higher share of small and medium sized flats, which indicates a high influence of the infrastructure on the occupancy. A comparison with the occupancy in Swiss housing markets that have minimum occupancy requirements implemented suggests that a large part of the theoretical potential could be realized by shaping infrastructural and market conditions. We conclude that housing politics should focus on the development of affordable and attractive alternatives for older people and smaller households in order to free up dwellings for families and address social and ecological problems in the housing market simultaneously."

This study investigates projected changes in compound extreme hot & humid and wet & windy events across Africa by the end of the 21st century (2069–2098). Using the multi-model ensemble mean from the regional climate projections from the coordinated regional climate downscaling experiment-coordinated output for regional evaluations project, we examined both low/high representative concentration pathway (RCP2.6/8.5) emission scenarios. We estimated population exposure to these joint events by combining climate projections with low/high shared socioeconomic pathway (SSP1/SSP3) population growth scenarios. Broadly, changes are regionally-dependent. In some subregions, we found a substantial increase in the frequency and duration of compound extreme hot & humid events, rising by approximately 100%/600% under RCP2.6/RCP8.5, associated with a rise in extremely hot univariate events. Conversely, compound extreme wet & windy events are projected to weaken, particularly under RCP8.5, with reductions up to 64%, driven in most regions, by declines in extreme wet-only events. Global warming expands historical equatorial hotspots for heat events into eastern and southern Africa, which is less severe under RCP2.6. These changes significantly increase exposed populations to these hazards, affecting up to 668 million person-events across various IPCC reference subregions, especially in West, Central, Northeast, and Southeast Africa, as well as most of West and East South Africa, and Madagascar (MDG). In subregions like the Sahara and West Africa, population growth is the primary driver of exposure to hot & humid events, while in Central, North-East, South-East, West-South, East-South and MDG, climate and interaction effects are more influential. We stress the need to enhance climate adaptation policies, especially in West, Central, Northeast, Southeast Africa and MDG, to address these risks, as they could exacerbate climate refugee migration, heat-related illnesses, food insecurity, and societal instability. We also advocate for disseminating climate services, particularly in low-income countries, to support research for sustainable development."

Consecutive peaks in HONO and NO fluxes suggest a potentially enhanced release of HONO and NO due to soil tillage, whereas waterlogged soil may inhibit microbial nitrification processes following irrigation. Notably, biological processes and light-driven NO2 reactions at the surface may serve as sources of HONO and influence the local HONO budget during rotary tillage. 
 Significant amounts of nitrous acid (HONO) released from soil affect the chemistry of the troposphere, thereby serving as a major precursor to hydroxyl radicals. However, the scarcity of in situ data on soil–atmosphere HONO exchange flux has constrained the understanding of emission mechanisms and the budget of reactive nitrogen. Herein, we performed measurements of HONO and NOx fluxes over paddy fields in the Huaihe River Basin. The entire experiment involved various agricultural-management activities, including rotary tillage, flood irrigation, fertilization, paddy cultivation and growth, and top dressing. HONO and NO exhibited more upward fluxes, whereas NO2 was deposited on the ground, with average hourly fluxes of 0.07±0.22, 0.19±0.53, and -0.42±0.44 nmol m−2 s−1, respectively. Continuous peaks in HONO and NO fluxes were observed during the rotary tillage period, and they exhibited a significant correlation (R=0.77). Moreover, a significant correlation (R=0.60) between HONO flux and the product of J(NO2) × NO2 was observed during the daytime. The results indicate that both biological emissions from soil and light-driven NO2 conversion are likely active, collectively influencing the diurnal pattern of HONO flux. A source analysis revealed that the unknown HONO source (Punknown) exhibited a diurnal pattern with higher daytime and lower nighttime values. Sensitivity tests demonstrated that photo-enhanced NO2 conversion on the ground could adequately explain Punknown, while nocturnal HONO production derived from soil emission fluxes (ranging from 0.32 to 0.79 ppbv h−1) could sufficiently elucidate nighttime Punknown values. Our study emphasized the variability in HONO fluxes across various agricultural-management activities, as well as the importance of heterogeneous NO2 conversion on ground surfaces and soil emissions in HONO production."

In this study, we use a technique called “double-moment normalization” to model the distribution of diameter sizes. The parameters of the method have been defined over 70 % of the dataset and tested over the remaining 30 %. An independent distribution of hail sizes, collected by a drone, has also been used to evaluate the method. 
 Measurements of hailstone diameters and kinetic energy, collected by the Swiss network of automatic hail sensors, are available in three regions of Switzerland for the period between September 2018 and August 2023. In this study, we propose the use of double-moment normalization for modeling the hail size number distribution (HSND), which is defined as the number of hailstone impacts measured, for each diameter size, by one instrument during one hail event. This method uses two of the empirical moments of the HSND to compute a normalized distribution. While the HSND is dependent on the duration and intensity of the event and on the detection area of the sensor, we show that the normalized distribution has limited variability across the three geographical regions of deployment of the sensors. Thanks to its invariance in space and time, a generalized gamma function is used to model the normalized distribution, and its parameters have been determined through a fit over approximately 70 % of the events. The fitted model and the previously chosen pair of empirical moments can be used to reconstruct the HSND at any location in Switzerland. The accuracy of the reconstruction has been estimated over the remaining 30 % of the dataset. An additional evaluation has been performed on an independent HSND, made of estimates of hail diameters measured by drone photogrammetry during a single event. This HSND has a much larger number of hailstone impacts (18 000) than those of the hail sensor events (from 30 to 400). The double-moment normalization is able to reproduce well the HSND recorded by the hail sensors and the drone, albeit with an underestimation of the number of impacts at small diameters. These results highlight the invariance of the normalized distribution and the adaptability of the method to different data sources."

Yde,"Ice thickness and bed topography of  Jostedalsbreen ice cap, Norway","We present an extensive ice thickness dataset from Jostedalsbreen ice cap that will serve as a baseline for future studies of regional climate-induced change. Results show that Jostedalsbreen currently (~2020) has a maximum ice thickness of ~630 m, a mean ice thickness of 154 ± 22 m and an ice volume of 70.6 ±10.2 km3. Ice of less than 50 m thickness covers two narrow regions of Jostedalsbreen, and the ice cap is likely to separate into three parts in a warming climate. 
 We present an extensive dataset of ice thickness measurements from Jostedalsbreen ice cap, mainland Europe's largest glacier. The dataset consists of more than 351 000 point values of ice thickness distributed along ∼ 1100 km profile segments that cover most of the ice cap. Ice thickness was measured during field campaigns in 2018, 2021, 2022 and 2023 using various ground-penetrating radar (GPR) systems with frequencies ranging between 2.5 and 500 MHz. A large majority of the ice thickness observations were collected in spring using either snowmobiles (90 %) or a helicopter-based radar system (8 %), while summer measurements were carried out on foot (2 %). To ensure accessibility and ease of use, metadata were attributed following the GlaThiDa dataset (GlaThiDa Consortium, 2020) and follow the FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable and reusable) guiding principles. Our findings show that glacier ice of more than 400 m thickness is found in the upper regions of large outlet glaciers, with a maximum ice thickness of ∼ 630 m in the accumulation area of Tunsbergdalsbreen. Thin ice of less than 50 m covers narrow regions joining the central part of Jostedalsbreen with its northern and southern parts, making the ice cap vulnerable to break-up with future climate warming. Using the point values of ice thickness as input to an ice thickness model, we computed 10 m grids of ice thickness and bed topography that cover the entire ice cap. From these distributed datasets, we find that Jostedalsbreen (458 km2 in 2019) has a present (∼ 2020) mean ice thickness of 154 ± 22 m and an ice volume of 70.6 ± 10.2 km3. Locations of depressions in the map of bed topography are used to delineate potential future lakes, consequently providing a glimpse of the landscape if the entire Jostedalsbreen melts away. Together, the comprehensive ice thickness point values and ice-cap-wide grids serve as a baseline for future climate change impact studies at Jostedalsbreen.

Observations exist to address this problem, and mathematics and different computing tools can be used to predict histories of flow. We explore how modeling choices impact calculated vertical deflections. The sensitivity of vertical motions at Earth's surface to deep flow is assessed, demonstrating how surface observations can enlighten flow histories. 
 The modern state of the mantle and its evolution on geological timescales are of widespread importance for the Earth sciences. For instance, it is generally agreed that mantle flow is manifest in topographic and drainage network evolution, glacio-eustasy, and  the distribution of sediments. There are now a variety of theoretical approaches to predict histories of mantle convection and its impact on surface deflections. A general goal is to make use of observed deflections to identify Earth-like simulations and constrain the history of mantle convection. Several important insights into the role of radial and non-radial viscosity variations, gravitation, and the importance of shallow structure already exist. Here we seek to bring those insights into a single framework to elucidate the relative importance of popular modeling choices for predicted instantaneous vertical surface deflections. We start by comparing results from numeric and analytic approaches to solving the equations of motion that are ostensibly parameterized to be as similar as possible. Deflections predicted by such numeric and analytic models can vary by ∼ 10 %, and the difference increases to ∼ 25 % when viscosity is temperature-dependent. Including self-gravitation and the gravitational potential of the deflected surface is a relatively small source of discrepancy. However, spherical harmonic correlations between model predictions decrease dramatically with the removal of shallow structure to increasing depths and when radial viscosity structure is modified. The results emphasize the sensitivity of instantaneous surface deflections to density and viscosity anomalies in the upper mantle. They reinforce the view that a detailed understanding of lithospheric structure is crucial for relating mantle convective history to observations of vertical motions at Earth's surface."

The background currents and horizontally inhomogeneous stratifications are implemented in ISWFM-NSCS v2.0 to better reproduce ISW properties, including arrival time, mode-1 wave amplitude, wave-induced velocity, characteristic half-width and propagation direction.

This study examines how global soil N2O emissions have changed from 1961 to 2020 and identifies key factors driving these changes using an ecological model. The findings highlight croplands as the largest source, with factors like fertilizer use and climate change enhancing emissions. Rising CO2 levels, however, can partially mitigate N2O emissions through increased plant nitrogen uptake. 
 Nitrogen (N) transformation processes by soil microbes account for significant nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions from natural ecosystems and cropland. However, understanding and quantifying global soil N2O emissions and their responses to changing environmental conditions remain challenging. We implemented a soil nitrification-denitrification module into the dynamic vegetation model LPJ-GUESS to estimate N2O emissions from global lands. The performance of this new development is examined using observed N2O fluxes from natural soil and cropland field trials, and independent global-scale estimates. LPJ-GUESS broadly reproduces the cumulative N2O emissions under different climate conditions and N fertilizer applications that are observed in the field experiments, with some deviations in emission seasonality. Globally, simulated soil N2O emissions from terrestrial ecosystems increase from 5.6±0.2 Tg N yr-1 in the 1960s to 9.9±0.3 Tg N yr-1 in the 2010s, with croplands contributing about two thirds of the total increase. East Asia and South Asia show the fastest growth rates in N2O emissions over the study period due to the expansion of fertilized croplands. On a global scale, N fertilization (including synthetic fertilizer and manure use), atmospheric N deposition, and climate change contribute 58 %, 46 %, and 24 %, respectively, to the simulated soil N2O emissions in the 2010s. Rising CO2 levels in the atmosphere reduce the simulated emissions by 32 % through increased plant N uptake, whereas land-use changes have varied spatial effects on emissions depending on N management intensity after land-cover conversion. Our estimates only account for the direct soil N2O emissions, excluding those from fertilized pasture. This study highlights the importance of environmental factors in influencing global soil N2O emissions, particularly for assessing greenhouse gas mitigation potential in agricultural ecosystems."

Earthquake‐triggered landslides are a severe hazard and contribute to landscape evolution. To understand their process and controlling factors, we model the onset of seismically‐triggered slip on pre‐existing slip surfaces governed by laboratory‐based rate‐and‐state friction, including wave propagation effects. Through numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we identify how friction properties, landslide thickness and incident wave attributes (frequency, duration, amplitude) control slope stability. We find that the frictional state variable tracks the cyclic fatigue of the slip surface, its progressive weakening with each wave cycle. Wave propagation effects introduce two regimes depending on frequency relative to the two‐way travel time across the landslide thickness: the stability criterion is well approximated by a threshold on incident peak acceleration at low frequencies, and on peak velocity at high frequencies. We derive analytical approximations, validated by simulations, suitable to apply the model to evaluate landslide stability under arbitrary input motions."

This study investigates the inter‐model spread in the projection of winter Central Asian precipitation (WCAP) using models from the Coupled Model Inter‐comparison Project Phase 6. The results reveal a homogenous wetting trend in WCAP, with the primary source of uncertainty in its magnitude stemming from the dynamic component of vertical moisture advection. This dynamical uncertainty is further attributed to an out‐of‐phase variation between two Eurasian westerly jets, which can enhance the upward motion over Central Asia through positive relative vorticity advection and warm temperature advection. The opposing variation between two westerly jets can be traced to cooling in the North Pacific, which alters jet intensity through changes in the meridional temperature gradient.

However, the effectiveness and cost‐efficiency of large‐scale forest restoration projects (FRP) in different climatic zones, and the trade‐off between carbon sequestration and water consumption caused by FRP are poorly understood. Here, we conducted a comprehensive examination of 2,778 counties in China, where the world's most ambitious FRP was executed during the past two decades. Results showed that, on average, each square kilometer of FRP yielded an additional 0.6 square kilometers of forests and contributed an extra 1354.9 tC to forest carbon storage, with the aridity index emerging as a key influencer. The actual expenditure incurred per ton of increased forest carbon storage amounted to approximately 118.9 USD in average, with the lowest in Southwest at 50.9 USD. The expansion of forest cover and enhanced biomass storage led to a notable increase in water consumption, and the trade‐off was particularly pronounced in arid regions. Our study provides empirical evidence that FRP is an effective and cost‐efficient climate change mitigation strategy for humid climate zones under current carbon prices. However, FRP is not cost‐efficient in semi‐arid and arid regions.

Here the authors show that microRNA 9 mediates the formation of G-quadruplexes and the looping of promoters and super-enhancers in genes activated by transforming growth factor beta 1signaling. 
 The dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) genome organization are essential to transcriptional regulation. While enhancers regulate spatiotemporal gene expression, chromatin looping is a means for enhancer-promoter interactions yielding cell-type-specific gene expression. Further, non-canonical DNA secondary structures, such as G-quadruplexes (G4s), are related to increased gene expression. However, the role of G4s in promoter-distal regulatory elements, such as super-enhancers (SE), and in chromatin looping has remained elusive. Here we show that mature microRNA 9 (miR-9) is enriched at promoters and SE of genes that are inducible by transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGFB1) signaling. Moreover, we find that miR-9 is required for formation of G4s, promoter-super-enhancer looping and broad domains of the euchromatin histone mark H3K4me3 at TGFB1-responsive genes.

 Understanding changes in global ocean heat content (OHC) is essential for investigating Earth’s energy imbalance and climate change. OHC trends are assessed using four state-of-the-art ocean reanalyses and one objective analysis. The spatial OHC trend patterns captured by reanalyses are consistent with each other, but sensitive to the selected time period. A higher proportion of heat uptake in the 100–2000 m sub-surface layer over 2001–2010 than 1994–2000 contributed to the temporary slowdown in global surface warming. The North Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (MOC) and heat transport show better agreement with RAPID observations compared with previous studies. Zonal mean OHC trends in the North Atlantic over 40–60 °N differ for the MOC increasing (2000–2004) and decreasing periods (2005–2010) and OHC increases are more concentrated between 30 and 40 °N in the later MOC increasing period (2011–2022).

 Built-up heights serve as a nexus in understanding the complex relationship between urban forms and socioeconomic activities. With the advent of remote sensing technology, built-up height mapping from satellite observations has become available over the past years. However, the absence of high-precision sample data poses a significant limitation to built-up height mapping at large (regional or global) scales, particularly in developing regions. To address this issue, we proposed a flexible mapping framework to derive precise building height samples using the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) data for built-up height estimation. First, we calculated building heights from ICESat-2 photons using advanced algorithms such as Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) linear fitting and cloth simulation filtering. Then, we constructed large-scale built-up height samples by aggregating the height information into grid cells with optimal size. Finally, aided by these grids with height information from ICEsat-2 and other satellite observations from Sentinel data as well as the digital surface model (DSM), we mapped built-up heights in two mega-cities (i.e., New York and Shenzhen) using the random forest regression model. Our results demonstrate building height estimation using ICESat-2 data generally exhibits in relation to other studies high accuracy, showing great potential to support large-scale built-up height mapping using satellite observations. We found the optimal grid size for built-up height mapping is around 300 m, after a comprehensive sensitivity analysis regarding the building fraction within the grid and its size. Overall, the mapped built-up heights are reliable, with relatively low mean absolute errors (MAE) of 2.69 m in New York and 3.87 m in Shenzhen, similar to or better than previous studies. By leveraging high-precision elevation data provided by the ICESat-2 data, our proposed approach can effectively collect samples in regions with limited information on building heights, showing great potential for large-scale built-up height monitoring and supporting future urban studies."

 Nighttime light (NTL) remote sensing has become an important tool to study human activities and their impact on the environment. However, accurately and quantitatively measuring NTL has remained a challenge. In this study, we propose using radiant flux as a more precise measure of NTL energy intensity, which takes into account both radiance and image pixel area. To achieve this, we develop a conversion model from radiance to radiant flux based on the SNPP-VIIRS dataset and calculate the global radiant flux map for 2022. A validation of the model was conducted in 50 representative cities worldwide, confirming its rationality and accuracy. The use of radiant flux provides a more intuitive reflection of NTL energy intensity and eliminates system error caused by variations in pixel areas.

 Mangroves, critical for ecological sustainability, are challenging to map accurately due to their fragmented nature and difficult accessibility. Existing datasets, often constrained to 10 m or above resolutions, could misrepresent fragmented mangrove regions and suffer from sampling biases, limiting their regional applicability. Furthermore, scale conversion’s spatial and statistical implications on mangrove mapping accuracy and area estimation remain largely unexplored. This study proposes a novel framework that leverages UHR (0.2 m) aerial photos and the DeepLabV3+ model for fine-scale mapping and systematically simulates and quantifies scale-induced effects. The resultant 20 cm-resolution mangrove map of Hong Kong achieved an overall accuracy (OA) of 92.1 %, with up to 53 % improvement compared to various existing datasets. It delineates complex boundaries in diverse coastal settings while preserving the structural integrity of fragmented patches. The total mangrove area in Hong Kong is estimated at ∼720 ha, with Deep Bay comprising 77.5 %. The scale effects analysis revealed pronounced sensitivity in fragmented habitats, where each 1 m increase in resolution could result in an average area underestimation of 5000 m2 and up to 25 % OA degradation when transitioning from 0.2 m to 30 m. Moreover, integrating patch geometry and scale responses indicated that 6 m is the optimal scale for monitoring. Beyond this, OA could sharply decline to below 82 % at the commonly used 10 m resolution and drop as low as 66 % at 30 m. These findings highlight the critical importance of fine-scale mapping using UHR images for effective mangrove conservation and management."

 The South Asian regions frequently encounter extreme rainfall events (EREs) during the summer monsoon season, causing property damage, environmental harm, and fatalities. Therefore, it is essential to comprehend how these events are evolving and may change in the future, particularly for developing countries like India. This study utilised selected models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) to evaluate the intensity and contribution of EREs to seasonal rainfall during the historical period (1950–2014), as well as to anticipate the variability of extremes in the future period (2015–2100) during the summer monsoon period. Compared to observational rainfall data from the Climatic Research Unit, the selected models showed similar spatial patterns for mean and extreme rainfall in the historical period with regional biases across CMIP6 selected models, mainly in the monsoonal regions such as the west coast, central India, the Himalayas and its foothills, and the northeastern regions. Four EC-Earth models accurately projected mean and extreme rainfall for central India, the southern west coast, and the western Himalayan regions, while NorESM slightly overestimated central India and underestimated) west coast extremes. Moreover, the selected models are not adequate to realistically capture the extremes in northeastern and Myanmar coastal areas. Future scenarios predict significant changes in extreme rainfall over central India and the rain shadow regions of southeast India. The increased ERE in the northern regions of the west coast and southwestern regions of central India could lead to increased vulnerabilities in the area, especially in higher forcing scenarios.

We examined bone loss and recovery in 17 astronauts using time-lapsed high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography and biochemical markers to determine whether disuse-induced changes are permanent. During 6 months in microgravity, resorption was threefold higher than formation. Upon return to Earth, targeted bone formation occurred in high mechanical strain areas, with 31.8% of bone formed in the first 6 months after flight at sites resorbed during spaceflight, significantly higher than the 2.7% observed 6 to 12 months after return. Limited bone recovery at resorption sites after 6 months on Earth indicates a restricted window for reactivating bone remodeling factors in humans. Incomplete skeletal recovery may arise from these arrested remodeling sites, representing potential targets for new interventions, thus providing means to counteract this long-term health risk for astronauts."

However, characterizing these interactions faces challenges with conventional farfield–based methods, which typically lack the essential accuracy and resolution to interrogate the structured nearfield with high fidelity. To address this challenge, we experimentally observe spin-orbit interactions at the nanoscale using photoinduced force microscopy. Such interactions are enabled through sharply focused circularly polarized optical vortices, which are then mapped by nearfield optical forces in high resolution. Because the optical forces can reveal both longitudinal and transverse nearfield structures with high fidelity, the spin-orbit interactions are eventually evaluated quantitatively at the nearfield, as an important inspiration to use the coupled momenta in dense optical nano-device systems."

Here we applied nitrogen isotope tracer incubations to measure N2O production under experimentally manipulated changes in oxygen and temperature in the Chesapeake Bay—the largest estuary in the United States. N2O production more than doubled from nitrification and increased exponentially from denitrification when O2was decreased from >20 to <5 micromolar. Raising temperature from 15° to 35°C increased N2O production 2- to 10-fold.

Furthermore, we find that, globally, average glacial erosion rates exceed fluvial erosion rates through time by an order of magnitude, and that this difference cannot be explained by Sadlerian biases or by variations in hillslope, precipitation, or latitude.

We identified 80 metabolic pathways putatively activated by mixtures of inorganic ions, heavy metals, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, industrial chemicals, and a set of biocides, pesticides, and pharmacologically active substances. Our data-driven approach discovered both known bioactivity signatures with previously described modes of action and new pathways linked to undiscovered potential hazards. This study demonstrates the feasibility of reducing the complexity of real-world mixture toxicity to characterize the biomolecular effects of a defined number of chemical components based on gene expression monitoring of the sentinel species Daphnia."

This study utilizes Global Navigation Satellite System and Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar data to image the spatial distribution of interseismic coupling before the Wushi event along the MDF. The four asperities we identified indicate a high seismic risk for the MDF, with potential magnitudes of Mw 7.5–7.6, Mw 7.5–7.7, Mw 7.0–7.2, and Mw 6.8–7.0. Specifically, the Maierkaiqi segment has already accumulated seismic moment comparable to previous event. Furthermore, our comparison of the interseismic coupling model with the coseismic rupture of the Wushi earthquake reveals that the shallow compliant zone, creeping patches, and irregular fault geometry collectively constrained the rupture propagation. The consistency between the rupture and high coupling area also suggests that the obtained coupling distribution may represent potential earthquake‐prone zones along the MDF."

Convective environment variability within areas representative of reanalysis data sets is quantified using large‐domain, high‐resolution (∆x = 100 m) simulations of convective cloud systems throughout the tropics and subtropics. Even after removing locations of resolved clouds and precipitation, convective environment parameters vary significantly on these scales. For example, for half of the simulated data, 500 hPa relative humidity varies by ∼30% within a typical reanalysis area. Surface winds, convective available potential energy, and middle‐tropospheric moisture are the most variable convective environment parameters for both continental and maritime regimes, while above‐surface temperature and winds are the least variable. While high‐resolution, sub‐reanalysis‐scale extrema are well‐correlated with the reanalysis‐area mean values, some of the most extreme convective environments can occur within regions with moderate reanalysis‐area mean values, particularly for continental regions."

Here we probe and interpret the differences in these relationships between the climate change projections provided by the CMIP5 and CMIP6 experiment ensembles. We find that internal variability feedbacks better predict forced feedbacks in CMIP6 relative to CMIP5 by over 50%, and that the increased predictability derives primarily from the slow (>20 years) response to climate change. A key novel result is that the increased predictability is consistent with the higher resemblance between the patterns of internal and forced temperature changes in CMIP6, which suggests temperature pattern effects play a key role in predicting forced climate feedbacks. Despite the increased predictability, emergent constraints provided by observed internal variability are weak and largely unchanged from CMIP5 to CMIP6 due to the shortness of the observational record."

Consequently, most studies have focused on seismic‐to‐electromagnetic conversions at fluid/poroelastic and poroelastic/poroelastic interfaces. However, when investigating permeable zones in unfractured media, often associated with geothermal reservoirs, poroelastic/elastic interfaces must be considered. To address this, we conducted laboratory and numerical experiments using a container filled with quartz sand saturated with a NaCl solution, with one of five thin layers made of different materials (four elastic and one poroelastic) embedded within the sand. Our numerical simulations assume an elastic medium as poroelastic using limiting values for certain physical parameters. The results confirm that seismoelectric conversion occurs at poroelastic/elastic transitions, showing a strong agreement between experiments and simulations. Furthermore, we inferred that the amplitudes of electromagnetic waves generated at poroelastic/elastic interfaces are mainly controlled by contrasts of dielectric permittivity."

Two WindBornes continuously sampled inside and near the center of the TPV at various vertical levels for 27 hr before the cyclogenesis. The 27 hr were divided into three phases based on the different vertical levels sampled by WindBornes. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of the forecasted cyclone is reduced from 12‐hr to 36‐hr forecast lead time as more phases of WindBornes are assimilated. This period corresponds to when the surface cyclone becomes superimposed with the TPV and rapidly deepens. Comparing the experiment with three phases of WindBorne observations assimilated versus the baseline, the cyclone expands southwestwards toward the TPV and forms a stronger coupled structure. Two analysis improvements leading to the improved AC predictability are revealed. First, a stronger circulation at and below the tropopause of the TPV is observed, leading to stronger coupling between the TPV and the surface cyclone in the forecast. Second, a mesoscale shortwave embedded in the synoptic trough is better constrained as more phases of WindBorne are assimilated. The north part of the TPV, which evolves from the shortwave trough, is therefore forecasted to be stronger. The sensitivity of forecast performance to horizontal localization parameter of the WindBorne observations is also studied. Larger localization parameters result in larger RMSE reduction compared to smaller values."

Future flood risk assessment has primarily focused on heavy rainfall as the main driver, with the assumption that projected increases in extreme rain events will lead to subsequent flooding. However, the presence of and changes in vegetation have long been known to influence the relationship between rainfall and runoff. Here, we extract historical (1850–1880) and projected (2070–2100) daily extreme rainfall events, the corresponding runoff, and antecedent conditions simulated in a prominent large Earth system model ensemble to examine the shifting extreme rainfall and runoff relationship. Even with widespread projected increases in the magnitude (78% of the land surface) and number (72%) of extreme rainfall events, we find projected declines in event‐based runoff ratio (runoff/rainfall) for a majority (57%) of the Earth surface. Runoff ratio declines are linked with decreases in antecedent soil water driven by greater transpiration and canopy evaporation (both linked to vegetation greening) compared to areas with runoff ratio increases. Using a machine learning regression tree approach, we find that changes in canopy evaporation is the most important variable related to changes in antecedent soil water content in areas of decreased runoff ratios (with minimal changes in antecedent rainfall) while antecedent ground evaporation is the most important variable in areas of increased runoff ratios. Our results suggest that simulated interactions between vegetation greening, increasing evaporative demand, and antecedent soil drying are projected to diminish runoff associated with extreme rainfall events, with important implications for society."

 Internal climate variability (ICV) creates a range of climate trajectories, which are superimposed upon the forced response. A single climate model realization may not represent forced change alone and may diverge from other realizations, as well as observations, due to ICV. We use an initial-condition large ensemble of simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) to show that ICV produces a range of outcomes in the terrestrial carbon cycle. Trends in gross primary production (GPP) from 1991 to 2020 differ among ensemble members due to the different climate trajectories resulting from ICV. We quantify how ICV imparts on GPP trends and apply our methodology to the observational record. Observed changes in GPP at two long-running eddy covariance flux towers are consistent with ICV, challenging the understanding of forced changes in the carbon cycle at these locations.

 Shortly after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill began in April 2010, a widely spaced passive acoustic monitoring array was deployed in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico to document the impacts of this unprecedentedly large and deep offshore oil spill on oceanic marine mammals. The array was subsequently maintained for over a decade. Here we document decadal density declines for seven of eight monitored species groups, including sperm whales (up to 31%), beaked whales (up to 83%), and small delphinids (up to 43%). Declines were observed both within and outside of the surface oil footprint. Though not conclusively linked to the oil spill, the broad spatial and temporal scale of these declines observed for disparate marine mammal species is consistent with Deepwater Horizon impacts. These declines have exceeded and outlasted post-spill damage assessment predictions, suggesting that the offshore ecosystem impacts of Deepwater Horizon may have been larger than previously thought.

 Natural regeneration of Amazon forests offers a promising strategy to mitigate forest loss and advance the goals of the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. However, the vast variability in regeneration rates across environmental gradients and over time poses considerable challenges for assessing regeneration success and ecosystem services provision in human-modified landscapes. Here we compiled 448 plots from forest regeneration in the Amazon to investigate the drivers of regrowth capacity and identify robust ecological indicators. By modeling optimal successional trajectories, we estimated reference values for vegetation structure, diversity, and functioning. After 20 years, successful regeneration should reach a minimum basal area of 14 m². ha−¹, at least 34 tree species per 100 individuals, a structural heterogeneity index of 0.27, and 123 Mg.ha−¹ of aboveground biomass.

 Arctic permafrost soils contain a vast reservoir of soil organic carbon (SOC) vulnerable to increasing mobilization and decomposition from polar warming and permafrost thaw. How these SOC stocks are responding to global warming is uncertain, partly due to a lack of information on the distribution and status of SOC over vast Arctic landscapes. Soil moisture and organic matter vary substantially over the short vertical distance of the permafrost active layer. The hydrological properties of this seasonally thawed soil layer provide insights for understanding the dielectric behavior of water inside the soil matrix, which is key for developing more effective physics-based radar remote sensing retrieval algorithms for large-scale mapping of SOC. This study provides a coupled hydrologic-electromagnetic framework to model the frequency-dependent dielectric behavior of active layer organic soil. For the first time, we present joint measurement and modeling of the water matric potential, dielectric permittivity, and basic physical properties of 66 soil samples collected across the Alaskan Arctic tundra. The matric potential measurement allows for estimating the soil water retention curve, which helps determine the relaxation time through the Eyring equation. The estimated relaxation time of water molecules in soil is then used in the Debye model to predict the water dielectric behavior in soil. A multi-phase dielectric mixing model is applied to incorporate the contribution of various soil components. The resulting organic soil dielectric model accepts saturation water fraction, organic matter content, mineral texture, temperature, and microwave frequency as inputs to calculate the effective soil dielectric characteristic. The developed dielectric model was validated against lab-measured dielectric data for all soil samples and exhibited robust accuracy. We further validated the dielectric model against field-measured dielectric profiles acquired from five sites on the Alaskan North Slope. Model behavior was also compared against other existing dielectric models, and an in-depth discussion on their validity and limitations in permafrost soils is given. The resulting organic soil dielectric model was then integrated with a multi-layer electromagnetic scattering forward model to simulate radar backscatter under a range of soil profile conditions and model parameters. The results indicate that low frequency (P-, L-band) polarimetric synthetic aperture radars (SARs) have the potential to map water and carbon characteristics in permafrost active layer soils using physics-based radar retrieval algorithms."

 Melt ponds are a common phenomenon on the surface of Arctic sea ice during the summer, and their low albedo strongly influences the energy balance of the Arctic sea ice. Estimating Melt Pond Fraction (MPF) and Melt Pond Depth (MPD) using optical remote sensing is crucial for a better understanding of rapid climate change in the Arctic region. However, current retrieval algorithms for monitoring Arctic melt ponds using optical imagery often fail to estimate MPD. In this study, a radiative transfer model for melt ponds is establish to describe the relationship between melt pond reflectance and its physical properties. Using Sentinel-2 observation data, we propose a novel algorithm for the simultaneous retrieval of MPF and MPD, thereby enabling the estimation of Melt Pond Volume (MPV). This method does not depend on prior assumptions regarding the spectral reflectance of sea ice and melt ponds, and it accounts for the spatiotemporal variability in their reflectance. Compared with other high-resolution MPF and MPD products, the results of this study demonstrate comparable spatial distributions. The root mean square error (RMSE) of the retrieved MPF is less than 10 %, and the RMSE for MPD is approximately 24.51 cm. The analysis of melt pond evolution along the MOSAiC track shows the rapid expansion of melt ponds and their significant spatial variability. Ultimately, using Google Earth Engine (GEE) and machine learning, a dataset of MPF, MPD, and MPV for the Arctic from 2013 to 2023 is generated from 57,842 Landsat-8 images. Correlation analysis shows that MPF, MPD, and MPV all have a positive correlation with downward surface radiation. The approach outlined in this study is entirely based on remote sensing imagery, demonstrating significant potential for large scale application. This offers new opportunities for estimating the volume of water stored in Arctic summer melt ponds."

 Many invasive shrubs in the eastern deciduous forests of the United States use the temporal niche before and after the native tree canopy leaf-on period (leafing out prior to most native species and retaining leaves after most natives senesce) to establish in the light-limited environment of the understory. To support an increased understanding of invasive shrub species’ ecology and distribution patterns and inform better management plans, this key phenological difference needs to be characterized in detail. Here we leveraged the high-resolution observations from the French-Israel VENµS mission to examine the phenological characteristics of a widespread invasive shrub species—Amur honeysuckle (AH; Lonicera maackii (Rupr.) Herder)—compared to native deciduous trees in Robinson Forest, Kentucky. VENµS offered daily superspectral (12 narrow bands) observations at 4 m resolution in a limited number of global sites, providing us with crucial data for the analysis. We identified three forest communities with respect to AH presence through field surveys (i.e., uninvaded forest stands, forest stands with AH understory, and AH shrub thickets) and compared their VENµS-derived spectral signatures and time series of vegetation indices. In 2023, AH shrub thickets greened up one month earlier than uninvaded forest stands (mid-March vs. mid-April). AH leaf growth advanced into full green before the canopy tree greenup started in early April, marking an optimal window for isolating areas with AH understory from the uninvaded forest using remote sensing. Based on the phenological differences identified, we predicted the distribution of AH in the study area using a two-date differencing model and a spectral mixture analysis. Our detailed findings using VENµS data offer insights into the temporal dynamics of invasive shrubs and native trees in a typical eastern deciduous forest. While our prediction of the AH distribution was confounded by the presence of native early greening and/or evergreen understory plants at a few locations, it was still moderately accurate (overall accuracy ∼ 70 %) and its abundance estimates agreed with observations in forest stands with minimal native understory growth. Moving forward, high-resolution remote sensing observations combined with a phenology-based approach will likely support more precise monitoring and management of invasive understory plants in native forest ecosystems."

 Compound hazards caused by tropical cyclones involve interactions among multiple hazards, such as wind, rainfall, and storm surge, significantly increasing the uncertainty and destructiveness of disasters. Existing studies primarily focus on probabilistic analyses of single or dual hazards associated with tropical cyclones, revealing limitations in handling high-dimensional data and complex dependencies. This study developed the ComHazAsTC-RRE (Compound Hazard Assessment of Tropical Cyclones within Repeatable, Reproducible, and Expandable Framework) model to analyze the compound hazards of wind, rainfall, and storm surge induced by tropical cyclones and successfully applied it to China’s coast. We collected globally accessible daily records of maximum wind speed, cumulative rainfall, and maximum storm surge for China’s coastal areas from 1979 to 2018. Using a C-Vine Copula with wind speed as the core, incorporating rainfall and storm surge as branches, we accurately captured complex dependencies of tropical cyclones. Our various return period analyses underscore the importance of considering multiple hazards and their interactions. Additionally, the application of Compound Hazard Index in China reveals that southeastern coastal areas are subjected to significantly higher compound hazards, driven by high wind speeds and strong spatial–temporal consistency of hazards. An in-depth analysis of failure probabilities indicates that neglecting the interactions among hazards can result in substantial additional cost for engineering projects, especially during severe tropical cyclones. This study offers new perspectives and scientific tools for understanding and addressing compound hazards, formulating effective disaster prevention and mitigation strategies, and supporting the sustainable development of coastal regions worldwide."

Our records show long-term warming of ~3°C, probably driven by Deccan CO2emissions, and reveal a transient (<10 kyr) ~5°C cooling event, coinciding with the peak of the Poladpur “pulse” of Deccan eruption ~30 kyr before the K–Pg boundary. This cooling was likely caused by the aerosolization of volcanogenic sulfur. Temperatures returned to pre-event values before the mass extinction, suggesting that, from the terrestrial perspective, volcanogenic climate change was not the primary cause of K–Pg extinction."

Ibuprofen (IBU) is the most prevalent chiral pharmaceutical in municipal wastewater. However, its enantioselective toxicity toward soil animals and the underlying mechanism remain largely unknown. In this study, the toxicity of IBU enantiomers, S-IBU and R-IBU, to earthworms was evaluated at environmentally relevant concentrations (10 and 100 μg/L), simulating wastewater reuse for irrigation. The results demonstrated that IBU adversely affects the growth, reproduction, regeneration, defense systems, and metabolic processes of earthworms, with S-IBU exhibiting stronger toxic effects than R-IBU. The bioavailability assessment revealed that S-IBU was more readily absorbed by earthworms and converted to its enantiomer within earthworms than R-IBU. This is consistent with molecular docking results showing that S-IBU had stronger affinities for functional proteins associated with xenobiotic transport and transformation. The findings of this study highlight that S-IBU poses a higher risk than R-IBU to soil organisms under wastewater reuse scenarios and that the chirality of chemical pollutants in wastewater deserves more attention when implementing wastewater reuse. In addition, our study underscores that the differences in bioavailability and bioactivity may account for the enantioselective toxicity of chiral pollutants."

The Fisheries and Marine Ecosystem Model Intercomparison Project (FishMIP) was established to develop model ensembles for projecting long‐term impacts of climate change on fisheries and marine ecosystems while informing policy at spatio‐temporal scales relevant to the Inter‐Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) framework. While contributing FishMIP models have improved over time, large uncertainties in projections remain, particularly in coastal and shelf seas where most of the world's fisheries occur. Furthermore, previous FishMIP climate impact projections have been limited by a lack of global standardized historical fishing data, low resolution of coastal processes, and uneven capabilities across the FishMIP community to dynamically model fisheries. These features are needed to evaluate how reliably the FishMIP ensemble captures past ecosystem states ‐ a crucial step for building confidence in future projections. To address these issues, we have developed FishMIP 2.0 comprising a two‐track framework for: (a) Model evaluation and attribution of past changes and (b) future climate and socioeconomic scenario projections. Key advances include improved historical climate forcing, which captures oceanographic features not previously resolved, and standardized global fishing forcing to test fishing effects systematically across models. FishMIP 2.0 is a crucial step toward a detection and attribution framework for changing marine ecosystems and toward enhanced policy relevance through increased confidence in future ensemble projections. Our results will help elucidate pathways toward achieving sustainable development goals."

 Decarbonizing the United States transportation sector has emerged as a critical objective to combat climate change due to its high greenhouse gas emissions, largely from light-duty vehicles. This study assesses the breakdown of life cycle emissions of various transportation options under average and maximum ridership scenarios and quantifies emissions reductions through mode shifts and technology advancements. Electrified transportation achieves half the greenhouse gas emissions of petroleum-fueled options in 2023, with projections indicating a reduction to one-fifth by 2050. Battery systems contribute up to one-fifth of lifetime emissions of electric vehicles and buses as of 2023, and this share is estimated to increase to half by 2050 as electricity emissions are greatly reduced with the decarbonization of electricity. The study concludes that shifting away from light-duty vehicles can achieve near-term greenhouse gas reductions, but these reductions are minimal in the long term when combined with transportation electrification powered by decarbonized electricity. In the United States, electrification can reduce greenhouse gas emissions from passenger transportation by half now and up to 85 percent by 2050 with a decarbonized grid, according to an analysis that uses life cycle assessment and ridership scenarios."

 Offset tracking using synthetic aperture radar (SAR) amplitude imagery is a valuable technique for detecting large ground displacements. However, the traditional offset tracking methods with the SAR datasets are computationally intensive and require significant time for processing. We have developed a novel cross-connection Siamese ResNet (CC-ResSiamNet). The model leverages multi-kernel offset tracking for preprocessing, followed by deep learning architectures that incorporate U-Net, cross-connections, and residual and attention blocks to predict pixel offsets between two SAR amplitude images. It is trained and tested on 200 K pairs of reference and secondary SAR amplitude images, alongside corresponding target offset data from Alaska's glaciers. The comparative analysis with multiple deep learning models confirmed that our designed model is highly generalizable, achieving rapid convergence, minimal overfitting, and high prediction accuracy. Through multi-scenario inference with glacier movements, earthquakes, and volcanic eruptions worldwide, the model demonstrates strong performance, closely matching the accuracy of traditional methods while offering significantly faster processing times through parallel computing. The model's rapid displacement mapping capability shows particular promise for improving disaster response and near real-time surface monitoring. While the approach encounters challenges in accurately capturing small-scale displacements, it opens new possibilities for SAR-based surface displacement prediction using machine learning.

Allergenic proteins released by various allergenic species play a critical role in the pathogenesis of allergic diseases and have been widely detected in the environmental matrix. However, the release, presence and interaction of environmental allergens with human body remain to be elucidated. In this study, we reported the widespread of allergen-harboring extracellular vesicles (EVs) in indoor dust from 75 households across five provinces in China. Particle size and abundance of EVs were correlated with specific environmental factors. EVs showed long persistence and high resistance to environmental stress. Metagenomics and metaproteomics data revealed that most indoor allergenic species released allergens within the EVs into dust. A higher abundance of allergenic species and their derived EVs was observed in urban areas compared to rural areas. ELISA confirmed the allergenic activity of the EV-associated allergens. Allergens are common components and even markers of EVs, as evidenced by the data compilation of various allergenic species. The proportion of EV-associated allergens varied across species. EVs facilitated allergen entry into epithelial cells. Intranasally administered EVs can be rapidly transported to the lungs and gastrointestinal tract. EV-associated allergens exhibited higher allergenicity compared with non-EV allergens.

The efficiency of this method led to concise routes to twenty-five naturally-occurring picrotoxanes.

Here, the authors performed a genome-wide genetic screen to identify genes that mitigate the larvae lethal phenotype of a fruit fly model with mitochondrial dysfunction. 
 Aberration of mitochondrial function is a shared feature of many human pathologies, characterised by changes in metabolic flux, cellular energetics, morphology, composition, and dynamics of the mitochondrial network. While some of these changes serve as compensatory mechanisms to maintain cellular homeostasis, their chronic activation can permanently affect cellular metabolism and signalling, ultimately impairing cell function. Here, we use a Drosophila melanogaster model expressing a proofreading-deficient mtDNA polymerase (POLγexo-) in a genetic screen to find genes that mitigate the harmful accumulation of mtDNA mutations. We identify critical pathways associated with nutrient sensing, insulin signalling, mitochondrial protein import, and autophagy that can rescue the lethal phenotype of the POLγexo- flies. Rescued flies, hemizygous for dilp1, atg2, tim14 or melted, normalise their autophagic flux and proteasome function and adapt their metabolism. Mutation frequencies remain high with the exception of melted-rescued flies, suggesting that melted may act early in development. Treating POLγexo- larvae with the autophagy activator rapamycin aggravates their lethal phenotype, highlighting that excessive autophagy can significantly contribute to the pathophysiology of mitochondrial diseases. Moreover, we show that the nucleation process of autophagy is a critical target for intervention. Finding ways to compensate for mitochondrial dysfunction is essential.

 Aneuploidy in eggs is a leading cause of miscarriages or viable developmental syndromes. Aneuploidy rates differ between individual chromosomes. For instance, chromosome 21 frequently missegregates, resulting in Down Syndrome. What causes chromosome-specific aneuploidy in meiosis is unclear. Chromosome 21 belongs to the class of acrocentric chromosomes, whose centromeres are located close to the chromosome end, resulting in one long and one short chromosome arm. We demonstrate that acrocentric chromosomes are generally more often aneuploid than metacentric chromosomes in porcine eggs. Kinetochores of acrocentric chromosomes are often partially covered by the short chromosome arm during meiosis I in human and porcine oocytes and orient less efficiently toward the spindle poles. These partially covered kinetochores are more likely to be incorrectly attached to the spindle. Additionally, sister chromatids of acrocentric chromosomes are held together by lower levels of cohesin, making them more vulnerable to age-dependent cohesin loss. Chromosome architecture and low cohesion therefore bias acrocentric chromosomes toward aneuploidy during mammalian meiosis. Bellou et al. show that acrocentric chromosomes, such as chromosome 21, are more prone to aneuploidy in oocytes due to their unique architecture and lower cohesion levels, which lead to inefficient alignment and increased mis-segregation during meiosis."

 The ability to prioritize among input features according to relevance enables adaptive behaviors across the human lifespan. However, relevance often remains ambiguous, and such uncertainty increases demands for dynamic control. While both cognitive stability and flexibility decline during healthy ageing, it is unknown whether aging alters how uncertainty impacts perception and decision-making, and if so, via which neural mechanisms. Here, we assess uncertainty adjustment across the adult lifespan (N = 100; cross-sectional) via behavioral modeling and a theoretically informed set of EEG-, fMRI-, and pupil-based signatures. On the group level, older adults show a broad dampening of uncertainty adjustment relative to younger adults. At the individual level, older individuals whose modulation more closely resembled that of younger adults also exhibit better maintenance of cognitive control. Our results highlight neural mechanisms whose maintenance plausibly enables flexible task-set, perception, and decision computations across the adult lifespan.

 OpenStreetMap (OSM) contains valuable geographic knowledge for remote sensing (RS) interpretation. They can provide correlated and complementary descriptions of a given region. Integrating RS images with OSM data can lead to a more comprehensive understanding of a geographic scene. But due to the significant differences between them, little progress has been made in data fusion for RS and OSM data, and how to extract, interact, and collaborate the information from multiple geographic data sources remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on designing a multi-modal self-supervised learning (SSL) approach to fuse RS images and OSM data, which can extract meaningful features from the two complementary data sources in an unsupervised manner, resulting in comprehensive scene understanding. We harmonize the parts of information extraction, interaction, and collaboration for RS and OSM data into a unified SSL framework, named Rose. For information extraction, we start from the complementarity between the two modalities, designing an OSM encoder to harmoniously align with the ViT image encoder. For information interaction, we leverage the spatial correlation between RS and OSM data to guide the cross-attention module, thereby enhancing the information transfer. For information collaboration, we design the joint mask-reconstruction learning strategy to achieve cooperation between the two modalities, which reconstructs the original inputs by referring to information from both sources. The three parts are interlinked and blending seamlessly into a unified framework. Finally, Rose can generate three kinds of representations, i.e., RS feature, OSM feature, and RS-OSM fusion feature, which can be used for multiple downstream tasks. Extensive experiments on land use semantic segmentation, population estimation, and carbon emission estimation tasks demonstrate the multitasking capability, label efficiency, and robustness to noise of Rose. Rose can associate RS images and OSM data at a fine level of granularity, enhancing its effectiveness on fine-grained tasks like land use semantic segmentation.

 Sea level changes will significantly drive hydrodynamic, morphological, and ecological development of estuaries. However, the interplay of geomorphology and vegetation at estuary scales remains unclear. To better understand this process, we take the Western Scheldt estuary in the Netherlands as an example to reveal the link between changes in emersion duration and vegetation dynamics in the period 1993–2016. We found that tidal flats in the Western Scheldt become steeper—higher intertidal areas increased in elevation and emersion duration, whereas the low-lying edges of tidal flats experienced a decrease in elevation and emersion duration. We found that longer emersion duration was associated with increased plant diversity and cover. Furthermore, we detected the unique spatiotemporal response patterns of four abundant plant species to geomorphological variations. Our study suggests that on a large estuary scale, geomorphological changes are coupled to the richness and cover of plant communities, and that potential changes in relative sea level can induce structural modifications of the plant communities. It also emphasizes the importance of assessing the potential effects of localized relative sea level changes while considering all aspects of natural processes and direct and indirect human influences.

To address these issues, we proposed a novel method of hydrothermal clean water depolymerization without any catalysts. In this study, high-purity monomers were successfully recovered from nylon plastics by utilizing the reversibility and hydrophilicity of amide bonds, with hydrothermal amphoteric hydrolysis applied as the method. On this basis, repolymerization of the monomer was completed, and new nylon was generated by one-pot solution polycondensation, thereby achieving a closed-loop recycling process. A depolymerization model was established for nylon in a hydrothermal system at both macro- and micro levels, revealing a unique mechanism of simultaneous surface and internal depolymerization.

Importantly, MgO NPs showed an additive effect with carbendazim and azoxystrobin in inhibiting F. graminearum. The extracellular toxicity of MgO NPs against F. graminearum was mainly attributed to the inhibition of fungal growth and germination by oxidative damage, alkaline damage, and cell structure damage. Although MgO NPs could not be absorbed into mycelia, they (EC90) decreased the soluble protein content and DNA concentration of mycelia by 27.8% and 42.3%, respectively, and increased the pyruvate content by 67.4%, demonstrating that the intracellular toxicity was mainly based on their inhibition of protein and DNA production and promotion of carbohydrate degradation.

Here, using 3 year full‐depth mooring data at 130°E/15°N, we demonstrate that downward propagating tropical cyclone (TC)‐induced NIWs and parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) can contribute to the intensification of near‐inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) over 1,000–3,000 m. The deep warm core eddy (WCE) is found to facilitate the downward propagation of TC‐induced NIWs with fast vertical group velocity and the intensified PSI efficiency that improves the energy transfer from diurnal internal tides (DITs) to NIWs at the site poleward of critical latitude for DITs.

The study provides observational evidence supporting the wave resonance (WR) theory which attempts to explain the intensification of MRGW by extratropical forcing. Wavenumber‐frequency cospectral analysis and a bulk measure of growth of MRGW estimated using reanalysis data reveal that the extratropical forcing manifested in the form of eddy momentum flux convergence can create eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and aid the intensification of MRGW via WR mechanism during boreal winter season. However, the WR mechanism does not hold during boreal summer season as the extratropical forcing tends to dampen the MRGW. The analysis also reveals that the Doppler‐shifted eastward propagating MRGW in the WH during boreal winter season are not maintained by extratropical forcing, marking another highlight of this study."

The analysis reveals that multi‐day oscillations are predominantly driven by PW normal modes (NMs), which exhibit distinct seasonal variations and statistical association with Sudden Stratospheric Warming events. Specifically, a prominent 6‐day NM emerges in April, followed by dominant 4‐ and 2‐day NMs persisting until June, with subsequent peaks of 2‐, 4‐, and 6‐day NMs extending from July to October. Furthermore, this study presents the first observational verification of the frequencies and zonal wavenumbers of over 10 secondary waves, arising from nonlinear interactions among planetary‐scale waves. A notable finding is the prevalence of non‐migrating components in the winter 24‐hr and summer 8‐hr tides, phenomena attributed to the nonlinear interactions.

To address this issue, we apply the moving correlation Empirical Orthogonal Function (MC‐EOF) between EASMP and ENSO, identifying a meridional tri‐pole pattern in the interdecadal variation of their relationship. The primary driver of this pattern is the summer Tropical North Atlantic (TNA) sea surface temperature, which has shifted from being uncorrelated to exhibiting a strong negative correlation with concurrent ENSO since the late 1980s. Consequently, the TNA's influence on EASMP combines with ENSO's effects, altering the EASMP pattern during ENSO events. This conclusion is supported by two observations: (a) the moving correlation series between TNA and ENSO aligns with the time series of MC‐EOF‐1, and (b) the MC‐EOF‐1 pattern spatially matches the TNA's impact on EASMP."

The downscaled results indicate that, by the end‐of‐century, there are no significant changes in the average minimum central pressures or total number of winter Arctic cyclones. However, there are significant changes in the spatial patterns. For example, the frequency and vorticity of cyclones tend to increase over the western Arctic. Due to the poleward movement of the polar frontal zone and the increased low‐level tropospheric baroclinicity, more cyclones are expected to form within the Arctic Basin and migrate into the western‐central Arctic. We expect about 39% more cyclone tracks forming and dying in the Arctic Basin under RCP8.5, compared to present climate. On the other hand, with the reduced baroclinicity in the entire troposphere, there is a reduced genesis, frequency, and vorticity of cyclones over the Atlantic Arctic. Moreover, the depth of cyclones shows a robust decrease over the Arctic Basin, suggesting weakened eddy kinetic energy. With increasing greenhouse gases, the changes in cyclone vorticities and their depths tend to be stronger. In addition, the high resolution Polar WRF results demonstrate that changes in cyclone track density and intensities consistently become more pronounced with increasing radiative forcing."

 Multijunction photovoltaics (PVs) are gaining prominence owing to their superior capability of achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) beyond the radiative limit of single-junction cells1-8, where improving narrow bandgap tin–lead perovskites is critical for thin-film devices9. With a focus on understanding the chemistry of tin–lead perovskite precursor solutions, we herein find that Sn(II) species dominate interactions with precursors and additives and uncover the exclusive role of carboxylic acid in regulating solution colloidal properties and film crystallisation, and ammonium in improving film optoelectronic properties. Materials that combine these two function groups, amino acid salts, considerably improve the semiconducting quality and homogeneity of perovskite films, surpassing the effect of the individual functional groups when introduced as part of separate molecules. Our enhanced tin–lead perovskite layer allows us to fabricate solar cells with PCEs of 23.9, 29.7 (certified 29.26%), and 28.7% for single-, double-, and triple-junction devices, respectively. Our 1-cm2 triple-junction devices show PCEs of 28.4% (certified 27.28%). Encapsulated triple-junction cells maintain 80% of their initial efficiencies after 860 h maximum power point tracking in ambient.

Here, the authors use Micro-C to study the T. brucei genome architecture at high resolution and reveal an intricate network of inter-chromosomal transcription hub structures. 
 The eukaryotic nucleus exhibits a highly organized 3D genome architecture, with RNA transcription and processing confined to specific nuclear structures. While intra-chromosomal interactions, such as promoter-enhancer dynamics, are well-studied, the role of inter-chromosomal interactions remains poorly understood. Investigating these interactions in mammalian cells is challenging due to large genome sizes and the need for deep sequencing. Additionally, transcription-dependent 3D topologies in mixed cell populations further complicate analyses. To address these challenges, we used high-resolution DNA-DNA contact mapping (Micro-C) in Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite with continuous RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription and polycistronic transcription units (PTUs). With approximately 300 transcription start sites (TSSs), this genome organization simplifies data interpretation. To minimize scaffolding artifacts, we also generated a highly contiguous phased genome assembly using ultra-long sequencing reads. Our Micro-C analysis revealed an intricate 3D genome organization. While the T. brucei genome displays features resembling chromosome territories, its chromosomes are arranged around polymerase-specific transcription hubs. RNAPI-transcribed genes cluster, as expected from their localization to the nucleolus. However, we also found that RNAPII TSSs form distinct inter-chromosomal transcription hubs with other RNAPII TSSs. These findings highlight the evolutionary significance of inter-chromosomal transcription hubs and provide new insights into genome organization in T. brucei. Decoding the role of inter-chromosomal DNA-DNA interactions remains challenging.

 Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is a neuropathogenic alphavirus which is of interest both as a model neurotropic alphavirus and as an oncolytic virus with proven potency in preclinical cancer models. In laboratory mice, peripherally administered SFV infiltrates the central nervous system (CNS) and causes encephalitis of varying severity. The route of SFV CNS entrance is poorly understood but has been considered to occur through the blood-brain barrier. Here we show that neuroinvasion of intravenously administered SFV is strictly dependent on very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) which acts as an entry receptor for SFV. Moreover, SFV primarily enters the CNS through the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (B-CSF) barrier via infecting choroid plexus epithelial cells which show distinctly high expression of VLDLR. This is the first indication of neurotropic alphavirus utilizing choroid plexus for CNS entry, and VLDLR playing a specific and crucial role for mediating SFV entry through this pathway.

 The native extracellular matrix is continuously remodeled to form complex interconnected network structures that reversibly regulate stem cell behaviors. Both regulation and understanding of its intricate dynamicity can help to modulate numerous cell behaviors. However, neither of these has yet been achieved due to the lack of designing and modeling such complex structures with dynamic controllability. Here we report modularity-based mathematical modeling of extracellular matrix-emulating ligand inter-cluster connectivity using the graph theory. Increasing anisotropy of magnetic nano-blockers proportionately disconnects arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ligand-to-ligand interconnections and decreases the number of ligand inter-cluster edges. This phenomenon deactivates stem cells, which can be partly activated by linearizing the nano-blockers. Remote cyclic elevation of high-anisotropy nano-blockers flexibly generates nano-gaps under the nano-blockers and augments the number of ligand inter-cluster edges. Subsequently, integrin-presenting stem cell infiltration is stimulated, which reversibly intensifies focal adhesion and mechanotransduction-driven differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Designing and systemically modeling extracellular matrix-mimetic geometries opens avenues for unraveling dynamic cell-material interactions for tissue regeneration.

 Mirror-image proteins, composed of d-amino acids, are an attractive therapeutic modality, as they exhibit high metabolic stability and lack immunogenicity. Development of mirror-image binding proteins is achieved through chemical synthesis of d-target proteins, phage display library selection of l-binders and chemical synthesis of (mirror-image) d-binders that consequently bind the physiological l-targets. Monobodies are well-established synthetic (l-)binding proteins and their small size (~90 residues) and lack of endogenous cysteine residues make them particularly accessible to chemical synthesis. Here, we develop monobodies with nanomolar binding affinities against the d-SH2 domain of the leukemic tyrosine kinase BCR::ABL1. Two crystal structures of heterochiral monobody-SH2 complexes reveal targeting of the pY binding pocket by an unconventional binding mode. We then prepare potent d-monobodies by either ligating two chemically synthesized d-peptides or by self-assembly without ligation. Their proper folding and stability are determined and high-affinity binding to the l-target is shown. d-monobodies are protease-resistant, show long-term plasma stability, inhibit BCR::ABL1 kinase activity and bind BCR::ABL1 in cell lysates and permeabilized cells. Hence, we demonstrate that functional d-monobodies can be developed readily. Our work represents an important step towards possible future therapeutic use of d-monobodies when combined with emerging methods to enable cytoplasmic delivery of monobodies. In this work, the authors develop mirror-image monobodies (Mb) made of D-amino acids against the BCR::ABL1 SH2 domain with high binding affinities.

 The North Atlantic Tripole sea surface temperature anomaly (NAT SSTA) is critical for predicting climate in Eurasia. Predictions for summer climate anomalies currently assume the NAT SSTA phase persists from boreal winter through summer. When NAT phase switches, predictions become unreliable. However, the NAT phase sustained/reversal mechanism from boreal winter to spring remains unclear. This study demonstrates that the evolution of the NAT phase could be driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). When NAO phase persists (switches) during preceding boreal winter, the NAO-driven wind anomalies favor maintenance (transition) of NAT phase by causing sea surface heat flux anomalies. Meanwhile, NAT SSTA causes eddy-mean flow interaction by increasing atmospheric baroclinity, thereby generating positive feedback on the former NAO phase. The NAO phase change is leading 1–3 months for the NAT phase. These findings deepen our understanding of the interaction between NAO and NAT and provide implications for seasonal prediction in Eurasia."

 Farmworkers, the frontline workers of our food system, are often exposed to heat stress that is likely to increase in frequency and severity due to climate change. Irrigation can either alleviate or exacerbate heat stress, quantification of which is crucial in intensely irrigated agricultural lands such as the Imperial Valley in southern California. We investigate the impact of irrigation on wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT), a key indicator of heat exposure in humans, using a validated high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) regional climate model, during day and night and in different seasons. We find that irrigation reduces WBGT by 0.3–1.3  °C during the daytime in summer due to strong evaporative cooling. However, during the summer nights, irrigation increases WBGT by 0.4–1.3 °C, when a large increase in humidity sufficiently raises the wet-bulb temperature. Urban and fallow areas adjacent to cropped fields also experience increased heat stress due to moisture advection from irrigated areas.

 Formation of granite-hosted tin deposits reflects the differentiation and maturation of continental crust. While rare in Earth’s early continental crust, the eastern Kaapvaal Craton in southern Africa may harbor the oldest known tin-bearing granites. Here we present a perspective of early continental evolution from the study of Archean detrital cassiterite from the volcano-sedimentary continental cover succession of the Dominion Group of the western Kaapvaal Craton. The cassiterites yield a concordia age of 3084.7 ± 2.3 million-year-old, representing the oldest detrital cassiterite ever found. They are enriched in hafnium, zirconium, niobium, and tantalum, depleted in tungsten, and have overall consistent δ18O values (mostly 3‒5‰) but heterogeneous δ122/118Sn values (−0.59 to 0.79‰). They likely originated from erosion of peraluminous granites, forming immediate basement of the Dominion Group. The occurrence of ~3.08 billion-year-old detrital cassiterite suggests widespread tin mineralization in the granites, the intrusion of which led to stabilization of the Kaapvaal craton.

 Inland lakes are a crucial source of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The interconnected river-lake systems feature multiple lake regions, wherein numerous rivers interconnect various lake regions. Their intricate hydrological conditions and interactions distinguish them from conventional lakes, which typically have a single and relatively static water body. However, the greenhouse gas emission characteristics, as well as the driving forces of the interconnected river-lake systems, are still under-researched. Here, we carried out bi-seasonal in situ surveys across a typical interconnected river-lake system, Dongting Lake, along with a meta-analysis derived from 168 lakes spanning six continents, to elucidate this issue. We found that interconnected river-lake systems exhibit a unique temporal variation in carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide fluxes, with positive fluxes during the wet season but transitioning to sinks during the dry season. Greenhouse gas fluxes in conventional stable lakes are frequently correlated with abiotic factors, such as hydro-climatological conditions and trophic status. While in Dongting Lake, specific microbial species that are important to the cycling of macronutrients and other less common nutrients, alongside microbial predatory behaviour, can better predict greenhouse gas fluxes. Our study highlights the importance of biotic predictors in prospective greenhouse gases flux estimates.

 The peak structure of relationships between extreme precipitation intensity (EPI) and temperature has triggered increasing attention. However, investigations into the correlation between extreme precipitation frequency (EPF) and temperature are relatively scarce. Leveraging an extensive dataset of daily precipitation and temperature data from 3825 grids over the 1961–2019 period, our research analyzes the EPI-temperature (EPI-T) and EPF-temperature (EPF-T) relationships at 11 Climate Zones in China. The investigation affirms the presence of peak structures in both EPI-T and EPF-T relationships in all Climate Zones. Significant differences are observed between these two relationships. Asymmetry characterizes the peak structures, with EPI and EPF occurrences more dominant at the low-temperature condition. Spatial disparities in peak structures are more distinct for EPI-T compared to EPF-T. The study also identifies significant spatial differences in the corresponding temperatures at the peaks of EPI (EPIpeaks) and EPF (EPFpeaks), with the highest and lowest peaks distributed in Southeastern China (>20 °C) and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau regions (<10 °C), respectively. Our results highlight that EPF peaks tend to occur at higher temperature conditions than EPI peaks. The peaks of EPI and EPF, as well as the temperatures at these peaks, are likely to increase in response to global warming. Most Climate Zones may experience more intense extreme precipitation peaks and higher associated temperatures in the future.

However, potential mechanisms remain to be elucidated. Herein, a 3T3-L1 adipocyte model was used to explore the dynamic changes in adipocyte differentiation (2, 4, and 8 days) under PFOA and HFPO–DA exposure. PFOA and HFPO–DA increased the adipocyte formation rate and intracellular levels of triglycerides (TG). Meanwhile, adipocyte browning was induced by PFOA and HFPO–DA, which was characterized by small lipid droplets, low levels of TG per adipocyte, increased ATP levels, and elevated mitochondrial respiration activities with time-dependent differentiation. The browning potency indexes of PFOA and HFPO–DA were approximately 1.5 times higher than those of the controls. Time-course transcriptomics analysis showed that PFOA and HFPO–DA activated the biological process of adipocyte browning but different gene expression patterns regulated adipocyte browning. Only overexpressed hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA synthase (Hmgcs2) was shared between PFOA and HFPO–DA groups from 2 to 8 days. Hmgcs2 could regulate adipocyte browning induced by PFOA and HFPO–DA, and this observation was lost when Hmgcs2 was knocked down.

Specifically, calorimetry measurements show that PFOA at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM lowers DPPC’s gel–liquid crystalline transition enthalpy by several J/g without changing the transition temperature (Tgel-LC), and dynamic light scattering (DLS) data illustrate that PFOA markedly broadens the size distribution of DPPC vesicles. Furthermore, DLS results from PFOA-containing, DPPC vesicle solutions also contain smaller objects having diameters of 30–50 nm. Close inspection of cryo-EM images reveals that DPPC vesicles formed in the presence of PFOA are multilamellar and the smaller objects have a clear bilayer structure similar to niosomes. A consequence of these PFOA-induced changes to DPPC bilayer structure is that the bilayers themselves are more susceptible to secondary solute accumulation. Time resolved emission measurements of Coumarin 152 (C152) report that C152 is 3-fold more likely to partition into the bilayer’s acyl chain, hydrophobic interior when PFOA is present, and fluorescence lifetimes from C152 partitioned into the polar region of the lipid bilayer show evidence of PFOA-induced membrane hydration below Tgel-LC."

However, the precise engineering of such catalytic systems toward PT decontamination is still challenging, and the conventional SACs are plagued by low structural stability of carbon material support. Here, we adopted magnesium oxide (MgO) as a structurally stable alternative for loading single copper (Cu) atoms to drive peroxymonosulfate-based Fenton-like reactions. Through fine-tuning the Cu atom steric location from lattice-embedding to surface-loading, the system exhibited a fundamental transition in the catalytic pathways toward the PT process and drastically improved decontamination efficiency. The catalytic pathway change was mainly ascribed to a downshifted d-band center of the Cu atoms. The optimized catalyst achieved complete, rapid removal of phenolic compounds from water via nearly 100% PT pathway, accompanied by high oxidant utilization efficiency surpassing most state-of-the-art SACs. Moreover, it showed excellent structural stability and environmental robustness and was successfully used for the treatment of lake water and industrial coking wastewater.

The speciation of phosphorus (P), calcium (Ca), and potassium (K) in fire ash from five globally distributed ecosystems was characterized by using X-ray absorption spectroscopy and sequential fractionation. Aqueous dissolution of the macronutrients was measured by batch experiments at acidic and alkaline pHs. The results showed that P existed mainly as Ca phosphates, Ca as double carbonates, calcite, and sulfates, and most K was associated with Ca carbonates. Mineralogy and the relative abundance of the species were primarily controlled by elemental stoichiometry and fire temperature. Differences in Ca and P speciation existed between ash and smoke from laboratory burning, possibly caused by the temperature difference and/or mass fractionation during burning. The rates, extents, and pH dependencies of macronutrient dissolution differed among macronutrients and depended on their speciation, with K being highly soluble and the P and Ca regulated by solution pH. The variability in ash macronutrient chemistry and ecosystem-specific fire ash loads resulted in varying loads and availability of individual macronutrient from fire among ecosystems.

Moreover, TDtBPP exposure downregulated the expression of hsd3b1 in vivo and in vitro and subsequently inhibited the synthesis of androgens in zebrafish testes and Leydig cells. This inhibition of androgen synthesis appeared to be responsible for the observed reproductive toxicity in male fish. Molecular docking and dual-luciferase reporter gene experiments elucidated that TDtBPP inhibited the promotion of vitamin D on hsd3b1 transcription by the vitamin D receptor and thus downregulated the expression of hsd3b1. Our findings provide first time evidence that TDtBPP poses a risk to male fish reproduction at environmentally relevant levels."

Current mitigation strategies predominantly focus on reducing the availability of inorganic Hg (IHg) for Hg methylation, achieved primarily through Hg emission control and in situ Hg immobilization. While these IHg-targeted approaches have effectively reduced MeHg bioaccumulation and subsequent human exposure, their efficacy is largely undermined by Hg transformations and fluctuating environmental conditions due to the complex and protracted pathway linking IHg from environmental sources to MeHg at the point of human exposure. In light of recent advancements in MeHg-related transformations, we emphasize the development of MeHg-targeted strategies to improve the overall efficiency of Hg risk management in rice-paddy systems. MeHg-targeted strategies include microbial regulation to diminish net MeHg production, facilitating MeHg demethylation in soils, and promoting the in vivo MeHg degradation within rice plants. Although these approaches are still in their nascent stages, they hold significant promise due to their potential high mitigation efficacy and reduced uncertainties, owing to the shorter pathway between MeHg production and human exposure. Integrating IHg- and MeHg-targeted strategies offers a comprehensive and synergistic approach, paving the way for more effective mitigation of human exposure to MeHg in rice-paddy systems."

A high‐resolution simulation of the historical climate in Alaska can provide an important benchmark for climate change studies. In this study, we utilized the Regional Arctic System Model (RASM) and conducted coupled land‐atmosphere modeling for Alaska and Yukon River Basin at 4‐km grid spacing. In RASM, the land model was replaced with the Community Terrestrial Systems Model (CTSM) given its comprehensive process representations for cold regions. The microphysics schemes in the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) atmospheric model were manually tuned for optimal model performance. This study aims to maintain good model performance for both hydroclimate and terrestrial hydrology, especially streamflow, which was rarely a priority in coupled models. Therefore, we implemented a strategy of iterative testing and optimization of CTSM. A multi‐decadal climate data set (1990–2021) was generated using RASM with optimized land parameters and manually tuned WRF microphysics. When evaluated against multiple observational data sets, this data set well captures the climate statistics and spatial distributions for five key weather variables and hydrologic fluxes, including precipitation, air temperature, snow fraction, evaporation‐to‐precipitation ratios, and streamflow. The simulated precipitation shows wet bias during the spring season and simulated air temperatures exhibit dampened seasonality with warm biases in winter and cold biases in summer. We used transfer entropy to investigate the discrepancy in connectivity of hydrologic and energy fluxes between the offline CTSM and coupled models, which contributed to their discrepancy in streamflow simulations."

Based on three experiments with low aerosol concentration background (“Low”), medium aerosol concentration background (“Medium”), and high aerosol concentration background (“High”), the effects of hydrophilic aerosol serving as Cloud Condensation Nuclei (CCN) on microphysical and precipitation processes are investigated. Results indicate the impact of hydrophilic aerosol on clouds and precipitation structure exhibits structural difference. Aerosol increases from “Low” to “Medium”, precipitation in middle circle of SWV decreases, precipitation in outer circle of SWV increases. Because the outer circle of SWV with strong convection competes with the middle circle of SWV for liquid droplets, leading to a reduction in ice‐phase particles in middle circle of SWV. In contrast, more ice‐phase particles are formed in outer circle of SWV. The increased ice‐phase particles melt into raindrops, leading to an increase in precipitation. Aerosol increases from “Medium” to “High”, precipitation in middle circle of SWV increases, precipitation in outer circle of SWV decreases. The size of liquid droplets formed in outer circle of SWV further becomes smaller. This is not conducive to the formation of ice‐phase particles, leading to weaker convection, which makes it becomes less competitive. A large number of small cloud droplets in middle circle of SWV are transported above the freezing layer and participate in the formation of ice‐phase particles.

The leading mode is characterized by positive SLP anomalies over the East Asia‐Northwest Pacific region. Inter‐model regression analyses reveal the relationship between the leading mode and historical sea surface temperature (SST). The inter‐model uncertainties of the NWPSH projections are closely related to the historical tropical North Atlantic (TNA) cold SST anomalies. The TNA cold SST anomalies result in increased precipitation in the subtropical North Pacific through westward propagated Rossby wave responses, further enhancing the subtropical North Pacific cold SST anomalies in the future through the reinforced convection‐shortwave‐SST negative feedback. Suppressed convection over the subtropical North Pacific strengthens the NWPSH through the anticyclonic Rossby wave response. The emergent constraints based on the observed TNA SST pattern reduce the uncertainties of the NWPSH projections by 32.5%, indicating a weaker NWPSH compared to the multi‐model mean. Cold biases of the simulated present‐day TNA SST in most CMIP6 models indicate that the multi‐model ensemble mean (MME) may overestimate the intensity of NWPSH in the warmer future. This study helps improve the accuracy of NWPSH projections, contributing to climate change adaptations for many important sectors impacted by NWPSH variation, such as agriculture, infrastructure, and energy."

 Remote Sensing Image (RSI) scene classification plays a pivotal role in diverse applications such as land cover mapping, urban planning, and environmental monitoring. Traditional deep learning approaches, however, heavily rely on abundant labeled data, which is often costly and challenging to acquire. Semi-supervised learning emerges as a cost-effective alternative, yet existing methods frequently overlook the intricate characteristics of remote sensing data, such as multi-scale features and complex spatial patterns, thereby limiting their ability to effectively address these challenges. In this study, a novel Scene Semi-Supervised Method (SSSM) is introduced, marking a significant advancement in both network architecture and semi-supervised techniques. At the core of the SSSM framework lies the Multi-Level Feature Fusion Network (MFFN), meticulously designed to extract and integrate complex features from remote sensing data across diverse scales and locations. To optimize the utilization of pseudo-labels and minimize mislabeling, the Pseudo-Label Multi-Level Sampling strategy (PMLS) is proposed, a probabilistic approach that selectively identifies high-quality pseudo-labels to enhance training. Rigorous experiments conducted on three benchmark datasets reveal that the SSSM method significantly improves classification accuracy, achieving an increase of 3%–5% on a specific dataset compared to existing approaches. This accomplishment underscores the effectiveness of the MFFN design and the semi-supervised strategy in tackling the complexities of remote sensing scene classification.

 Accurate identification and classification of tree species on a large scale are crucial for the effective management of urban green spaces; however, previous research combining airborne sensors such as LiDAR and hyperspectral imaging for tree classification has generally focused on smaller areas or specific sites, with limited studies applying this approach at the city-wide scale. This study focuses on the utilization of multi-temporal airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) and hyperspectral imaging (HSI) data for the classification of 10 species of urban trees at the city scale, which collectively cover over 95 % of the tree-covered areas within the city. Our objective is to evaluate the utility of metrics and indices derived from LiDAR (leaf-on/leaf-off) and HSI (peak growing season/autumn senescence) data in a 35.86 km2 urban green space in Gwacheon, Republic of Korea. A comprehensive set of 15 independent variables was extracted from preprocessed and calibrated airborne LiDAR data (footprint size: 0.46 m, density: 42.7 points/m2) and HSI data (127 bands, 400–970 nm range, spatial resolution: 0.68 m) to train seven machine learning classifiers. The model was trained on a stratified random sample of 21,826 tree crown polygon samples collected from individual trees surveyed. The results showed that the combination of airborne LiDAR and HSI data from two seasons achieved the highest classification accuracy with the light gradient boosting machine (LGBM) classifier (90.6 %; Kappa: 0.895) for all 10 major tree species across the entire city, especially for Ginkgo, American sycamore, and Yoshino cherry. Among all variables, the maximum tree height (Hmax) and the intersection symmetric difference ratio index (ISDRI) were among the top influential factors for tree species classification accuracy. Hmax, with an importance value of 0.490, is particularly effective due to the characteristics of urban green spaces. ISDRI, with an importance value of 0.336, highlights seasonal leaf volume differences, aiding in species differentiation. The spectral indices acquired during the autumn leaf senescence showed a cumulative shapley additive explanations (SHAP) importance score that was 0.374 points higher than that of the leaf-on period, highlighting the enhanced significance of hyperspectral data from the leaf senescence phase in classifying tree species. The synergistic integration of airborne LiDAR, HSI, and seasonal data gathered during key phenological periods, along with relevant indices, will contribute significantly to urban forest management at the city-wide level."

The results revealed that all three greenhouse gases exhibited an increase over the study period, with interannual growth rates of 5.249 ± 0.255 ppb/yr for CH4, 2.24 ± 0.027 ppm/yr for CO2, and 0.894 ± 0.015 ppb/yr for N2O. Significant seasonal variations were observed for each gas: CH4 concentrations were elevated from June to September, displaying an obvious unimodal distribution. For CO2, peak concentrations occurred in April and the lowest in August, also following a unimodal distribution. The N2O exhibited two peaks in March and October, with a trough in June, indicating a bimodal single-trough distribution. Comparative seasonal analysis with two other northern hemisphere stations (LMP and NWR) showed that the seasonal variation of CO2 demonstrates stronger global consistency, whereas the seasonal characteristics of CH4 and N2O reflect regional differences.

From the perspective of anthropogenic emission sources of O3 precursors (NOX and VOCS), the Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) method is explored to carry out the causation analysis and the Empirical Kinetics Modeling Approach (EKMA) is used for sensitivity analysis. A causation FTA model is established for excessive emission of O3 precursors, the key risk factors are identified, and a quantitative probability calculation strategy is proposed for the risk factors.

 Cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activation plays a crucial role in regional cloud-precipitation and global climate. However, inaccuracies in CCN activation parameterization, stemming from the presence of unactivated particles in CCN measurements that are mistakenly included in developing CCN activation parameterizations, can introduce biases in model predictions of cloud droplet number concentration, subsequently affecting cloud microphysics, precipitation initiation, and radiation. To address this issue, this study proposes correction coefficients for CCN activation parameterization using the Twomey power-law function and applies them in the large-eddy model to simulate continental shallow cumulus over the Southern Great Plains, USA. Results reveal that compared to simulations using uncorrected CCN parameterization, those using corrected parameterization decrease cloud droplet number concentration by 32.8 %, leading to an increase of cloud water autoconversion rate by 8.9 % and a decrease of cloud optical thickness by 17.3 %. This indicates a suppression of cloud-precipitation processes and an overestimation of cloud radiative cooling in the default scheme. Moreover, as aerosol loading increases, the differences between the corrected and uncorrected parameterization slightly diminish. Compared to uncorrected CCN parameterization, those using corrected parameterization exhibit stronger cloud sensitivity to aerosols, which partially mitigates the overestimation of cloud radiative cooling in the default scheme. The corrected CCN activation parameterization could help alleviate the overestimation of aerosol indirect effects, particularly in clouds with low supersaturation conditions, thereby contributing to reduced uncertainties in aerosol-cloud interaction simulations.Short summaryCloud condensation nuclei (CCN) are particles that help clouds form, but inaccuracies in measuring them can lead to errors in predicting cloud behavior. This study introduces a correction for CCN activation in models, showing that the uncorrected parameterization can significantly overestimate cloud droplet numbers. The corrected approach provides more accurate predictions, reducing uncertainties in weather and climate models and enhancing our understanding of how aerosols interact with clouds."

High CO2driven low pH in the context of ocean acidification (OA) has been shown to severely affect various calcifiers, but less is known about the extent to which low pH influences sex determination and reproduction of marine organisms, particularly mollusks. This study is the first to report a biased sex ratio over multiple generations toward females, driven by exposure to high CO2-induced low pH environments, using the ecologically and economically important Portuguese oyster (Crassostrea angulata) as a model. This phenomenon, which we term pH-mediated sex determination (PSD), has no consequences for fecundity, gonadal development, or reproductive function in the offspring. Moreover, PSD persisted into a second year of reproduction and was inherited across multiple generations. Transcriptomic analysis indicates PSD is associated with the activation of the Wnt signaling pathway in females and inhibition of spermiogenesis-related functions in males.

China held ∼34 Mt of in-use BPA stock in 2022 (∼24 kg per capita), with no indication of reaching saturation. BPA release occurred throughout its lifecycle, and soil and water were primary sinks. Aquatic BPA concentrations exceeded the limit in national pollutant emission standards in ∼8.4% of Chinese mainland areas in 2022, and ∼4.5% of areas suffered very high chronic ecological risks to aquatic organisms. Scenario analysis indicates that a 90% reduction in BPA emission factors would be required to avoid BPA contamination in all areas of focus. Our findings contribute as a scientific basis for sustainable plastic management and highlight the need for updated techniques, intensified monitoring, and standardized regulations."

While previous studies primarily focused on PAH concentrations, the impacts of PAH self-clustering have been largely overlooked, which will lead to inaccurate assessments of their ecological risks. This study evaluates the toxic effects of four prevalent PAH clusters on microbes with an emphasis on comparing the cluster sizes. Results revealed that over 95% of PAHs can form clusters in the aquatic environment, with smaller clusters more likely to form at lower concentrations and with fewer benzene rings. To quantify the toxic effects and understand underlying mechanisms, single-cell Raman-D2O was employed to link bacterial phenotypes with transcriptomic profiles. Bacteria exposed to smaller PAH clusters showed a 1%–10% reduction in metabolic activity, which was associated with a 1.8–2.9-fold increase in intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, when exposed to smaller PAH clusters, the expression of genes related to the ROS response and efflux pumps was upregulated by up to 6.33-fold and 4.97-fold, respectively, suggesting that smaller PAH clusters pose greater toxicity to microbes. These findings underscore the potentially overlooked risks of PAH clusters in environmental systems and deepen our understanding of the environmental fate and ecological risks of these contaminants."

However, the impact of MPs on the transfer of ARGs in wastewater treatment remains unclear. This study investigated the roles and mechanisms of conventional (polystyrene, PS) and biodegradable (polylactic acid, PLA) MPs in the conjugative transfer of ARGs during ultraviolet disinfection. The results showed that MPs significantly facilitated the conjugative transfer of ARGs compared with individual ultraviolet disinfection, and PSMPs exhibited higher facilitation than PLAMPs. The facilitation effects were attributed to light shielding and the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nanoplastics from ultraviolet irradiation of MPs. The light shielding of MPs protected the bacteria and ARGs from ultraviolet inactivation. More importantly, ROS and nanoplastics generated from irradiated MPs induced intracellular oxidative stress on bacteria and further increased the cell membrane permeability and intercellular contact, ultimately enhancing the ARG exchange. The greater fragmentation of PSMPs than PLAMPs resulted in a higher intracellular oxidative stress and a stronger enhancement. This study highlights the concerns of conventional and biodegradable MPs associated with the transfer of ARGs during wastewater treatment, which provides new insights into the combined risks of MPs and ARGs in the environment."

Due to their large number and diversity, extractable organofluorine (EOF) has been employed as a sum parameter measurement to capture known and unknown PFAS in environmental samples. However, current methods for determining drinking water EOF perform poorly for trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) and provide limited insights into the nature of unidentified fluorine occurring in samples. To address this, we developed and validated a solid-phase extraction procedure for EOF determination in drinking water with improved TFA recovery, which removes and/or accounts for different species of inorganic fluorine. The method produces two fractions: one containing mostly polar fluorinated substances (e.g., TFA, tetrafluoroborate, and trifluoromethanesulfonate) and another containing longer-chain PFAS. Hexafluorophosphate was distributed across both fractions. Application of the method to Stockholm drinking water revealed a closed fluorine mass balance in fraction I, predominantly (93%) consisting of TFA. In fraction II, however, 67% of the fluorine was unidentified, pointing to unknown fluorinated substance(s) with similar physical–chemical properties to PFAS in this fraction (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonate). In addition to providing clues for identifying EOF, the method improves estimation of “PFAS Total” for comparison to limits under the European Drinking Water Directive."

This study is the first to quantify and characterize atmospheric MP deposition in the Eastern United States. Passive sampling was conducted at two locations within the Eastern United States, specifically in remote South Central Appalachia, from March to September 2023. Each location had five sampling periods, with collections over a 21 day period. Samples were processed to remove biological material, and the presence of MPs was confirmed using Raman spectroscopy to match particles based on polymer similarity. The relative average atmospheric MP deposition in South Central Appalachia was determined to be 68 MPs m–2 d–1. Most verified MPs were fibers, and the most abundant polymer type identified was poly(ethylene terephthalate) PETE. This study’s average MP deposition rate is qualitatively comparable to rates reported in other studies that employed a similar methodology in a similar landscape. Scaling up our measured deposition rate to all of South Central Appalachia, an area of over 94,000 km2 and home to five million people, suggests a yearly MP deposition of approximately 321 metric tonnes.

The summers of 2018 and 2022 are two examples with record‐breaking temperatures leading to thousands of heat‐related excess deaths in Europe. Some of the extreme temperatures experienced during these summers were predictable several weeks in advance by subseasonal forecasts. Subseasonal forecasts provide weather predictions from 2 weeks to 2 months ahead, offering advance planning capabilities. Nevertheless, there is only limited assessment of the potential for heat‐health warning systems at a regional level on subseasonal timescales. Here we combine methods of climate epidemiology and subseasonal forecasts to retrospectively predict the 2018 and 2022 heat‐related mortality for the cantons of Zurich and Geneva in Switzerland. The temperature‐mortality association for these cantons is estimated using observed daily temperature and mortality during summers between 1990 and 2017. The temperature‐mortality association is subsequently combined with bias‐corrected subseasonal forecasts at a spatial resolution of 2‐km to predict the daily heat‐related mortality counts of 2018 and 2022. The mortality predictions are compared against the daily heat‐related mortality estimated based on observed temperature during these two summers. Heat‐related mortality peaks occurring for a few days can be accurately predicted up to 2 weeks ahead, while longer periods of heat‐related mortality lasting a few weeks can be anticipated 3 to even 4 weeks ahead.

 Leaf-wood separation plays an important role in estimating aboveground biomass (AGB) of trees from terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) point clouds. Yet, leaf-wood separation studies have predominantly focused on reporting the accuracy of leaf and wood point separation. Assessments of the impact of these algorithms on the subsequent AGB estimations, based on commonly used quantitative structure models (QSMs), have been limited. Therefore, in this study, we quantified the impact of 11 published leaf-wood separation algorithms on QSM-based tree AGB estimation using an independent benchmarking dataset. The benchmarking dataset consists of AGB measured for 20 destructively harvested trees from a mixed temperate forest in Harvard Forest and AGB estimated from QSMs built on manually segmented tree point clouds of 856 broadleaved trees in Wytham Woods under leaf-off conditions. These benchmarking AGB values were compared to the AGB estimated from QSMs built on the leaf-removed point clouds resulting from the different separation algorithms performed on the leaf-on tree point clouds of the same trees. The results of the study indicated that for most of the algorithms, the leaf-removed AGB estimates for both coniferous and broadleaved trees underestimated the AGB (conifers: −17 % to −3 %, broadleaf: −14 % to −2 %) compared to the destructively measured AGB in Harvard Forest. In Wytham Woods, leaf-removed AGB estimates from all separation algorithms consistently underestimated the AGB (−46 % to −24 %) compared to the AGB from the leaf-off point clouds. Most leaf-wood separation algorithms performed better on broadleaved trees than on coniferous trees. Moreover, significant differences were observed among different algorithms in estimating AGB for trees of the same forest type. For coniferous trees, the relative difference (RD) of leaf-removed AGB estimates from QSMs and separation algorithms ranged from −27 % to 16 %, among which the best performing algorithms demonstrated similar optimal performance, with small RD values of approximately −3 % to 2 %. For broadleaved trees, the leaf-removed AGB estimates from QSMs and eight separation algorithms, as well as leaf-off point cloud estimates (approximately at 10 %), were closely in agreement with the harvested benchmark values, among which the best performing algorithms had a RD value approximately within ±2 %. Additionally, most separation algorithms could lead to better estimates of trunk biomass than branch biomass, whereas the estimation for branch biomass consistently exhibited varying degrees of underestimation. These findings provide a timely reference for utilizing leaf-wood separation algorithms for QSM-based AGB estimation."

 Air pollution, a major global issue, comprises various solid and gaseous pollutants in urban environments, including particulate matter (PM) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, and isomeric xylenes (BTEX) constitute about 80% of VOC emissions, primarily from vehicle exhaust, tobacco smoke, petrol, paints, adhesives, and solvents, posing significant health risks including carcinogenic effects.

This was done by evaluating primary DNA damage using the comet assay and associating it to measured air pollutants and to blood values of BTEX as a biomarker of exposure. Measured DNA damage was also associated with additional lifestyle factors and sociodemographic data. Statistically significant positive correlations between % tail DNA and air pollutants were observed only for daily average for pyrene, measured one day prior to blood sampling. Passive smokers showed significantly higher DNA damage levels compared to non-smokers.

Robinson,Standard fog collector and dual FM-120 comparisons,"•Upwind (free-stream) and leeward fog droplet spectra measurements from standard fog collectors. •Measurements of multiple efficiencies of field-based fog collectors. •Impact of environmental variables on fog collector efficiencies assessed. •First fog droplet spectra as part of fog collection deployment in Northern Hemisphere. •Comparison of results with those of previous studies in Chile. 
 For the first time in the northern hemisphere, extended measurements of fog droplet sizes and numbers were measured both upstream from and on the leeward side of a standard fog collector (SFC) using FM-120 optical spectrometers. These measurements, coupled with the water recorded by the standard fog collectors and accompanying meteorological data, have yielded efficiency measurements for field-based fog collectors for the first time in the northern hemisphere and only for the third time ever that we are aware of. Of note, two of these efficiencies are the ‘collector efficiency’ and the ‘mesh efficiency’. The collector efficiency is the ratio between the water draining from the collector and the upstream liquid water content (LWC) flux. This value describes the efficiency of the fog collector in collecting fog LWC. Using multiple-regression analysis, the collector efficiency has a significantly positive relationship with the mean volume diameter (MVD) (p = 0.0019), is negatively related with upstream LWC (p = 0.0012) and positively related with leeward LWC given all other variables held constant. The adjusted R-square of this regression model is 0.431. If we account for the interaction between upstream LWC and leeward LWC, which is statistically significant (p = 0.0219) given all other variables held constant, the adjusted R-square increases to 0.538. This interaction indicates that the positive relationship between collector efficiency and leeward LWC is significantly positive especially when the upstream LWC is low, but the positive relationship becomes weaker when the upstream LWC is high.The mesh efficiency describes the efficiency of the mesh in removing the fog LWC and it was calculated to have an average value of 35 % ± 19 %. It is equal to the difference between the LWC arriving at the surface of the SFC and what is measured behind the mesh all divided by the LWC arriving at the surface of the mesh. Like the collector efficiency, the mesh efficiency has a significantly positive relationship with the MVD (p = 0.0016), is positively related with upstream LWC (p = 0.0024) and is negatively related with leeward LWC (p = 0.0009) given all other variables held constant. In addition, the mesh efficiency is significantly related to the wind direction (p = 0.0003) in that it increases as the wind direction becomes more aligned with the SFC direction. This model has an adjusted R-square of 0.780. The interaction between the upwind and leeward LWC was not statistically significant for the mesh efficiency (p = 0.6521).Measurements from both FM-120 units generally indicate a clear reduction in the droplet numbers, MVD and LWC from the unperturbed ‘free-stream” fog on the upwind side of the SFC to the fog on the leeward side of the SFC, as would be expected. While the numbers of ∼5 μm droplets are reduced by the SFC to in some cases 50 % of their counts in the open-air fog, the volume of fog water reduced by the SFCs experiences its greatest reduction by the loss of relatively fewer droplets but at larger diameters that peak at around 25 μm. The droplets observed at this semi-coastal, low-elevation California location tend to have higher average diameters than those fog droplets observed at higher elevations in other studies done in Chile. Furthermore, the droplet numbers tend to be much lower at these sites compared to the higher-elevation sites at which studies in Chile took place, often close to 100 droplets per centimeter as compared to 300–500 droplets per centimeter in the Chilean studies. Similarly, despite the larger droplet sizes in the current study, the LWC in the coastal fogs observed in this study is typically at least a factor of 2 lower than that associated with the orographic fog observed in the Chilean studies."

Biochar is the most commonly sold form of CDR to date and it can be used in applications ranging from concrete to agricultural soil amendments. Previous analyses of biochar rely on modeled or estimated life-cycle data and suggest a cradle-to-gate range of 0.20–1.3 kg CO2 net removal per kg of biomass feedstock, with the range reported driven by differences in energy consumption, pyrolysis temperature, and feedstock sourcing. Herein, we quantify the distribution of CDR possible for biochar production with a compositional life-cycle inventory model paired with scenario-aware Monte Carlo simulation in a ‘best practice’ (incorporating lower transportation distances, high pyrolysis temperatures, high energy efficiency, recapture of energy for drying and pyrolysis energy requirements, and co-generation of heat and electricity) and ‘poor practice’ (higher transportation distances, lower pyrolysis temperatures, low energy efficiency, natural gas for energy requirements, and no energy recovery) scenarios. In the best-practice scenario, cradle-to-gate CDR (which is representative of the upper limit of removal across the entire life cycle) is highly certain, with a median removal of 1.4 kg of CO2e/kg biomass and results in net removal across the entire distribution. In contrast, the poor-practice scenario results in median net emissions of 0.090 kg CO2e/kg biomass. Whether this scenario emits (66% likelihood) or removes (34% likelihood) carbon dioxide is highly uncertain. The emission intensity of energy inputs to the pyrolysis process and whether the bio-oil co-product is used as a chemical feedstock or combusted are critical factors impacting the net carbon dioxide emissions of biochar production, together responsible for 98% of the difference between the best- and poor-practice scenarios."

Major attested hotspots include the Mediterranean, South and South-East Asia, and the Bohai Sea region in China. Approximately 87 Mha of cropland globally are vulnerable due to low elevation and coastal proximity, including regions where little to no literature has documented SWI. Main drivers include sea-level rise (SLR), drought, groundwater depletion, river modifications, tidal flooding and subsidence. Projections of SLR indicate cropland of North America, the Indian Subcontinent, and South-East Asia as high-risk for SWI. Additionally, regions like South-East Asia and the Indian Subcontinent are expected to experience significant demographic growth in coastal areas. Understanding present and future SWI dynamics is crucial for designing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies in coastal agriculture to support food supply."

Hence, we statistically downscaled and bias-corrected daily CMIP6 model outputs for continental Chile, using a multivariate bias correction method, to project climate changes under the SSP5-8.5 scenario. The results reveal that General Circulation Models (GCMs) project increased dryness across the study domain by the end of the 21st century, especially in Central Chile (−30% in precipitation), with notable sensitivities of precipitation projections to the implementation of bias correction methods in the northern and austral macrozones. Temperature projections show less dispersion, with higher increments in northern Chile and the Andes (4 ∘C–5 ∘C). Notable shifts in the extension of Köppen–Geiger climate classes are projected for the next decades, with the expansion of deserts in northern Chile and the prevalence of temperate climates with dry summers in central Chile. The Andes subdomain is expected to face the most dramatic changes in Köppen–Geiger classes (inter-model agreement 70%). Surprisingly, despite the large spread in GCM projections, there is high agreement among models regarding spatial changes in climate classes.

The findings reveal that sanctions have reduced the import dependency of sanctioned countries by about 6% on average. Notably, improving domestic production in sanctioned countries is instrumental in mitigating the adverse effects of sanctions on food security, but it increases the emissions of CH4, N2O, biomass burned and the use of fertilizer and pesticide, which destroys the domestic environmental sustainability.

Our results indicate that this 0.5 ∘C increase in global warming triggers an intensified reaction in both the Arctic’s mean sea surface temperature (SST) and variability. In a 2 ∘C warmer world, one out of every four summer months would be warmer than the current climate. We detect a nonlinear increase of MHW intensity in a 2 ∘C world, which is characterized by a break in slope occurring around the year 2042 ± 2 (across 50 ensemble members of the SSP5-8.5 scenario). At the estimated post-break dates, the intensity rate roughly doubles, leading to MHWs in a 2 ∘C world with average cumulative heat intensity 100 ∘C*days higher than in a 1.5 ∘C world. Further results reveal that an extremely rare MHW with an intensity of 3.19 ∘C, classified as a 1-in-100-year event in a 1.5 ∘C world, is expected to transform into a 1-in-7-year event in a 2 ∘C world. This transition signifies a ∼15-fold increase in the likelihood of such events occurring due to a 0.5 ∘C increase in global warming. Likewise, a rare occurrence of years featuring 125 MHW days in a 1.5 ∘C world is projected to become a 1-in-10-year event in a 2 ∘C world, resulting in a 10-fold increase in occurrence probability. The main contributor to these changes is predominantly the rise in mean SST, with enhanced SST variability playing a minor role. These findings highlight that a 2 ∘C world could lead to a substantial escalation of the frequency and intensity of MHWs in the Arctic compared to a 1.5 ∘C world, transforming what are currently rare extreme events into more common events, with significant implications for global climate dynamics and the well-being of Arctic ecosystems and communities."

This approach is gaining momentum in international forums and among development practitioners focused on improving the sustainability and efficiency of their water security interventions. Following this trend, the integration of market incentives to foster the uptake of WSTs is not surprising. However, recent literature on WSTs and related incentives paints an ambiguous picture of the impact these technologies can have. On one hand, there is evidence that supports the efficacy of market incentives in promoting water-saving practices and the adoption of WSTs. On the other hand, there are also concerns about the potential adverse consequences of introducing WSTs, including promoting unsustainable water consumption and exacerbating inequalities. This study focuses on Mercy Corps’ water innovation technologies program in Jordan, a country grappling with severe water scarcity. It specifically examines how market mechanisms played a crucial role in saving approximately 24 million cubic meters of water, equivalent to around 9500 Olympic-sized swimming pools. Driven by this significant achievement, the study delves deeper into the efficacy of market-based approaches, while also considering their potential limitations. The conclusion offers a critical perspective on how the promotion of WSTs through market-based approaches can ensure that water savings contribute to both environmental sustainability and human well-being. In particular, Mercy Corps’ practitioner perspective advocates for governance reforms that limit and prevent unsustainable consumption, facilitate and ensure equitable access to WSTs, and promote the fair redistribution of water savings across different users."

TPs leachate mainly contained Zn and 6-PPD, which could be absorbed by microalgae mostly, especially under MHWs. Additionally, TPs leachate increased the reactive oxygen species content, activated the antioxidant system, impaired photosynthesis and glycolysis, and decreased sugar and protein content. 10 mg/L TPs leachate increased the lipid content and saturation. Meanwhile, microalgae under such TPs leachate were biased toward the synthesis of long-chain fatty acids and Δ8 desaturation pathway.

However, their impacts on soil biogeochemical processes remain unclear. Here, we investigated the effects of TWP at various doses and their leachate on soil respiration and denitrification using a robotized continuous-flow incubation system in upland soil. Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and high-throughput sequencing were employed to elucidate the mechanisms underpinning the TWP effects. We show that TWP increased soil CO2, N2, and N2O emissions, which were attributed to the changes in content and composition of soil dissolved organic matter (DOM) induced by TWP and their leachate. Specifically, the labile DOM components (H/C ≥ 1.5 and transformation >10), which were crucial in shaping the denitrifying community, were significantly enriched by TWP exposure. Furthermore, the abundances of denitrification genes (nirK/S and nosZ-I) and the specific denitrifying genera Pseudomonas were increased following TWP exposure. Our findings provide new insights into impacts of TWP on carbon and nitrogen cycling in soil, highlighting that TWP exposure may exacerbate greenhouse gas emissions and fertilizer N loss, posing adverse effects on soil fertility in peri-urban areas and climate change mitigation."

This study investigated the distribution of 40 OPFRs in a river impacted by major industrial manufacturing plants in Eastern China by target analysis. Nontarget analysis using high-resolution mass spectrometry was further employed to identify novel organophosphorus compounds (NOPs). Thirty-four OPFRs were detected in river water samples, with total concentrations of 62.9–1.06 × 103 ng/L (median: 455 ng/L). Triphenylphosphine oxide and diphenyl phosphoric acid were ubiquitously detected up to 620 and 127 ng/L, respectively. Among 26 identified NOPs, 17 were reported for the first time in the environment, including 14 novel organophosphate esters (especially 4 heterocycles and 3 oligomers), 2 organophosphites, and an organophosphonate. Bis(2,4-di-tert-butylphenyl) hydrogen phosphate and 2,2-dimethylpropoxy(propyl)phosphinic acid with high predicted persistence or toxicity were widely detected, with semiquantified concentrations up to 990 and 1.0 × 103 ng/L, respectively. Structurally similar organophosphorus heterocycles exhibited consistent variation trends, suggesting a common emission source. Estimated annual river discharges to the sea were 20.6–37.0 kg/yr for OPFRs and 30.8–161 kg/yr for NOPs.

Previously reported models have achieved relatively good performance, but due to scarce data (<1400 records), the applicability domain (AD) has been significantly limited. To address this limitation, we curated a much larger experimental data set (Primary data set), which contains 2358 kinetic records. We then employed both the group contribution method (GCM) and a semisupervised learning (SSL) strategy to add new data points, aiming to effectively expand the model’s AD while improving model performance. The results indicated that GCM improved the model’s performance for chemicals outside the AD, while SSL expanded the model’s AD. The final model, after incorporating 147,168 new data points, achieved an R2 = 0.77, root-mean-square-error = 0.32, and mean-absolute-error = 0.24 on the test set. Importantly, the AD was expanded by 117% compared to the model developed solely based on the Primary data set, and the final model can be reliably applied to more than 560,000 chemicals from the DSSTox database. Further model interpretation results indicated that the model made predictions based on a correct “understanding” of the impact of key substituents and reactive sites toward HO•. This research provides an effective method for augmenting data sets, which is important in improving ML model performance and expanding AD.

Assuming an MgSO4 ocean, we show that salt layers, formed through the freezing of subsurface liquid water reservoirs, can be detected by ice‐penetrating radar instruments on Europa Clipper and JUICE. Furthermore, because these features are thermodynamically stable within the minimally attenuating portion of Europa's ice shell, referred to here as the “pellucid region,” they could produce brighter reflections than deeper liquid water interfaces. We demonstrate how ice‐penetrating radar measurements of salt layer thickness could establish lower bounds on the parameter space of possible initial reservoir thickness and salinity, constrain the origin of reservoirs (ice shell melt vs. ocean injection), and—if sourced through ocean injection—the ocean salinity."

In this study, we use numerical model experiments to demonstrate that the seasonal variability of the LZDO is driven by wind stress both within the downstream SCS and upstream Pacific Ocean. This finding contrasts with previous views that considered the LZDO hydraulically controlled at the Luzon Strait sill and thus influenced solely by the upstream Pacific Ocean forcing. Additionally, we identify that the LZDO is particularly sensitive to wind forcing in specific North Pacific regions where geostrophic contours connect to the Luzon Strait due to topographic effects."

 Although epigenetic modification has long been recognized as a vital force influencing gene regulation in plants, the dynamics of chromatin structure implicated in the intertwined transcriptional regulation of duplicated genes in polyploids have yet to be understood. Here, we document the dynamic organization of chromatin structure in two subgenomes of allotetraploid cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) by generating 3D genomic, epigenomic and transcriptomic datasets from 12 major tissues/developmental stages covering the life cycle. We systematically identify a subset of genes that are closely associated with specific tissue functions. Interestingly, these genes exhibit not only higher tissue specificity but also a more pronounced homoeologous bias. We comprehensively elucidate the intricate process of subgenomic collaboration and divergence across various tissues. A comparison among subgenomes in the 12 tissues reveals widespread differences in the reorganization of 3D genome structures, with the Dt subgenome exhibiting a higher extent of dynamic chromatin status than the At subgenome. Moreover, we construct a comprehensive atlas of putative functional genome elements and discover that 37 cis-regulatory elements (CREs) have selection signals acquired during domestication and improvement. These data and analyses are publicly available to the research community through a web portal. In summary, this study provides abundant resources and depicts the regulatory architecture of the genome, which thereby facilitates the understanding of biological processes and guides cotton breeding.

This study shows that the duration coding of brief visual events transforms along the human cortical hierarchy, and that duration and spatial processing interact through common neural responses and linked topographic representations. 
 Integrating spatial and temporal information is essential for our sensory experience. While psychophysical evidence suggests spatial dependencies in duration perception, few studies have directly tested the neural link between temporal and spatial processing. Using ultra-high-field functional MRI and neuronal-based modeling, we investigated how and where the processing and the representation of a visual stimulus duration is linked to that of its spatial location. Our results show a transition in duration coding: from monotonic and spatially-dependent in early visual cortex to unimodal and spatially-invariant in frontal cortex. Along the dorsal visual stream, particularly in the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), neuronal populations show common selective responses to both spatial and temporal information. In the IPS, spatial and temporal topographic organizations are also linked, although duration maps are smaller, less clustered, and more variable across participants. These findings help identify the mechanisms underlying human perception of visual duration and characterize the functional link between time and space processing, highlighting the importance of their interactions in shaping brain responses.

 Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has become a standard anti-cancer treatment, offering durable clinical benefits. However, the limited response rate of ICB necessitates biomarkers to predict and modulate the efficacy of the therapy. The gut microbiome’s influence on ICB efficacy is of particular interest due to its modifiability through various interventions. However, gut microbiome biomarkers for ICB response have been inconsistent across different studies. Here, we identify TANB77, an uncultured and distinct bacterial clade, as the most consistent responder-enriched taxon through meta-analysis of ten independent ICB recipient cohorts. Traditional taxonomy fails to distinguish TANB77 from unrelated taxa, leading to its oversight. Mice with higher gut TANB77 abundance, either naturally or through transplantation, show improved response to anti-PD-1 therapy. Additionally, mice injected with TANB77-derived pilin-like protein exhibit improved anti-PD-1 therapy response, providing in vivo evidence for the beneficial role of the pilin-like protein. These findings suggest that pilins from the TANB77 order may enhance responses to ICB therapy across diverse cohorts of cancer patients.

 We describe a structural and functional study of the G protein-coupled apelin receptor, which binds two endogenous peptide ligands, apelin and Elabela/Toddler (ELA), to regulate cardiovascular development and function. Characterisation of naturally occurring apelin receptor variants from the UK Genomics England 100,000 Genomes Project, and AlphaFold2 modelling, identifies T892.64 as important in the ELA binding site, and R1684.64 as forming extensive interactions with the C-termini of both peptides.

 Plants accumulate silicon to protect them from biotic and abiotic stresses. Especially in rice (Oryza sativa), a typical Si-accumulator, tremendous Si accumulation is indispensable for healthy growth and productivity. Here, we report a shoot-expressed signaling protein, Shoot-Silicon-Signal (SSS), an exceptional homolog of the flowering hormone “florigen” differentiated in Poaceae. SSS transcript is only detected in the shoot, whereas the SSS protein is also detected in the root and phloem sap. When Si is supplied from the root, the SSS transcript rapidly decreases, and then the SSS protein disappears. In sss mutants, root Si uptake and expression of Si transporters are decreased to a basal level regardless of the Si supply. The grain yield of the mutants is decreased to 1/3 due to insufficient Si accumulation. Thus, SSS is a key phloem-mobile protein for integrating root Si uptake and shoot Si accumulation underlying the terrestrial adaptation strategy of grasses.

 Two robust peaks in the diurnal evolution of orographically-locked precipitation are simulated in large-eddy simulations with an idealized ocean-plain-mountain topography. The ensemble experiment design is guided by sounding statistics from summertime afternoon thunderstorms in Taiwan to obtain realistic variability of free-tropospheric moisture associated with the intensity of the summertime subtropical high. The convection in the first peak is directly modulated by convective available potential energy, while the convection in the second peak is associated with low-level moist static energy (MSE) transport by the island-scale (40-km) local circulation, producing more extreme rainfall. When the initial free troposphere is drier, the convection in the second peak is strengthened. Both the environmental adjustments by the first peak and local circulation development contribute to the sensitivity of the second peak to free-tropospheric moisture. This work highlights the critical roles of convection-environment interaction and upstream MSE supply in enhancing extreme diurnal precipitation over complex topography."

 Peatlands store vast amounts of carbon, with deep peat carbon remaining stable due to limited thermodynamic energy and transport. However, climate change-induced increases in labile carbon inputs could destabilize these stores. Here, we combined DNA stable isotope probing with stable isotope-assisted metabolomics employing a multi-platform approach to investigate microbial dynamics driving deep peat carbon degradation upon labile carbon (e.g., glucose) amendment. Our findings highlight the vulnerability of deep peat carbon, as glucose addition triggers the breakdown of older organic matter. By uniquely integrating these techniques, we identified active glucose metabolizers to specific microbial populations and mapped carbon flow through microbial networks, elucidating their role in priming recalcitrant carbon mineralization.

 Around the periphery of the Greenland ice sheet, satellite-based observations of ground uplift record Earth’s response to past and recent unloading of Greenland’s ice mass. On the southeast coast, near the Kangerlussuaq glacier, rapid uplift exceeding 12 mm/yr cannot be explained using current layered Earth deformation models. Here we find that 3D models with a weakened Earth structure, consistent with the passage of Greenland over the Iceland plume, can explain the rapid uplift of Southeast Greenland. This uplift is dominated by a viscous response that is accelerated by the low viscosities of the hot plume track. Recent mass loss, occurring during the last millennium and especially within the past few decades, drives most of the uplift. Holocene indicators recorded similarly rapid uplift following deglaciation that ended the last ice age. Such rapid uplift, occurring beneath marine terminating glaciers, can affect the future stability of entire ice catchment areas and will become increasingly important in the near future as deglaciation accelerates.

 Extending satellite radar altimetry measurements from the open ocean to the coastal zone can improve the accuracy and quality of monitoring coastal sea level. However, radar altimetry waveforms can be distorted by any inhomogeneity in the properties of the surface observed within the footprints, possibly leading to range measurement errors. To address these issues, a coastal retracking method based on reconstructed sea surface height and iterative threshold (RSIT) is proposed in this paper. RSIT involves several steps: First, the sea surface height components are reconstructed as prior information to compute the initial retracking gate. Next, iterate the amplitude scale factor of the entire waveform to identify possible sub-waveforms. After each iteration, continuity between neighboring sub-waveforms is assessed. Eventually, the optimal retracking gate is determined from all identified sub-waveforms. We validated RSIT using Jason-2 data in the coastal regions of Australia and Pakistan. Experimental results show that RSIT can retrieve more available altimetry data and enhance the accuracy by nearly 37.5% and 23.1% compared to ALES within the last few kilometers to the coast, respectively. Moreover, the impact of varied errors in reconstructed sea surface height on RSIT was discussed, with the results reveal that RSIT has strong robustness to errors within 1 m, making it suitable for application in most coastal zones."

 The pre-processing feasibility assessment of interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR) is important for predicting the quality of InSAR results and guiding the further accurate slope displacement monitoring. However, such kinds of pre-processing (i.e. before the interferometry data processing) assessment method are few, especially for the slope displacement in wide areas. In this article, a method for assessing the pre-processing feasibility of InSAR displacement monitoring is proposed, which mainly takes into accounts the maximum detectable deformation gradients (MDDG), SAR geometric distortions and vegetation coverage. Based on the above factors, the classification criteria employed for InSAR feasibility assessment are built. The approach is applied over Guangxi Province, China a landslide prone area, and an InSAR feasibility map categorized into four categories: high, moderate, low, and very low over the entire study area for pre-processing analysis is obtained. The feasibility results indicate that approximately 77% of areas are classified as very low in the four categories, while the high and moderate feasibility are mainly distributed in urban areas and regions with a NDVI value of less than 0.5. The feasibility results show great agreement with the time series InSAR monitoring results derived from the real Sentinel-1 data in the further validation. This developed methodology is useful for predicting the quality of time series InSAR measurements and providing important information before the SAR data collection and processing, especially in wide-area slope displacement monitoring."

 The rapid growth in population and urban development has attracted considerable scientific attention due to its impact on the local and regional atmospheric environment. Given its scientific significance, in this study, we employ the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model to investigate the physical mechanisms underlying the impact of Land Use Land Cover (LULC) changes on the fog life cycle of a recent dense fog episode in January 2021. The model domain covers the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR) at a resolution of 2 km. We conducted two sensitivity experiments: The control run (CNTL), representing the current LULC, and the Experimental run (EXP), by integrating the land use conditions from 2004. Results from these experiments suggest that the model reasonably reproduces the near-surface meteorological conditions and vertical profiles during the severe fog episode. Over the past two decades, urban and built-up areas and dryland croplands increased by 119.73% and 118.97%, most of which were converted from irrigated croplands and other vegetated areas. We noticed that the increase in urban areas has led to an advancement in fog dissipation by about 1–2 h. The early dissipation also results in modifying the Liquid Water Path (LWP), consequently forming fog holes. Moreover, this phenomenon is likely to escalate if urban areas continue to develop in the future. We further attribute the near-surface soil moisture as a primary factor influencing the early lifting and dissipation of the fog layer by affecting surface fluxes (quantified by Bowen Ratio (BR)) and Turbulent Kinetic Energy (TKE), and expediting the heating (0.5°C–2°C) and drying (5%–20%) of the near-surface boundary layer (<500m from the land surface)."

 Efforts to reduce particulate matter (PM) mass concentrations often overlook the variability in PM components and associated health effects across cities. Here, we conducted PM toxicity experiments by injecting 228 Wistar rats with water-soluble PM suspensions (filtered through 0.45 μm membrane) (PMSF) of equal mass (6 mg/kg body weight), collected from automobile air filter in 31 major Chinese cities. Results revealed that PMs from thirty-one sources resulted in statistically significant differences in organ damages (heart, lung and liver), protein biomarkers and four microRNA expressions (miR-21, miR-125b, miR-146a, and miR-155). Nonetheless, these same measurements exhibited a statistical similarity for neighboring cities. Dimensionality reduction and machine learning algorithm revealed a strong link between specific metal components in PMSF and PM-related health risks. For example, reducing 6.20% of metal elements in PMSF was estimated to result in a 23.74% reduction in health risk. Additionally, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) levels per unit PM mass was also observed to vary substantially across the 31 cities, thus further explaining the health disparity. Until this work, most studies involve limited number of city PM sources, thus developing a biased understanding of PM toxicity and health impacts for a country or the world. The results here provide a state-of-the-art mechanistic understanding of the health effects of PMs of diverse city sources, while formulating the theoretical basis and reference for city- and component-specific PM control."

 As a serious compound disaster, the drought-flood abrupt alternation (DFAA) has become consensus and is urgent to be analyzed. Previous studies have mainly focused on the monthly time scale, making it difficult to reveal the detailed variation characteristics of DFAA. To address this limitation, this study proposed a daily-scale method that combines narrow and generalized DFAA intensity to identify, screen, and evaluate DFAA phenomena. Taking the Pearl River Basin (PRB) as an example, the results obtained through the new method demonstrate good agreement with the observed reality. The DFAA events mainly occurred in the west, east and southeast of PRB, and their frequency, coverage, intensity and average duration exhibit a significant upward trend, while the maximum duration shows an insignificant downward trend. Generally, the proposed method offers a clear representation of the evolution of DFAA events, and enables comprehensive analysis and comparison of DFAA events within the same watershed, thereby promoting a deeper understanding of DFAA on a broader temporal scale."
