Data from three September 2023 fog events show that larger droplets form near the ground, while fog dissipates from both the top and bottom. Key findings include average droplet sizes, water content, and how fog impacts radiation. The results improve understanding of fog behavior and its environmental effects. 
 Based on in situ observations, remote sensing, and tethered balloon soundings, this study examines vertical profiles of microphysical and thermodynamic properties in radiative fog layers in the Strzyżów valley (Southeastern Poland). During three radiation fog events in September 2023, 74 soundings were performed, with 41 employing the OPC-N3 instrument to capture droplet spectra. All cases showed similar conditions, with liquid water path consistently above 15 g m−2, placing most observations within the thin fog regime. Effective droplet radius decreased with height (3–4.6 µm over 100 m), while larger droplets (18.5 µm) were near the ground.Fog dissipation occurred from both top and bottom. The mature stage showed peaks in liquid water content (LWC) and droplet number concentration (Nc) at about 80% of fog depth. Larger droplets (≥ 18.5 µm) were removed within minutes, affecting fog longevity. Equivalent adiabaticity (αeq) – the scaling of adiabatic lapse rate to match observed liquid water path (LWP) – ranged from 0 to 0.6, with one rare case of negative near-ground αeq. Instruments above and below the fog allowed estimation of effect of the fog's impact on radiation flux. The difference of total shortwave and longwave NET (downward − upward) radiation at ground level before and after dissipation reached 150 W m−2. A linear relationship was found between reduction in longwave radiation and LWP under optically thin conditions. Mean LWC in the fog core ranged from 0.2–0.4 g m−3, and Nc reached 300 cm−3. Near-surface effective radius was 8–10 µm, decreasing with height. Agreement between model outputs and observed fluxes supports the retrieved microphysical parameters."

Here, the occurrence of ice particle sizes and concentrations with varying temperature and cloud microphysical thickness is analyzed as well as whether they formed in-situ or were transported upwards as frozen droplets from further below. The analyses are based on a large database of airborne measurements and extensive simulations. 
 Cloud particle size distributions (PSDs) are crucial in determining the clouds physical and optical properties and hence their radiative feedback to the climate. Here we present unprecedented occurrence patterns of cloud particles derived from 270 h of cloud measurements (≈ 975 000 PSDs). The focus of the analysis is on cirrus clouds, but liquid and mixed-phase clouds are also shown. In particular, cirrus PSDs for cold to warm cirrus temperatures and microphysically thin to thick cirrus clouds are provided in a novel presentation as heat maps. The observations are accompanied by simulations of ice crystal growth in  in situ-origin cirrus, showing that the maximum size to which the cirrus ice crystals can grow increases from approx. 60 µm@T < 200 K to 230 µm@T > 220 K. Crystals larger than this size are most likely of liquid-origin. The combined evaluation of observations and simulations allows the attribution of processes shaping the PSDs. Important results are that, with increasing temperature and cirrus thickness, the most frequent ice particles change from smaller and fewer crystals of in situ-origin to larger and more crystals of both in situ and liquid-origin i.e. the cirrus type changes from in situ- to liquid-origin. In addition, three characteristic ice crystal size ranges are identified. The nucleation/evaporation size interval (∼ 3–20 µm), most frequent in the coldest, thinnest in situ-origin cirrus; the – most common – overlap size interval (∼ 20–230 µm), where both in situ-origin liquid-origin cirrus occur and the uplift/sedimenation size interval (>∼ 230 µm), which consists mostly of liquid-origin ice crystals."
10.5194/acp-25-13475-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究主要关注大气水相中苯并噻唑类化合物（BTs）的羟基自由基（OH）氧化反应，以及由此产生的二次气溶胶的形成机制。研究通过实验模拟，探讨了BTs的光化学降解、硫酸盐的生成以及低聚物的形成，并分析了这些过程对大气颗粒物化学和光学性质的影响。虽然该研究涉及大气成分，但它侧重于化学反应和气溶胶形成过程，而非直接利用遥感技术进行大气环境监测或成分分析，因此与大气环境遥感技术的关联性较弱。,"['secondary aerosols', 'aqueous-phase oxidation', 'benzothiazoles (BTs)', 'OH radicals', 'oligomerization', 'sulfate formation', 'brown carbon']",Qun Zhang;Wei Zhou;Shanshan Tang;Kai Huang;Jie Fu;Zechen Yu;Yunhe Teng;Shuyi Shen;Yang Mei;Xuezhi Yang;Jianjie Fu;Guibin Jiang,Potential contribution to secondary aerosols from benzothiazoles in the atmospheric aqueous phase based on oxidation  and oligomerization mechanisms,"This article comprehensively investigates the aqueous-phase OH oxidation of benzothiazoles (BTs), common rubber additives widespread in urban air, through laboratory simulation experiments. BTs can rapidly degrade, leading to light absorption, high yields of sulfate, and the formation of oligomerized organic compounds. The results reveal that aqueous-phase BTs can contribute to secondary aerosols, altering the chemical and optical properties of atmospheric particles. 
 Benzothiazoles (BTs), widely used as vulcanization accelerators in the rubber industry, have frequently been identified in the atmosphere, especially in areas with heavy traffic. BTs can undergo gas-phase oxidation in the atmosphere, which contributes to secondary aerosol mass. However, given their certain water solubility, the atmospheric fate of BTs associated with aqueous-phase transformations is unclear. In this study, the reactions of benzothiazole (BT), 2-methylbenzothiazole (MBT), and 2-chlorobenzothiazole (CBT) with hydroxyl radicals (OH) were investigated. The rate constants of BT, MBT, and CBT reacted with OH radicals were determined to be (8.0 ± 1.8), (7.6 ± 1.7), and (7.6 ± 1.9) × 109 M-1s-1 at initial pH 2 and (9.7 ± 2.7), (9.8 ± 2.7), and (9.4 ± 2.7) × 109 M-1s-1 at initial pH 10, respectively. Lifetimes ranging from several minutes to several hours were estimated under mean OH concentrations in various atmospheric aqueous phases, which are significantly shorter than those estimated under mean OH concentrations in the gas phase. The nanoparticle tracing analysis (NTA) directly shows the formation of nanoparticles from the aqueous-phase photooxidation of the selected BTs. Data analysis of liquid chromatography Orbitrap mass spectrometry (LC-Orbitrap MS) identifies many multifunctional oligomers. Changes in optical property support the formation of oligomers and suggest that the products have the potential to contribute to the atmospheric brown carbon. In addition, higher yields of sulfate are formed after the reactions. It is highlighted that the aqueous-phase oxidation of BTs can contribute to the secondary aerosol mass in the ambient atmosphere, particularly in polluted regions where concentrations of BTs are comparable to those of benzenes, potentially altering the chemical composition and optical properties of atmospheric particles."

Freeman;Huanxin Zhang;Jun Wang;Shan-Hu Lee,Estimating surface sulfur dioxide concentrations from satellite data over eastern China: Using chemical transport models vs. machine learning,"Air pollutants like sulfur dioxide impact human health and the environment. Our work estimated surface sulfur dioxide concentrations from satellite data over eastern China. One method used atmospheric models, and another method used machine learning. We found that compared to measurements from an air quality monitoring network, both methods accurately captured the locations of sulfur dioxide, but the machine learning method was generally much more accurate in the estimated concentrations. 
 Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is an important air pollutant that contributes to negative health effects, acid rain, and aerosol formation and growth. SO2 has been measured using ground-based air quality monitoring networks, but routine monitoring sites are predominantly in urban areas, leaving large gaps in the network in less populated locations. Previous studies have used chemical transport models (CTMs) or machine learning (ML) techniques to estimate surface SO2 concentrations from satellite vertical column densities, but their performance has never been directly compared. In this study, we estimated surface SO2 concentrations using Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) retrievals over eastern China from 2015–2018 utilizing GEOS-Chem CTM simulations and an extreme gradient boosting ML model. For the first time, we quantified methodological uncertainties for both methods and directly compared their performance on the same truth dataset. The surface concentrations estimated from the CTM-based method had similar spatial distributions (r=0.58) and temporal variations compared to the in situ measurements but were underestimated (slope = 0.24; RPE = 75 %) and had worsening performance over time. The ML-based method produced more accurate spatial distributions (r = 0.77) and temporal variations with a smaller discrepancy (slope = 0.69; RPE = 30 %) and stable performance over time. Despite the higher accuracy of the ML-based method at the monitoring sites, the CTM-based method produced more reasonable gridded spatial distributions over areas without monitoring data. These results suggest that satellite data could be a reliable way to estimate global SO2 concentrations to parameterize other chemical processes in the atmosphere."

Carslaw;A. Robert MacKenzie;Zongbo Shi,Rethinking machine learning weather normalisation: a refined strategy for short-term air pollution policies,"Air pollution causes millions of deaths annually, driving policies to improve air quality. However, assessing these policies is challenging because weather changes can hide their true impact. We created a logical evaluation framework and found that a widely applied machine learning approach that adjusts for weather effects could underestimate the effectiveness of short-term policies, like emergency traffic controls. We proposed a refined approach that could largely reduce such underestimation. 
 Air pollution causes millions of premature deaths annually, driving widespread implementation of clean air interventions. Quantitative evaluation of the efficacy of such interventions is critical in air quality management. Machine learning-based weather normalization (ML-WN) has been employed to isolate meteorological influences from emission-drive changes; however, it has its own limitations, particularly when abrupt emission shifts occur, e.g., after an intervention. Here we developed a logical evaluation framework, based on paired observational datasets and a test of “ML algebra” (i.e., the “commutation” of a normalisation step), to show that ML-WN significantly underestimates the immediate effects of short-term interventions on nitrogen oxides (NOx), with discrepancies reaching up to 42 % for 1 week interventions. This finding challenges assumptions about the robustness of ML-WN for evaluating short-term policies, such as emergency traffic controls or episodic pollution events. We propose a refined approach (MacLeWN) that can reduce such underestimation biases by > 90 % in idealised but plausible cases studies. We applied both approaches to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 lockdown on NOx as measured at Marylebone Road, London. For the 1 week period after the lockdown, ML-WN estimates approximately 17 % smaller NOx reductions compared to MacLeWN, and such underestimation diminishes as policy duration extends, decreasing to ∼ 10 % for 1 month and becoming insignificant after 3 months. Our findings indicate the importance of carefully selecting evaluation methodologies for air quality interventions, suggesting that ML-WN should be complemented or adjusted when assessing short-term policies. Increasing model interpretability is also crucial for generating trustworthy assessments and improving policy evaluations."

This study implemented an improved parameterization of BrC bleaching in a model with which BrC can survive much longer in cold, dry air, especially when lofted into the upper atmosphere by wildfires. The results reveal stronger warming effects and impacts on atmospheric oxidation, highlighting the need to consider BrC in climate and pollution control strategies. 
 Brown carbon (BrC), a light-absorbing component of organic aerosols, undergoes bleaching in the atmosphere, a process where its light absorption capacity diminishes over time due to chemical transformation. A recent study suggests that the lifetime of freshly emitted, unbleached BrC (referred to as fresh BrC) against bleaching (τBrC) is influenced by ambient temperature and relative humidity. In this study, we incorporate the improved τBrC parameterization into an atmospheric chemical transport model (GEOS-Chem) to assess its atmospheric chemical and radiative effects. Our results show that τBrC varies strongly with altitude, ranging from 1–10 h in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) to over 100 h in the upper troposphere, where bleaching becomes negligible. Dry regions (e.g., northern Africa and South Asia) exhibit longer surface τBrC, while humid regions (e.g., the tropics) show shorter τBrC. The updated τBrC parameterization triples the global burden of fresh BrC compared to the baseline parameterization with uniform τBrC, increasing its effective lifetime from 0.45 to 1.45 d and amplifying the direct radiative effect (DRE) of BrC by 48 % (from +0.059 to +0.088 W m−2). Lofted wildfire emissions experience prolonged τBrC due to reduced bleaching in the free troposphere, underscoring the importance of fire injection height. Additionally, BrC absorption suppresses photochemical activity, reducing the photolysis rate of NO2 (JNO2) by up to 7.4 %, surface ozone by 0 %–2.5 %, and tropospheric OH by 0 %–6.9 %. These effects intensify during major wildfire events, such as the Siberian fires in 2019 that caused JNO2 and ozone to drop by 36.3 % and 17.5 %, respectively, highlighting BrC's role in perturbing atmospheric oxidation capacity."

We simulate the measurement scenario considering technological feasibility and state-of-the-art atmosphere models. We find that both atomic oxygen and temperature could be accurately measured from an altitude of 100 km up to at least 200 km with such an instrument. 
 We investigate the feasibility of a satellite-borne heterodyne spectrometer for the retrieval of atomic oxygen concentration and temperature in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. We use the vertical density and temperature profiles provided by the NRLMSIS 2.1 atmosphere model to simulate 2.1 and 4.7 THz atomic oxygen emission spectra as measured by a satellite in a near-polar circular orbit at 500 km altitude. We then apply retrieval algorithms for the atomic oxygen concentration and temperature and compare the retrieved profiles to the reference, i.e. the original NRLMSIS 2.1 profiles. The emission spectra are simulated using radiative transfer under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium.By considering two separate heterodyne receivers with sensitivity of 11 000 and 25 000 K noise temperature for the 2.1 and 4.7 THz lines, respectively, and data accumulated over 177 s of measurement time, corresponding to a ground track of 1250 km, we can retrieve vertical temperature profiles from 100 km altitude to 200 km altitude within ±2 % relative uncertainties and an atomic oxygen concentration profile from 110 to 300 km within ±3 % relative uncertainties. From 100 to 110 km the uncertainty in the atomic oxygen concentration is higher but still within ±15 %."

This helps monitor air quality more efficiently and in greater detail. Our method uses real data collected over 3 years in northern France and can detect changes caused by weather conditions. It offers a faster and more accurate way to understand what is in the air we breathe. 
 This study presents the development of an automated aerosol typing model utilizing Mie–Raman–fluorescence lidar data collected by LILAS (Lille Lidar for Atmospheric Study), located on the ATOLL (ATmospheric Observations at LiLLe) platform in Lille, France. The proposed model, FLARE-GMM (Fluorescence Lidar-based Aerosol REcognition from Gaussian Mixture Model), employs a Gaussian mixture model trained on a dataset spanning from early 2021 to the end of 2023. FLARE-GMM is able to distinguish the predominant aerosol type in a given layer between dust, urban, and biomass burning aerosols by using the PLDR (particular linear depolarization ratio) and the fluorescence capacity, as well as relative humidity, all measured with LILAS. To ensure accurate model training, cases were manually selected to include only pure aerosol layers, as mixed aerosols are not accurately modeled by GMM. Following the training phase, the model's performance was evaluated by investigating extreme events in which the aerosol type is not ambiguous. This approach was also completed with the use of a test dataset, on which FLARE-GMM was compared to NATALI (Neural Network Aerosol Typing Algorithm Based on Lidar Data), another automatic aerosol typing model based on neural networks using lidar data. The results demonstrated that FLARE-GMM shows promise in accurately identifying aerosol types, indicating its potential for classifying aerosols in a variety of situations. Finally, FLARE-GMM was used to estimate the aerosol types present in Lille's atmosphere throughout the entire dataset from early 2021 to the end of 2023. A statistical analysis of these results was conducted, further underscoring the model's capability in automated aerosol classification."

It provides high detection efficiency, low noise, a rapid time response, and excellent reliability, confirmed in lab experiments and at the CERN CLOUD chamber. Its design enables precise, robust long-term measurements, facilitating versatile applications in diverse environments, from laboratory settings to field and potential airborne research. 
 A dilute plasma is continuously maintained in the troposphere by ionizing particle radiation from galactic cosmic rays and radon decay. Small ions in the 1–2 nm size range play an important role in atmospheric processes such as ion-induced nucleation of aerosol particles. Consequently, there is a need for precise and robust instruments to measure small ions both for atmospheric observations and for laboratory experiments that simulate the atmosphere. Here, we describe the design and performance of the Cluster Ion Counter (CIC, Airel OÜ), which measures the number concentrations of positively and negatively charged ions and particles below 5 nm mobility diameter simultaneously, with low noise and fast time response. The CIC is primarily designed as a robust, low-maintenance instrument  prioritizing ease of operation and broad applicability, including  laboratory experiments; long-term unattended field measurements; and mobile, airborne, and battery-powered setups. The main application of the device is to study the temporal development of total cluster ion concentrations while also providing some information about the ion mobility distribution. The detection efficiency is above 80 % for ions and charged particles between 1.2 and 2.0 nm and above 90 % between 2.0 and 3.0 nm. The ion concentrations measured by the CIC agree well with reference instruments. The noise level (1 σ of background measurements) is typically between 20 and 30 ions cm−3 at 1 Hz sampling rate and an airflow rate of 7 L min−1 per analyzer. The noise level improves when higher flow rates and longer sampling periods are used. The CIC responds rapidly, with 1 s time resolution, to pulses of ionization produced in the CLOUD chamber by a CERN particle beam."

In only 3 years, nextGEMS achieved this milestone with the two km-scale Earth system models, ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic model (ICON) and Integrated Forecasting System coupled to the Finite-volumE Sea ice-Ocean Model (IFS-FESOM). nextGEMS was based on three cornerstones: (1) developing km-scale Earth system models with small errors in the energy and water balance, (2) performing km-scale climate simulations with a throughput greater than 1 simulated year per day, and (3) facilitating new workflows for an efficient analysis of the large simulations with common data structures and output variables. These cornerstones shaped the timeline of nextGEMS, divided into four cycles. Each cycle marked the release of a new configuration of ICON and IFS-FESOM, which were evaluated at hackathons. The hackathon participants included experts from climate science, software engineering, and high-performance computing as well as users from the energy and agricultural sectors. The continuous efforts over the four cycles allowed us to produce 30-year simulations with ICON and IFS-FESOM, spanning the period 2020–2049 under the SSP3-7.0 scenario. The throughput was about 500 simulated days per day on the Levante supercomputer of the German Climate Computing Center (DKRZ). The simulations employed a horizontal grid of about 5 km resolution in the ocean and 10 km resolution in the atmosphere and land. Aside from this technical achievement, the simulations allowed us to gain new insights into the realism of ICON and IFS-FESOM. Beyond its time frame, nextGEMS builds the foundation of the Climate Change Adaptation Digital Twin developed in the Destination Earth initiative and paves the way for future European research on climate change."

Hirmas;Li Li,Soil parameterization in land surface models drives large discrepancies in soil moisture predictions across hydrologically complex regions of the contiguous United States,"Land models need reliable soil properties to simulate water, but these settings are uncertain. We analyzed Community Land Model version 5 simulations for the United States from 1980 to 2010 to see how different soil settings shape patterns of soil moisture. Compared with an independent global land dataset, patterns align in many regions but differ in water-limited areas such as the Great Plains. Our maps show where to improve settings and guide future tests with observations. 
 Land surface models (LSMs) are critical components of Earth system models (ESMs), enabling the simulation of energy and water fluxes that are essential for understanding climate systems. Soil hydraulic parameters, derived using pedotransfer functions (PTFs), are crucial for modeling soil–plant–water interactions; they introduce uncertainties in soil moisture simulations. However, a key knowledge gap exists in understanding how specific soil hydraulic properties contribute to these uncertainties and in identifying the regions most affected by them. This study conducts an intra-model sensitivity analysis within the Community Land Model version 5 (CLM5), examining how alternative soil parameter settings influence soil moisture variability across the contiguous United States (CONUS) using empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis. The EOF analysis revealed dominant spatial and temporal patterns of soil moisture across multiple experimental configurations, highlighting the impact of soil parameter variability on hydrological processes. The results showed significant discrepancies in soil moisture simulations, particularly in the central Great Plains, which may be attributed to the combination of arid climatic conditions and limitations in modeling saturated hydraulic conductivity and soil water retention curves. Seasonal soil moisture dynamics showed broad similarity to ERA5-Land patterns, with differences in magnitude and phase, indicating the importance of refined parameterization, particularly in the representation of infiltration and drainage processes. Comparisons with ERA5-Land, used here solely as a model-based reference for pattern consistency, revealed stronger similarity in regions with consistent climatic gradients but persistent differences in hydrologically complex areas, particularly in areas with arid climates, such as the Great Plains, where hydrological processes remain difficult to represent. Because CLM5 is forced by GSWP3, whereas ERA5-Land is an offline HTESSEL replay forced by ERA5, differences reflect both forcing and structural contrasts in addition to parameter effects. This research demonstrates the necessity to refine soil parameter representations, utilize high-resolution datasets, and consider climatic variability to inform the model development of LSMs. Importantly, these findings also pave the way for future efforts that incorporate dynamic soil properties into LSMs. This work illustrates the influence of soil properties on simulated variability. While the analysis documents their importance, a future direction will be to develop approaches that allow these properties to vary dynamically within LSMs. This study contributes to ongoing efforts toward more integrated modeling frameworks that capture soil–hydrology–climate interactions."

These changes anticipating ecosystem responses to environmental change and effectively managing marine. The model-based predictions and their performance in the historical states of the ocean must be carefully evaluated against observations. In this study a coupled ocean and sea-ice simulation during 1993–2018 using observations. We focus on the Bering Sea shelf, which is the largest productive ecosystem in the US. 
 Understanding and predicting the ocean environment and marine ecosystem status depends on accurate representations of regional ocean dynamics. Recently, the Modular Ocean Model version 6 (MOM6) has been configured to span the Northeast Pacific Ocean from Baja California to the Chukchi Sea (MOM6-NEP). In this study we present a physical hindcast (1993–2018) simulation of MOM6-NEP where it is coupled to a thermodynamic-dynamic sea-ice module and includes tides. We evaluate the performance of this model in the Bering Sea. Various model metrics are benchmarked against in-situ mooring data and satellite observations. The simulation captures the general characteristics of Bering Sea dynamics, particularly with respect to seasonal and interannual variability of the middle shelf water mass properties. Modeling of shear induced mixing was found to be critical to the model's ability to reproduce the observed sharp summer thermocline and its depth. The hindcast simulation reproduces the long-term mean timing of sea-ice arrival and retreat in both the northern and southern Bering Sea, with the remaining mild biases primarily occurring in May over the northern shelf – the model captures the mean timing of sea-ice retreat, though it tends to retreat earlier in colder years and later in warmer years compared to observations. This pattern in biases suggests that the melting rate in the model likely underestimates the well-known melt-rate dependency on ice property whereby thicker (thinner) ice melts more slowly (quickly). As a result of high skills in reproducing sea-ice areal coverage, the interannual variability of the cold pool (the cold-water mass present on the bottom of the Bering Sea shelf in summer) extent is accurately reproduced by the model. Skillful representation of sea ice and the cold pool is essential for understanding ecosystem dynamics and successful fisheries management in the Bering Sea. The findings of this study contribute to the development of reliable oceanographic modeling and forecasting of marine ecosystem conditions to support fisheries management decision making."

 Epidemiologic evidence on thermal stress and preterm birth (PTB) is based on ambient temperature rather than a biothermal metric. Thyrotropin abnormalities have been associated with PTB and may increase thermal vulnerability. However, it remains unknown whether thermal stress and thyrotropin abnormalities synergistically contribute to increased risk of PTB. Here we conducted a nationwide cohort study among 6,218,131 singleton live births in China. Biothermal stress was measured using the Universal Thermal Climate Index. We found that both heat stress and cold stress during each trimester were associated with increased risks of PTB, with hazard ratios ranging from 1.06 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05, 1.07) to 2.33 (95% CI: 2.30, 2.35) and from 1.08 (95% CI: 1.07, 1.09) to 1.68 (95% CI:1.67, 1.70), respectively.

 The non-volatile spontaneous ferroelectric polarization field serves as a cornerstone for applying ferroelectric materials in electronic devices, yet it is frequently mitigated by charge trapping at defect sites. Achieving an effective transition between ferroelectric polarization and charge trapping is challenging due to the inherent opposition of the two mechanisms and the uncontrollable charge trapping types in ferroelectric materials. Here, we realized a polarity-dependent ferroelectric transition in two-dimensional ferroelectric heterojunction transistor by integrating a hybrid organic-inorganic ferroelectric layer embedded with electron trapping sites. Through theoretical calculations and experimental validation, we demonstrate a ferroelectric manifestation and elimination mechanism based on the polarity of the semiconductor layer. The electron-majority n-type semiconductor exhibits charge trapping behavior, while the electron-minority p-type transistor exhibits the ferroelectric control mechanism. Leveraging the mechanism transition, our bipolar heterojunction transistor enables synergistic heterogeneous control of non-volatile memory and volatile synaptic weight modulation within a single bipolar ferroelectric transistor. Based on the experimentally extracted parameters from the transistors, the device-informed simulation achieves a recognition accuracy of 92.9% and a 20.7-fold improvement in training efficiency of the transfer learning network.

Outcomes were first hypotension, syncope, or fracture leading to hospitalization or death within 10 years. Models were derived from CPRD GOLD data (n = 1,773,224) and validated with CPRD Aurum data (n = 3,805,366). Each model had 31-37 predictors. Validation demonstrated strong discriminative ability (10-year C-statistic: hypotension 0.824; syncope 0.819; fracture 0.790), with close agreement between predicted and observed risks for the hypotension and syncope models. Some underprediction was observed for the fracture model. These models could be used to help reassure patients about the relatively low risk of harm from antihypertensive treatment, or identify the small number of individuals with a higher risk where additional monitoring may be indicated. This study developed three clinical prediction models using UK primary care  data which accurately identified patients eligible for antihypertensive treatment who were at higher risk of hypotension, syncope, or fracture."

 Marine diatoms are responsible for about 20% of global primary productivity, yet their capability to adapt to long-term climate warming remains uncertain. Here we show that thermal stress induces polyploidization in the model diatom Thalassiosira pseudonana, and the polyploids (having more than two sets of chromosomes) adapt faster to elevated temperature compared with their diploid ancestor. Common molecular signatures underlying thermal adaptation in the polyploids included differential regulation of the cell cycle, responses to oxidative stress, cell wall biosynthesis and nutrient assimilation. Our findings indicate that polyploidization in diatoms may occur under thermal stress, triggering diverse changes in differential expression and accelerating evolutionary responses to temperature shifts. Polyploidization may be partially responsible for the past evolutionary success of diatoms and may provide an advantage to diatoms in a rapidly changing climate.

 Extreme heat discomfort days (EHDDs) are increasing in frequency and intensity under global warming, raising growing concerns in subtropical regions such as South China. Using multi-decadal observational data, we identify a marked increase in the frequency and spatial extent of EHDDs since 2000, following an absence of significant trends in earlier decades. A convolutional neural network trained on sea level pressure and 500-hPa geopotential height fields successfully detects 92% of these events and reveals their dominant circulation features. The northwestward extension of the western North Pacific subtropical high induces an anomalous anticyclone over South China, weakening summer monsoon winds and suppressing ventilation. In the presence of high humidity, these stagnant and hot conditions exacerbate heat discomfort. Concurrently, a post-2000 strengthening of mid-latitude blocking high activity reinforces high-pressure anomalies over East Asia. The joint influence of intensified blocking highs and northwestward extension of the western North Pacific subtropical high drives the sharp rise in both frequency and intensity of regional EHDDs. These findings highlight the importance of large-scale circulation changes, in combination with long-term global warming, in amplifying extreme thermal stress under a warming climate."

 This study investigated the influence of oceanographic dynamics on marine microplastic (MP) distribution and identified wastewater and greywater emissions as relevant sources. In June 2021, sub-surface water samples were continuously collected during steaming at a depth of 4 meters along five transects, spanning 1600 nautical miles from the Norwegian coast to Bear Island in the Arctic Ocean. MPs (>10 µm) were analyzed using Fourier-transform infrared imaging micro-spectroscopy, revealing concentrations ranging from 7 to 491 items m⁻³. Elevated MP levels near the Norwegian coast (max 399 items m⁻³) were linked to discharges from wastewater discharges, including greywater from ships, with polyester dominating, followed by polypropylene and acrylates/polyurethanes/varnish. The highest concentrations were observed near the remote Bear Island, likely driven by oceanographic features such as the Polar Front and mesoscale eddies, which can trap and accumulate MPs. Our results were compared to a parallel study analyzing stationary samples from the same cruise, revealeing systematically higher MP concentrations in underway samples and highlighting the importance of sampling strategies for inter-study comparisons. Overall, this study underlines the complexity of MP distribution and the combined roles of wastewater and greywater emissions, ocean current patterns, and frontal zones in understanding MP pollution in marine environments.

 Forest-focused Natural Climate Solutions (F-NCS) are crucial for climate change mitigation through emissions reductions and carbon sequestration. The Voluntary Carbon Market directs finance to F-NCS activities by the sale of carbon credits to offset emissions. However, inconsistent implementation and imprecise rules have led to over-crediting and other integrity challenges, reducing confidence in F-NCS effectiveness. Despite these concerns, assessments of the limitations of current protocols and how scientific advances could improve VCMs effectiveness have been piecemeal and limited in scope. To address this applied research gap, we review current and emerging methodologies for monitoring carbon impacts of forest protection and restoration activities, covering methods for monitoring carbon stock change, additionality, leakage, and non-durability, with an emphasis on integrating remote sensing (RS) technologies alongside field-based methods and emerging statistical approaches. We recommend 1) that the VCM needs to evolve as science advances. Carbon standards should also improve carbon estimates by 2) incorporating use of high-resolution maps of carbon stocks and change into standards; 3) establishing and sustainably financing a federated forest plots database for training and validation of carbon maps and testing new machine learning approaches; 4) calculate additionality for projects using causal inference methods that statisticians have developed for analysing changes in land cover and carbon density maps; 5) better understand the interaction between project and jurisdictional assessment of REDD+ projects; address leakage by 6) harnessing remote sensing to estimate its extent and evaluate the effectiveness of sustainable development measures designed to minimise it; 7) factor in non-durability upfront in F-NCS projects by leveraging map-based modelling of persistence.

 Individual Tree Detection (ITD) is essential for assessing tree parameters including spatial distribution, geometrical characteristics, and species identification within forested landscapes. This process is vital for tree inventory management and forest carbon accounting. Such information on individual trees can be derived from high-resolution Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data by utilizing Deep Learning (DL) object detectors. Unlike traditional RGB images, UAV LiDAR data can be rasterized into multiple bands (or features) representing different structural and textural attributes, such as Vertical Distance (VD), Canopy Height Model (CHM), and texture-based features, to provide richer information to enhance detection. However, existing methods for UAV LiDAR data face challenges in processing high-resolution data due to complex forest environments, overlapping tree crowns, and limitations in utilizing rich multi-band information (i.e., input raster layers with more than three bands). To address these issues, this paper introduces Tree-Net, an innovative one-stage DL structure object detection for ITD on rasterized UAV LiDAR data. Inspired by a deep neural network based on You Only Look Once (YOLO), Tree-Net attempts to benefit from greater numbers of input bands to obtain sophisticated spectral and spatial features. By optimizing the neural network structure, Tree-Net improves computational efficiency and detection accuracy by employing a shallower architecture. Tree-Net's performance is evaluated on two distinct datasets, Heiberg and ForInstance benchmarks consisting of around 25,000 trees including deciduous and coniferous trees to represent different canopy shapes, heights, and densities. The Best detection metrics results indicate that the proposed method outperforms existing literature (i.e., YOLOv5) and Modified YOLO by achieving 7 %, 41 %, 30 %, and 34 % improvement in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics, respectively. In terms of time efficiency, Tree-Net outperformed our previously developed modified version of YOLO (Modified YOLO), which accepts multi-band instead of classic three-band (RGB) input, by 60 % on both training and testing phases. From a practical perspective, Tree-Net holds significant promise for urban tree inventory, forest management, and satellite ground-truth data generation for large-scale applications including biomass estimations and carbon exchange."

 The thermal radiation directionality (TRD) effect is a critical factor influencing the global application of thermal infrared remote sensing data, and limiting the comparison of long-term temporal data series. The inherent inconsistency of thermal radiation data acquired from different observation angles poses significant challenges for data utilization and analysis. To address this issue, this study develops a dual-band parametric angular normalization (DPAN) method based on physical model. The key parameters for angular normalization are firstly derived through theoretical analysis, then empirical estimation formulas for these parameters are established. Analysis based on simulation dataset demonstrates that the DPAN method can correct an average of 62 % of thermal radiation angular effects, with maximum corrections reaching 66–68 % and minimum corrections approximately 47–49 % under various input parameter errors. A wavelength difference of 2–3.5 μm is found to be the best for the dual-band setting to apply the DPAN method. When applied to actual Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data, the method achieves a radiative brightness temperature root mean square difference (RMSD) of approximately 1.3 K, with maximum correction exceeding 8 K. Notably, temperature corrections typically surpass 1 K when the view zenith angle exceeds 40°. In summary, the DPAN method requires neither multi-angle nor multi-temporal observations, enabling direct application to any satellite dataset with at least two thermal infrared bands. These characteristics satisfy the essential requirements for operational angular normalization of satellite-derived land surface temperature products, indicating strong potential for widespread implementation."

 Recent studies indicate an increase in the frequency, severity, and duration of drought events in the Horn of Africa. This research aims to assess the capability of high-frequency Earth observations in detecting drought events in Ethiopia, Somalia, Kenya and Djibouti. By utilizing daily vegetation and precipitation products, we explore the benefits of high frequency data to monitor meteorological and agricultural drought. A vegetation product derived from geostationary satellites with an increased capacity to minimize the effect of clouds is compared with global and regional precipitation daily datasets to analyze the relationship between vegetation and precipitation indices. Our findings demonstrate that certain daily precipitation products offer greater accuracy and a higher probability of detecting rainfall events. Particularly, we found that TAMSAT and CHIRPS products are not well-suited for analyses at daily temporal resolution. Additionally, we investigate the impact of different accumulation periods for the Standard Precipitation Index (SPI) (McKee et al., 1993), finding that longer accumulation windows (e.g., SPI-180) provide greater robustness to wet–dry fluctuations but introduce a trade-off between precision and timeliness in detecting drought events. Through a detailed analysis of four drought events in the area, we assess their effects across different soil types, revealing that cropland and forest soils exhibited greater resilience to water stress compared to other soil types. In contrast, shrubs and bare soil types were particularly affected, contributing to severe humanitarian consequences, such as a drought event in Somalia that resulted in an estimated 250,000 fatalities. This study underscores the significance of using daily temporal resolution to identify drought events that are not visible on a monthly scale, including the alternation of short-term wet–dry spells."

 Accurate Urban Functional Zone (UFZ) mapping is a fundamental prerequisite for analyzing the spatial structure of cities and optimizing urban planning. Very High Resolution (VHR) remote sensing image and crowd sourcing geospatial data have emerged as critical data sources for UFZ mapping due to their capability to represent multidimensional spatial semantics. However, current research on UFZ mapping faces several limitations, including insufficient modeling of both global and local features in VHR image, unclear spatial units for functional zones, and a lack of cross-city validation. To address these issues, this study proposes a UFZ mapping framework that integrates VHR image and crowd sourcing geospatial data. First, a Global-Local Scale Attentive Network (GLSANet) is developed to extract deep functional semantic features from VHR image by modeling both local and global contextual information. Second, a Multi-scale Road-constrained Feature Segmentation (MRFS) algorithm is proposed, which incorporates OpenStreetMap (OSM) road constraints. By integrating geometric shape constraints with functional semantic features, this algorithm enables the generation of spatial units for functional zones. Finally, within the constructed spatial units, the framework integrates multiple data features, including low-light remote sensing data from SDGSAT-1, 3D building morphology features, POI kernel density features, and deep functional semantic features, and employs an ensemble learning model to classify urban functions. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, we conducted UFZ mapping studies in 25 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework exhibits strong adaptability across diverse urban regions, achieving an average overall accuracy of 0.906 in UFZ mapping. In addition, comparative analyses with other related methods further highlight the superior performance of the proposed framework."

The LNOx remains inadequately quantified in the Pearl River Delta (PRD), a region experiencing one of the highest lightning frequencies in China. Here, we combine the Guangdong-Hongkong-Macao Lightning Location System (GHMLLS) flash data and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model to quantify the LNOx emission contribution and investigate the impact on NOx and O3 concentration. An updated LNOx vertical distribution parameterization is developed, incorporating the lightning channel current intensity profile via the Modified Transmission Line Equivalent (MTLE) model. LNOx can contribute 4 % to the total NOx emissions during the PRD's convective season. Lightning scenario results reveal a 22 % increase in surface NOx concentrations compared to the base scenario. A titration effect is observed in O3 concentrations, with overall increases most pronounced at 4–6 km altitudes due to enhanced LNOx production. Vertical and horizontal transport processes dominate atmospheric composition changes during extreme thunderstorm events, significantly influencing surface O3 levels.
