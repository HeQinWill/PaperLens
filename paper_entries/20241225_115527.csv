10.1021/acs.est.4c09178,False,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇研究论文关注的是废弃尼龙塑料的闭环回收利用。研究人员提出了一种无需催化剂的水热清洁水解聚方法，成功地将废弃尼龙塑料解聚为高纯度单体，并通过一步法溶液缩聚重新聚合生成新的尼龙，实现了闭环回收。该研究的重点在于塑料废弃物的处理和资源化利用，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）并没有直接关系。,[],Yongliang Zhang;Lu Zhan;Zhenming Xu,Closed-Loop Upcycling of Waste Nylon Plastic under Hydrothermal Clean Water Atmosphere,"The extensive use and longevity of nylon plastics pose substantial challenges for plastic management, recycling, and pollution control. Depolymerization and monomer recycling are potential solutions for valorizing waste plastics, but they often rely on complex and costly catalysts. Additionally, various additives in nylon plastics can negatively impact the catalyst efficiency. To address these issues, we proposed a novel method of hydrothermal clean water depolymerization without any catalysts. In this study, high-purity monomers were successfully recovered from nylon plastics by utilizing the reversibility and hydrophilicity of amide bonds, with hydrothermal amphoteric hydrolysis applied as the method. On this basis, repolymerization of the monomer was completed, and new nylon was generated by one-pot solution polycondensation, thereby achieving a closed-loop recycling process. A depolymerization model was established for nylon in a hydrothermal system at both macro- and micro levels, revealing a unique mechanism of simultaneous surface and internal depolymerization. This process enables the closed-loop upcycling of nylon, transforming waste back into its starting materials, reducing carbon emissions, and promoting sustainability."

Developing green partners for fungicides is crucial for reducing fungal growth, mycotoxin contamination, and agricultural fungicides input. Herein, we investigated the mechanism of MgO nanoparticles (NPs) in controlling FHB. The EC50 of MgO NPs on mycelial growth was 105.2 μg/mL. At this concentration, they inhibited the spore germination, DON production, and wheat colonization of Fusarium graminearum by 56.0%, 24.5%, and 43.8%, respectively, exhibiting superior performance compared to nine other bioactive NPs such as ZnO and TiO2. Importantly, MgO NPs showed an additive effect with carbendazim and azoxystrobin in inhibiting F. graminearum. The extracellular toxicity of MgO NPs against F. graminearum was mainly attributed to the inhibition of fungal growth and germination by oxidative damage, alkaline damage, and cell structure damage. Although MgO NPs could not be absorbed into mycelia, they (EC90) decreased the soluble protein content and DNA concentration of mycelia by 27.8% and 42.3%, respectively, and increased the pyruvate content by 67.4%, demonstrating that the intracellular toxicity was mainly based on their inhibition of protein and DNA production and promotion of carbohydrate degradation. With low risks to nontarget organisms, MgO NPs could be a promising nanopartner for fungicides to protect wheat from FHB and mitigate fungicide overuse."

Here, we directly evaluated the relationships between whole embryo contaminant concentrations and mRNA expression in liver tissue of the double-crested cormorant (Nannopterum auritum). Eggs collected from three North American sites (one from Lake Erie and two from the Salish Sea) were artificially incubated until pipping. Hepatic mRNA was analyzed with an EcoToxChip quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) array containing 354 target genes. The remaining embryo was analyzed for mercury and 95 persistent organic contaminants. Lake Erie embryos had higher concentrations of most organic contaminants than those from the Salish Sea. Sparse partial least-squares regression analysis of contaminant and gene expression data indicated that chlorinated hydrocarbons, especially polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), were associated with variation in gene expression. Linear correlations revealed consistent pairwise associations between chlorinated contaminants and the expression of nine genes (seven genes with PCBs and two with β-hexachlorocyclohexane). Partial least-squares discriminant analysis identified embryos from the Lake Erie site accurately. Overall, gene expression in embryos from wild-collected eggs was associated with tissue contaminant concentrations, and thus, transcriptomic measurements may serve to identify individuals or populations affected biologically by contaminants."

Robinson and Peter F. DeCarlo,Transmission and Distribution Pipeline Leak Identification and Characterization by Walking Survey and Soil Flux Measurements,"We identified fugitive methane (CH4) leaks within natural gas transmission and distribution pipeline rights of way (ROWs) around Pittsburgh, PA, and Baltimore, MD, by means of a walking survey while measuring ambient methane and ethane (C2 H6) mixing ratios. We used the methane time series to determine discrete leaks using a simple algorithm and verified that the methane was fossil in origin via the methane-to-ethane ratio. For transmission ROWs, we found an average of 23 leaks (range of 12 to 47) over 20.1 total km, corresponding to an activity factor (AF) of 1.1 leaks/km (range 0.60 to 2.3 leaks/km). We also quantified total methane emissions for a subset (N = 5) of the identified leaks using a soil flux measurement chamber. The mean leak emission rate (ER) was 172 g/h/leak (range 17 to 452 g/h/leak). Our AF is higher than the Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory (GHGI) estimate for transmission pipelines, which is 0.02 leaks/km. Our mean ER is also larger than the GHGI estimate for protected steel pipelines (44 g/h/leak). This study provides a model for making AF and ER measurements in vegetated environments with difficult terrain and suggests fugitive emissions from transmission pipelines may be a more significant source of atmospheric methane than is currently outlined in the GHGI."

High winds carried smoke and ash into an unknown number of buildings that, while not incinerated, were significantly damaged. We aimed to understand whether smoke or ash damage to one’s home was associated with physical health impacts of the fire event for people living in and around the fire zone whose homes were not completely destroyed. We analyzed data collected from participants who responded to Wave 1 (six months postfire; N = 642) or Wave 2 (one-year postfire; N = 413) of the Marshall Fire Unified Research Survey. We used self-reported exposure to smells and ash in their homes as measures of exposure and also created spatial exposure measures based on proximity to destroyed structures. Reporting a headache was statistically significantly associated with all exposure metrics (self-reported and spatial proximity), and reporting a strange taste in one’s mouth was also significantly associated with having more destroyed buildings within 250 m of the home. Study findings can inform response planning for future WUI fires to protect the health of residents of smoke-damaged homes."
10.1021/acsestair.4c00259,False,ACS ES&T Air,这篇论文主要关注的是野火烟雾对房屋室内空气中挥发性有机化合物 (VOCs) 的影响。研究使用质子转移反应飞行时间质谱法 (PTR-TOF-MS) 对受马歇尔火灾影响的房屋室内空气中的 VOCs 进行了现场测量。研究发现，火灾后 10 天起，室内 VOCs 混合比在 5 周内缓慢下降，平均下降到初始室内值的约 20%。VOCs 的成分可以由生物质燃烧排放和室内空气成分共同描述。研究还比较了气相和灰烬中多环芳烃 (PAHs) 的分布，并对缓解措施（如使用活性炭空气净化器和开窗通风）进行了测试。模拟烟雾影响实验表明，VOCs 的缓慢下降与室内储库（不仅仅是表面）有关，导致 VOCs 缓慢释放到室内空气中。总的来说，该研究属于室内空气质量领域，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大，例如，没有涉及到卫星观测、大气成分分析等遥感技术。,"['Volatile Organic Compounds', 'Indoor Air Quality', 'Wildfire Smoke', 'Air Cleaners', 'Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS)']",William D.

Hannigan;Joost A. de Gouw,Volatile Organic Compounds Inside Homes Impacted by Smoke from the Marshall Fire,"Wildfires at the wildland–urban interface (WUI) have been increasing in frequency over recent decades due to increased human development and shifting climatic patterns. The work presented here focuses on the impacts of a WUI fire on indoor air using field measurements of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) by Proton-Transfer-Reaction Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS). We found a slow decrease in VOC mixing ratios over the course of roughly 5 weeks starting 10 days after the fire, and those levels decreased to ∼20% of the initial indoor value on average. The VOC composition could be described by a combination of biomass burning emissions and indoor air composition. Comparisons were made between polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) distributions in the gas phase and ash, with differences observed in their distribution between each other and when compared to fresh fuel inventory measurements. Mitigation tests were conducted running air cleaners with activated carbon and opening windows to promote indoor–outdoor air exchange, with both methods showing a decrease greater than 50% for average VOC levels indoors while active. We compare our results with simulated smoke impact experiments that show the slow decline in VOCs must be understood in the context of indoor reservoirs, beyond just on surfaces, leading to the slow release of VOCs to indoor air."

However, the mechanisms for generating deep and abyssal NIWs are largely unknown. Here, using 3 year full‐depth mooring data at 130°E/15°N, we demonstrate that downward propagating tropical cyclone (TC)‐induced NIWs and parametric subharmonic instability (PSI) can contribute to the intensification of near‐inertial kinetic energy (NIKE) over 1,000–3,000 m. The deep warm core eddy (WCE) is found to facilitate the downward propagation of TC‐induced NIWs with fast vertical group velocity and the intensified PSI efficiency that improves the energy transfer from diurnal internal tides (DITs) to NIWs at the site poleward of critical latitude for DITs. Quantitative regression analysis suggests that compared to the PSI, downward penetrating TC‐induced NIWs contribute more to the deep NIKE. Our study emphasizes that accurately representing deep eddy activities and TC's wind intensity in numerical models is crucial to simulating the deep NIKE."
10.1029/2024GL112832,True,Geophysical Research Letters,这篇论文研究了近几十年来全球陆地表面昼夜温差(DTR)的变化趋势。利用集合经验模态分解(EEMD)方法分析了1961年至2022年全球DTR的时空特征和长期趋势。结果表明，全球平均DTR在1988年前后发生了反转，由下降转为上升，影响了全球47%的陆地面积。这种变化在温带地区最为显著，春季和夏季的反转也较早出现。研究发现，由于云量减少导致地表太阳辐射增加，最高气温(Tmax)的升温速度快于最低气温(Tmin)，从而导致DTR的反转和增强。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了卫星观测数据（虽然文中没有明确说明使用了哪种具体的卫星或传感器）来分析地表温度，并探讨了气候变化对地表温度的影响。研究结果对于制定有针对性的气候政策和适应战略具有重要意义。,"['surface temperature', 'diurnal temperature range', 'satellite remote sensing', 'climate change', 'land surface temperature', 'Tmax', 'Tmin', 'cloud cover', 'radiation']",Ge Liu;Yan Guo;Haoming Xia;Xingya Liu;Hongquan Song;Jia Yang;Yuqing Zhang,Increase Asymmetric Warming Rates Between Daytime and Nighttime Temperatures Over Global Land During Recent Decades,"Diurnal asymmetric warming, a critical feature of climate change, significantly impacts water‐carbon exchange in terrestrial ecosystems. This study analyzes the spatiotemporal characteristics and long‐term trends of the global diurnal temperature range (DTR) from 1961 to 2022 using ensemble empirical mode decomposition (EEMD). Our results reveal a trend reversal in global averaged DTR around 1988, shifting from a decrease to an increase, affecting 47% of global land areas. Subsequent to the reversal, the most pronounced increases were observed in temperate regions. Seasonal analysis shows earlier reversals in spring and summer, with accelerated change rates following the reversal. Additionally, increased surface solar radiation from reduced cloud cover caused daily maximum (Tmax) temperatures to warm faster than the minimum (Tmin), leading to a reversal and intensified DTR. These complex patterns underscore the need for targeted climate policies and adaptation strategies to tackle global warming."

The study provides observational evidence supporting the wave resonance (WR) theory which attempts to explain the intensification of MRGW by extratropical forcing. Wavenumber‐frequency cospectral analysis and a bulk measure of growth of MRGW estimated using reanalysis data reveal that the extratropical forcing manifested in the form of eddy momentum flux convergence can create eddy kinetic energy (EKE) and aid the intensification of MRGW via WR mechanism during boreal winter season. However, the WR mechanism does not hold during boreal summer season as the extratropical forcing tends to dampen the MRGW. The analysis also reveals that the Doppler‐shifted eastward propagating MRGW in the WH during boreal winter season are not maintained by extratropical forcing, marking another highlight of this study."

The analysis reveals that multi‐day oscillations are predominantly driven by PW normal modes (NMs), which exhibit distinct seasonal variations and statistical association with Sudden Stratospheric Warming events. Specifically, a prominent 6‐day NM emerges in April, followed by dominant 4‐ and 2‐day NMs persisting until June, with subsequent peaks of 2‐, 4‐, and 6‐day NMs extending from July to October. Furthermore, this study presents the first observational verification of the frequencies and zonal wavenumbers of over 10 secondary waves, arising from nonlinear interactions among planetary‐scale waves. A notable finding is the prevalence of non‐migrating components in the winter 24‐hr and summer 8‐hr tides, phenomena attributed to the nonlinear interactions. Our findings highlight the complexity of atmospheric nonlinear dynamics in generating diverse planetary‐scale periodic oscillations."

The flux of the winter hemisphere maintains downward throughout the night. It is much larger between 30° $30{}^{\circ}$ and 50° $50{}^{\circ}$ geomagnetic latitudes and keeps increasing until 22:00–00:00 LT. It peaks at 60° $60{}^{\circ}$W and 60° $60{}^{\circ}$E–120° $120{}^{\circ}$E geographic longitudes during the December solstice, and at 180° $180{}^{\circ}$E during the June solstice. These features are similar to those of WNE in NmF2. Furthermore, the derived flux is applied as the upper boundary condition to run the Thermosphere Ionosphere Electrodynamics General Circulation Model (TIEGCM).

An enhanced plasma density has been observed in the Martian nightside ionosphere during extreme low solar wind density and pressure periods. At a given altitude, the electron density surged by ∼2.5 times, while for ions (NO+, O2+, CO2+, C+, N+, O+, and OH+), it enhanced by > 10 times, respectively, compared to their typical average quiet‐time periods. This investigation suggests that an upward ionospheric expansion likely took place in a direct consequence to the contrasting low dynamic/magnetic pressure and relatively higher nightside ionospheric pressure (by 1–2 orders) causing an increased ionospheric density. Moreover, the day‐to‐night plasma transport may also be a contributing factor to the increased plasma density.

For the first time, we demonstrate that the tripole's vertical structure across the Mid‐Atlantic Bight continental shelf and slope differs from that in the ocean interior. The tripole strongly projects in the Slope Water north of the Gulf Stream mean path, marked with temperature changes across the water column not maintained by air‐sea heat flux. Over the shelf, the tripole‐associated sea level, temperature, and ocean current are weak. In the ocean interior, the tripole temperature variability is apparent in the upper 100 m in the tropics and three times as deep in the subtropics.

To address this issue, we apply the moving correlation Empirical Orthogonal Function (MC‐EOF) between EASMP and ENSO, identifying a meridional tri‐pole pattern in the interdecadal variation of their relationship. The primary driver of this pattern is the summer Tropical North Atlantic (TNA) sea surface temperature, which has shifted from being uncorrelated to exhibiting a strong negative correlation with concurrent ENSO since the late 1980s.

The downscaled results indicate that, by the end‐of‐century, there are no significant changes in the average minimum central pressures or total number of winter Arctic cyclones. However, there are significant changes in the spatial patterns. For example, the frequency and vorticity of cyclones tend to increase over the western Arctic. Due to the poleward movement of the polar frontal zone and the increased low‐level tropospheric baroclinicity, more cyclones are expected to form within the Arctic Basin and migrate into the western‐central Arctic. We expect about 39% more cyclone tracks forming and dying in the Arctic Basin under RCP8.5, compared to present climate. On the other hand, with the reduced baroclinicity in the entire troposphere, there is a reduced genesis, frequency, and vorticity of cyclones over the Atlantic Arctic. Moreover, the depth of cyclones shows a robust decrease over the Arctic Basin, suggesting weakened eddy kinetic energy. With increasing greenhouse gases, the changes in cyclone vorticities and their depths tend to be stronger. In addition, the high resolution Polar WRF results demonstrate that changes in cyclone track density and intensities consistently become more pronounced with increasing radiative forcing."

Foltz;Alex Sen Gupta,Global Predictability of Marine Heatwave Induced Rapid Intensification of Tropical Cyclones,"Prediction of the rapid intensification (RI) of tropical cyclones (TCs) is crucial for improving disaster preparedness against storm hazards. These events can cause extensive damage to coastal areas if occurring close to landfall. Available models struggle to provide accurate RI estimates due to the complexity of underlying physical mechanisms. This study provides new insights into the prediction of a subset of rapidly intensifying TCs influenced by prolonged ocean warming events known as marine heatwaves (MHWs). MHWs could provide sufficient energy to supercharge TCs. Preconditioning by MHW led to RI of recent destructive TCs, Otis (2023), Doksuri (2023), and Ian (2022), with economic losses exceeding $150 billion. Here, we analyze the TC best track and sea surface temperature data from 1981 to 2023 to identify hotspot regions for compound events, where MHWs and RI of tropical cyclones occur concurrently or in succession. Building upon this, we propose an ensemble machine learning model for RI forecasting based on storm and MHW characteristics. This approach is particularly valuable as RI forecast errors are typically largest in favorable environments, such as those created by MHWs. Our study offers insight into predicting MHW TCs, which have been shown to be stronger TCs with potentially higher destructive power. Here, we show that using MHW predictors instead of the conventional method of using sea surface temperature reduces the false alarm rate by 30%. Overall, our findings contribute to coastal hazard risk awareness amidst unprecedented climate warming causing more frequent MHWs."

 Multijunction photovoltaics (PVs) are gaining prominence owing to their superior capability of achieving power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) beyond the radiative limit of single-junction cells1-8, where improving narrow bandgap tin–lead perovskites is critical for thin-film devices9. With a focus on understanding the chemistry of tin–lead perovskite precursor solutions, we herein find that Sn(II) species dominate interactions with precursors and additives and uncover the exclusive role of carboxylic acid in regulating solution colloidal properties and film crystallisation, and ammonium in improving film optoelectronic properties. Materials that combine these two function groups, amino acid salts, considerably improve the semiconducting quality and homogeneity of perovskite films, surpassing the effect of the individual functional groups when introduced as part of separate molecules. Our enhanced tin–lead perovskite layer allows us to fabricate solar cells with PCEs of 23.9, 29.7 (certified 29.26%), and 28.7% for single-, double-, and triple-junction devices, respectively. Our 1-cm2 triple-junction devices show PCEs of 28.4% (certified 27.28%). Encapsulated triple-junction cells maintain 80% of their initial efficiencies after 860 h maximum power point tracking in ambient.

Here, the authors use Micro-C to study the T. brucei genome architecture at high resolution and reveal an intricate network of inter-chromosomal transcription hub structures. 
 The eukaryotic nucleus exhibits a highly organized 3D genome architecture, with RNA transcription and processing confined to specific nuclear structures. While intra-chromosomal interactions, such as promoter-enhancer dynamics, are well-studied, the role of inter-chromosomal interactions remains poorly understood. Investigating these interactions in mammalian cells is challenging due to large genome sizes and the need for deep sequencing. Additionally, transcription-dependent 3D topologies in mixed cell populations further complicate analyses. To address these challenges, we used high-resolution DNA-DNA contact mapping (Micro-C) in Trypanosoma brucei, a parasite with continuous RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription and polycistronic transcription units (PTUs). With approximately 300 transcription start sites (TSSs), this genome organization simplifies data interpretation. To minimize scaffolding artifacts, we also generated a highly contiguous phased genome assembly using ultra-long sequencing reads. Our Micro-C analysis revealed an intricate 3D genome organization. While the T. brucei genome displays features resembling chromosome territories, its chromosomes are arranged around polymerase-specific transcription hubs. RNAPI-transcribed genes cluster, as expected from their localization to the nucleolus. However, we also found that RNAPII TSSs form distinct inter-chromosomal transcription hubs with other RNAPII TSSs. These findings highlight the evolutionary significance of inter-chromosomal transcription hubs and provide new insights into genome organization in T. brucei. Decoding the role of inter-chromosomal DNA-DNA interactions remains challenging. Here, the authors use Micro-C to study the T. brucei genome architecture at high resolution and reveal an intricate network of inter-chromosomal transcription hub structures."

 Semliki Forest virus (SFV) is a neuropathogenic alphavirus which is of interest both as a model neurotropic alphavirus and as an oncolytic virus with proven potency in preclinical cancer models. In laboratory mice, peripherally administered SFV infiltrates the central nervous system (CNS) and causes encephalitis of varying severity. The route of SFV CNS entrance is poorly understood but has been considered to occur through the blood-brain barrier. Here we show that neuroinvasion of intravenously administered SFV is strictly dependent on very-low-density-lipoprotein receptor (VLDLR) which acts as an entry receptor for SFV. Moreover, SFV primarily enters the CNS through the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (B-CSF) barrier via infecting choroid plexus epithelial cells which show distinctly high expression of VLDLR. This is the first indication of neurotropic alphavirus utilizing choroid plexus for CNS entry, and VLDLR playing a specific and crucial role for mediating SFV entry through this pathway.

 The native extracellular matrix is continuously remodeled to form complex interconnected network structures that reversibly regulate stem cell behaviors. Both regulation and understanding of its intricate dynamicity can help to modulate numerous cell behaviors. However, neither of these has yet been achieved due to the lack of designing and modeling such complex structures with dynamic controllability. Here we report modularity-based mathematical modeling of extracellular matrix-emulating ligand inter-cluster connectivity using the graph theory. Increasing anisotropy of magnetic nano-blockers proportionately disconnects arginine-glycine-aspartic acid ligand-to-ligand interconnections and decreases the number of ligand inter-cluster edges. This phenomenon deactivates stem cells, which can be partly activated by linearizing the nano-blockers. Remote cyclic elevation of high-anisotropy nano-blockers flexibly generates nano-gaps under the nano-blockers and augments the number of ligand inter-cluster edges. Subsequently, integrin-presenting stem cell infiltration is stimulated, which reversibly intensifies focal adhesion and mechanotransduction-driven differentiation both in vitro and in vivo. Designing and systemically modeling extracellular matrix-mimetic geometries opens avenues for unraveling dynamic cell-material interactions for tissue regeneration.

 Mirror-image proteins, composed of d-amino acids, are an attractive therapeutic modality, as they exhibit high metabolic stability and lack immunogenicity. Development of mirror-image binding proteins is achieved through chemical synthesis of d-target proteins, phage display library selection of l-binders and chemical synthesis of (mirror-image) d-binders that consequently bind the physiological l-targets. Monobodies are well-established synthetic (l-)binding proteins and their small size (~90 residues) and lack of endogenous cysteine residues make them particularly accessible to chemical synthesis. Here, we develop monobodies with nanomolar binding affinities against the d-SH2 domain of the leukemic tyrosine kinase BCR::ABL1. Two crystal structures of heterochiral monobody-SH2 complexes reveal targeting of the pY binding pocket by an unconventional binding mode. We then prepare potent d-monobodies by either ligating two chemically synthesized d-peptides or by self-assembly without ligation. Their proper folding and stability are determined and high-affinity binding to the l-target is shown. d-monobodies are protease-resistant, show long-term plasma stability, inhibit BCR::ABL1 kinase activity and bind BCR::ABL1 in cell lysates and permeabilized cells. Hence, we demonstrate that functional d-monobodies can be developed readily. Our work represents an important step towards possible future therapeutic use of d-monobodies when combined with emerging methods to enable cytoplasmic delivery of monobodies.

 The North Atlantic Tripole sea surface temperature anomaly (NAT SSTA) is critical for predicting climate in Eurasia. Predictions for summer climate anomalies currently assume the NAT SSTA phase persists from boreal winter through summer. When NAT phase switches, predictions become unreliable. However, the NAT phase sustained/reversal mechanism from boreal winter to spring remains unclear. This study demonstrates that the evolution of the NAT phase could be driven by the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). When NAO phase persists (switches) during preceding boreal winter, the NAO-driven wind anomalies favor maintenance (transition) of NAT phase by causing sea surface heat flux anomalies. Meanwhile, NAT SSTA causes eddy-mean flow interaction by increasing atmospheric baroclinity, thereby generating positive feedback on the former NAO phase. The NAO phase change is leading 1–3 months for the NAT phase. These findings deepen our understanding of the interaction between NAO and NAT and provide implications for seasonal prediction in Eurasia."

We find that irrigation reduces WBGT by 0.3–1.3  °C during the daytime in summer due to strong evaporative cooling. However, during the summer nights, irrigation increases WBGT by 0.4–1.3 °C, when a large increase in humidity sufficiently raises the wet-bulb temperature. Urban and fallow areas adjacent to cropped fields also experience increased heat stress due to moisture advection from irrigated areas. Our results can inform heat-related policies in agricultural regions of California and elsewhere. In the Imperial Valley of California, irrigation of agricultural fields in summer decreases farmworker’s heat stress in the daytime but increases it at night, according to an analysis that uses high-resolution data from a regional climate model."

 Formation of granite-hosted tin deposits reflects the differentiation and maturation of continental crust. While rare in Earth’s early continental crust, the eastern Kaapvaal Craton in southern Africa may harbor the oldest known tin-bearing granites. Here we present a perspective of early continental evolution from the study of Archean detrital cassiterite from the volcano-sedimentary continental cover succession of the Dominion Group of the western Kaapvaal Craton. The cassiterites yield a concordia age of 3084.7 ± 2.3 million-year-old, representing the oldest detrital cassiterite ever found. They are enriched in hafnium, zirconium, niobium, and tantalum, depleted in tungsten, and have overall consistent δ18O values (mostly 3‒5‰) but heterogeneous δ122/118Sn values (−0.59 to 0.79‰). They likely originated from erosion of peraluminous granites, forming immediate basement of the Dominion Group. The occurrence of ~3.08 billion-year-old detrital cassiterite suggests widespread tin mineralization in the granites, the intrusion of which led to stabilization of the Kaapvaal craton. A detrital cassiterite found in the Kaapvaal Craton, South Africa, implies widespread tin mineralization and stabilization of granitic cratons approximately 3.08 billion years ago, as shown by U-Pb geochronology, trace element and oxygen and tin isotopes."

 Inland lakes are a crucial source of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The interconnected river-lake systems feature multiple lake regions, wherein numerous rivers interconnect various lake regions. Their intricate hydrological conditions and interactions distinguish them from conventional lakes, which typically have a single and relatively static water body. However, the greenhouse gas emission characteristics, as well as the driving forces of the interconnected river-lake systems, are still under-researched. Here, we carried out bi-seasonal in situ surveys across a typical interconnected river-lake system, Dongting Lake, along with a meta-analysis derived from 168 lakes spanning six continents, to elucidate this issue. We found that interconnected river-lake systems exhibit a unique temporal variation in carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide fluxes, with positive fluxes during the wet season but transitioning to sinks during the dry season. Greenhouse gas fluxes in conventional stable lakes are frequently correlated with abiotic factors, such as hydro-climatological conditions and trophic status. While in Dongting Lake, specific microbial species that are important to the cycling of macronutrients and other less common nutrients, alongside microbial predatory behaviour, can better predict greenhouse gas fluxes. Our study highlights the importance of biotic predictors in prospective greenhouse gases flux estimates.

Hu,Peak structure of extreme precipitation to temperature varies across climate patterns: Insights into intensity and frequency,"•Peak structures exist in the relationships between extreme precipitation intensity/frequency and temperature across China. •The extreme precipitation frequency peaks tend to occur at higher temperatures than intensity peaks. •The negative scaling of extreme precipitation intensity and frequency are distinct across various climate zones. 
 The peak structure of relationships between extreme precipitation intensity (EPI) and temperature has triggered increasing attention. However, investigations into the correlation between extreme precipitation frequency (EPF) and temperature are relatively scarce. Leveraging an extensive dataset of daily precipitation and temperature data from 3825 grids over the 1961–2019 period, our research analyzes the EPI-temperature (EPI-T) and EPF-temperature (EPF-T) relationships at 11 Climate Zones in China. The investigation affirms the presence of peak structures in both EPI-T and EPF-T relationships in all Climate Zones. Significant differences are observed between these two relationships. Asymmetry characterizes the peak structures, with EPI and EPF occurrences more dominant at the low-temperature condition. Spatial disparities in peak structures are more distinct for EPI-T compared to EPF-T. The study also identifies significant spatial differences in the corresponding temperatures at the peaks of EPI (EPIpeaks) and EPF (EPFpeaks), with the highest and lowest peaks distributed in Southeastern China (>20 °C) and Qinghai-Tibet Plateau regions (<10 °C), respectively. Our results highlight that EPF peaks tend to occur at higher temperature conditions than EPI peaks. The peaks of EPI and EPF, as well as the temperatures at these peaks, are likely to increase in response to global warming. Most Climate Zones may experience more intense extreme precipitation peaks and higher associated temperatures in the future. This research contributes essential insights into the complex interplay between extreme precipitation and temperature, which is crucial for mitigating the impacts of climate change."
