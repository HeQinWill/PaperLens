This work uses numerical simulations to explore the impact of critical design parameters on the performance of upcoming CO2-observing satellite concepts. 
 Satellites have been providing spaceborne observations of the total column of CO2 (denoted XCO2) for over two decades now, and, with the need for independent verification of Paris Agreement objectives, many new satellite concepts are currently planned or being studied to complement or extend the instruments that already exist. Depending on whether they are targeting natural and/or anthropogenic fluxes of CO2, the designs of these future concepts vary greatly. The characteristics of their shortwave infrared (SWIR) observations notably explore several orders of magnitude in spectral resolution (from λ/Δλ ∼ 400 for Carbon Mapper to λ/Δλ ∼ 25 000 for MicroCarb) and include different selections of spectral bands (from one to four bands, among which there are the CO2-sensitive 1.6 µm and/or 2.05 µm bands). The very nature of the spaceborne measurements is also explored: for instance, the NanoCarb imaging concept proposes to measure CO2-sensitive truncated interferograms, instead of infrared spectra like other concepts, in order to significantly reduce the instrument size. This study synthetically explores the impact of three different design parameters on the XCO2 retrieval performance obtained through optimal estimation: (1) the spectral resolution, (2) the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and (3) the spectral band selection. Similar performance assessments are completed for the exactly defined OCO-2, MicroCarb, Copernicus CO2 Monitoring  (CO2M) and NanoCarb concepts. We show that improving the SNR is more efficient than improving the spectral resolution to increase  XCO2 precision when perturbing these parameters across 2 orders of magnitude, and we find that a low SNR and/or a low spectral resolution yield XCO2 with vertical sensitivities that give more weight to atmospheric layers close to the surface. The exploration of various spectral band combinations illustrates, especially for lower spectral resolutions, how including an O2-sensitive band helps to increase the optical path length information and how the 2.05 µm CO2-sensitive band contains more geophysical information than the 1.6 µm band. With very different characteristics, MicroCarb shows a CO2 information content that is only slightly higher than that of CO2M, which translates into XCO2 random errors that are lower by a factor ranging from 1.1 to 1.9, depending on the observational situation. The performance of NanoCarb for a single pixel of its imager is comparable to those of concepts that measure spectra at low SNR and low spectral resolution, but, as this novel concept would observe a given target several times during a single overpass, its performance improves when combining all the observations. Overall, the broad range of results obtained through this synthetic XCO2 performance mapping hint at the future intercomparison challenges that the wide variety of upcoming CO2-observing concepts will pose."

Knappe,Machine Learning Models to Predict Early Breakthrough of Recalcitrant Organic Micropollutants in Granular Activated Carbon Adsorbers,"Granular activated carbon (GAC) adsorption is frequently used to remove recalcitrant organic micropollutants (MPs) from water. The overarching aim of this research was to develop machine learning (ML) models to predict GAC performance from adsorbent, adsorbate, and background water matrix properties. For model calibration, MP breakthrough curves were compiled and analyzed to determine the bed volumes of water that can be treated until MP breakthrough reaches ten percent of the influent MP concentration (BV10). Over 400 data points were split into training, validation, and testing sets. Seventeen variables describing MP, background water matrix, and GAC properties were explored in ML models to predict log10-transformed BV10 values. Using the ML models on the testing set, predicted BV10 values exhibited mean absolute errors of ∼0.12 log units and were highly correlated with experimentally determined values (R2 ≥ 0.88). The top three drivers influencing BV10 predictions were the air-hexadecane partition coefficient and hydrogen bond acidity (Abraham parameters L and A) of the MPs and the dissolved organic carbon concentration of the GAC influent water. The model can be used to rapidly estimate the GAC bed life, select effective GAC products for a given treatment scenario, and explore the suitability of GAC treatment for remediating emerging MPs."

Lindsay,Uranium Speciation and Mobilization in Thawing Permafrost,"Uranium is a toxic and pervasive geogenic contaminant often associated with organic matter. Its abundance and speciation in organic-rich permafrost soils are unknown, thereby limiting our ability to assess risks associated with uranium mobilization during permafrost thaw. In this study, we assessed uranium speciation in permafrost soil and porewater liberated during thaw using active-layer and permafrost samples from a study area in Yukon, Canada where elevated uranium concentrations occur in bedrock and groundwater. Permafrost contained 1.1–28 wt % organic carbon and elevated uranium (range 7.6–1040 μg g–1, median 25 μg g–1) relative to local bedrock. The highest soil uranium concentrations were encountered in catchments hosting uranium-enriched bedrock and correlated positively with soil organic carbon. X-ray absorption spectroscopy, micro-X-ray fluorescence, and electron microscopy analyses revealed that solid-phase uranium predominantly occurs as uranium(VI) associated with soil organic matter. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) analyses suggested the presence of uranium(VI) coordinated with carbon, consistent with bidentate-mononuclear uranyl complexation on carboxyl groups. Permafrost thaw produced circumneutral pH porewater (pH 6.2–7.5) with elevated dissolved uranium (0.5–203 μg L–1). Geochemical modeling indicated that calcium-uranyl-carbonate complexes dominated the dissolved uranium speciation. This study highlights that permafrost soil can mobilize uranium upon thaw and that uranium fate is linked to dynamic biogeochemical reactions involving organic carbon and groundwater chemistry."

Although the formation of Fe(III) minerals in AMD-impacted waters has previously been reported to be regulated by biological processes, the role of abiotic processes remains largely unknown. This study first reported that a photochemical reaction coupled with O2 significantly accelerated the formation of Fe(III) flocculates (i.e., schwertmannite) in the AMD, as evidenced by the comparison of samples from contaminated sites across different natural conditions at latitudes 24–29° N. Combined with experimental and modeling results, it is further discovered that the intramolecular oxidation of photogenerated Fe(II) with a five-coordinative pyramidal configuration (i.e., [(H2O)5Fe]2+) by O2 was the key in enhancing the photooxidation of Fe(II) in the simulated AMD. The in situ attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectrometry (ATR-FTIR), UV–vis spectroscopy, solvent substitution, and quantum yield analyses indicated that, acting as a precursor for flocculation, [(H2O)5Fe]2+ likely originated from both the dissolved and colloidal forms of Fe(III) through homogeneous and surface ligand-to-metal charge transfers. Density functional theory calculations and X-ray absorption spectroscopy results further suggested that the specific oxidation pathways of Fe(II) produced the highly reactive iron species and triggered the hydrolysis and formation of transient dihydroxo dimers. The proposed new pathways of Fe cycle are crucial in controlling the mobility of heavy metal anions in acidic waters and enhance the understanding of complicated iron biochemistry that is related to the fate of contaminants and nutrients."

Herein, a high-efficiency and energy-saving photothermal synergistic catalytic oxidation method was developed for the removal of 1,2-dichloroethane (1,2-DCE). Compared to traditional thermocatalysis, the 1,2-DCE conversion over Ru–U6S in photothermal synergistic catalysis at 340 °C increased by approximately 44% not only reducing energy consumption but also avoiding the instability of MOF structure caused by high reaction temperature. The excellent photothermal catalytic oxidation activity was derived from the synergistic effect of photo- and thermocatalysis. Ru–U6S demonstrated excellent 1,2-DCE adsorption capacity and stronger light utilization and could produce more reactive oxygen species (•OH and •O2–) after light illumination, which participated in the oxidation reaction, promoting the release of the active site of the catalyst. The results of H2O-TPD and NH3-DRIFTS exhibited that the use of S-containing ligands in the synthesis process increased the hydroxyl groups and Brønsted acid sites, significantly improved the selectivity of CO2 and HCl in the oxidation process, and reduced the release of chlorine-containing byproducts.

Variations in the light-absorption properties and molecular composition of BrC due to atmospheric photochemical aging process have not been well constrained, leading to high uncertainty in evaluating its global radiative effect. The molecular composition of atmospheric BrC were investigated to stress the BrC photobleaching in this work. In total, 896 organic compounds were identified, which accounted for 2.5%–26.1% of organic aerosol in mass concentration. We found that solar radiation led to the declined mass absorption coefficient at 375 nm (MAC375), indicating BrC photobleaching, coinciding with an elevated mass fraction of carboxylic acids (CAs). This phenomenon was more pronounced under higher-energy solar radiation. Specifically, the mass fraction of nitrocarboxylic acids (NCAs) in CAs increased during BrC photobleaching, which was potentially caused by the oxidation of nitrophenols, resulting in an ∼83.3% decrease in MAC375. Our findings provide  direct observational evidence of BrC photobleaching from a molecular-level perspective and elucidate a potential BrC photobleaching pathway in the urban atmosphere."

Edmonds,Topographic Roughness as an Emergent Property of Geomorphic Processes and Events,"Earth's terrestrial surfaces commonly exhibit topographic roughness at the scale of meters to tens of meters. In soil‐ and sediment‐mantled settings topographic roughness may be framed as a competition between roughening and smoothing processes. In many cases, roughening processes may be specific eco‐hydro‐geomorphic events like shrub deaths, tree uprooting, river avulsions, or impact craters. The smoothing processes are all geomorphic processes that operate at smaller scales and tend to drive a diffusive evolution of the surface. In this article, we present a generalized theory that explains topographic roughness as an emergent property of geomorphic systems (semi‐arid plains, forests, alluvial fans, heavily bombarded surfaces) that are periodically shocked by an addition of roughness which subsequently decays due to the action of all small scale, creep‐like processes. We demonstrate theory for the examples listed above, but also illustrate that there is a continuum of topographic forms that the roughening process may take on so that the theory is broadly applicable. Furthermore, we demonstrate how our theory applies to any geomorphic feature that can be described as a pit or mound, pit‐mound couplet, or mound‐pit‐mound complex."

After an irregularity production peak at sunset, the amplitude of the resulting turbulence decays with time. Analyzing a large database of irregularity spectra observed by one of the European Space Agency's Swarm satellites, we have applied a novel but conceptually simple statistical analysis to the data, finding that turbulence in the F‐region tends to decay with a uniform, scale‐independent rate, thereby confirming and extending the results from an earlier case study.

We present evidence that these features may be related to fluid drainage of the slip zone during seismic slip. We sheared water‐saturated kaolinite powders under both fluid drained and undrained conditions, expected for seismic slip at shallow crustal depths. Our results show typical dynamic weakening behavior regardless of conditions. Under fluid drained condition, restrengthening accompanied by the thermal decomposition of kaolinite occurs. In addition, thermal decomposition of kaolinite tends to be initiated at high normal stresses (>5 MPa) with short displacement (<5 m). We propose that thermal pressurization acts as a weakening mechanism but ceases because of fluid drainage, triggering kaolinite thermal decomposition.

A heat‐budget analysis reveals coupling between cloud‐radiative effects, circulation, and SST gradients in driving multi‐decadal variability in the Eastern Pacific. Using this relationship and observed feedback estimates, we find that internal Eastern Pacific SST variability is underestimated in most models. Adjusting for model bias increases the likelihood of generating a cooling trend at least as large as observations in preindustrial control simulations by ∼ ${\sim} $56% on average. If models underestimate climate “noise,” as our results suggest, this bias should be accounted for when attributing the relative importance of forced versus unforced changes in the climate."

Quantifying and understanding the observed patterns is desirable, as they provide information about the dynamics of the processes involved. This study introduces the empirical spatio‐temporal covariance function and a corresponding parametric covariance function as tools to identify and characterize spatio‐temporal patterns in remotely sensed fields. The method is demonstrated using 2 km hourly GOES‐16/17 land surface temperature (LST) data over the Contiguous United States by splitting the area into 1.0° × 1.0° domains. The summer day‐time LST ESTCFs for 2018 to 2022 are derived for each domain, and a parametric covariance model is fitted. Clustering analysis is applied to detect areas with similar spatio‐temporal LST patterns. Six main zones within CONUS are identified and characterized based on their variance and temporal and spatial characteristic length scales (i.e., scales for which the temperature variations are temporally and spatially related), respectively: (a) Eastern plains with 3 K2, ∼6 hr, and 0.15°, (b) Gulf of California with 60 K2, ∼8 hr, and 0.34°, (c) mountains and coasts transition 1 with 16 K2, ∼11 hr, and 0.25°, (d) central US, Midwest, and South cities with 5.5 K2, ∼8 hr, and ∼0.2°, (e) mountains and coasts transition 2 with ∼10 K2, ∼8 hr, and 0.2°, and (f) largest mountains and coastlines with ∼19 K2, ∼13 hr, and 0.3°.

 The direct C–H activation of inert C(sp3)–H bonds in a hydrocarbon chain has been a very attractive target in organic synthesis for many decades. Among all the variety of processes, those driven by vinyl carbocations are quite scarce thus far, and it is hard to control for unstabilized vinyl cations. In this study, we designed a double C(sp3)–H functionalization of unactivated alkyl CH2 groups to produce a totally substituted quaternary carbon stereocenter via insertion of vinyl carbocations. These processes represent complicated reaction cascades with high molecular complexity controlled by the cooperative action of Ga(III) salts & GaHal4– anions and allow one-step deep poly-functionalization of simple CH substrates to be performed.

 Pathogen-host competition for manganese and intricate immunostimulatory pathways severely attenuates the efficacy of antibacterial immunotherapy against biofilm infections associated with orthopaedic implants. Herein, we introduce a spatiotemporal sono-metalloimmunotherapy (SMIT) strategy aimed at efficient biofilm ablation by custom design of ingenious biomimetic metal-organic framework (PCN-224)-coated MnO2-hydrangea nanoparticles (MnPM) as a metalloantibiotic. Upon reaching the acidic H2O2-enriched biofilm microenvironment, MnPM can convert abundant H2O2 into oxygen, which is conducive to significantly enhancing the efficacy of ultrasound (US)-triggered sonodynamic therapy (SDT), thereby exposing bacteria-associated antigens (BAAs). Moreover, MnPM disrupts bacterial homeostasis, further killing more bacteria. Then, the Mn ions released from the degraded MnO2 can recharge immune cells to enhance the cGAS-STING signaling pathway sensing of BAAs, further boosting the immune response and suppressing biofilm growth via biofilm-specific T cell responses. Following US withdrawal, the sustained oxygenation promotes the survival and migration of fibroblasts, stimulates the expression of angiogenic growth factors and angiogenesis, and neutralizes excessive inflammation. Our findings highlight that MnPM may act as an immune costimulatory metalloantibiotic to regulate the cGAS-STING signaling pathway, presenting a promising alternative to antibiotics for orthopaedic biofilm infection treatment and pro-tissue repair.

 How intracellular bacteria subvert the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I pathway is poorly understood. Here, we show that the obligate intracellular bacterium Orientia tsutsugamushi uses its effector protein, Ank5, to inhibit nuclear translocation of the MHC class I gene transactivator, NLRC5, and orchestrate its proteasomal degradation. Ank5 uses a tyrosine in its fourth ankyrin repeat to bind the NLRC5 N-terminus while its F-box directs host SCF complex ubiquitination of NLRC5 in the leucine-rich repeat region that dictates susceptibility to Orientia- and Ank5-mediated degradation. The ability of O. tsutsugamushi strains to degrade NLRC5 correlates with ank5 genomic carriage. Ectopically expressed Ank5 that can bind but not degrade NLRC5 protects the transactivator during Orientia infection. Thus, Ank5 is an immunoevasin that uses its bipartite architecture to rid host cells of NLRC5 and reduce surface MHC class I molecules. This study offers insight into how intracellular pathogens can impair MHC class I expression. Viruses and bacteria are known to subvert the immune system using mimic or inhibitory proteins.

 Expanding and intensifying agriculture has led to a loss of soil carbon. As agroecosystems cover over 40% of Earth’s land surface, they must be part of the solution put in action to mitigate climate change. Development of efficient management practices to maximize soil carbon retention is currently limited, in part, by a poor understanding of how plants, which input carbon to soil, and microbes, which determine its fate there, interact. Here we implement a diversity gradient by intercropping undersown species with barley in a large field trial, ranging from one to eight undersown species. We find that increasing plant diversity strengthens positive associations within the rhizosphere soil microbial community in relation to negative associations. These associations, in turn, enhance community carbon use efficiency.

Here, a new material structure activated by compression is proposed, yielding strong optical regulation with minute deformation 
 Smart windows, capable of tailoring light transmission, can significantly reduce energy consumption in building services. While mechano-responsive windows activated by strains are promising candidates, they face long-lasting challenges in which the space for the light scatterer’s operation has to be enlarged along with the window size, undermining the practicality. Recent attempts to tackle this challenge inevitably generate side effects with compromised performance in light modulation. Here, we introduce a cuttlefish-inspired design to enable the closing and opening of pores within the 3D porous structure by through-thickness compression, offering opacity and transparency upon release and compression. By changing the activation mode from the conventional in-plane to through-thickness direction, the space requirement is intrinsically decoupled from the lateral size of the scatterer. Central to our design is the asymmetry of pore orientation in the 3D porous structure. These inclined pores against the normal direction increase the opaqueness upon release and improve light modulation sensitivity to compression, enabling transmittance regulation upon compression by an infinitesimal displacement of 50 μm. This work establishes a milestone for smart window technologies and will drive advancements in the development of opto-electric devices.

 Precipitation and temperature are critical factors influencing terrestrial water storage (TWS) can lead to unexpected TWS losses when compounded by dryness and high temperatures. Yet, a dynamic assessment of the individual and combined effects of these conditions on TWS is lacking. This study proposes a framework to assess TWS loss driven by compound dry-hot conditions (CDHC) and dynamically evaluates risk probabilities and thresholds for 2003–2012 and 2013–2022. Results showed that CDHC exert a greater impact on TWS than dry or hot conditions alone. The risk probabilities of global TWS loss are higher in the late period than in the early period, with risk probabilities for light and extreme levels increasing by approximately 9–11 % and 2–7 %, respectively. Although the resilience of water resource systems to CDHC has increased in some regions, it still shows a decreasing trend on a global scale. The decrease in the resilience to TWS in major hyperarid areas is primarily influenced by temperature, whereas that in arid areas is primarily affected by precipitation. These distinct patterns may be the primary factors contributing to the exacerbation of global TWS loss. This study provides a novel approach for the dynamic assessment of global TWS under CDHC. The research findings offer valuable insights for decision-makers developing adaptive strategies to mitigate future CDHC challenges."

 The frequency and intensity of global drought events are continuously increasing, posing an elevated risk of forest mortality worldwide. Accurately understanding the impact of drought on forests, particularly the distribution of mortality due to drought, is crucial for scientifically understanding global ecological drought. Atmospheric indicators and soil moisture are typically correlated with tree growth and influence tree water status and drought severity; however, they do not directly represent forest drought conditions. Optical vegetation indices reflect forest mortality but are affected by response delays, low temporal resolution, and cloud contamination. Therefore, the accuracy of current assessment methods for global drought-induced forest mortality, which are based on meteorological and vegetation variables, still needs improvement. To address this challenge, we utilized vegetation optical depth (VOD) data to characterize the changes in forest canopy moisture due to drought. VOD is a parameter that describes the transmissivity of vegetation in the microwave band and is closely related to forest water content and biomass, with longer wavelengths and greater penetration capabilities than visible and near-infrared remote sensing signals. We calculated the annual variation of VOD (ΔVOD) as a supplementary indicator to enhance the accuracy of monitoring and modeling of global drought-induced forest mortality. We integrated VOD with vegetation indices, meteorological data, terrain, and other variables to construct a predictive model of forest mortality due to drought and used this model to generate a series of global maps depicting drought-induced forest mortality. The results indicated that variables related to VOD contributed significantly to the mortality model compared with those based on vegetation or meteorological variables. Furthermore, ΔVOD exhibited a higher correlation with reference mortality rates compared to relative water content, the enhanced vegetation index, and climate water deficit. Notably, by validating the model fit with reference mortality rates, we found that incorporating ΔVOD into the model improved the accuracy of the global forest mortality map from R2 = 0.45 to R2 = 0.63. By optimizing the training points using a two-stage correlation threshold between ΔVOD and the reference mortality, map accuracy was further improved to R2 = 0.72. This study highlights the effectiveness of VOD, particularly ΔVOD, as a direct indicator of vegetation water content variation, for predicting drought-induced forest mortality. The global forest mortality map obtained from 2014 to 2018 is of significant value for the further analysis of forest carbon variations induced by extreme global drought events."

 Ongoing advances in satellite remote sensing data and machine learning methods have enabled crop yield estimation at various spatial and temporal resolutions. While yield mapping at broader scales (e.g., state or county level) has become common, mapping at finer scales (e.g., field or subfield) has been limited by the lack of ground truth data for model training and evaluation. Here we present a scale transfer framework, named Quantile loss Domain Adversarial Neural Networks (QDANN), that leverages knowledge from county-level datasets to map crop yields at the subfield level. Based on the strategy of unsupervised domain adaptation, QDANN is trained on labeled county-level data and unlabeled subfield-level data, with no requirement for yield information at the subfield level. We evaluate the proposed method applied to Landsat imagery and Gridmet weather data for maize, soybean, and winter wheat fields in the United States, using as reference data yield monitor records from roughly one million field-year observations. The model is compared with several process-based and machine learning-based benchmark approaches that train on simulated yield records or county-level data. QDANN-estimated yields achieved an R2 score (RMSE) of 48 % (2.29 t/ha), 32 % (0.85 t/ha), and 39 % (1.40 t/ha) for maize, soybean, and winter wheat in comparison with the ground-based yield measures, respectively. These performances are higher than benchmark approaches and are nearly as good as models trained on field-level data. When aggregated to the county level, the improvement achieved by QDANN is more pronounced and the R2 scores (RMSE) improved to 78 % (0.98 t/ha), 62 % (0.37 t/ha), and 53 % (1.00 t/ha) for maize, soybean, and winter wheat, respectively. This study demonstrates that the proposed scale transfer framework can serve as a reliable approach for yield mapping at the subfield level when there is no access to fine-scale yield information. Based on the QDANN model, we have generated and made publicly available 30-m annual yield maps for major crop-producing states in the U.S. since 2008."

 Extraction of built-up areas from polarimetric synthetic aperture radar (PolSAR) images plays a crucial role in disaster management. The polarimetric orientation angles (POAs) of built-up areas exhibit diversity, and built-up areas with POA close to 45° are often misclassified as vegetation. To address this problem, a polarimetric feature suitable for the extraction of built-up areas with large POAs is first designed, and a mixed real-complex-valued polarimetric feature combination is constructed. Then, a real-complex and spatial feature fusion classification network (RCSFFCNet) is designed. In which the proposed mixed real-complex-valued residual structure can efficiently extract mixed numerical features. Additionally, a multi-local spatial convolutional attention module is designed and embedded to efficiently fuse mixed numerical features, as well as superpixel multi-local spatial features. Experiments were conducted using PolSAR images from Gaofen-3, Radarsat-2, and ALOS-2/PALSAR-2. The experimental results show that the feature combination proposed in this paper increases the F1 score of built-up areas by approximately 2%-3%, and the F1 score of built-up areas extracted using the RCSFFCNet also improves by about 2%-3%, with F1 scores exceeding 95%. On all three datasets, the proposed method achieves the best performance in extracting built-up areas with various POAs, indicating overall superiority from feature selection to model implementation."

 Chlorophyll-a (Chl-a) and Total Suspended Matter (TSM) are key health indicators of the coastal ocean and seas. The former is linked to primary productivity, while the latter is associated with water quality; both are influenced by change in climate. Recent studies have highlighted a declining trend in Chl-a levels along the Mediterranean coastal region. River discharge plays an important role in regulating the coastal Chl-a concentration levels. The present research primarily focuses on understanding the significance of Tiber River −driven spatial dynamics of Chl-a and TSM along the central Tyrrhenian Sea coasts. The research also focuses on evaluating the applicability of Sentinel-2 and identifying a suitable method for estimating Chl-a and TSM from Sentinel-2. Neural networks and dark spectrum fitting techniques were applied using multiple algorithms to estimate the dynamic distribution of Chl-a and TSM driven by the Tiber River in the study area. Multiple statistical analyses were performed, and statistically significant relationships were observed. The Case-2 Regional Coast Colour Neural Network (C2RCC-Net) outperformed all other algorithms, with an R2 value of 0.903 for Chl-a and an R2 value of 0.966 for TSM. Furthermore, the present research also identified a positive pixel to pixel spatial correlation between Chl-a and TSM in all four seasons, highlighting the positive impact of Tiber River on maintaining Chl-a levels along the coasts of Tyrrhenian Sea. This stands in contrast with the negative trend seen in the Mediterranean scale."

Abd Elbasit;Xiaohe Gu;Wei Su,The novel triangular spectral indices for characterizing winter wheat drought,"•LST, LAI, SWIR and LSWI are used for developing our triangular spectral indices. •ECHIs, DCHIs and PWSIs spectral indices for winter wheat drought monitoring. •ECHI2shows the highest correlation with relative soil moisture and volumetric water content. •ECHI2shows highly correlation with popular drought monitoring indices. 
 Agricultural drought threatens food security and agricultural sustainable development. There have been numerous spectral indices from remote sensing images developed for monitoring crop drought. However, most present spectral indices are focusing on crop growth and Land Surface Temperature (LST), and the crop canopy water content are in less consideration simultaneously. Additionally, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used for characterizing crop growth in almost all spectral drought indices, with the spectral saturation problem of NDVI for closed crop canopy. When vegetation cover is high, NDVI values tend to saturate, which makes them insensitive to further changes in crop health. Therefore, the NDVI saturation phenomenon may lead to an underestimation of the extent of crop drought, as it is not effective in identifying subtle changes in crops under high-density vegetation conditions. Hence, we propose three novel triangular spectral indices for characterizing winter wheat drought using three features including LAI, Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) and LST. For validating the proposed spectral indices, we compared the agreement between these indices with measured Relative Soil Moisture (RSM) and Volumetric Water Content (VWC) of soil in agricultural meteorological station and present popular indices including Crop Water Stress Index (CWSI), Temperature-Vegetation Drought Index (TVDI), and Vegetation Health Index (VHI). The results revealed that our proposed indices including Euclidean distance Crop Health Index (ECHI), Difference Crop Health Index (DCHI) and Perpendicular Water Stress Index (PWSI) outperformed the popular CWSI, TVDI and VHI, with stronger correlations with measured RSM and VWC in agricultural meteorological station. Secondly, there are spatial consistencies for characterizing winter wheat drought between proposed ECHI, DCHI and PWSI with popular CWSI, TVDI and VHI. In addition, our proposed ECHI, DCHI and PWSI have achieved good performance of drought monitoring both in irrigated and rainfed croplands. All these results suggest that our proposed indices have great potential in crop drought monitoring."

Tulbure;Patrick Meyfroidt,Taking it further: Leveraging pseudo-labels for field delineation across label-scarce smallholder regions,"•Pseudo labels for agricultural field delineation generated from pre-trained model. •Fine-tuning performance gains from pseudo labels approached gains of human labels. •Complementing human labels with pseudo labels further improved performance. •Pseudo labels support large-area field delineation in data-scarce settings. 
 Satellite-based field delineation has entered a quasi-operational stage due to recent advances in machine learning for computer vision. Transfer learning allows for the resource-efficient transfer of pre-trained field delineation models across heterogeneous geographies. However, the scarcity of labeled data for complex and dynamic smallholder landscapes remains a major bottleneck. The key innovation of this study is to overcome this challenge by using pre-trained models to generate sparse (i.e., not fully annotated) field delineation pseudo-labels for fine-tuning models across geographies and sensor characteristics. We build on a FracTAL ResUNet trained for crop field delineation in India (median field size of 0.24 ha) based on multi-spectral imagery at 1.5 m spatial resolution. We use this model to generate pseudo-labels for the use in Northern Mozambique (median field size of 0.06 ha) based on sub-meter resolution true-color satellite imagery. We designed multiple pseudo-label selection strategies based on field-level probability scores and compared the quantities, area properties, seasonal distribution, and spatial agreement of the pseudo-labels against human-annotated training labels (n = 1,512). We then used the human-annotated labels and the pseudo-labels for model fine-tuning and compared predictions against human field annotations (n = 2,199). We evaluated performance with regards to object-level spatial agreement and site-level field size estimation. Our results indicate i) a good baseline performance of the pre-trained model in both field delineation (mean intersection over union (mIoU) of 0.634) and field size estimation (mean root mean squared error (mRMSE) of 0.071 ha), and ii) the added value of regional fine-tuning with performance improvements in nearly all experiments (mIoU increases of up to 0.060, mRMSE decreases of up to 0.034 ha). Moreover, we found iii) substantial performance increases when using only pseudo-labels (up to 77 % of the mIoU increases and 68 % of the mRMSE decreases obtained by human-annotated labels), and iv) additional performance increases (mIoU+0.008, mRMSE: −0.003 ha) when complementing human annotations with pseudo-labels. Pseudo-labels are architecture-agnostic, can be efficiently generated at scale, and thus facilitate domain adaptation in label-scarce settings. The workflow presented here is a stepping stone for overcoming the persisting challenges in mapping heterogeneous smallholder agriculture."
