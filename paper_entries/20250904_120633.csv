As varying ENSO decay pace results in significantly different climate impacts, understanding the factors responsible for ENSO decay is vital for improving the prediction of ENSO evolution and its climate effects. Here we show the sea surface temperature variability peaking in boreal winter over the equatorial Atlantic, dubbed as winter Atlantic Niño/Niña, regulates ENSO decay pace via modulating trans-basin Walker circulation. Both observational analyses and pacemaker experiments demonstrates that El Niños concurrent with preceding winter Atlantic Niño would decay rapidly, while those with a winter Atlantic Niña tend to decay slowly. Analogously, La Niñas would undergo a prolonged attenuation following a winter Atlantic Niño but evanish rapidly following a winter Atlantic Niña. Our results highlight the winter Atlantic Niño/Niña as a crucial factor modulating ENSO decay pace, offering valuable insights for improving seasonal forecasts of ENSO evolution in decaying phase."

This includes New Zealand, where significant knowledge gaps exist around the future risks they pose. Here, we present the first comprehensive analysis of projected New Zealand heat extremes across various event durations (1, 5, 10, 15, and 30 days) using the latest suite of dynamically downscaled CMIP6 climate projections for New Zealand. We find that longer duration extreme events with a 1-in-10 year return period in Historical simulations, will begin to occur at least every other year across the majority of the country by the mid 21st-century under a SSP2-4.5 warming scenario, with shorter duration events emerging more slowly. Once model-specific warming rates are accounted for, we find a consistent pattern of accelerated warming for the hottest days of the year, with each degree of annual-mean warming over the wider New Zealand region resulting in approximately 1.6 ∘C of change in the hottest days of the year. Importantly, we find evidence of heat extremes intensifying much faster than mean warming across many regions of inland New Zealand, contradicting past claims of muted changes based on coarse resolution global climate models. Finally, we examine a model-based example of a physically plausible record-shattering heatwave capable of occurring in the present climate, with five-day temperature anomalies exceeding +10 ∘C over large parts of the North Island."

In this paper, we review recent advances in the application of machine learning to global soil carbon modelling as a data-mining tool and highlight its potential to drive an iterative feedback loop that improves the representation of soil carbon dynamics in Earth System Models."
10.5194/acp-25-9737-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文探讨了撒哈拉沙尘中赤铁矿含量与沙尘气溶胶光学性质之间的关系，使用了激光雷达数据和气溶胶模型模拟。研究地点位于佛得角。研究发现赤铁矿含量越高，粒子的后向散射系数会降低，并且这种降低在光谱上存在差异。研究重点关注了消光比、粒子退偏振比以及355和532纳米波长下的后向散射和消光相关的Ångström指数。这些发现有助于改进气候模型中对矿物沙尘的描述，特别是在其辐射效应方面，从而提高气候模型的准确性。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用激光雷达测量大气气溶胶的光学特性，并结合模型来分析大气成分（特别是沙尘中的赤铁矿）对辐射传输的影响。,"['mineral dust', 'hematite', 'lidar', 'optical properties', 'radiative effect', 'Saharan dust', 'aerosol modeling', 'atmospheric composition', 'backscattering', 'extinction', 'Ångström exponent']",Sofía Gómez Maqueo Anaya;Dietrich Althausen;Julian Hofer;Moritz Haarig;Ulla Wandinger;Bernd Heinold;Ina Tegen;Matthias Faust;Holger Baars;Albert Ansmann;Ronny Engelmann;Annett Skupin;Birgit Heese;Kerstin Schepanski,Investigating the link between mineral dust hematite content and intensive optical properties by means of lidar measurements and aerosol modeling,"This study investigates how hematite in Sahara dust affects how dust particles interact with radiation. Using lidar data from Cabo Verde (2021–2022) and hematite content from atmospheric model simulations, the results show that a higher hematite fraction leads to a decrease in the particle backscattering coefficients in a spectrally different way. These findings can improve the representation of mineral dust in climate models, particularly regarding their radiative effect. 
 This study investigates the relationship between lidar-measured intensive optical properties of Saharan dust and simulated hematite content, using data collected during the Joint Aeolus Tropical Atlantic Campaign (JATAC) in 2021 and 2022. Measurements were taken in Mindelo, São Vicente, Cabo Verde. The study aims to determine how changes in hematite content influence the intensive optical properties of dust particles, particularly in the ultraviolet–visible (UV–Vis) spectrum. Given the well-documented impact of hematite on the absorption properties of dust, especially in the UV–Vis range, our hypothesis is that these effects will be detectable in lidar measurements. Specifically, this study focuses on the lidar ratio, particle depolarization ratio, and backscatter- and extinction-related Ångström exponents at 355 and 532 nm wavelengths. By analyzing dust plume cases separately regarding their size differences, the strongest positive correlation was identified between the backscatter-related Ångström exponent and hematite fraction (R2=0.63). These findings contribute to improving the representation of dust in atmospheric models, which often overlook the variability in mineralogical composition in their dust descriptions, and refining calculations of its direct radiative effect."

Four types of tropical waves (equatorial Rossby – ER, Kelvin, MRG-TD1, and MRG-TD2 – mixed Rossby gravity–tropical depressions) are studied using filters, satellite measurements, and in situ data from the Clouds–Atmosphere Dynamics–Dust Interaction in West Africa (CADDIWA) campaign held in September 2021 in Cabo Verde. ER waves impact temperature and humidity above 2500 m, MRG-TD1 around 3500 m, and MRG-TD2 around 2000 m. Interactions between these waves favor tropical cyclone formation. 
 In summer, mixed Rossby gravity waves–tropical depressions (MRG-TD) are known to drive intraseasonal humidity variability in the northeastern Atlantic troposphere, modulated by equatorial Rossby (ER) and Kelvin waves. However, their impact on dust remains poorly understood, and methods in the literature struggle to distinguish the two MRG-TD tracks. During the Clouds–Atmosphere Dynamics–Dust Interaction in West Africa (CADDIWA) campaign in September 2021, in situ data (from dropsondes and radiosondes) and remote sensing data (Global Navigation Satellite System data and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer data) were used to investigate the three-dimensional impact of tropical waves on dust and thermodynamics over Cabo Verde. The distinct contributions of Kelvin waves, ER, and MRG-TD were isolated using frequency–wavenumber filtering of total column water vapor. The latter was efficiently split into southern- and northern-track African easterly waves using distinct frequency windows (MRG-TD1 and MRG-TD2) and enabled us to demonstrate their distinct horizontal structures and impacts. ER waves mainly impacted thermodynamics above 750 hPa, MRG-TD1 affected jet-level thermodynamics, and MRG-TD2 modulated moisture in the lower troposphere. MRG-TD2 was identified as the main driver of dust events over Cabo Verde in September 2021. Tropical cyclogenesis was linked to interactions among multiple tropical waves. Notably, a delay of up to 2 d was observed between Kelvin wave interactions with MRG-TD1 and cyclone formation, consistent with previous findings. These results highlight the critical role of tropical wave interactions in cyclogenesis and underscore their potential to improve forecasting."

Carslaw;Daniel P. Grosvenor;Hamish Gordon,"Weak influence of anthropogenic emissions on aerosol, cloud, and rain in the wet season of the Amazon rainforest","Anthropogenic emissions can influence aerosol particle number concentrations and cloud formation. Our model simulations predict around a 10 % increase in the particle and cloud droplet number concentrations when doubling the emissions in the Manaus region in the Amazonian wet season. However, the corresponding changes in cloud water and rain mass are around 4 %. Such a weak response implies that this convective environment is not sensitive to the localized anthropogenic emission changes here. 
 Anthropogenic emissions have been shown to affect new particle formation, aerosol concentrations, and clouds. Such effects vary with region, environmental conditions, and cloud types. In the wet season of Amazonia, anthropogenic emissions emitted from Manaus, Brazil, can significantly increase the cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations compared to the background of mainly natural aerosols. However, the regional response of cloud and rain to anthropogenic emissions in Amazonia remains very uncertain. Here, we aim to quantify how aerosol concentration, cloud, and rain respond to changes in anthropogenic emissions through parameterized new particle formation and primary aerosol emission in the Manaus region and to understand the underlying mechanisms. We ran the atmosphere-only configuration of the HadGEM3 climate model with a nested regional domain that covers most of the rainforest region (720 km by 1200 km with 3 km resolution) under scaled regional emissions. The 7 d simulations show that, in the areas that are affected by anthropogenic emissions, when aerosol and precursor gas emissions are doubled from the baseline emission inventories, aerosol number concentrations increase by 13 %. The nucleation rate that involves sulfuric acid and biogenic compounds generally increases with pollution levels. However, nucleation is suppressed very close to the pollution source, resulting in lower nucleation and soluble Aitken mode aerosol number concentrations. We also found that doubling the anthropogenic emission can increase the cloud droplet number concentrations (Nd) by 9 %, but cloud water and rain mass mixing ratios do not change significantly. Even very strong reductions in aerosol number concentrations by a factor of 4, which is an unrealistic condition, cause only a 4 % increase in rain over the domain. If we assume our simulation has a fine enough grid resolution and an accurate representation of the relevant atmospheric processes, the simulated weak and non-linear response of cloud and rain properties to linearly scaled anthropogenic emissions suggests that the interactions among aerosol, cloud, and precipitation in the Amazonian convective environment are buffered by microphysical processes. It also implies that the convective environment is resilient to the changes in Nd that occur in response to localized anthropogenic aerosol perturbations."

Bageston;Wei Yuan;Xiao Liu;Weijun Liu;Ying Wen;Hui Li;Zhengkuan Liu,Extreme concentric gravity waves observed in the mesosphere and thermosphere regions over southern Brazil associated with fast-moving severe thunderstorms,"This study explores intense concentric gravity waves (CGWs) based on ground-based and multi-satellite observations over southern Brazil, revealing significant airglow perturbations and strong momentum release. Triggered by deep convection and enabled by weaker wind fields, these CGWs reached the mesopause and thermosphere. Consistent detection via OI and OH airglow emissions confirms their vertical propagation, while asymmetric thermosphere propagation is linked to Doppler-induced wavelength changes. 
 Three groups of intense concentric gravity waves (CGWs) lasting over 10 h were observed by an airglow imager at the Southern Space Observatory (SSO) in São Martinho da Serra (29.44° S, 53.82° W) in southern Brazil on 17–18 September 2023. These CGW events were simultaneously captured by spaceborne instruments, including the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) aboard Aqua, the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) on board Suomi NPP, and the Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry (SABER) instrument operating on the Thermosphere-Ionosphere-Mesosphere Energetics and Dynamics (TIMED) satellite. The CGWs caused significant airglow radiation perturbations exceeding 24 %, and the distance of the wave centre movement exceeded 400 km. These CGW events were caused by fast-moving deep convection observed by the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-16 (GOES-16). The weaker background wind field during the spring season transition provides the necessary conditions for CGWs to propagate from the lower atmosphere to the mesopause region. The 630 nm emission images were significantly contaminated by specific OH emission bands. The same CGW event was observed propagating from the OH airglow layer (∼ 87 km) to the thermospheric OI 630.0 nm airglow layer (∼ 250 km). The asymmetric propagation of CGWs in the thermosphere may be due to the vertical wavelength changes caused by the Doppler-shifting effect of the background wind field. This multilayer ground-based and satellite joint detection of CGWs offers an excellent perspective for examining the coupling of various atmospheric layers."

Two examples are given to demonstrate the technique. In the first, water vapor profiling is extended closer to the surface while simultaneously maintaining sufficient far-range performance.  These results are verified with collocated measurements. In the second example, clouds are resolved at high vertical spatial resolution with a high signal-to-noise ratio. Details of the lidar instrument hardware and the method to combine the laser pulses of different durations are given."

We therefore measured soil physical and hydraulic properties (n = 1300) at seven field sites (Thames catchment, UK). The sites cover a range of geologies, land use, and management. Dataset applications include hydrological and land surface modelling and validation of remote sensing observations. The dataset also provides a baseline against which future soil changes may be compared. 
 Observational data on soil physical and hydraulic properties are important for improving our understanding of hydrological processes. This is particularly relevant given current interest in the potential of land-based “natural flood management” measures (and related concepts: “nature-based solutions” and “working with natural processes”) to reduce flood risk. Therefore, a detailed survey of seven field sites under different land uses and management practices in the Thames catchment, UK, was undertaken as part of the LANDWISE project. Measurements (n = 1300) included soil surface infiltration rate, saturated hydraulic conductivity, bulk density, estimated porosity, soil moisture, and soil moisture retention. Field sites comprised three arable fields on shallow soils over limestone, two arable fields on free-draining loamy soils over chalk, and permanent grassland and broadleaf woodland on slowly permeable soil over mudstone. Soil sampling points covered infield areas, trafficked areas (e.g. tramlines), and untrafficked margins. Samples were generally taken at five depths ranging from the soil surface to 100 cm below ground level. Soil saturated hydraulic conductivity measurements were made at 25 and 45 cm depths. Soil samples and measurements were taken between April and October 2021, with repeats taken pre- and post-harvest (arable sites). These data provide valuable insight into the hydrological behaviour of soils under contrasting management, including both conventional and innovative agricultural practices (e.g. herbal leys, mob grazing, and controlled traffic). Dataset applications include improving the performance of hydrological and land surface models and validation of remotely sensed soil observations.

In the paper, we present an expanded global dataset of sea levels, produced using a global ocean model driven by ERA5 reanalysis – a state-of-the-art dataset of historical weather and climate. The strengths and limitations of the dataset are discussed by comparing it to observed sea levels. The dataset covers a period of 1950–2024, improving our understanding of the global frequency of extreme water levels. 
 Extreme sea levels, generated by storm surges and high tides, can cause coastal flooding and erosion. Global datasets have been instrumental in mapping extreme sea levels and associated societal risks. Harnessing the backward extension of the ERA5 reanalysis, we present a dataset containing timeseries of tides and storm surges based on a global hydrodynamic model covering the period 1950–2024. This is an extension of a previously published dataset that covered a shorter period (1979–2018). Using this dataset, we estimate extreme sea levels globally. Validation shows good agreement between observed and modelled extreme sea levels, with the level of agreement for the extended dataset being very similar to that of the previously published dataset. The extended 75-year dataset allows for a more robust estimation of return periods, often resulting in smaller uncertainties than its 40-year precursor. This underscores the necessity for long timeseries and the strength of long-term modelling enabled by the ERA5 reanalysis extension. The present dataset can be used for assessing flood risk, climate variability and climate changes."

Here, we present curated timeseries of in situ soil moisture measurements from the Swiss Soil Moisture Experiment (SwissSMEX) network, which as of now cover 15 years. We demonstrate the potential of this comprehensive network for analysing the documented drying trends. At 12 grassland stations, SwissSMEX provides data on the volumetric soil water content at various depths in the soil profile, which can be used to calculate integrated soil water content down to 50 cm depth as an indicator of root zone water. We document recent measures that have been taken to secure the SwissSMEX network and to ensure the continuity of its long-term soil moisture timeseries. These timeseries are used to analyse trends in summer and summer half-year anomalies of integrated soil water content, and to investigate the robustness of the recent drying based on different sets of Swiss Plateau stations.

The model performance is evaluated for its ability to simulate processes related to El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The newly developed HCMROMS is expected to become an effective modeling tool for studying the multiscale and multisphere interactions associated with ENSO in the tropical Pacific. 
 El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) constitutes the most prominent interannual climate variation mode in the climate system that originates from ocean–atmosphere interactions in the tropical Pacific. Accurately modeling ENSO variation has consistently posed a great challenge, exhibiting strongly model-dependent representations and simulations of ENSO. This study presents a novel hybrid coupled model (HCM), denoted HCMROMS, built upon the Regional Ocean Modeling System (ROMS) that has been widely used for regional modeling studies. For basin-wide applications to the tropical Pacific, here, the ROMS is coupled with a statistical atmospheric model. The statistical atmospheric model is based on singular value decomposition (SVD), capturing interannual relationships of atmospheric perturbations such as wind stress and freshwater flux anomalies with sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies. The model is constructed in a flexible way so that various components representing atmospheric forcing and oceanic biogeochemistry can be easily included as a module in the HCMROMS. Results demonstrate that the HCMROMS can simulate a stable quasi-3-year ENSO cycle when the interannual wind stress coupling coefficient, ατ, is set to 1.5. The HCMROMS reproduces the three-dimensional (3D) evolution of ENSO-related anomalies, revealing that the most pronounced temperature anomalies occur beneath the surface at 150 m. The interannual temperature anomaly budget highlights the dominance of the advection process in simulated ENSO. Vertical mixing contributes negatively to ENSO anomalies, damping temperature anomalies from the surface due to the turbulent heat flux feedback. This newly developed HCMROMS is poised to serve as an efficient modeling tool for ENSO research in the future."

Our method combines techniques to simplify these maps and predict them quickly using statistical tools. This approach could help authorities respond faster and more accurately in emergencies, reducing risks to the population and the environment. 
 Uncertainty estimation is a key issue in nuclear crisis situations. Probabilistic methods for taking uncertainties into account in assessments are often costly in terms of the number of simulations and computation time. This is why emulation methods, which enable rapid estimation of numerical model outputs, represent a promising solution. However, in the context of radioactive dispersion modeling, existing emulators are mostly limited to scalar outputs. In a crisis context, decisions are often based on dose maps, which are mathematically represented by high-dimensional data. In this study, we use the auto-associative model method to reduce the dimension of dose results and then predict these reduced representations using kriging. We also compare this prediction method with others used by the French Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection Authority (ASNR) to predict the consequences of a nuclear accident."

While MPs’ fate and transport have been studied extensively, the adsorption of eDNA onto polymer surfaces and its persistence remain less understood. Here, we systematically studied eDNA adsorption onto poly(ethylene terephthalate) (PET), polyethylene (PE), and silica (Si) surfaces, where the latter material was used as a proxy for comparison to natural particles. Using quartz-crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D), the impact of varying ionic conditions that mimic freshwater and seawater environments was analyzed for adsorption rate and extent. The role of cations, particularly divalent ions such as Ca2+, in promoting eDNA adsorption through cation bridging was particularly important. PET exhibited the highest adsorption rates, followed by those of PE and Si. Adsorption of eDNA in seawater led to thicker and more rigid adlayers compared with freshwater conditions. However, eDNA adlayers were susceptible to enzymatic degradation and replacement by DNase in both freshwater and seawater, suggesting limited protection from decay. Consequently, the longevity and potential for transfer of material over time and distance are brought into question. This study provides insights into the adsorption mechanisms and stability of eDNA on MPs, advancing our understanding of how MPs influence the transport and persistence of genetic material, including antibiotic-resistant genes, in aquatic environments."

Many recently identified sources involve subjecting plastic materials to elevated temperatures; however, fundamental understanding of airborne emissions is limited. This study is the first systematic characterization of particle and volatile organic compound emissions from plastic smoldering combustion. Five common plastic types were studied, including low-density polyethylene (LDPE), polypropylene (PP), polystyrene (PS), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polyvinyl chloride (PVC). For all types of plastics, a dominant submicron mode of emitted particles is observed. The composition of NPPs and oxidation products is identified in aerosol mass spectra, where mass fractions of NPPs are estimated based on their distinctive fragment ions: hydrocarbon ions (LDPE and PP), aromatic ions (PS), phthalate ions (PET), and organochlorine and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons ions (PVC). Emission factors of submicron particles (0.5–769 g kg–1) and VOCs (46–393 g kg–1) are calculated. NPPs from open plastic combustion are estimated to exceed oceanic microplastic emissions and be comparable to microplastics from tire and brake wear.

However, the long-term impact of chronic dietary exposure to environmentally relevant IMI doses on kidney health has not been fully elucidated, particularly regarding its nephrotoxic mechanisms. To address this gap, chronic exposure to IMI was administered to mice through supplementation of their feed with environmentally relevant doses (approximately 100 and 1000 μg/kg/day) for 24 weeks to investigate its nephrotoxicity and underlying mechanisms. Toxicological analysis revealed that chronic IMI exposure led to renal dysfunction, histopathological alterations, and excessive apoptosis in mice. Mechanistic investigations suggested that IMI might inhibit AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity through both direct and indirect pathways. Direct inhibition occurred through the binding of IMI and its metabolites to AMPK, reducing its phosphorylation activity. Indirect inhibition involved excessive production of reactive oxygen species, which suppressed AMPK phosphorylation, leading to sustained purine metabolism dysregulation in the renal system. Consequently, the kidneys showed an aggravated redox imbalance, heightened inflammatory states, and increased cellular apoptosis. The results of this study are intended to raise awareness of pesticide use and food safety among agricultural workers and consumers."

Compared to the dark oxidation of Cr(OH)3 by O2, photoirradiation enhanced Cr(VI) production in both aqueous and frozen solutions. In the presence of natural organic matter (NOM), the photoproduction of Cr(VI) was significantly promoted in aqueous solution but hindered in frozen solution. Photosensitized NOM induced the production of H2O2 that played the dual roles of enhancing Cr(OH)3 oxidation in aqueous solution and accelerating Cr(VI) reduction in frozen solution. The in situ generated Cr(VI) in the Cr(OH)3/NOM/UV system was gradually accumulated during the repeated cycles of aqueous–frozen phase transitions and light–dark variations, which confirms that the stable Cr(OH)3 can be a source of natural Cr(VI) under realistic environmental conditions. The photooxidative dissolution of Cr(OH)3 is proposed to involve the complex formation between dissolved Cr(OH)4– and O2, which subsequently undergoes the photoinduced charge transfer, resulting in the oxidation of Cr(III) to Cr(VI) with the concurrent reduction of O2 to H2O2 via •O2–. A similar mechanistic behavior was also observed with FexCr1–x(OH)3 (x = 0.3, 0.5, and 0.7) for the photooxidative production of Cr(VI).

We developed a mouse model to assess the hepatotoxic effects and mechanisms of 8:2 polyfluoroalkyl phosphate diesters (8:2 diPAP). Exposure to 8:2 diPAP at doses of 0.5, 5, and 50 mg/kg resulted in hepatocyte damage and elevated serum levels of total bilirubin.

While previous studies assessed transition strategies in isolation, focused mainly on climate impacts, and neglected regional differences, our integrated model assesses transition strategies, globally and regionally, addressing the potential co-benefits and trade-offs across several key drivers of the triple planetary crisis. We note that other important impacts, such as microplastic leakage, remain to be quantified. Achieving a net-zero plastic industry by 2050 (1 Gt annual production) is technically feasible through lignocellulose residue-based feedstocks, recycling, and carbon capture. Meanwhile, this would require consuming all available global lignocellulose residues (2.3 Gt), early retirement of fossil infrastructure to avoid at least 0.35 Gt CO2-eq emissions, and ensuring grid decarbonization, presenting great challenges. Without internationally coordinated relocation of plastic production facilities or trade of biomass feedstocks or the derived intermediate chemicals, global net zero becomes unattainable. The global climate benefits through the transition come with trade-offs in higher land-use-related biodiversity loss and particulate matter-related health impacts, especially in regions with vulnerable ecosystems and dense populations, necessitating tailored regional solutions.

Understanding and quantifying the impacts of such MHWs on land heatwaves can enhance seasonal prediction skills for these extremes. Here we evaluate the impact of the 2023 MHW on the record‐breaking atmospheric heatwave in East Asia during the summer. Through a set of regional atmospheric model experiments, we demonstrate that the MHW significantly exacerbated the 2023 East Asian summer atmospheric heatwave, particularly as a compound hot‐humid extreme. The extremely warm ocean amplified both surface air temperature and humidity anomalies, on top of the contributions of background atmospheric circulation anomalies. The MHW influence on air temperature manifests through radiative effects of cloud and water vapor changes. Our results also indicate that the atmospheric heatwave amplifies despite the MHW acts to dampen the western North Pacific subtropical high against large‐scale background atmospheric conditions. By examining the effects of both temperature and humidity anomalies through wet‐bulb globe temperature, we find that the MHW explains ∼20%–50% of the aggravation and prolonged duration of hot‐humid conditions in East Asia, with notable impacts in Japan. Additionally, the recent trend of sea surface warming is shown to substantially amplify the MHW's impact on the heatwave.

SM gradients shape sensible heat flux gradients via evapotranspiration, while upstream pre‐storm rain‐producing clouds suppress surface available energy.

Rising air temperature has led to permafrost degradation, resulting in the melting of ground ice and the release of carbon to the atmosphere, creating a positive feedback loop. Extreme weather events, particularly extreme rainfall, have been increasing, yet the effects of extreme rainfall on permafrost remain unclear. Here, we use long‐term observational data to investigate the effects of extreme rainfall on the hydrothermal properties of the active layer at two sites in China's upper Heihe River Basin, EBoA and PT5. Two methods are applied: hierarchical linear regression and a relative variation ratio. The results for both sites indicate that when rainfall exceeds 10 mm, soil temperatures increase. This suggests warming effects of extreme rainfall on the active layer that maybe attributable to reduced heat loss from decreased actual evapotranspiration, as well as increased thermal conductivity and heat transfer due to elevated soil moisture during extreme rainfall events. Future studies investigating the effects of extreme rainfall via irrigation experiments and physical modeling could benefit our results as a reference for the design of controlled experiments."

Whicker‐Clarke,Sensitivity of Simulated Polar Climate to Improved Partitioning of Spectral Solar Irradiance Between Visible and Near‐Infrared Bands,"The solar radiative processes that contribute to Earth's surface and atmospheric energy budgets are strongly dependent on wavelength. For example, snow and water vapor become more absorptive as incident radiation shifts from visible (VIS) to near‐infrared (NIR) wavelengths. Some earth system models (ESMs) aggregate solar radiation into just two bands (VIS and NIR) partitioned at 0.7 μ ${\upmu }$m for transmission between the atmospheric and surface components. In the widely used radiative transfer model RRTMG_SW this partition is near the center of the overlap spectral band spanning 0.625–0.778 μ ${\upmu }$m, whose flux is often approximated as being evenly divided between the VIS and NIR surface bands. Using a hyperspectral radiative transfer model, we show that the fractional downwelling surface flux within the overlap band is usually distributed about 55.5%:44.5% VIS:NIR. This improved approximation shifts as much as 4.27 W m−2 from the NIR to the VIS band, leading to an instantaneous decrease in surface absorption of up to 0.91 W m−2 over snow‐covered surfaces. Century‐long fully coupled ESM simulations show surface absorption over snow decreases by over 1.6 W m−2. The coupled response in sea ice regions amplifies the initial forcing ten‐fold, and increases seasonal sea ice area by up to 4.9%. These results highlight the importance of accurately representing the spectral distribution of solar radiation in the cryosphere."

However, the seasonality of BVOC emissions, especially from tropical and subtropical plants, remains poorly understood. This study investigated the seasonal variation in BVOC emissions from Eucalyptus urophylla, a common subtropical species, through in situ measurements during dry and wet seasons. We observed a marked seasonality in emission factors (Es), with light‐dependent BVOCs exhibiting increased emissions from the dry to wet season, while light‐independent BVOCs showed a decline. Isoprene emissions followed temperature‐driven patterns, with substantial increases in the wet season, while the seasonal dynamics of monoterpenes (MTs), particularly β‐ocimenes, exceeded model predictions, indicating more complex emission behaviors. Growth temperature was identified as the primary driver of these seasonal variations, with temperature sensitivity differing between light‐dependent and light‐independent compounds. Our results also suggest that the tropical/subtropical plants may emit more light‐dependent, highly reactive BVOCs in the hot wet season to protect plant leaves from damage by heat‐induced reactive oxygen species. Our study implies that BVOC emissions from subtropical vegetation are highly responsive to seasonal temperature changes, with significant implications for atmospheric reactivity and biosphere‐atmosphere interactions, highlighting the need for improvements in current emission models to better account for the complex seasonality of BVOCs, particularly MTs, in tropical and subtropical ecosystems."

In view of this, an all‐surface assimilation framework based on dynamic emissivity retrieval is established for radiance data over four main complex underlying surfaces (snow‐free land, snow, sea ice, and coast) from all microwave lower‐atmosphere‐sounding channels (at 50–60 GHz, 118 GHz, and 183 GHz) on all operational microwave instruments in CMA‐GFS, on the basis of summarizing previous research. A new emissivity correction scheme is proposed and the regression coefficients are determined for the assimilation of humidity‐sounding channels on ATMS over sea ice. Quality control procedures are designed for each instrument over each surface type. The performances of these modules are evaluated according to first‐guess departures, and the results are given for channel selection over each surface type. Five series of batch experiments, which add the observations over one surface type on top of the former experiment one by one, are carried out. Results indicate that all‐surface assimilation has significant positive impacts on the analysis of all variables across the entire atmospheric layer globally, and the 1–6 days forecasting in the Northern Hemisphere, 6–8 days forecasting in the Southern Hemisphere, and short‐to‐medium‐term forecasting in the tropics are all well improved.

Relatively limited research has examined AR characteristics further inland, particularly for Colorado (CO), where high and complex topography, as well as the distance from the coast, complicate attempts to track ARs, AR‐derived moisture, and AR‐related impacts. Previous research efforts attributing precipitation to ARs based on their spatial footprint have yielded less than 30% of cool‐season precipitation in CO as related to ARs. However, a large volume of anecdotal evidence suggests that ARs play a larger role in CO precipitation, but this requires quantitative investigation. We used trajectory‐based methods to explore the role of landfalling ARs, their moisture pathways, and their contribution to top‐decile precipitation in sub‐basins throughout CO. Moisture sourced from landfalling ARs affects this area more frequently, penetrating inland along relatively low‐elevation corridors through the Interior West, and exhibit substantial geographic and interannual variability. The backward trajectory approach for attributing precipitation to landfalling ARs yields mostly higher AR contributions to top‐decile cool‐season precipitation (21%–78%), primarily affecting western CO. Most of the AR‐related precipitation across western CO during the cool season is sourced from landfalling ARs near Southern California, the Baja peninsula, and the Pacific Northwest. These results indicate a larger role for ARs in CO weather and hydroclimate than previous research suggests."

This is the first time OMI LNOx column amounts have been evaluated using in situ data from aircraft profiles. For each case study, aircraft transects of the storm anvils were completed near the time of the OMI satellite overpass, allowing for direct comparison of satellite‐retrieved and aircraft‐sampled LNOx columns from the cloud top to the OMI optical centroid pressure. These comparisons were used to assess uncertainties in the satellite‐based columns. Differences between the aircraft and mean OMI LNOx column amounts varied with location and flash density. The DC3 and TC4 cases resulted in OMI column amounts 38%–56% less than the aircraft, while for the AMMA case, the OMI column was 20%–30% larger than the aircraft column. These differences are consistent but slightly larger than the 36% uncertainty estimated for the satellite retrieval method. Additionally, mean LNOx production efficiency (PE) was determined with values ranging from 52 to 691 mol/flash. These findings lend support for on‐going LNOx PE estimates using OMI, TROPOMI, TEMPO, GEMS, and Sentinel‐4 data and show the need for additional aircraft profiles to further reduce uncertainties."

Two SSACCs persist beyond June. One is traceable until mid‐August over Canada. The other SSACC was discernible until 5 October after having completed three global circumnavigations. The internal SSACC circulation aspect is gleaned from geostationary‐based visible image animations and confirmed in situ via a novel application of high‐resolution radiosonde wind direction and balloon position data. We also examine diabatic lofting of both SSACCs in relation to their individual geographic and constituent morphologies. Thermal infrared observations show that SSACC aerosols produce brightness temperature depressions of ∼ ${\sim} $2.6 K, opening a new line of investigation into the source of heating that contributes to diabatic rise."

The Northern Annular Mode (NAM) index and the Southern Annular Mode (SAM) index are derived from the model output to represent the strengths of the polar vortices in the Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH), respectively. During weak polar vortex events in the NH, there is an increase in zonal‐mean zonal winds in the MLT at the NH high latitudes and a warming of the lower thermosphere, accompanied by a cooling of the mesosphere. Conversely, the wind and temperature anomalies are reversed during strong NH polar vortex events. During weak polar vortex events in the SH, similar but generally weaker anomalies are observed in the corresponding hemisphere. This study also elucidates the response of the solar‐migrating semidiurnal tide (SW2) to variations in the strength of the polar vortices. A weak NH polar vortex is associated with an increase in SW2, while a strong NH vortex results in a decrease in SW2. The response of SW2 to changes in the SH polar vortex is similar, although considerably weaker. The NH polar vortex variability can explain around 40−50% $40-50\%$ of the variability in the SW2 during NH winter. The SH polar vortex, however, accounts for only a small fraction of the variability (up to ∼5% ${\sim} 5\%$) in SW2."

PAs established primarily for biodiversity conservation also contribute to increasing carbon storage in terrestrial ecosystems. However, there is a lack of quantitative studies on the role of China's existing PAs in carbon storage. We proposed an integrated approach to estimating the carbon density of terrestrial ecosystems in China, based on a modified Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Trade‐offs model. Through a statistical matching method, we evaluated the conservation effectiveness of PAs in carbon storage during 2020–2050. Under the moderate emission scenario (SSP2‐RCP4.5), the average carbon density of PAs is projected to 168.3 Mg C ha−1, an increase of 14.2% compared to 2020. In contrast, under the low emission scenario (SSP1‐RCP2.6) and high emission scenario (SSP5‐RCP8.5), the average carbon density of PAs is projected to decrease by 4.8% and 4.6%, respectively. By 2050, approximately 45%–47% of PAs are expected to experience effective conservation in carbon storage, with about 80% of PAs maintaining their current effectiveness during 2020–2050. Additionally, in view of area proportion, 34.3%–36.2% of PAs will remain effective, while 1.8%–4.0% are projected to transition from ineffective to effective. PAs with conservation effectiveness in carbon storage were predominantly located in humid and mid‐to‐high‐altitude regions. Given the spatial mismatch among existing PAs, priority areas for carbon storage conservation, and effective areas for carbon storage conservation, our findings underscore the necessity of expanding China's PAs to achieve the additional benefits of PAs in carbon storage conservation."

Although previous studies have widely investigated the historical changes of CHEPs, when these changes emerge from the internal climate variability remains unclear. In this study, we aim to understand the time of emergence (ToE) of CHEPs by utilizing multiple advanced Single Model Initial‐condition Large Ensembles (SMILEs) in China. First, we investigate the spatiotemporal changes of CHEP characteristics over a 200‐year period. Second, we detect ToE of CHEPs by adopting a signal‐to‐noise ratio framework. Third, we evaluate the added value of using SMILEs in the ToE analysis. We find that most areas have experienced increases in CHEP characteristic values in the historical period, which are projected to be more remarkable in the future under multiple projection scenarios. The agreement on the spatial distribution among SMILEs implies that anthropogenic forcings have already caused CHEP frequency to emerge from the internal climate variability over more than 84% of grid cells at least by 2020. In addition, earlier emergence can be found in CHEP hotspots. The temporal uncertainty largely derives from the model uncertainty in simulating signal‐to‐noise ratios for individual events rather than differences in ensemble sizes among SMILEs. Furthermore, ToE can be better constrained based on SMILEs compared to the climate models with fewer members, confirming the added value of using SMILEs.

However, the geographical distribution of Hg in urban forests remains poorly quantified at multiple spatial scales. Based on field investigations of urban forest parks in China, we explored the urban‐rural gradients and latitudinal trends of tree leaf and topsoil (0–10 cm) Hg concentrations. Our results indicate an urban hotspot of leaf and topsoil Hg concentrations across urban‐rural transects and show an increase in leaf and topsoil Hg concentrations from higher latitudes toward lower latitudes. The urban‐rural gradient and latitudinal trend of leaf Hg concentration are both significantly explained by road density, annual precipitation, and plant life forms. Leaf Hg concentration increases significantly with higher road density and is significantly higher in deciduous trees than in evergreen trees. Leaf Hg concentration decreases with higher annual precipitation across the urban‐rural transects but increases with it across latitudes. The urban‐rural gradient of topsoil Hg concentration is significantly associated with the spatial variation in traffic sources, while the latitudinal change in topsoil Hg concentration is largely explained by background soil Hg concentration. Our findings demonstrate distinctive patterns of urban forest Hg from local to regional scales and the occurrence of urban Hg hotspot implies a significant imprint on accelerated Hg cycling in urban areas."

Here, we examine the changes in hydrologic fluxes due to a shift toward aridity and the extent to which water storage in major reservoirs has offset these changes using a novel, high‐resolution (4 km) configuration of a state‐of‐the‐science land model, the Community Land Model. We leverage an emulation‐based parameter optimization approach to improve model hydrologic performance and reservoir parametrizations (generic and data‐driven) to simulate water storage and release. The hydrologic performance is notably improved across 121 basins in the Southwest, which translates into improved simulation of inflow, storage, and release across 133 reservoirs. The data‐driven approach outperforms the generic one, in simulating reservoir storage but not releases due to biases in inflows. Model simulations show a widespread increase in evapotranspiration (especially its soil evaporation component), driven primarily by increased absorption of solar radiation due to snowpack loss, which suppresses runoff. Increases in snowmelt mitigate runoff deficits during spring, which highlights the sensitivity of runoff response to the seasonal distribution of hydroclimatic supply and demand in the Southwest. Up to 40% of inflow deficits are met by surface water storage in large reservoirs (i.e., Mead and Powell).

Past work has shown how hydrological non‐stationarity may alter water discharges and hence Sy, but less attention has been given to the impact of likely future changes in upland sediment‐detachment rates on downstream Sy. In certain environments, climatically driven changes in vegetation cover on upland hillslopes may more than counteract the effects of changing runoff on Sy. Changes in precipitation, temperature, and vegetation may, therefore, interact in nonlinear ways to produce unexpected changes. In this work, we simulated future changes to background Sy (i.e., changes unrelated to land‐use changes and dams) with climatological and vegetative data output from an ensemble of CMIP6 Earth System Model (ESM) simulations. Depending on the future scenario, the cumulative annual sediment flux of 780 globally distributed rivers increases by between 2.3% and 8.4%. Significant deviations from historical Sy are projected at high latitudes in response to each forcing variable, while low‐latitude responses are regionally varied. In regions where ensemble members agree on future changes in forcing variables, large Sy changes are forecast with high confidence (e.g., >200% Sy increase for several northeastern U.S. rivers at the 95% level). In contrast, ensemble variability in vegetation projections results in considerable uncertainty in the projected Sy of rivers in other regions. Further improvements to the vegetation components of ESMs will help to reduce regional uncertainties in projected changes to Sy."

The challenge of feeding a growing population without increasing cultivated land can be addressed partly by expanding irrigation to currently rain‐fed croplands. At the same time, water‐scarce regions with currently unsustainable irrigation practices may experience a reduction in irrigated area. While the evaporative cooling effect of irrigation on regional climate has been extensively studied, it is still unclear how different irrigation expansion (or contraction) scenarios would affect global and regional near‐surface climatic conditions. Here we evaluate the hydro‐climatic impacts of several irrigation expansion scenarios. To assess changes in evapotranspiration (ET) $(ET)$ and land surface temperature (LST) $(LST)$ under various irrigation scenarios, we incorporated and validated an irrigation model representing four main irrigation methods: sprinkler, drip, furrow, and flood‐paddy, into the NASA Catchment land surface model. Globally, the increase in ET $ET$ from irrigation and the associated impact on average yearly LST $LST$ are negligible, with an average global cooling of −0.03°C ${-}0.03{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in the case of current irrigation (with respect to a baseline without irrigation). Compared to the current irrigation scenario, the maximum irrigation expansion scenario can lead to an additional LST $LST$ cooling of −0.01°C ${-}0.01{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$, while the net irrigation contraction in a sustainable irrigation scenario is associated with a 0.02°C $0.02{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ warming. While global and regional impacts of irrigation on LST $LST$ are relatively modest, locally, the cooling effect can be substantial, with a maximum yearly average LST $LST$ cooling as strong as −5°C ${-}5{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ and monthly cooling peaks of up to −10.2°C ${-}10.2{}^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$ in heavily irrigated periods."

 Steel truss bridges are constructed by connecting many different types of bars (components) to form a load-bearing structural system. Several disastrous collapses of this type of bridge have occurred as a result of initial component failure(s) propagating to the rest of the structure1–3. Despite the prevalence and importance of these structures, it is still unclear why initial component failures propagate disproportionately in some bridges but barely affect functionality in others4–7. Here we uncover and characterize the fundamental secondary resistance mechanisms that allow steel truss bridges to withstand the initial failure of any main component. These mechanisms differ substantially from the primary resistance mechanisms considered during the design of (undamaged) bridges. After testing a scaled-down specimen of a real bridge and using validated numerical models to simulate the failure of all main bridge components, we show how secondary resistance mechanisms interact to redistribute the loads supported by failed components to other parts of the structure. By studying the evolution of these mechanisms under increasing loads up to global failure, we are able to describe the conditions that enable their effective development. These findings can be used to enhance present bridge design and maintenance strategies, ultimately leading to safer transport networks.

 Nuclease–helicase DNA2 is a multifunctional genome caretaker that is essential for cell proliferation in a range of organisms, from yeast to human1–4. Bi-allelic DNA2 mutations that reduce DNA2 concentrations cause a spectrum of primordial dwarfism disorders, including Seckel and Rothmund–Thomson-related syndromes5–7. By contrast, cancer cells frequently express high concentrations of DNA2 (refs. 8–11). The mechanism that precludes cell proliferation in the absence of DNA2 and the molecular aetiology of DNA2-linked diseases remain elusive. Here we used yeast and human cells to demonstrate that DNA2 suppresses homologous recombination-restarted replication and checkpoint activation at stalled DNA replication forks. Loss of this control mechanism upon degradation of DNA2 in human cells causes recombination-dependent DNA synthesis and build-up of RPA-bound single-stranded DNA in the G2 phase of the cell cycle. Consequently, DNA2 deprivation triggers the DNA damage checkpoint and invariably leads to ATR–p21-dependent cell-cycle exit before mitosis. These findings explain why DNA2 is essential for cell proliferation and reveal that replication fork processing to restrict recombination is indispensable for avoiding cellular senescence. Stochastic entry into senescence stifles the proliferative potential of cells following the expression of a Seckel syndrome patient-derived DNA2 hypomorph or partial degradation of DNA2, providing a conceptual framework to explain global growth failure in DNA2-linked primordial dwarfism disorders.

 Geologically storing carbon is a key strategy for abating emissions from fossil fuels and durably removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere1,2. However, the storage potential is not unlimited3,4. Here we establish a prudent planetary limit of around 1,460 (1,290–2,710) Gt of CO2 storage through a risk-based, spatially explicit analysis of carbon storage in sedimentary basins. We show that only stringent near-term gross emissions reductions can lower the risk of breaching this limit before the year 2200. Fully using geologic storage for carbon removal caps the possible global temperature reduction to 0.7 °C (0.35–1.2 °C, including storage estimate and climate response uncertainty). The countries most robust to our risk assessment are current large-scale extractors of fossil resources. Treating carbon storage as a limited intergenerational resource has deep implications for national mitigation strategies and policy and requires making explicit decisions on priorities for storage use.

 A key challenge in neuroscience is understanding how neurons in hundreds of interconnected brain regions integrate sensory inputs with previous expectations to initiate movements and make decisions1. It is difficult to meet this challenge if different laboratories apply different analyses to different recordings in different regions during different behaviours. Here we report a comprehensive set of recordings from 621,733 neurons recorded with 699 Neuropixels probes across 139 mice in 12 laboratories. The data were obtained from mice performing a decision-making task with sensory, motor and cognitive components. The probes covered 279 brain areas in the left forebrain and midbrain and the right hindbrain and cerebellum. We provide an initial appraisal of this brain-wide map and assess how neural activity encodes key task variables. Representations of visual stimuli transiently appeared in classical visual areas after stimulus onset and then spread to ramp-like activity in a collection of midbrain and hindbrain regions that also encoded choices. Neural responses correlated with impending motor action almost everywhere in the brain. Responses to reward delivery and consumption were also widespread. This publicly available dataset represents a resource for understanding how computations distributed across and within brain areas drive behaviour.

 Metazoan development proceeds through a series of morphogenetic events that sculpt body plans and organ structures1,2. In the early embryo, these processes occur concurrently such that forces generated in neighbouring tissues can impose mechanical stresses on each other3–5, potentially disrupting development and consequently decreasing fitness. How organisms evolved mechanisms to mitigate inter-tissue mechanical conflicts remains unclear. Here, we combined phylogenetic survey, quantitative live imaging and functional mechanical perturbation to investigate mechanical stress management during gastrulation across the insect order of flies (Diptera). We identify two distinct cellular mechanisms that prevent tissue collision between the expanding head and trunk. In Cyclorrhapha, a monophyletic subgroup including Drosophila melanogaster, active out-of-plane deformation of a transient epithelial fold, called the cephalic furrow, acts as a mechanical sink to pre-empt head–trunk collision. Genetic and optogenetic ablation of the cephalic furrow leads to accumulation of compressive stress, tissue buckling at the head–trunk boundary and late-stage embryonic defects in the head and nervous system. By contrast, the non-cyclorrhaphan Chironomus riparius lacks cephalic furrow formation and instead undergoes widespread out-of-plane division that reduces the duration and spatial extent of head expansion. Re-orienting head mitosis from in-plane to out-of-plane in Drosophila partially suppresses tissue buckling, showing that it can function as an alternative mechanical sink. Our data suggest that mechanisms of mechanical stress management emerge and diverge in response to inter-tissue conflicts during early embryonic development. Flies have evolved two distinct strategies for managing mechanical stresses during embryogenesis: out-of-plane cell division in midges and transient out-of-plane tissue folding in fruit flies."

 Artificial intelligence (AI) and combinatorial optimization drive applications across science and industry, but their increasing energy demands challenge the sustainability of digital computing. Most unconventional computing systems1–7 target either AI or optimization workloads and rely on frequent, energy-intensive digital conversions, limiting efficiency. These systems also face application-hardware mismatches, whether handling memory-bottlenecked neural models, mapping real-world optimization problems or contending with inherent analog noise. Here we introduce an analog optical computer (AOC) that combines analog electronics and three-dimensional optics to accelerate AI inference and combinatorial optimization in a single platform. This dual-domain capability is enabled by a rapid fixed-point search, which avoids digital conversions and enhances noise robustness. With this fixed-point abstraction, the AOC implements emerging compute-bound neural models with recursive reasoning potential and realizes an advanced gradient-descent approach for expressive optimization. We demonstrate the benefits of co-designing the hardware and abstraction, echoing the co-evolution of digital accelerators and deep learning models, through four case studies: image classification, nonlinear regression, medical image reconstruction and financial transaction settlement. Built with scalable, consumer-grade technologies, the AOC paves a promising path for faster and sustainable computing. Its native support for iterative, compute-intensive models offers a scalable analog platform for fostering future innovation in AI and optimization.

 Over time, cells in the brain and in the body accumulate damage, which contributes to the ageing process1. In the human brain, the prefrontal cortex undergoes age-related changes that can affect cognitive functioning later in life2. Here, using single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq), single-cell whole-genome sequencing (scWGS) and spatial transcriptomics, we identify gene-expression and genomic changes in the human prefrontal cortex across lifespan, from infancy to centenarian. snRNA-seq identified infant-specific cell clusters enriched for the expression of neurodevelopmental genes, as well as an age-associated common downregulation of cell-essential homeostatic genes that function in ribosomes, transport and metabolism across cell types. Conversely, the expression of neuron-specific genes generally remains stable throughout life. These findings were validated with spatial transcriptomics. scWGS identified two age-associated mutational signatures that correlate with gene transcription and gene repression, respectively, and revealed gene length- and expression-level-dependent rates of somatic mutation in neurons that correlate with the transcriptomic landscape of the aged human brain. Our results provide insight into crucial aspects of human brain development and ageing, and shed light on transcriptomic and genomic dynamics.

 Internal motive states, such as sexual arousal, drive behaviour in response to social cues. However, little is known about how internal states and external cues are integrated to release appropriate behaviours at the correct moment during a social interaction, such as the transition from the appetitive to the consummatory phases of mating1,2. Here we identify a neural circuit in male mice that gates the onset of consummatory reproductive behaviours on contact with a mating partner. Stimulating MPOAEsr1∩Vgat hypothalamic neurons promotes mounting of conspecifics and three-dimensional dummy objects3. We find that such mounting depends on mechanosensory but not visual cues. Through a large-scale electrophysiological screen, we identify neurons in the subparafascicular thalamic nucleus that nonlinearly integrate medial preoptic area of the hypothalamus (MPOA) and mechanosensory input to encode contact with a potential mate. Circuit tracing and perturbations demonstrated that this conjunctive coding occurs by means of convergent disinhibition from MPOA and excitation from the spinal trigeminal nucleus. Functional manipulations and calcium recordings showed these social-contact neurons, marked by parathyroid hormone 2, were essential for and able to promote mounting. These data indicate that subparafascicular thalamic nucleus-parathyroid hormone 2 neurons integrate internal drive with social touch to trigger mounting at opportune moments during mating. More generally, our findings uncover a brain mechanism whereby an internal state can attribute a social quality to a generic touch to initiate purposeful reproductive actions.

 The spatial resolution of omics analyses is fundamental to understanding tissue biology1–3. The capacity to spatially profile DNA methylation, which is a canonical epigenetic mark extensively implicated in transcriptional regulation4,5, is lacking. Here we introduce a method for whole-genome spatial co-profiling of DNA methylation and the transcriptome of the same tissue section at near single-cell resolution. Applying this technology to mouse embryogenesis and the postnatal mouse brain resulted in rich DNA–RNA bimodal tissue maps. These maps revealed the spatial context of known methylation biology and its interplay with gene expression. The concordance and distinction in spatial patterns of the two modalities highlighted a synergistic molecular definition of cell identity in spatial programming of mammalian development and brain function. By integrating spatial maps of mouse embryos at two different developmental stages, we reconstructed the dynamics that underlie mammalian embryogenesis for both the epigenome and transcriptome, revealing details of sequence-, cell-type- and region-specific methylation-mediated transcriptional regulation. This method extends the scope of spatial omics to include DNA cytosine methylation, enabling a more comprehensive understanding of tissue biology across development and disease.

Here we show that an evolutionary novelty of fly embryos—the patterned embryonic invagination known as the cephalic furrow5–7—has a mechanical role during Drosophila gastrulation. By integrating in vivo experiments and in silico simulations, we demonstrate that the head–trunk boundary of the embryo is under increased compressive stress due to the concurrent formation of mitotic domains and germ band extension and that the cephalic furrow counteracts these stresses, preventing mechanical instabilities during gastrulation. Then, by comparing the genetic patterning of species with and without the cephalic furrow, we find evidence that changes in the expression of the transcription factor buttonhead are associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow. These results suggest that the cephalic furrow may have evolved through the genetic stabilization of morphogenesis in response to the mechanical challenges of dipteran gastrulation. Together, our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development. In Drosophila, the cephalic furrow counteracts mechanical stress as the developing head and the trunk tissues meet, providing evidence for how mechanical forces influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development."

 The neural representations of prior information about the state of the world are poorly understood1. Here, to investigate them, we examined brain-wide Neuropixels recordings and widefield calcium imaging collected by the International Brain Laboratory. Mice were trained to indicate the location of a visual grating stimulus, which appeared on the left or right with a prior probability alternating between 0.2 and 0.8 in blocks of variable length. We found that mice estimate this prior probability and thereby improve their decision accuracy. Furthermore, we report that this subjective prior is encoded in at least 20% to 30% of brain regions that, notably, span all levels of processing, from early sensory areas (the lateral geniculate nucleus and primary visual cortex) to motor regions (secondary and primary motor cortex and gigantocellular reticular nucleus) and high-level cortical regions (the dorsal anterior cingulate area and ventrolateral orbitofrontal cortex). This widespread representation of the prior is consistent with a neural model of Bayesian inference involving loops between areas, as opposed to a model in which the prior is incorporated only in decision-making areas. This study offers a brain-wide perspective on prior encoding at cellular resolution, underscoring the importance of using large-scale recordings on a single standardized task. Brain-wide recordings in mice reveal that prior expectations are distributed through recurrent loops across all levels of cortical and subcortical processing."

 The nine human herpesviruses, including herpes simplex virus 1 and 2, human cytomegalovirus and Epstein–Barr virus, present a significant burden to global public health1. Their envelopes contain at least ten different glycoproteins, which are necessary for host cell tropism, attachment and entry2. The best conserved among them, glycoprotein B (gB), is essential as it performs membrane fusion by undergoing extensive rearrangements from a prefusion to postfusion conformation. At present, there are no antiviral drugs targeting gB or neutralizing antibodies directed against its prefusion form, because of the difficulty in structurally determining and using this metastable conformation. Here we show the isolation of prefusion-specific nanobodies, one of which exhibits strong neutralizing and cross-species activity. By mutational stabilization we solved the herpes simplex virus 1 gB full-length prefusion structure, which allowed the bound epitope to be determined. Our analyses show the membrane-embedded regions of gB and previously unresolved structural features3,4, including a new fusion loop arrangement, providing insights into the initial conformational changes required for membrane fusion. Binding an epitope spanning three domains, proximal only in the prefusion state, the nanobody keeps wild-type HSV-2 gB in this conformation and enabled its native prefusion structure to be determined. This also indicates the mode of neutralization and an attractive avenue for antiviral interventions.

 Physical neural networks (PNNs) are a class of neural-like networks that make use of analogue physical systems to perform computations. Although at present confined to small-scale laboratory demonstrations, PNNs could one day transform how artificial intelligence (AI) calculations are performed. Could we train AI models many orders of magnitude larger than present ones? Could we perform model inference locally and privately on edge devices? Research over the past few years has shown that the answer to these questions is probably “yes, with enough research”. Because PNNs can make use of analogue physical computations more directly, flexibly and opportunistically than traditional computing hardware, they could change what is possible and practical for AI systems. To do this, however, will require notable progress, rethinking both how AI models work and how they are trained—primarily by considering the problems through the constraints of the underlying hardware physics. To train PNNs, backpropagation-based and backpropagation-free approaches are now being explored. These methods have various trade-offs and, so far, no method has been shown to scale to large models with the same performance as the backpropagation algorithm widely used in deep learning today. However, this challenge has been rapidly changing and a diverse ecosystem of training techniques provides clues for how PNNs may one day be used to create both more efficient and larger-scale realizations of present-scale AI models.

 Trapped-ion applications, such as in quantum information processing1, precision measurements2–5, optical clocks6 and mass spectrometry7, rely on specialized high-performance ion traps. The last three of these applications typically use traditional machining to customize macroscopic 3D Paul traps8, whereas quantum information processing experiments usually rely on photolithographic techniques to miniaturize the traps and meet scalability requirements9,10. Using photolithography, however, it is challenging to fabricate the complex 3D electrode structures required for optimal confinement. Here we demonstrate a high-resolution 3D printing technology based on two-photon polymerization (2PP)11 that is capable of fabricating large arrays of high-performance miniaturized 3D traps. We show that 3D-printed ion traps combine the advantages, such as strong radial confinement, of traditionally machined 3D traps with on-chip miniaturization. We trap calcium ions in 3D-printed ion traps with radial trap frequencies ranging from 2 MHz to 24 MHz. The tight confinement eases ion cooling requirements and allows us to implement high-quality Rabi oscillations with Doppler cooling only. Also, we demonstrate a two-qubit gate with a Bell-state fidelity of 0.978 ± 0.012.

 Learning enables biological organisms to begin life simple yet develop immensely diverse and complex behaviours. Understanding learning principles in engineered molecular systems could enable us to endow non-living physical systems with similar capabilities. Inspired by how the brain processes information, the principles of neural computation have been developed over the past 80 years1, forming the foundation of modern machine learning. More than four decades ago, connections between neural computation and physical systems were established2. More recently, synthetic molecular systems, including nucleic acid and protein circuits, have been investigated for their abilities to implement neural computation3–7. However, in these systems, learning of molecular parameters such as concentrations and reaction rates was performed in silico to generate desired input–output functions. Here we show that DNA molecules can be programmed to autonomously carry out supervised learning in vitro, with the system learning to perform pattern classification from molecular examples of inputs and desired responses. We demonstrate a DNA neural network trained to classify three different sets of 100-bit patterns, integrating training data directly into memories of molecular concentrations and using these memories to process subsequent test data. Our work suggests that molecular circuits can learn tasks more complex than simple adaptive behaviours.

 Enteric pathogens engage in complex interactions with the host and the resident microbiota to establish gut colonization1–3. Although mechanistic interactions between enteric pathogens and bacterial commensals have been extensively studied, whether and how commensal fungi affect enteric infections remain largely unknown1. Here we show that colonization with the common human gut commensal fungus Candida albicans worsened infections with the enteric pathogen Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium. The presence of C. albicans in the mouse gut increased Salmonella caecal colonization and systemic dissemination. We investigated the underlying mechanism and found that Salmonella binds to C. albicans via type 1 fimbriae and uses its type 3 secretion system to deliver effector proteins into C. albicans. A specific effector, SopB, was sufficient to manipulate C. albicans metabolism and trigger the release of millimolar amounts of arginine into the extracellular environment. The released arginine, in turn, induced expression of the type 3 secretion system in Salmonella, increasing its invasion of epithelial cells. C. albicans deficient in arginine production was unable to increase Salmonella virulence. Arginine-producing C. albicans also dampened the inflammatory response during Salmonella infection. Arginine supplementation in the absence of C. albicans increased the systemic spread of Salmonella and decreased the inflammatory response, phenocopying the presence of C. albicans. In summary, we identified C. albicans colonization as a susceptibility factor for disseminated Salmonella infection and arginine as a central metabolite in the cross-kingdom interaction between fungi, bacteria and host.

 Despite genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) having identified many genetic risk loci1–3, the underlying disease mechanisms remain largely unclear. Determining causal disease variants and their LOAD-relevant cellular phenotypes has been a challenge. Here, using our approach for identifying functional GWAS risk variants showing allele-specific open chromatin, we systematically identified putative causal LOAD-risk variants in human induced pluripotent stem (iPS)-cell-derived neurons, astrocytes and microglia, and linked a PICALM LOAD-risk allele to a microglial-specific role of PICALM in lipid droplet (LD) accumulation. Allele-specific open-chromatin mapping revealed functional risk variants for 26 LOAD-risk loci, mostly specific to microglia. At the microglial-specific PICALM locus, the LOAD-risk allele of the single-nucleotide polymorphism rs10792832 reduced transcription factor (PU.1) binding and PICALM expression, impairing the uptake of amyloid beta (Aβ) and myelin debris. Notably, microglia carrying the PICALM risk allele showed transcriptional enrichment of pathways for cholesterol synthesis and LD formation. Genetic and pharmacological perturbations of microglia further established a causal link between reduced PICALM expression, LD accumulation and phagocytosis deficits. Our work elucidates the selective LOAD vulnerability in microglia at the PICALM locus through detrimental LD accumulation, providing a neurobiological basis that can be exploited for developing clinical interventions.

 Sustainable development is an imperative worldwide1–3 but metrics and data on poverty and quality of life have remained too coarse and abstract to characterize challenges adequately and guide practical progress4,5. Nowhere is this challenge greater than in Africa4–6, where we still know little about the spatial details of development3,7–9. Here we leverage a comprehensive, high-precision dataset of building footprints to identify infrastructure deficits and infer informal settlements down to the street block level10–12 everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa. We identify a general pattern of informality with cities showing, on average, greater access to infrastructure and services than rural and peri-urban areas. We show that such patterns of informality are characterized by consistent statistical distributions reflecting uneven local development2,13,14. We also show that these physical measures of informality are systematically associated with many indicators of human deprivation, which form a single principal component co-varying predictably with specific changes in street access to buildings. These results demonstrate that the localization of sustainable development is possible down to the street level at a continental scale and provide a general distributed strategy for accelerating progress in infrastructure and service expansion that taps local innovations in systematic, equitable and context-appropriate ways7,11,12,15.

 Behavioural adaptations to environmental threats are crucial for survival1,2 and necessitate rapid deployment of energy reserves3–5. The amygdala coordinates behavioural adaptations to threats6, but little is known about its involvement in underpinning metabolic adaptations. Here we show that acute stress activates medial amygdala (MeA) neurons that innervate the ventromedial hypothalamus (MeAVMH neurons), which precipitates hyperglycaemia and hypophagia. The glycaemic actions of MeAVMH neurons occur independently of adrenal or pancreatic glucoregulatory hormones. Using whole-body virus tracing, we identify a polysynaptic connection from MeA to the liver that promotes the rapid synthesis of glucose by hepatic gluconeogenesis. Repeated stress exposure disrupts MeA control of blood glucose, resulting in diabetes-like dysregulation of glucose homeostasis. Our findings reveal an amygdala–liver axis that regulates rapid glycaemic adaptations to stress and links recurrent stress to metabolic dysfunction.

 Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by interacting with DNA in a sequence-specific manner. High-throughput in vitro technologies, such as protein-binding microarrays1–6 and HT-SELEX (high-throughput systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment)7,8, have revealed the DNA-binding specificities of hundreds of TFs. However, they have limited ability to reliably identify lower-affinity DNA binding sites, which are increasingly recognized as important for precise spatiotemporal control of gene expression9–19. Here, to address this limitation, we developed protein affinity to DNA by in vitro transcription and RNA sequencing (PADIT-seq), with which we comprehensively assayed the binding preferences of six TFs to all possible ten-base-pair DNA sequences, detecting hundreds of novel, lower-affinity binding sites. The expanded repertoire of lower-affinity binding sites revealed that nucleotides flanking high-affinity DNA binding sites create overlapping lower-affinity sites that together modulate TF genomic occupancy in vivo. We propose a model in which TF binding is not determined by individual binding sites, but rather by the sum of multiple, overlapping binding sites. The overlapping binding model explains how competition between paralogous TFs for shared high-affinity binding sites is determined by flanking nucleotides that create differential numbers of overlapping, lower-affinity binding sites. Critically, the model transforms our understanding of noncoding-variant effects, revealing how single nucleotide changes simultaneously alter multiple overlapping sites to additively influence gene expression and human traits, including diseases.

 Cardiolipin (CL) is the signature phospholipid of the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it stabilizes electron transport chain protein complexes1. The final step in CL biosynthesis relates to its remodelling: the exchange of nascent acyl chains with longer, unsaturated chains1. However, the enzyme responsible for cleaving nascent CL (nCL) has remained elusive. Here, we describe ABHD18 as a candidate deacylase in the CL biosynthesis pathway. Accordingly, ABHD18 converts CL into monolysocardiolipin (MLCL) in vitro, and its inactivation in cells and mice results in a shift to nCL in serum and tissues. Notably, ABHD18 deactivation rescues the mitochondrial defects in cells and the morbidity and mortality in mice associated with Barth syndrome. This rare genetic disease is characterized by the build-up of MLCL resulting from inactivating mutations in TAFAZZIN (TAZ), which encodes the final enzyme in the CL-remodelling cascade1. We also identified a selective, covalent, small-molecule inhibitor of ABHD18 that rescues TAZ mutant phenotypes in fibroblasts from human patients and in fish embryos.

 Living organisms are assumed to produce same-species offspring1,2. Here, we report a shift from this norm in Messor ibericus, an ant that lays individuals from two distinct species. In this life cycle, females must clone males of another species because they require their sperm to produce the worker caste. As a result, males from the same mother exhibit distinct genomes and morphologies, as they belong to species that diverged over 5 million years ago. The evolutionary history of this system appears as sexual parasitism3 that evolved into a natural case of cross-species cloning4,5, resulting in the maintenance of a male-only lineage cloned through distinct species’ ova. We term females exhibiting this reproductive mode as xenoparous, meaning they give birth to other species as part of their life cycle. In a case of obligate cross-species cloning, female ants of Messor ibericus need to clone males of Messor structor to obtain sperm for producing the worker caste, resulting in males from the same mother having distinct genomes and morphologies."

 Fibroblasts and immune cells coordinate tissue regeneration and necessary scarring after injury. In the brain, fibroblasts are border-enriched cells whose dynamic molecular states and immune interactions after injury remain unclear1. Here we define the shared fibroblast–immune response to brain injury. Early profibrotic myofibroblasts develop from pre-existing brain fibroblasts and infiltrate brain lesions, orchestrated by fibroblast TGFβ signalling, profibrotic macrophages and microglia, and perilesional glia. Myofibroblasts transition into several late fibroblast states, including lymphocyte-interactive fibroblasts. Interruption of the early myofibroblast state exacerbated sub-acute brain injury, tissue loss and secondary neuroinflammation, with increased mortality in the transient middle cerebral artery occlusion stroke model. Disruption of late lymphocyte–fibroblast niches via selective loss of fibroblast chemokine CXCL12 led to late brain-specific innate inflammation and lymphocyte dispersal with increased IFNγ production. These data indicate the response to brain injury is coordinated by evolving temporal and spatial fibroblast states that limit functional tissue loss and chronic neuroinflammation. Spatial transcriptomic studies and lineage tracing reveal that, after brain injury, transient profibrotic fibroblasts develop from existing brain fibroblasts, infiltrate lesions, regulate the local immune response and lead to beneficial scar tissue formation."

Wahl,Rewiring of cortical glucose metabolism fuels human brain cancer growth,"The cortex fuels essential physiological processes with glucose-derived carbon, while gliomas fuel their aggressiveness by rerouting glucose carbon pathways and scavenging alternative carbon sources such as environmental amino acids, providing a potential therapeutic target. 
 The brain avidly consumes glucose to fuel neurophysiology1. Cancers of the brain, such as glioblastoma, relinquish physiological integrity and gain the ability to proliferate and invade healthy tissue2. How brain cancers rewire glucose use to drive aggressive growth remains unclear. Here we infused 13C-labelled glucose into patients and mice with brain cancer, coupled with quantitative metabolic flux analysis, to map the fates of glucose-derived carbon in tumour versus cortex. Through direct and comprehensive measurements of carbon and nitrogen labelling in both cortex and glioma tissues, we identify profound metabolic transformations. In the human cortex, glucose carbons fuel essential physiological processes, including tricarboxylic acid cycle oxidation and neurotransmitter synthesis. Conversely, gliomas downregulate these processes and scavenge alternative carbon sources such as amino acids from the environment, repurposing glucose-derived carbons to generate molecules needed for proliferation and invasion. Targeting this metabolic rewiring in mice through dietary amino acid modulation selectively alters glioblastoma metabolism, slows tumour growth and augments the efficacy of standard-of-care treatments. These findings illuminate how aggressive brain tumours exploit glucose to suppress normal physiological activity in favour of malignant expansion and offer potential therapeutic strategies to enhance treatment outcomes. The cortex fuels essential physiological processes with glucose-derived carbon, while gliomas fuel their aggressiveness by rerouting glucose carbon pathways and scavenging alternative carbon sources such as environmental amino acids, providing a potential therapeutic target."

 For rocky planets, the presence of a solid inner core has notable implications on the composition and thermal evolution of the core and on the magnetic history of the planet1–3. On Mars, geophysical observations have confirmed that the core is at least partially liquid4–7, but it is unknown whether any part of the core is solid. Here we present an analysis of seismic data acquired by the InSight mission, demonstrating that Mars has a solid inner core. We identify two seismic phases, the deep core-transiting phase, PKKP, and the inner core boundary reflecting phase, PKiKP, indicative of the inner core. Our inversions constrain the radius of the Martian inner core to about 613 ± 67 km, with a compressional velocity jump of around 30% across the inner core boundary, supported by additional inner-core-related seismic phases. These properties imply a concentration of distinct light elements in the inner core, segregated from the outer core through core crystallization. This finding provides an anchor point for understanding the thermal and chemical state of Mars. Moreover, the relationship between inner core formation and the Martian magnetic field evolution could provide insights into dynamo generation across planetary bodies. An analysis of seismic data acquired by the InSight mission demonstrates that Mars has a 600-km solid inner core."

 The second half of the first millennium ce in Central and Eastern Europe was accompanied by fundamental cultural and political transformations. This period of change is commonly associated with the appearance of the Slavs, which is supported by textual evidence1,2 and coincides with the emergence of similar archaeological horizons3–6. However, so far there has been no consensus on whether this archaeological horizon spread by migration, Slavicisation or a combination of both. Genetic data remain sparse, especially owing to the widespread practice of cremation in the early phase of the Slavic settlement. Here we present genome-wide data from 555 ancient individuals, including 359 samples from Slavic contexts from as early as the seventh century ce. Our data demonstrate large-scale population movement from Eastern Europe during the sixth to eighth centuries, replacing more than 80% of the local gene pool in Eastern Germany, Poland and Croatia. Yet, we also show substantial regional heterogeneity as well as a lack of sex-biased admixture, indicating varying degrees of cultural assimilation of the autochthonous populations. Comparing archaeological and genetic evidence, we find that the change in ancestry in Eastern Germany coincided with a change in social organization, characterized by an intensification of inter- and intra-site genetic relatedness and patrilocality. On the European scale, it appears plausible that the changes in material culture and language between the sixth and eighth centuries were connected to these large-scale population movements. Analyses of ancient human DNA show that cultural and political transformations in Central Europe during the second half of the first millennium ce were associated with movements of Slavic populations into Germany, Poland and Croatia."

This study shows rising emissions, limited decoupling, and shifting trade patterns involving more emerging and developing economies. 
 Methane has been identified as the second-largest contributor to climate change, accounting for approximately 30% of global warming. Countries have established targets and are implementing various measures to curb methane emissions. However, our understanding of the trends in methane emissions and their drivers remains limited, particularly from a consumption perspective (i.e. accounting for all emissions along the entire global supply chain). This study investigates the most recent dynamics of methane emissions across 120 sectors from both production and consumption viewpoints in 164 countries. It also discusses the status of decoupling of production- and consumption-based methane emissions from economic growth. Our results indicate that there is no foreseeable slowdown in the momentum of global methane emissions growth. Only a few developed countries have managed to reduce both production- and consumption-based emissions while maintaining economic growth (i.e., strong decoupling) during the observed period (1990-2023). Global trade accounts for approximately 30% of global methane emissions, but major trade patterns are shifting from North-North and North-South to South-South countries, reflecting the increasing participating of developing countries in global supply chains. The study further reveals the changing drivers of global methane emissions from 1998 to 2023 in five-year intervals. It identifies that the reduction in emission coefficient (i.e., emissions per unit of output), driven by advancements in improved energy efficiency and cleaner production technologies, is the main determinant for reducing emissions over the observation period, partly offsetting the increasing effects from growth of final demand. Changes in demand structure have played a considerable role in the increase of emissions since 2008. This study enhances our understanding of the changes and drivers of methane emissions and supports countries in incorporating methane emissions into their climate mitigation strategies. Understanding global methane trends remains limited, especially from a consumption view.

Immediately accounting for the equity obligations of the Paris Agreement implies important financial support now. 
 National emissions targets are collectively insufficient to align with the Paris Agreement. The fair-share literature assesses whether these targets are fair and ambitious in comparison to emissions trajectories based on equity principles. Such emissions trajectories commonly start at present-day emissions levels. Here we show that these continuous trajectories inherently reward past inaction and increasingly do so with their iterative updates. We provide an approach to allocating emissions trajectories based on equity principles applied with immediate effect. The resulting discontinuous national trajectories not starting at current emissions levels imply significant immediate international support to fund rapid mitigation globally. Modelling allocations with or without continuity has remarkable consequences for the relative implied contributions to international support among high-income countries. We find that emissions targets of G7 countries, Russia and China are responsible for most of the global 2030 ambition gap, while only some countries align with their 1.5 °C allocation. Existing ambition assessments of national climate pledges are biased, incompatible with international law and reward high emitters.

Here, Gautam et al present an approach combining nanostructure engineering with high frequency domain structure control, reducing core losses by 55%. 
 The next generation of power electronics necessitates materials capable of rapid response at tens of kilohertz frequencies while ensuring minimal core losses. Accelerating the advancement of power electronics hinges on addressing the current shortage of ultra-low core loss soft magnets, thereby enabling sustainable energy utilization and paving the way toward achieving zero carbon footprints. Here we demonstrate an approach that integrates nanostructure engineering with high-frequency domain structure control, significantly enhancing the performance of Fe-enriched amorphous ribbons. Our strategy reduces core loss by 55%, achieving an ultra-low loss of ~ 75 ± 1.3 W/kg at 10 kHz, 1 T. We attribute this improvement to optimized perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, which is induced by positive magnetostriction and compressive stress generated from partial nanocrystallization of α-Fe in a residual amorphous matrix. These configurations lead to the formation of a narrow stripe-shaped magnetic domain (~ 4.8 ± 0.6 μm wide), resulting in minimal excess loss. These findings highlight a pivotal advancement in soft magnet design, facilitating energy-efficient, miniaturized power electronics for modern applications.

Accounting for age and education greatly improves predictions, with demographic-specific effects often an order of magnitude larger than population wide averages. 
 Understanding the impact of climate change on human migration is critical for policymakers. Yet climate change can both incentivize people to migrate and reduce their ability to move, making its effect on human migration ambiguous. We propose an approach to studying migration that combines causal inference methods with cross-validation techniques to reliably estimate effects of weather on migration within and across borders. This approach highlights the key role of migrant demographics in the weather-migration relationship. We show that allowing weather effects to differ by age and education improves out-of-sample performance by a factor of five or more compared with a homogeneous effect. Demographic heterogeneity is critical in explaining this discrepancy. Projections based on our empirical estimates indicate that the effects of climate change on future cross-border migration will be an order of magnitude larger for most demographics than the average effect, but differing responses across groups largely offset one another. Migration responses to climate are demographically heterogeneous.

 Cognitive impairments in Multiple Sclerosis (MS) are prevalent and disabling yet often unaddressed. Here, we optimised automated online assessment technology for people with MS and used it to characterise their cognitive deficits in greater detail and at a larger population scale than previously possible. The study involved 4526 UK MS Register members over three stages. Stage 1 evaluated 22 online cognitive tasks and established their feasibility.

Here, the authors show that the KH and R3H domains of KhpB cooperatively bind RNA via a composite interface revealed by crystal structures. 
 KhpB, also known as EloR, is a recently discovered global RNA-binding protein in various pathogenic bacteria that regulates critical cellular processes. KhpB is unique in containing both an R3H domain and a KH domain, which are universal RNA/DNA-binding domains found across various proteins involved in diverse cellular functions. However, the precise roles of these domains in KhpB’s RNA-binding mechanism remain unclear, particularly as no structural data of the R3H domain bound to RNA/DNA have been reported for any protein. In this study, we present the crystal structures of both the RNA-free and RNA-bound forms of Thermus thermophilus KhpB dimer. These structures reveal that the KH and R3H domains cooperate to form a composite RNA-binding site capable of binding a single RNA molecule. Notably, the coordinated interaction requires RNA molecules that are at least 7 nucleotides long. This interaction induces conformational changes, including the closure of the RNA-binding cleft between the two domains. The structural data further reveal that KhpB primarily interacts with the phosphate backbone of RNA, while most of the base moieties remain solvent-exposed. These findings provide structural insights into the molecular function of KhpB and shed light on the RNA-binding strategies of other R3H domain-containing proteins. R3H domain-containing proteins are widespread RNA binders, yet their binding mechanisms remain poorly understood.

 In 2023, sea surface temperatures (SSTs) reached record highs, partly due to a strong El Niño. Based on historical responses to elevated global mean SSTs, oceanic CO2 uptake in 2023 should have increased (−0.11 ± 0.04 PgC yr−1), driven by reduced outgassing in the tropical Pacific Ocean. However, using observation-based estimates of ocean CO2 fugacity, we show here that the global non-polar ocean absorbed about 10% less CO2 than expected (+0.17 ± 0.12 PgC yr−1). This weakening was caused by the anomalous outgassing of CO2 in the subtropical and subpolar regions, especially in the Northern Hemisphere, driven primarily by elevated SSTs reducing the solubility of CO2. In most regions, this SST-induced outgassing was mitigated by the depletion of dissolved inorganic carbon in the surface mixed layer. Such negative feedbacks caused an overall muted response of the ocean carbon sink to the record-high SSTs, but this resilience may not persist under long-term warming or more severe SST extremes.

 Strategies for achieving net-zero emissions in municipal solid waste (MSW) management are crucial for a sustainable society, but insights that can guide global policy-making are still scarce. Here we provide a holistic view on this topic on a global scale. We first evaluated the spatiotemporal differences in global and national MSW-related emissions in 195 countries or regions between 1980 and 2022, and determined the spatiotemporal heterogeneity and drivers of global and national MSW-related greenhouse gas emissions. Then we performed prospective scenario-based simulations and found that all countries can achieve net zero in MSW management by 2100, but tailored measures are needed. We finally explored the strategies and challenges associated with achieving net zero via 1,024 scenarios while considering the combination of several measures from a local perspective. The results suggest that most developing countries should adjust their treatment measures and/or upgrade their technologies, whereas developed regions can achieve net zero with a single measure, particularly recycling, which has substantial mitigation potential. These insights can help to develop localized MSW management strategies for different countries and eventually contribute to achieving the net-zero target globally. Developing strategies for reducing carbon emissions in municipal solid waste management is essential to achieve the net-zero target.

 Central Asia hosts some of the world’s last relatively healthy mountain glaciers and is heavily dependent on snow and ice melt for downstream water supply, though the causes of this stable glacier state are not known. We combine recent in-situ observations, climate reanalysis and remote sensing data to force a land-surface model to reconstruct glacier changes over the last two decades (1999–2023) and disentangle their causes over a benchmark glacierized catchment in Tajikistan. We show that snowfall and snow depth have been substantially lower since 2018, leading to a decline in glacier health and reduced runoff generation. Remote-sensing observations confirm wider snow depletion across the Northwestern Pamirs, suggesting that a lack of snowfall might be a cause of mass losses regionally. Our results provide an explanation for the recent decline in glacier health in the region, and reinforce the need to better understand the variability of precipitation.

 Understanding how climate systems respond to carbon dioxide removal is crucial for assessing effectiveness of carbon neutrality policies. Here we show that rising carbon dioxide intensifies aridity over vast regions, particularly in vulnerable and climate-sensitive drylands based on idealized emission-driven simulations from an Earth System Model. Notably, even as carbon dioxide concentrations decline, arid regions continue to expand and experience worsening conditions, exacerbating climate injustice and resource conflicts. This pronounced hysteresis is primarily driven by long-lasting precipitation reductions in the tropics, linked to hysteresis of the intertropical convergence zone. The asymmetric response of arid zones suggests that reversing aridity intensification under global warming is exceptionally difficult. Further analysis highlights that negative carbon dioxide emissions may be essential to mitigating these deteriorating conditions, yet full recovery requires extended timescales. Our findings underscore irreversible risks of delayed action and stress the urgent need for carbon neutrality strategies that go beyond net-zero targets.

 Microbial respiration is conventionally considered the primary driver of short-term carbon dioxide pulses following soil drying-rewetting cycles. However, rapid emission kinetics and delayed microbial recovery in drought-impacted soils suggest substantial abiotic contributions to carbon mineralization, particularly in arid sandy soils. Here, we quantified abiotic carbon emissions during soil drying–rewetting through microbial growth monitoring and sterilization. In sandy soils, abiotic processes dominated initial emissions, accounting for 95.5% of total carbon dioxide production within three hours after rewetting, compared to 39.5% in paddy soils. Solid-liquid interfacial reactions during rewetting drove iron and manganese redox cycling, generating reactive oxygen species that directly promoted carbon mineralization. These reactive oxygen species synergized with enzymes to degrade organic carbon, preferentially targeting dissolved organic matter with low hydrogen-to-carbon ratios and high double bond equivalents, which are typically resistant to microbial degradation. Our findings show that abiotic processes dominate short-term carbon dynamics during rewetting of arid sandy soils.

 Crop mapping is an indispensable application in agricultural and environmental remote sensing. Over the last few decades, the exponential growth of open Earth Observation (EO) data has significantly enhanced crop mapping and enabled the production of detailed crop-specific land cover data at national and regional scales. These data have served multiple purposes across a wide range of applications and research initiatives. However, there is currently no comprehensive summary of the crop mapping data products, nor is there a detailed discussion of their uses in remote sensing studies. This paper provides the first in-depth review of remote sensing for crop mapping from the perspective of crop-specific land cover data by evaluating over 60 open-access operational products, archival crop type map datasets, single-crop extent map datasets, cropping pattern datasets, and crop mapping platforms and systems. Using the Cropland Data Layer (CDL) – one of the most widely used products with over 25 years of continuous monitoring of U.S. croplands – as a case study, we also conduct a systematic literature review on the application of crop type maps in remote sensing science. Our analysis synthesizes 129 research articles through three core research questions: (1) What EO data are used with CDL; (2) What scientific problems and technologies are explored using CDL; and (3) What role does CDL play in remote sensing applications. Furthermore, we delve into the implications of our vision for new data products and propose emerging research topics, ranging from extending the spatiotemporal coverage of current data products to improving global mapping reliability and developing operational in-season crop mapping systems. This review paper not only serves as a reference for stakeholders seeking to utilize crop-specific land cover data in their work, but also outlines the directions for future geospatial data product development."

 Coastal areas worldwide experience serious ground subsidence and rising sea levels, leading to frequent flooding and continued elevation loss. Reliable estimation of coastal subsidence is critical for effective risk assessment and management. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) enables millimeter-scale deformation monitoring, but generating seamless wide-area results remains challenging due to limited swath width and inconsistencies between adjacent frames. This study proposes an adaptive gridded adjustment model for merging multi-path/frame InSAR results into a wide-area high-precision deformation map. We employ a quadtree-based adaptive grid with dynamically optimized sizes determined by the deformation gradient. The gridded corrections are combined with GNSS-constrained global corrections to eliminate inter-frame biases. Applied to the coastal area of the Bohai Rim, this method reduces the Sentinel-1 discrepancies by 38 %, and outperforms the fixed-grid method in achieving an optimal balance between precision and efficiency. This method is useful for wide-area high-precision deformation monitoring to support risk assessments of relative sea level rise in the context of global climate change."

 Parcels are the fundamental units of agricultural management; accurate crop classification of cropland parcels is crucial for the implementation of precision agriculture. Despite extensive knowledge of crop growth processes, the difficulty in acquiring this knowledge and its modal differences with remote sensing data hinder its application in crop classification research. Moreover, the highly complex and variable growth patterns of crops present significant challenges for time-series crop classification. We propose a novel crop classification framework that extracts intricate multi-period features of crop growth from remote sensing time-series signals. Additionally, we introduce an automatic construction process for crop remote sensing knowledge graphs based on a decision tree structure, capturing the association between crops and remote sensing time-series data. Through graph convolution, knowledge graph serves as a global guide to improve crop classification. By combining field survey samples with visible, near-infrared, and radar signals, we constructed a parcel-scale dataset of rice and wheat crops across four cities in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River using zonal feature aggregation methods for evaluation. The results indicate that the proposed framework achieves accuracies ranging from 89.45 % to 94.43 % across the four datasets. We conducted inferences in the four cities and compared the results with county-level statistical data, achieving R2 values of 0.89 and 0.97 for wheat and rice planting areas, respectively. Our proposed framework can automatically generate crop knowledge graphs based on samples from different regions, overcoming the modal barriers between the knowledge space and the remote sensing feature space, thus enhancing crop recognition accuracy."

 Fine-grained soils are crucial for assessing forest diversity and soil disturbances. Existing models for predicting particle size distributions (PSDs) often rely heavily on soil samples or lack necessary spatial dependencies, scalability and flexibility. This study introduces a holistic GeoAI model using graph neural networks (GNNs), LiDAR, and Sentinel-2 data to address these limitations. We collected 330 soil samples from 47 forest stands with a random-stratified method in southwestern Finland. The samples were pre-processed and analyzed for PSDs using a laser diffraction method, and classified into four groups: <2 µm, 2–6 µm, 6–20 µm, and 20–60 µm. To increase the number of annotations, we predicted soil PSDs at unmeasured locations using CoKriging within stands. The forests were segmented into small homogeneous polygons to construct the graph layer. We mapped 61 covariates using LiDAR and Sentinel-2 based on scorpan model, which were then summarized into the graph layer. Subsequently, we established the pipelines of five GNN models regarding the top covariates. The results indicate that geomorphometry and organisms covariates accounted for the majority of importance. The graph attention network (GAT) recorded high stability during training and remarkable prediction accuracy after testing with R2 values above 0.98 in predicting fine-grained soil PSDs across all four soil groups. Conversely, the relational graph convolutional networks (RGCN) also achieved R2 values above 0.97, but with lower stability and longer training times. However, the high accuracy of the predictive models is partly due to the large number of annotations derived from CoKriging, which may introduce uncertainties. Our GAT model demonstrated strong transferability when applied to an independent test stand using CoKriging-derived data (R2: 0.98–0.99) and showed robust performance when evaluated against real ground-truth samples (R2: 0.88–0.95). The observed prediction errors (RMSE: 0.68–2.82) reflect a combination of uncertainties originating from the CoKriging training data (RMSE: 0.34–2.46) and model-induced errors during training (RMSE: 0.37–1.46). Nevertheless, the consistently high R2 values indicate a strong agreement between predicted and measured soil PSDs. Future studies should focus on training the model with a larger number of ground-truth soil samples and evaluating its transferability across diverse boreal forest landscapes."

 This study investigates the vertical structure of macro- and microphysical cloud properties associated with the Southwest Vortex (SWV) during the warm season, utilizing CloudSat satellite observations and Southwest Vortex Yearbooks (2012–2017). Results show that the SWV system's cloud top height exceeds 16 km, with a maximum average cloud cover of 35 %, approximately 17 % higher than the East Asian average. Single-layer clouds account for about 48 %, with frequency decreasing as cloud layer number increases. Altocumulus and high clouds are most frequent, while deep convective clouds and nimbostratus are least frequent. Cloud phase analysis under the SWV systems shows a balanced occurrence (37 %) of ice and liquid clouds, with mixed-phase clouds showing the lowest frequency (27 %). Radar reflectivity vertical profiles identify key layers at 2 km (raindrop evaporation) and 5 km (mixed-phase regions).The liquid cloud effective radius reaches a peak of 35 μm at 1.5 km, stabilizing to 15 μm above 2 km. The ice cloud effective radius is distributed between 25 and 95 μm, with a maximum value of 95 μm observed at 5 km. The ice water content exhibits a unimodal distribution, peaking at 0.3 g·m−3 at 8 km. As an α mesoscale convective system, the SWV's strong updraft drives airflow to the upper atmosphere, where low temperatures and supersaturated conditions facilitate the growth of ice crystals. These results clarify the SWV's unique cloud vertical structure and properties, reveal links between regional mesoscale convective systems and cloud-precipitation processes, and provide a basis for enhancing the accuracy of climate and weather forecasts."

 The aerosol extinction coefficient (AEC) is a critical parameter in atmospheric research, providing valuable insights into aerosol concentration, composition, and their effects on solar radiation, air quality, and climate change. While the Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) onboard the Cloud-Aerosol LiDAR and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observation (CALIPSO) satellite offers high temporal continuity in vertical profiling, its AEC retrievals rely on multiple assumptions —such as fixed lidar ratios, layer homogeneity, and pre-defined aerosol models—which introduce uncertainties and limit retrieval accuracy. To address these limitations, this study proposes a deep learning-based method utilizing a ResNet architecture to estimate and retrieve AEC profiles more accurately. The model is trained using CALIOP data and ground-based measurements from European Aerosol Research Lidar Network (EARLINET) stations, enhancing predictive performance and generalization. The proposed model's performance was evaluated across multiple EARLINET stations, CALIOP Level 2 (L2) products, and two major aerosol events—a European dust storm and aged volcanic ash over north Europa—demonstrating robustness across diverse atmospheric conditions. Comparisons of total column Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) and LiDAR ratio (LR) profiles derived from the estimated AEC with CALIOP L2 retrievals and EARLINET measurements highlighted the model's superior accuracy and generalization. Specifically, the model showed excellent agreement with EARLINET AOD (R2 = 0.98, RMSE = 0.01), significantly outperforming CALIOP (R2 = 0.21, RMSE = 0.06). Moreover, the model provides vertically resolved LR profiles from 0 to 15 km, whereas CALIOP L2 offers limited and often fixed LR values due to missing AEC data and restrictive assumptions. Notably, the backscatter, AEC, and LR profiles produced by the model consistently outperformed CALIOP L2 retrievals when validated against EARLINET Raman measurements. Additionally, AOD estimates showed strong agreement with EARLINET data, achieving R2 and RMSE values of 0.98 and 0.01, respectively, compared to CALIOP's 0.21 and 0.06. The analysis of LR values for the significant aerosol events aligned well with the physical characteristics of these phenomena, underscoring the model's ability to capture complex aerosol behavior across vertical layers of the European troposphere and lower stratosphere."

 Quantifying and minimizing atmospheric transport errors is key to improve meteorological modeling and to better estimate urban greenhouse gas (GHG) and air pollution emissions from measurements. The Weather Research and Forecasting Model (WRF) model has been used to simulate urban atmospheric transport in many cities globally and there exist various possible configurations especially concerning choice of physics schemes, which influence the quality of the atmospheric simulation. Here, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of WRF on 1 km resolution for a polycentric European metropolitan area, namely the Rhine-Main-Neckar area by varying Land Surface Model (LSM), Surface Layer Model (SLM), Planetary Boundary Layer (PBL) and urban parametrization scheme configurations. We compare four month-long simulations to 2 m temperature, 10 m wind velocity and wind direction measured at 19 stations operated by the German Weather Service and to PBL height derived from radiosonde data at two locations. By showing kernel density functions in a Taylor diagram, we show the average performance of the schemes as well as the spread across different stations. We find that while the 2 m temperature and PBL height performance are most sensitive to choice of urban parametrization scheme, 10 m wind velocity and direction are most sensitive to choice of PBL scheme. Good overall performance was achieved using the Single-Layer Urban Canopy Model (SLUCM), Mellor-Yamada-Janjic (MYJ), Noah-Multiparametrization Land Surface Model (Noah-MP) and Monin-Obukhov (Janjic) (MO) schemes.

This degradation can be counteracted by RING-UIM E3 ligases RNF114 and RNF166, although the process is unclear.

This ubiquitylation occurs, not on a (canonical) lysine, but rather on MAR, creating a monoubiquitin-MAR hybrid mark. RNF114 and RNF166 recognize this mark using a unique hybrid reader domain and further diubiquitylate it. This ubiquitylation of MAR, which occurs near the ADP-ribose addition site, prevents PAR formation, antagonizing the action of the PAR-binding E3 ligase RNF146 and stabilizing tankyrase.

Inspired by the apoptotic body (ApoBD)–mediated deep tumor penetration, we design a pulsatile sequential drug release system with a core-shell structure. The reversible acid-responsive shell protonates and swells in lysosomes to release doxorubicin, inducing lysosomal escape and cell apoptosis. In ApoBDs, it deprotonates and contracts to prevent excessive drug release. After deep penetration via ApoBDs, the hypoxia-responsive core releases all-trans retinoic acid to reverse CSCs and MDSCs, overcoming chemoresistance and modulating the immuno-microenvironment. This strategy targets the heterogeneous distribution of CSCs and MDSCs in solid tumors, enhancing chemo-intervention and immune checkpoint blockade therapy while presenting encouraging potential for cascade deep tumor penetration and differentiation therapy."

Here, we incorporate these processes to simulate how sulfur, carbon, and hydrogen degas from martian melts. We find that reduced sulfur species, H2S and S2, are dominantly emitted through degassing at crustal to surficial pressures. These sulfur species could condense as sulfide and elemental sulfur, potentially yielding the sulfate deposits observed on the martian surface through secondary oxidation. Our models also show that evolved magmas reach graphite and sulfide saturation at crustal pressures and thus may establish sulfur and carbon reservoirs in the martian crust.

Herein, we propose a strategy that involves the rapid and sustained vasculature repair alongside microenvironment-driven drug delivery to achieve multifaceted RA management. The transformable, self-assembling nanoplatform specifically accumulates in the inflamed joint cavity guided by a vascular targeting peptide (STP). Subsequently, STP detaches and undergoes shape transformation, forming nanofibers on the vascular endothelium, which serve as a rapid-acting physical barrier in the short term and facilitate sustained vascular normalization in the long term. Concurrently, the remaining nanoparticles undergo charge reversal and RGD exposure, enabling precise delivery of anti-RA agent triptolide and the immunomodulatory agent metformin. Collectively, this study provides a potent strategy for rapid, sustained, and precise spatiotemporal remodeling of RA using a simple yet intelligent self-assembling nanoplatform."

Many non-native marine taxa are not documented until after they have become invasive, leaving questions about invasion timing (first introduction and lag period), geographic origin, vectors and pathways, and cause(s) of success. Foraminifera, unicellular, calcareous-shelled eukaryotes, offer a unique way of analyzing past ecosystem structure because their fossilized shells provide a window into the past, and small size and abundance enable us to document distribution over time in core samples. We use records of Foraminifera to document the timing and history of establishment of an invasive species (Ammonia confertitesta) in Long Island Sound, east of New York City (USA).A. confertitestawas rare from the mid-19th century but did not proliferate until the mid-1970s.

While Spanish colonists brought horses to the Caribbean decades earlier, settlement of the English colony at Jamestown, Virginia, was among the first dispersals of horses to the eastern seaboard. Archaeozoological analysis of identifiable domestic equid remains from two contexts associated with the initial occupation of Jamestown demonstrates intense processing and consumption of the first Jamestown horses during the “Starving Time” winter of 1609. Osteological and biomolecular study of these equid remains demonstrates their successful reproduction at the colony and use in transport activities and identifies an adult domestic donkey with mixed European and West African ancestry, possibly supplied through undocumented exchange during a transatlantic stopover. These results reveal the challenges of equid translocation in early settlement of eastern North America and the global connectivity of early transatlantic animal exchange."

Accordingly, we evaluated the effects of long-term/low-dose Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) supplementation in simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)–infected, ART-treated rhesus macaques (RMs). THC significantly increased plasma/jejunum serotonin and indole-3-propionate, enhancing gut-brain communication through up-regulation of serotonin receptors (HTR4/HTR7) and aryl hydrocarbon receptor (Ahr) signaling via a cannabinoid receptor (CBR)-2–mediated mechanism. Furthermore, THC enriched cholesterol-metabolizingOscillibacterand reduced plasma cholesterol and toxic secondary bile acids (SBAs), thus improving cholesterol and SBA homeostasis. Furthermore, THC increased β-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) levels via a CBR1-mediated mechanism, suggesting enhanced hepatic fatty acid oxidation for metabolic and cardiovascular health. THC restored ART/SIV-induced elevation of pro-inflammatory and cardiotoxic long-chain acylcholines to preinfection levels.

We developed a Bayesian computational model to decompose path integration errors into distinct components. SCD participants exhibited significantly higher path integration error, primarily driven by increased memory leak, while other modeling-derived error sources, such as velocity gain, sensory, and reporting noise, remained comparable across groups. Our findings suggest that path integration deficits, specifically memory leak, may serve as an early marker of neurodegeneration in SCD and highlight the potential of self-motion–based navigation tasks for detecting presymptomatic Alzheimer’s disease–related cognitive changes."

The stress-protective transcription factor heat shock factor 2 (HSF2) is associated with cancer, but its function in breast carcinogenesis remains poorly understood. Analysis of human breast tumor samples and mouse in vivo xenografts uncovered that HSF2 expression and activity undergo dynamic changes as a function of tumor progression. HSF2 expression, nuclear localization, and coexpression with the proliferation marker Ki67 are increased in ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), suggesting that HSF2 designates hyperplastic cells underlying tumor expansion. In mouse xenografts, HSF2 localization switches from nuclear to cytoplasmic upon DCIS-to-invasive transition. Using cell-based models, we identify canonical transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) signaling as the molecular mechanism regulating HSF2. TGF-β–mediated down-regulation of HSF2 allowed acquisition of an invasive cell phenotype, which was counteracted by ectopic HSF2.

Grishchuk,"Ndc80 complex, a conserved coupler for kinetochore-microtubule motility, is a sliding molecular clutch","Chromosome motion at spindle microtubule plus ends relies on dynamic molecular bonds between kinetochores and proximal microtubule walls. Under opposing forces, kinetochores move bidirectionally along these walls while remaining near the ends, yet how continuous wall sliding occurs without end detachment remains unclear. Using ultrafast force-clamp spectroscopy, we show that single Ndc80 complexes, the primary microtubule-binding kinetochore component, exhibit processive, bidirectional sliding. Plus end–directed forces induce a mobile catch bond in Ndc80, increasing frictional resistance and restricting sliding toward the tip. Conversely, forces pulling Ndc80 away from the plus end trigger mobile slip-bond behavior, facilitating sliding. This dual behavior arises from force-dependent modulation of the Nuf2 calponin-homology domain’s microtubule binding, identifying this subunit as a friction regulator. We propose that Ndc80’s ability to modulate sliding friction provides the mechanistic basis for the kinetochore’s end coupling, enabling its slip-clutch behavior."

Szele,Galectin-3 induces neurodevelopmental apical-basal polarity and regulates gyrification,"Apical-basal polarity (ABP) establishment and maintenance is necessary for proper brain development, yet how it is controlled is unclear. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) has been previously implicated in ABP of epithelial cells, and, here, we find that it is apically expressed in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) during neural induction. Gal-3 blockade disrupts ABP and alters the distribution of junctional proteins in hESC-derived neural rosettes and is rescued by addition of recombinant Gal-3. Transcriptomics analysis shows that blocking Gal-3 regulates expression of genes responsible for nervous system development and cell junction assembly, among others. Last, Gal-3 blockade during embryonic development in vivo reduces horizontal cell divisions, disturbs cortical layering of neural progenitors, and induces gyrification. These data uncover a regulatory mechanism for ABP in the brain and warrant caution in modulating Gal-3 during pregnancy."

However, curved image sensors mimicking the human retina typically lack tunable curvature to match the curved Petzval surface throughout the focus-tunable range. Here, we propose a focus-tunable real-time curved imaging system based on a tunable-curvature perovskite curved image sensor. Using parylene C film for waterproofing and encapsulation, the ultrathin perovskite curved image sensor with the hierarchical mesh design is demonstrated, which conforms to spherical surfaces of different radii while maintaining mechanical stability during deformation. The image sensor exhibits low detection limit (10 nanowatts per square centimeter) and long-term stable dynamic photoresponse. Combining the image sensor with a tunable lens achieves clear images at different distances via simultaneously adjusting both sensor and lens radii. Furthermore, through integrating image sensor with a readout matrix and wireless data collection component, the real-time imaging system is demonstrated with real-time focus-tunable imaging capabilities."

Small signaling peptides play crucial roles in the regulation of stress responses in plants. Here, we unveil that the TaCEP15 peptide interacts with the leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase TaCEPRL. Knockout ofTaCEP15orTaCEPRLincreases primary root length and enhances drought tolerance in wheat. TaCEPRL interacts with and phosphorylates TaSnRK1α, leading to the degradation of TaSnRK1α. The presence of TaCEP15 intensifies the phosphorylation and degradation of TaSnRK1α. Consistently, overexpressingTaSnRK1α boosts primary root elongation and augments drought tolerance. In addition, we identify the transcription factor TabZIP9, which binds to theTaCEP15promoter and suppresses its transcription. A-to-T substitution in theTaCEP15promoter decreases the binding affinity of TabZIP9. As expected, transgenic plants withTabZIP9knockout or overexpression exhibit noteworthy changes in primary root length and drought tolerance. Our findings shed light on the importance of the peptide signaling pathway in regulating primary root length and responding to drought stress in wheat."

Previous global analyses described increased yield volatility from warming, but it has become increasingly clear that changes in water availability are also a key determinant of yields. Here, we provide the first global quantification of climate change impacts on maize, soybean, and sorghum yield variance due to changes in temperature and soil moisture. Pairing an empirical crop model with CMIP6 simulations indicates that changes in temperature and soil moisture increase interannual weather-induced yield variance by7to19%°Cacross crops. This increase is driven roughly equally by previously quantified increased temperature stress variance, as well as by increased covariance between temperature and soil moisture stresses. Results using a simple land surface model are consistent with those using CMIP6 simulations in indicating that this increased covariance is driven by warmer air more quickly drying soils and by dry soils promoting greater warming."

The order-disorder transition has been recognized as playing a critical role; however, the precise nature of the order parameter still remains under scrutiny, including the local dipole direction and the correlations above and below the Curie temperature. Using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, we directly map polar displacements in BaTiO3across the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, providing atomistic insights into an order-disorder mechanism. Atomic tracking reveals finite polar Ti displacements in the paraelectric phase where they manifest as random polar nanoregions. The displacements align along <111> direction in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition emerges from real-space correlations of the <111> polar Ti displacements. Our direct visualizations provide atomic insights into the order-disorder mechanism in the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition of BaTiO3."

Using in vitro and in silico single-molecule force spectroscopy, we demonstrate that calcium ions (Ca2+) are essential for the ultrastrong binding between the serine-aspartate repeat protein D (SdrD) adhesin and the human skin protein desmoglein-1 (DSG-1), withstanding forces exceeding 2 nanonewtons. Ca2+ions stabilize both the SdrD complex and the mechanically robust SdrD B-domains, which exhibit unprecedented folding strength. In the context of atopic dermatitis (AD), disrupted calcium gradients amplify SdrD interactions, which could potentially intensifyS. aureusvirulence. Furthermore, abnormal DSG-1 distribution on AD-affected skin enhances bacterial adhesion. These findings provide crucial insights into the calcium-dependent regulation of bacterial adhesion and folding, suggesting possible therapeutic targets to combatS. aureusinfections."

In theDrosophilacircadian clock network, the small ventral lateral neurons (sLNvs) serve as critical pacemakers. Peptidergic communication mediated by the neuropeptidePigment Dispersing Factor(PDF), released by sLNvs, has been well characterized. In contrast, little is known about the role of the synaptic connections that sLNvs form with downstream neurons. Connectomic analyses revealed that the sLNvs form strong synaptic connections with previously uncharacterized neurons called superior lateral protocerebrum 316 (SLP316). Here, we show that silencing the synaptic output from the SLP316 neurons via tetanus toxin expression shortened the free-running period, whereas hyperexciting them by expressing the bacterial voltage-gated sodium channel resulted in period lengthening. Under light-dark cycles, silencing SLP316 neurons caused lower daytime activity and higher daytime sleep. Our results reveal that the main postsynaptic partners of keyDrosophilapacemaker neurons are a nonclock neuronal cell type that regulates the timing of sleep and activity."

While direct diffusion-driven cell-to-cell exchanges are difficult to map, current nanotechnology enables one to probe single-cell exchanges with the medium. We introduce a mathematical method to reconstruct the dynamic unfolding of intercellular exchange networks from these data, applying it to an experimental coculture system. The exchange network, initially dense, progressively fragments into small disconnected clusters. To explain these dynamics, we develop a maximum-entropy multicellular metabolic model with diffusion-driven exchanges. The model predicts a transition from a dense network to a sparse one as nutrient consumption shifts. We characterize this crossover both numerically, revealing a power-law decay in the cluster-size distribution, and analytically, by connecting to percolation theory. Comparison with data suggests that populations evolve toward the sparse phase by remaining near the crossover. These findings offer insights into the collective organization driving the adaptive dynamics of cell populations."
