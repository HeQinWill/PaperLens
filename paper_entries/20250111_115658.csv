10.1088/1748-9326/ad98ab,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要关注森林在调节地气相互作用中的作用，特别是森林对地表温度日变化的影响。研究使用原位观测和模型模拟相结合的方法，探究了森林蒸腾作用、生物量热通量以及生物量热储存（BHS）对地表温度、感热通量和潜热通量的影响。虽然研究涉及到大气边界层高度，但这并非是通过大气环境遥感技术来观测的，而是通过单柱大气模式模拟得到的。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）的相关性较弱。,"['temperature', 'evapotranspiration', 'heat flux', 'boundary layer height', 'land-atmosphere interaction']",Yi-Shin Jang;Sean C Swenson;Jehn-Yih Juang;Cho-ying Huang;Min-Hui Lo,Roles of forests in moderating the diurnal cycle of land–atmosphere interactions,"Forests moderate the microclimate through evapotranspiration and biomass heat flux. However, understanding the contributions of dense forests remains challenging due to observational limitations. Our in-situ observations show that forests regulate the diurnal temperature range by approximately 2 °C compared to open fields. The Community Terrestrial System Model simulation reveal that latent heat and sensible heat fluxes are overestimated by around 10% during the daytime. The nighttime temperatures are underestimated when biomass heat storage (BHS) is excluded. Furthermore, the Single-Column Atmospheric Model indicates that the misestimated daytime heat flux leads to the slight overestimation of boundary layer height. Notably, BHS decreases daytime temperature by adjusting sensible heat flux through land–atmosphere interaction. The warming bias resulting from neglecting BHS reduces vegetation transpiration, further leading to an underestimation of daytime latent heat flux. Facing the threats of climate warming and deforestation, understanding BHS characteristics in models is pivotal for accurately representing land–atmosphere interactions."
10.1088/1748-9326/ad9ec7,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了美国社会弱势群体面临的多重环境风险，其中包括空气污染、水资源短缺、野火、洪水和水质恶化等。研究利用疾病控制中心提供的社会脆弱性指数数据和环境风险暴露数据，发现超过11%的人口（3700万人）面临多种环境风险的高风险。研究结果揭示了环境风险在社会弱势群体中的累积，构成了一种环境不公正现象。虽然全国范围内，社会经济弱势群体（例如低收入家庭和缺乏医疗保险的人群）不成比例地暴露于多种严重的环境风险中，但不同地区导致风险累积的人口统计和环境驱动因素的具体组合有所不同。该研究强调，降低多重环境风险可能需要采取综合性的方法，同时也需要针对具体情况采取干预措施。研究中涉及的空气污染监测数据可能来源于卫星观测或地面监测站，这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['air pollution', 'air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'environmental injustice', 'hazard exposure']",Leslie Sanchez;Paul R Armsworth;Jasmine E Bruno;Sebastian Espinoza;Kathleen Galvin;Varsha Vijay;Travis Warziniack,Multi-hazard risk in socially vulnerable communities across the United States,"Society’s most vulnerable communities bear the burdens of a multitude of environmental shocks and stressors, which are increasingly likely to occur simultaneously or in quick succession. However, our understanding of where environmental risks accumulate across the United States and how determinants of multi-hazard risk vary within the country remains incomplete. This study offers a more comprehensive understanding of the national scope and underlying drivers of compounding environmental risks from five hazards (water shortage, air pollution, wildfire, flooding, and impaired water quality) in socially vulnerable communities in the contiguous United States. By pairing census tract-level Social Vulnerability Index data from the Centers for Disease Control with hazard exposure data, we find that over 11 percent of the population—37 million people—is at high risk from multiple hazards. We find that multi-hazard risk disproportionately accumulates in the most vulnerable communities and therefore constitutes an environmental injustice. Nationally, socioeconomically vulnerable populations (e.g., low-income households and those lacking health insurance) are inequitably exposed to multiple severe hazards. However, the specific combinations of demographic and environmental drivers of risk accumulation vary across regions. While the widespread nature of environmental risk accumulation indicates that reducing multi-hazard risk will likely require comprehensive rather than piecemeal approaches, results also highlight the need for context-specific interventions."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada3e6,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了中国大陆地区极端小时降水与温度之间的关系及其在一天中不同时间段的变化。研究发现，大部分地区的小时极端降水强度随温度的增加而增长的速度超过了克劳修斯-克拉珀龙关系预测的速度，并且这种增长速度在一天中存在明显的周期性变化。研究利用了地面观测数据和再分析数据，时间跨度为39年。这项研究关注的是降水和温度之间的关系，以及气候变化对极端降水的影响，与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等关系不大。,"['precipitation', 'temperature', 'dew point', 'climate change', 'diurnal cycle', 'gauge observation', 'reanalysis data']",Miao Lei;Shanshan Wang;Jianping Huang;Zhiyang Wang;Xiaoping Li,Reassessing hourly precipitation–temperature scaling: the diurnal cycle in a warming China,"Hourly extreme precipitation is expected to intensify with global warming following a Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) relationship. While extensive research has investigated the relationship between hourly precipitation and temperature, inconsistencies in this relationship across the diurnal cycle affect all-hours scaling. This study uses hourly gauge observations and reanalysis data from mainland China to analyze the scaling and explore its diurnal cycle for the first time. Our results reveal that 88.7% of the stations exhibit super-CC scaling, which is significantly underestimated by reanalysis data. Notably, the scaling shows a pronounced diurnal cycle and exceeds all-hour scaling, indicating that the mix of precipitation from different hours ultimately affects the overall scaling results. Over a 39 year period, changes in extreme precipitation intensity were closely aligned with dew-point temperatures throughout the diurnal cycle in inland regions. The above results provide a valuable insight into the shift of extreme precipitation to morning/night in some regions under climate change."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada3e7,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇研究论文主要关注的是大西洋经向翻转环流 (AMOC) 弱化对欧洲热浪发生频率的影响。研究利用 EC-Earth3 气候模型的大型集合模拟，分析了 AMOC 弱化对北半球近地表气温、急流和大气阻塞事件的影响。结果表明，虽然 AMOC 弱化导致北大西洋地区整体降温，但同时也减弱了高纬度地区的温度梯度，从而减缓急流速度，增加乌拉尔地区大气阻塞事件的频率，最终导致东欧地区热浪频率增加。该研究强调了海洋环流在塑造天气模式，特别是极端天气事件（如热浪）中的重要作用，但与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等关系不大。,"['Atmospheric blocking', 'Jet stream', 'Heatwaves', 'Climate modeling', 'Meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)']",Virna L Meccia;Claudia Simolo;Katinka Bellomo;Susanna Corti,The impact of a weakened AMOC on European heatwaves,"In our changing climate we expect an increase in the frequency of heatwaves, which are extreme events that can have severe consequences for human health, ecosystems, and economies. In this study, we examine how the weakening of the atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC) may influence the occurrence of extreme warm events in Europe. Our analysis is based on a series of numerical experiments conducted using the EC-Earth3 climate model, which includes three ensembles of 20 Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project-like members. The large ensemble size makes these simulations well-suited to studying rare extreme events. Our findings reveal that during boreal summer, the Northern hemisphere (NH) experiences overall mean cooling, most pronounced in the North Atlantic region. Therefore, the extreme warm events in Europe identified by using a fixed threshold tend to be less frequent. However, the cooling pattern reduces the meridional gradient of near-surface air temperature at high latitudes of the NH. As a result, the speed of the summer jet stream decreases, while the frequency of Ural atmospheric blocking events increases. Atmospheric blocking in summer is closely linked to heatwaves, primarily through subsidence warming and enhanced downward shortwave radiation under clear sky conditions. Consequently, the weakening of the AMOC leads to an increased frequency of heatwaves in Eastern Europe, the only region that presents this opposite trend. This study highlights the significant role that three-dimensional ocean circulation plays in shaping weather patterns, including extreme events such as heatwaves in Europe. These findings have important implications for future climate projections, as the AMOC is expected to weaken by the end of this century. Thus, as the Earth continues to warm, we may face an increased risk of heatwaves due to the combined effects of global warming and a weakening AMOC."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada45a,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究的是企业在计算其范围2排放量时，使用可再生能源证书（RECs）的合规性问题。它关注的是企业报告的碳减排量是否真实可靠，以及更严格的会计规则会如何影响企业的减排目标进展。研究方法是通过调整206家公司的市场化范围2排放数据，模拟三种更严格的会计限制条件（地理位置接近性、设施使用年限和电力购买协议）对企业碳减排目标的影响。结果表明，更严格的会计规则会降低企业报告的减排量，并导致更多企业无法实现其气候目标。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，并没有直接关系。,[],Anders Bjørn;Jens Friis Lund;Matthew Brander,Up to half of companies would be behind on their climate targets under stricter scope 2 accounting rules,"Companies have been accused of overstating their scope 2 emission reductions through purchases of ineffective renewable energy certificates (RECs). Therefore, several actors have proposed stricter accounting rules targeting additionality and deliverability. In this paper we explore how such restrictions would quantitatively affect the scope 2 emissions and target progress reported by companies. We consider three accounting restrictions: geographical proximity, facility age, and power purchase agreement. The study involves adjusting the market-based scope 2 emissions reported by 206 companies based on the portion of their purchased RECs that would become invalid under the proposed accounting restrictions. We find that the sample companies have more than doubled their purchases of RECs between their base year (typically 2019) and 2022, including an increase in RECs that would be invalid under the proposed accounting restrictions. The introduction of all three accounting restrictions would entail that the combined scope 2 emission reduction reported by the sample companies falls from 21% to 17%. Similarly, the share of sample companies that were behind on their climate target in 2022 would increase from 28% to 50% under all three accounting restrictions. However, a small subset of the company sample has over time replaced potentially invalid RECs with valid RECs, and the accounting restrictions would lead to improved target performance for these companies. Our findings can inform the revision of the greenhouse gas protocol and emerging accounting standards around renewable fuels."
10.1088/1748-9326/ada45b,False,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文主要研究的是地面安装式太阳能电池板对温带农业生态系统中植物和土壤性质的影响。研究人员在英格兰和威尔士的32个太阳能农场进行了采样，比较了太阳能电池板下、电池板间隙以及邻近的牧场（对照组）的植物覆盖度、地上生物量、土壤养分和理化性质等指标。结果表明，太阳能电池板下植物生长受到抑制，土壤理化性质也发生了一定程度的变化。这与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，并没有直接关系。研究关注的是太阳能农场对当地生态系统的影响，而非大气环境本身。,[],Fabio Carvalho;Hannah Montag;Laura Bentley;Radim Šarlej;Rosanne C Broyd;Hollie Blaydes;Marta Cattin;Miranda Burke;Abby Wallwork;Sammani Ramanayaka;Piran C L White;Stuart P Sharp;Tom Clarkson;Alona Armstrong,Plant and soil responses to ground-mounted solar panels in temperate agricultural systems,"In the move to decarbonise energy supplies to meet Net Zero targets, ground-mounted solar farms have proliferated around the world, with uncertain implications for hosting ecosystems. We provide some of the first evidence on the effects of ground-mounted solar panels on plant and soil properties in temperate agricultural systems. We sampled 32 solar farms in England and Wales in summer 2021. Plant cover and aboveground biomass, as well as soil nutrients and physiochemical properties, were quantified on land underneath solar panels, in the gaps between rows of solar arrays, and in control land (pasture) adjacent to three solar farms. Plant cover and aboveground biomass were significantly lower under solar panels than in the gaps between solar arrays and in pastures. Soil compaction was 14.4% and 15.5% higher underneath solar panels than in gaps and pastures, respectively. Soil organic carbon was 9% lower under solar panels than in gaps, while particulate organic matter was 29.1% and 23.6% lower under solar panels than in gaps and pastures, respectively. Soil mineral nitrogen was 30.5% higher under solar panels than in gaps, while soil (plant-available) phosphorus was approximately 60% higher in solar farm soils than in pasture soils. Reductions in solar radiation and changes to microclimate caused by solar panels may be driving lower plant productivity and growth, with consequences for nutrient cycling and soil properties. However, impacts must be considered in light of the previous land use and the total land area under solar panels, in the gaps between solar arrays, and around the margins of the solar farm. Our findings can inform solar farm design and management options (e.g. increase the proportion of land unaffected by solar panels, enhance plant cover under solar panels) to ensure the long-term provision of ecosystem services (e.g. soil carbon storage) within this fast-growing land use."

10.1088/1748-9326/ada4c3,True,Environmental Research Letters,这篇论文研究了不同类型干旱（一般干旱和复合干旱高温事件）对全球植被恢复时间的影响。利用1982年至2016年的数据，研究发现复合干旱高温事件后植被恢复时间显著长于一般干旱。这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为研究中植被绿度恢复时间的监测很可能依赖于卫星遥感数据，例如利用NDVI等植被指数来评估植被状况，并结合气象数据分析干旱和高温事件的影响。因此，这项研究使用了遥感技术来监测和分析植被对干旱的响应，这与大气环境遥感技术，特别是利用卫星观测进行地表植被监测和分析密切相关。,"['Vegetation greenness', 'Satellite observations', 'Remote sensing', 'NDVI', 'Drought monitoring', 'Land surface temperature', 'Terrestrial carbon dynamics']",Mengtian Huang;Panmao Zhai,Protracted vegetation recovery after compound drought and hot extreme compared to general drought,"Recovery time is critical for accurate assessment of drought impacts on vegetation growth and terrestrial carbon dynamics. However, the dominant factors driving the spatiotemporal variation of recovery time are still poorly understood; hardly any research has focused on the comparison of recovery time between general drought and compound dry-hot events. This study examined recovery time of vegetation greenness post different drought types during 1982–2016 and attempted to identify the predominant factors determining vegetation recovery time over the globe. Our findings demonstrated protracted recovery of vegetation greenness after compound drought and hot extreme (CDHE) event compared to general drought in 68% of global vegetated area. Deciduous broadleaved forest exhibited the most remarkable difference between recovery time post CDHE (13.8 ± 5.6 months) and post general drought (9.3 ± 4.7 months). We also revealed that post-event moisture condition and long-term precipitation were the chief impact factors of drought recovery time."

IASI retrievals underestimate CO, with stronger bias in the middle to upper troposphere for SOFRID and in the lower troposphere for FORLI. 
 IASI-A, IASI-B and IASI-C (Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer) are nadir-looking thermal-infrared sensors which have monitored the atmospheric composition since 2008. Atmospheric carbon monoxide (CO) is retrieved from IASI radiances with two algorithms: the SOftware for a Fast Retrieval of IASI Data (SOFRID) and Fast Optimal Retrievals on Layers for IASI (FORLI). Airborne in situ observations from the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) European research infrastructure have been used to validate IASI CO retrievals. The validation study of IASI CO data performed in 2011 with IAGOS data was limited to two airports (Frankfurt and Windhoek) and 2 years because of the limited sampling at the other IAGOS sites. The extension of the IAGOS infrastructure during the last decade has enabled validation with enough temporal sampling at 33 airports worldwide over the whole IASI-A period (2008–2019).The retrievals provide between 1.5 and 3 independent pieces of information about the CO vertical profile, and we have chosen to validate the surface–600 hPa and 600–200 hPa partial columns in addition to the total column. The ability of the retrievals to capture the CO variabilities is slightly different for the two retrieval algorithms. The correlation coefficients for the time series are generally larger for SOFRID, especially for the total and lower-tropospheric columns, meaning a better representation of the phase of the variability, while the amplitudes of the variations of FORLI are in better agreement with IAGOS in the middle to upper troposphere.On average, SOFRID and FORLI retrievals underestimate the IAGOS total column of CO (TCC) by 8 ± 16 % and 6 ± 14 %, respectively. This global TCC agreement between the algorithms hides significant vertical and geographical differences. In the lower troposphere (surface–600 hPa), the bias is larger for FORLI (−11 ± 27 %) than for SOFRID (−4 ± 24 %). In the middle to upper troposphere, the situation is reversed, with biases of −6 ± 15 % for FORLI and −11 ± 13 % for SOFRID. The largest differences between the retrievals are detected south of 13.5° S (latitude of Bangkok), where SOFRID underestimation is systematically larger for the TCC and the mid- to upper-tropospheric column. North of 40° N (latitude of Philadelphia), FORLI biases are significantly larger than SOFRID ones for the TCC and the lower-tropospheric columns. Our validation results provide users with an overview of the quality of IASI CO retrievals and developers with insights into improving the retrievals in the future."

We apply a deep-learning framework to multi-spectral Landsat imagery to create a calving front record for 42 key outlet glaciers of the Antarctic Peninsula Ice Sheet. The resulting data product includes 4817 calving front locations from 2013 to 2023 and achieves sub-seasonal temporal resolution. 
 Calving front positions of marine-terminating glaciers are an essential parameter for understanding dynamic glacier changes and constraining ice modelling. In particular, for the Antarctic Peninsula, where the current ice mass loss is driven by dynamic glacier changes, accurate and comprehensive data products are of major importance. Current calving front data products are limited in coverage and temporal resolution because they rely on manual delineation, which is time-consuming and unfeasible for the increasing amount of satellite data. To simplify the mapping of calving fronts, we apply a deep-learning-based processing system designed to automatically delineate glacier fronts from multi-spectral Landsat imagery. The U-Net-based framework was initially trained on 869 Greenland glacier front positions. For this study, we extended the training data by 252 front positions of the Antarctic Peninsula. The data product presented here includes 4817 calving front locations of 42 key outlet glaciers from 2013 to 2023 and achieves a sub-seasonal temporal resolution. The mean difference between automated and manual extraction is estimated at 59.3±5.9 m.

 We report on the first multi-year kilometre-scale global coupled simulations using ECMWF's Integrated Forecasting System (IFS) coupled to both the NEMO and FESOM ocean–sea ice models, as part of the H2020 Next Generation Earth Modelling Systems (nextGEMS) project. We focus mainly on an unprecedented IFS-FESOM coupled setup, with an atmospheric resolution of 4.4 km and a spatially varying ocean resolution that reaches locally below 5 km grid spacing. A shorter coupled IFS-FESOM simulation with an atmospheric resolution of 2.8 km has also been performed. A number of shortcomings in the original numerical weather prediction (NWP)-focused model configurations were identified and mitigated over several cycles collaboratively by the modelling centres, academia, and the wider nextGEMS community. The main improvements are (i) better conservation properties of the coupled model system in terms of water and energy budgets, which also benefit ECMWF's operational 9 km IFS-NEMO model; (ii) a realistic top-of-the-atmosphere (TOA) radiation balance throughout the year; (iii) improved intense precipitation characteristics; and (iv) eddy-resolving features in large parts of the mid- and high-latitude oceans (finer than 5 km grid spacing) to resolve mesoscale eddies and sea ice leads. New developments at ECMWF for a better representation of snow and land use, including a dedicated scheme for urban areas, were also tested on multi-year timescales. We provide first examples of significant advances in the realism and thus opportunities of these kilometre-scale simulations, such as a clear imprint of resolved Arctic sea ice leads on atmospheric temperature, impacts of kilometre-scale urban areas on the diurnal temperature cycle in cities, and better propagation and symmetry characteristics of the Madden–Julian Oscillation."

Two alternative NZ scenarios, the balanced net zero (BNZP) and widespread innovation (WI) pathways, from the UK Climate Change Committee’s Sixth Carbon Budget, were examined using a chemical transport model (CTM). Under the UK existing policy, Business as Usual (BAU), reductions in NO2 and PM were predicted by 2030 due to new vehicle technologies but plateau by 2040. The BNZP and WI scenarios show further reductions particularly by 2040, driven by accelerated electric vehicle (EV) uptake and low-carbon heating in buildings, with the building contribution to PM reduction being 2–3 times greater than road transport. The results demonstrate that the NZ transition to EVs (cars and vans) reduces both exhaust and nonexhaust emissions, as well as reducing traffic volumes. O3 trends are complex with a small overall increase by 2030 and a decrease by 2040. Although uncertain, 2050 predictions of BNZP showed important additional air pollution benefits. Our findings highlight the efficacy of NZ strategies, providing insights for UK and international policymakers interested in the air pollution cobenefits of climate policy."

The NO2/NOx ratios are crucial for accurate NO2 modeling and are closely linked to public health concerns. In 2020, we used a mobile platform to follow test trucks (plume-chasing) that were installed with a portable emission measuring system (PEMS) on two restricted driving tracts. Six hundred eighteen exhaust plumes were collected through the PEMS-chasing measurements from seven trucks. The NOx emission factors (EFs), and the NO2/NOx ratios, were calculated at distinct stages (i.e., tailpipe and on-road). A significant reduction in NOx EFs (>64%) was observed with normal operating after-treatment devices, except for trucks equipped with diesel particulate filter (DPF). Disparities in tailpipe NO2/NOx ratios were also found, attributed to the after-treatment technologies. The NO2/NOx ratios measured from plume-chasing were significantly higher (3–4 times, p < 0.001) than the tailpipe measurements, providing field evidence of substantial NO2 formation in exhaust plumes. We developed a quantitative relationship between NO2/NOx ratios from tailpipe and plume-chasing measurements and demonstrated a robust correlation (R2 > 0.90). Since the NO2 formation in the exhaust plume is not explicitly accounted for in NO2 modeling, the quantitative relationship (O3–NO2/NOx) could improve the estimation of NO2 exposure when local emission inventory (tailpipe emissions) is available."

One understudied source is from the photochemical reactions of aromatic compounds containing −CF3 moieties (aryl-CF3) including many pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals. Here, we studied the aqueous photochemistry of 4-(trifluoromethyl)phenol (4-TFMP), a known transformation product of the pharmaceutical fluoxetine. When exposed to lamps centered at UV-B, 4-TFMP formed up to 9.2% TFA at a steady state under acidic conditions and 1.3% under alkaline conditions. TFA yields of fluoxetine were similar to 4-TFMP for acidic and neutral pH, but higher at alkaline pH, suggesting that fluoxetine may have a mechanism of TFA formation in addition to via the 4-TFMP intermediate. Use of an 13CF3 isotopologue of 4-TFMP allowed for the tracking of TFA formation, which formed via multiple oxidative additions prior to oxidative ring cleavage. The oxidation is mediated by reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated through self-sensitized photolysis, with singlet oxygen and hydroxyl radicals as the key ROS. In addition to the TFA formation mechanism, other photochemical reactions of 4-TFMP resulted in defluorination and dimerization. Overall, this work expands our understanding of how TFA forms from aryl-CF3 compounds to better understand the total global burden of TFA."

Patra;Sagnik Dey,"Regional Trends and Spatial Gradients of Total Column Methane over India, China, and USA─Implications for Emissions from Coal Mining and Oil/Gas Exploitation","Observation-based verification of regional/national methane (CH4) emission trends is crucial for transparent monitoring and mitigation strategy planning. Although surface observations track the global and sub-hemispheric emission trends well, their sparse spatial coverage limits our ability to assess regional trends. Dense satellite observations complement surface observations, offering a valuable means to validate emission trends, especially in regions where emissions changes are substantial but debated. The uncertainty surrounding the rate of increase in fugitive coal mine emissions in China and emissions from unconventional oil and natural gas (ONG) exploration in the United States underscores the need for rigorous validation. Here, we examine the time evolution of total column dry-air mole fractions of CH4 (XCH4) during 2010–2020 by comparing observations from the GOSAT satellite with simulations from an atmospheric chemistry-transport model (ACTM). This study analyzes emissions and XCH4 trends in global totals and regions of India, China, the USA, and the global tropics. Our results suggest that GAINSv4 emission inventory overestimates the emission increase rate for the unconventional ONG sector of USA by about 3 times, while EDGARv6 inventory overestimates coal mine emissions in China. Emission increases in China and India agree with those estimated by GAINSv4. Analysis of spatially integrated XCH4 statistics (mean, 1-σ standard deviation) reveals a slight systematic underestimation of total emissions in China and bias (in both directions) in different parts of USA. Our results suggest that long-term satellite observations and ACTM simulations can effectively validate emission inventories for CH4 emissions and emission trends regionally."

Here, we resolved the molecular signatures of DOM oxidized by •OH/O3 using FT-ICR MS, thereby elucidating their oxidizability and resistance in concentrated leachates. The comprehensive gradual fragmentation of complex leachate DOM was then revealed through a modified machine-learning framework based on 43 key pathways during ozonation. Specifically, humic substances like humic acid (HA) and fulvic acid (FA) were measured to be the dominant DOM fractions in concentrated leachates, accounting for 35.9–51.7% of the total organic carbon, which was consistent with the observation by three-dimensional fluorescence spectroscopy. According to FT-ICR MS, carboxyl-rich alicyclic molecules (CRAMs) or lignin-like substances were the most abundant components, comprising 40.2–54.5% of all substances. The machine learning modeling showed that molecular weight was the most important structural factor for DOM resistance to •OH and O3 degradation (SHAP value 0.84), followed by (DBE-O)/C (0.32), S/C (0.31), and H/C (0.08). During •OH  and O3  attacking, unsaturated and reduced compounds were the dominant precursors. For the molecular transformation of CRAMs-DOM, oxygen addition reactions were found to be the predominant O3-attacking process, along with the dealkyl and carboxylic acid reactions during •OH oxidation that often resulted in more complete degradation of DOM. This study proposed a new framework integrating molecular signatures and machine learning for unraveling DOM’s inherent reactivity in complexity, which informs strategies for managing concentrated leachates."

Here, we present our observations of 236U and 233U in the western North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPStG), showing the presence of a source of anthropogenic U featured by a low 233U/236U ratio (∼1 × 10–3), which is an order of magnitude lower than the global fallout signature (∼2 × 10–2). The analyses of soil from the tropical Pacific atolls confirmed that this anthropogenic U originates from thermonuclear weapon tests conducted at the Pacific Proving Grounds (PPG). We further estimated that PPG tests released at least 50 kg of 236U and 48 g of 233U into the Equatorial North Pacific Ocean in the mid-to-late 1950s. After 70 years of redistribution, the PPG-derived U has become the predominant contributor (∼70%) to the 236U inventory in the western NPStG.

Talat Odman,The Trade-offs between Wildfires and Prescribed Fires: A Case Study for 2016 Gatlinburg Wildfires,"Prescribed burning is an effective land management tool that provides a range of benefits, including ecosystem restoration and wildfire risk reduction. However, prescribed fires, just like wildfires, introduce smoke that degrades air quality. Furthermore, while prescribed fires help manage wildfire risk, they do not eliminate the possibility of wildfires. It is therefore important to also evaluate fire and smoke impacts from wildfires that may occur after a prescribed burn. In this study, we developed a framework for understanding the air quality and health related trade-offs between wildfires and prescribed fires by simulating a set of counterfactual scenarios including wildfires, prescribed fires, and postprescribed burn wildfires. We applied this framework to the case of the Gatlinburg wildfire and found that emissions from prescribed burns and subsequent wildfire were slightly lower than those from the wildfire itself. This reduction resulted in lower daily average concentrations and exposures of PM2.5, O3, and NO2. Even considering the possibility of a postprescribed burn wildfire, prescribed fires reduced population-weighted daily average PM2.5, daily maximum 8-h average O3, and 1-h maximum NO2 concentrations. In Sevier County, Tennessee where the wildfire occurred, these reductions reached 5.28 μg/m3, 0.18 ppb, and 1.68 ppb, respectively. The prescribed fires also reduced the person-days smoke exposures from the wildfire. Our results suggest that although prescribed fires cannot eliminate the air quality impacts of wildfires, they can greatly reduce smoke exposure in downwind areas distant from the burn sites."

P‐wave attenuation (Q−1 ${Q}^{-1}$) was found to be weakly proportional to amplitude (A $A$) in both areas, following the relationship, Q−1∝An ${Q}^{-1}\mathit{\propto }{A}^{n}$. Quantitative analysis reveals that amplitude‐dependent attenuation is more pronounced in the uppermost mantle (n ∼ 0.16) than in the crust (n ∼ 0.05). This depth‐dependent behavior of attenuation may be attributed to increasing temperature and pressure, which enhance dislocation density and mobility.

Improving typhoon precipitation forecast with convection‐permitting models remains challenging. This study investigates the influence of cumulus parameterizations and turbulence models, including the Reconstruction and Nonlinear Anisotropy (RNA) turbulence scheme, on precipitation prediction in multiple typhoon cases. Incorporating the cumulus and RNA schemes increases domain‐averaged precipitation, improves recall scores, and lowers relative error across various precipitation thresholds, which is substantial in three out of four studied typhoon cases. Applying appropriate cumulus parameterization schemes alone also contributes to enhancing heavy precipitation forecasts. In Typhoon Hato, the RNA and Grell‐3 schemes demonstrated a doubled recall rate for extreme rainfall compared to simulations without any cumulus scheme. The improved forecasting ability is attributed to the RNA's capacity to model dissipation and backscatter. The RNA scheme can dynamically reinforce typhoon circulation with upgradient momentum transport in the lower troposphere and enhance the buoyancy by favorable heat flux distribution, which is conducive to developing heavy precipitation."

 How novel structures emerge during evolution has long fascinated biologists. A dramatic example is how the diminutive bones of the mammalian middle ear arose from ancestral fish jawbones1. In contrast, the evolutionary origin of the outer ear, another mammalian innovation, remains a mystery, in part because it is supported by non-mineralized elastic cartilage rarely recovered in fossils. Whether the outer ear arose de novo or through reuse of ancestral developmental programs is unknown. Here we show that the outer ear shares gene regulatory programs with the gills of fishes and amphibians for both its initial outgrowth and later development of elastic cartilage. Comparative single-nuclei multiomics of the human outer ear and zebrafish gills reveals conserved gene expression and putative enhancers enriched for common transcription factor binding motifs. This is reflected by transgenic activity of human outer ear enhancers in gills, and fish gill enhancers in the outer ear. Further, single-cell multiomics of the cartilaginous book gills of horseshoe crabs reveal a shared DLX-mediated gill program with vertebrates, with a book gill distalless enhancer driving expression in zebrafish gills. We propose that elements of an invertebrate gill program were reutilized in vertebrates to generate first gills and then the outer ear."

 Forecasting the onset, evolution and end of volcanic eruptions relies on interpretation of monitoring data—particularly seismic signals, such as persistent volcanic tremor—in relation to causative magmatic processes. Petrology helps establish such links retrospectively but typically lacks the required temporal resolution to directly relate to geophysical data. Here we report major and volatile element compositions of glass from volcanic ash continuously sampled throughout the 2021 Tajogaite eruption of Cumbre Vieja volcano, La Palma, Canary Islands. The data reveal the evolving chemistry of melts supplied from depth at a daily temporal resolution. Erupted melt compositions become progressively more primitive until the tenth week of activity, but a sharp reversal of this trend then marks the decline of mantle magma supply and a precursory signal to the eruption end. We find that melt SiO2 content is positively correlated with the amplitude of narrow-band volcanic tremor. Tremor characteristics, inferences from simulations and model calculations point to melt viscosity-controlled degassing dynamics generating variations in tremor amplitude. Our results show promise for a monitoring and forecasting tool capable of quickly identifying rejuvenated and waning phases of volcanic eruptions and illustrate how subtle changes in melt composition may translate to large shifts in geophysical signals.

Here, the authors report (RuIr)O2 electrocatalysts with enhanced performance, achieved by tuning the growth of Ru/Ir on lattice-modulated templates. 
 The success of proton exchange membrane water electrolysis (PEMWE) depends on active and robust electrocatalysts to facilitate oxygen evolution reaction (OER). Heteroatom-doped-RuOx has emerged as a promising electrocatalysts because heteroatoms suppress lattice oxygen participation in the OER, thereby preventing the destabilization of surface Ru and catalyst degradation. However, identifying suitable heteroatoms and achieving their atomic-scale coupling with Ru atoms are nontrivial tasks. Herein, to steer the reaction pathway away from the involvement of lattice oxygen, we integrate OER-active Ir atoms into the RuO2 matrix, which maximizes the synergy between stable Ru and active Ir centers, by leveraging the changeable growth behavior of Ru/Ir atoms on lattice parameter-modulated templates. In PEMWE, the resulting (RuIr)O2/C electrocatalysts demonstrate notable current density of 4.96 A cm−2 and mass activity of 19.84 A mgRu+Ir−1 at 2.0 V. In situ spectroscopic analysis and computational calculations highlight the importance of the synergistic coexistence of Ru/Ir-dual-OER-active sites for mitigating Ru dissolution via the optimization of the binding energy with oxygen intermediates and stabilization of Ru sites.

 Coherent Raman scattering spectroscopies have been established as a powerful tool for investigating molecular systems with high chemical specificity. The existing coherent Raman scattering techniques detect only Raman active modes, which are a part of the whole molecular vibrations. Here, we report the first observation of coherent anti-Stokes hyper-Raman scattering (CAHRS) spectroscopy, which allows measuring hyper-Raman active vibrations at high speed. The CAHRS process relies on a fifth-order nonlinear process that combines hyper-Raman scattering with coherent Raman scattering. Observed signals are proven to come from the CAHRS process through various experiments concerning the dependences of the signals on incident laser powers, time-delay, polarizations, and selection rules of molecular vibrations. Comparisons of CAHRS signals with spontaneous hyper-Raman signals from para-nitroaniline solutions and benzene liquid manifest much higher signal-to-noise ratios of CAHRS signals than spontaneous hyper-Raman signals. This study illustrates that CAHRS spectroscopy can offer additional information on molecular vibrations unobtainable from the present coherent Raman techniques at a much higher speed than spontaneous hyper-Raman spectroscopy.

Here, the authors uncover how convolutional networks leverage local, data-dependent kernel renormalization, enabling feature learning to absent in fully connected architectures. 
 Empirical evidence shows that fully-connected neural networks in the infinite-width limit (lazy training) eventually outperform their finite-width counterparts in most computer vision tasks; on the other hand, modern architectures with convolutional layers often achieve optimal performances in the finite-width regime. In this work, we present a theoretical framework that provides a rationale for these differences in one-hidden-layer networks; we derive an effective action in the so-called proportional limit for an architecture with one convolutional hidden layer and compare it with the result available for fully-connected networks. Remarkably, we identify a completely different form of kernel renormalization: whereas the kernel of the fully-connected architecture is just globally renormalized by a single scalar parameter, the convolutional kernel undergoes a local renormalization, meaning that the network can select the local components that will contribute to the final prediction in a data-dependent way. This finding highlights a simple mechanism for feature learning that can take place in overparametrized shallow convolutional neural networks, but not in shallow fully-connected architectures or in locally connected neural networks without weight sharing. Fully connected neural networks in the infinite-width limit often outperform finite-width models, while convolutional networks excel at finite widths.

 The realization of room-temperature-operated, high-performance, miniaturized, low-power-consumption and Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS)-compatible mid-infrared photodetectors is highly desirable for next-generation optoelectronic applications, but has thus far remained an outstanding challenge using conventional materials. Two-dimensional (2D) heterostructures provide an alternative path toward this goal, yet despite continued efforts, their performance has not matched that of low-temperature HgCdTe photodetectors. Here, we push the detectivity and response speed of a 2D heterostructure-based mid-infrared photodetector to be comparable to, and even superior to, commercial cooled HgCdTe photodetectors by utilizing a vertical transport channel (graphene/black phosphorus/molybdenum disulfide/graphene). The minimized carrier transit path of tens of nanometers facilitates efficient and fast carrier transport, leading to significantly improved performance, with a mid-infrared detectivity reaching 2.38 × 1011 cmHz1/2W−1 (approaching the theoretical limit), a fast response time of 10.4 ns at 1550 nm, and an ultrabroadband detection range spanning from the ultraviolet to mid-infrared wavelengths.

Pax coordinates the Hippo and Notch pathways to control the proliferation and differentiation of intestinal stem cells (ISCs), ensuring homeostasis of midgut. 
 Balanced self-renewal and differentiation of stem cells are crucial for maintaining tissue homeostasis, but the underlying mechanisms of this process remain poorly understood. Here, from an RNA interference (RNAi) screen in adult Drosophila intestinal stem cells (ISCs), we identify a factor, Pax, which is orthologous to mammalian PXN, coordinates the proliferation and differentiation of ISCs during both normal homeostasis and injury-induced midgut regeneration in Drosophila. Loss of Pax promotes ISC proliferation while suppressing its differentiation into absorptive enterocytes (ECs). Mechanistically, our findings demonstrate that Pax is a conserved target gene of the Hippo signaling pathway in both Drosophila and mammals. Subsequent investigations have revealed Pax interacts with Yki and enhances its cytoplasmic localization, thereby establishing a feedback regulatory mechanism that attenuates Yki activity and ultimately inhibits ISCs proliferation. Additionally, Pax induces the differentiation of ISCs into ECs by activating Notch expression, thus facilitating the differentiation process. Overall, our study highlights Pax as a pivotal component of the Hippo and Notch pathways in regulating midgut homeostasis, shedding light on this growth-related pathway in tissue maintenance and intestinal function.

 Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) poses significant risks for solid organ transplant recipients, who have atypical but poorly characterized immune responses to infection. We aim to understand the host immunologic and microbial features of COVID-19 in transplant recipients by leveraging a prospective multicenter cohort of 86 transplant recipients age- and sex-matched with 172 non-transplant controls. We find that transplant recipients have higher nasal SARS-CoV-2 viral abundance and impaired viral clearance, and lower anti-spike IgG levels. In addition, transplant recipients exhibit decreased plasmablasts and transitional B cells, and increased senescent T cells. Blood and nasal transcriptional profiling demonstrate unexpected upregulation of innate immune signaling pathways and increased levels of several proinflammatory serum chemokines. Severe disease in transplant recipients, however, is characterized by a less robust induction of pro-inflammatory genes and chemokines. Together, our study reveals distinct immune features and altered viral dynamics in solid organ transplant recipients.

These effects can be retained for extended periods within large oceanic eddies with long lifespans. 
 The Gulf Stream region (GSR) represents an area of robust oceanic eddies, active hurricanes, and more importantly, frequent encounters between the two phenomena. However, the direct impact of the intense storms on the eddy field has seldom been comprehensively examined. Here based on a multi-year analysis of eddy energy changing rate, we demonstrate that hurricanes enhance cyclonic eddies but weaken anticyclonic ones by injecting potential vorticity into the ocean. Such effects are not only pronounced immediately following hurricane-eddy encounters, but also retained for extended periods within large eddies that have long lifespans. Consequently, the variation of the annual mean energy and vorticity of the eddy field exhibits a high correlation with hurricane intensity. It can thus be argued that hurricanes over the GSR play an important role in driving the long-term variation of the underlying eddy field, thereby affecting ocean circulation and climate. This study shows that hurricanes in the Gulf Stream region enhance cyclonic eddies but weaken anticyclonic ones by injecting potential vorticity into the ocean.

 Nutrient recycling by marine megafauna is a key ecosystem service that has been disturbed by anthropogenic activity. While some hypotheses attribute Southern Ocean ecosystem restructuring to disruptions in micronutrient cycling after the elimination of two million great whales, there is little knowledge of trace metal lability in whale excrement. Here we measured high concentrations of dissolved iron and copper in five baleen whale fecal samples and characterized micromolar levels of organic metal-binding ligands as a proxy for their availability. The iron-ligand pool consisted of weakly-binding ligands and intermediate-binding ligands which enhanced iron stability and potential bioavailability. In comparison, 47 novel strongly-binding metallophores dominated copper-binding, curtailing its potential toxicity. These results illustrate how marine megafauna transform prey biomass into highly-labile micronutrients that they inject directly into the surface ocean, a mechanism whaling reduced by over 90%. Thus, the rapid restructuring of pelagic ecosystems through overharvesting may cause large biogeochemical feedbacks, altering primary productivity and carbon sequestration processes in the ocean. Whales transform prey biomass into labile micronutrients and inject them directly into the surface ocean, according to chemical analyses of whale excrement samples from the Southern Ocean."

 Vegetation cover regulates the exchanges of energy, water and carbon between land and atmosphere. Remotely-sensed fractional absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR), a land-surface greenness measure, depends on carbon allocation to foliage while also controlling photon flux for photosynthesis. Here we use an equation with just two globally fitted parameters to describe annual maximum fAPAR as the smaller of a water-limited value transpiring a constant fraction of annual precipitation, and an energy-limited value maximizing annual plant growth. This minimalist description reproduces global greenness patterns and temporal trends in remote-sensing data, comparable to the best-performing dynamic global vegetation models. Widely observed greening is attributed principally to the influence of rising carbon dioxide on the light- and water-use efficiencies of photosynthesis; limited browning regions are attributed to drying. This research provides one key component of ecosystem function as a step towards more robust foundations for new-generation land ecosystem models. Annual maximum fractional absorbed photosynthetically active radiation, described as smaller of a water-limited value and an energy-limited value, reproduces global spatial and temporal greenness patterns among remote-sensing products, according to simulation of light use efficiency model."

 Croplands are essential for food security but also impact the environment, biodiversity, and climate. Understanding, monitoring, modeling, and managing these impacts require accurate, comprehensive information on cropland vegetation cover.This study aimed to continuously monitor the state and vegetative processes of cropland, focusing on the assessment of bare soil and its cover with photosynthetic vegetation (PV) and non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV) at the national level. We employed regression-based unmixing techniques using time series of Sentinel-2 and Landsat imagery to quantify cover fractions of NPV, PV, and soil during the agricultural growing season. Our approach extends existing spectral unmixing methods by incorporating a novel soil-specific unmixing process based on a soil reflectance composite. The extension accounts for variations in the spectral characteristics of soils which is particularly relevant for large-scale monitoring of annually cultivated croplands, as the spectral soil properties can vary considerably at national level and periods of bare soil are frequent.All cover fractions were predicted with mean absolute errors between 0.13 and 0.19. Introducing soil-specific unmixing reduced the mean absolute error of the predictions for soil by 11.3 % and NPV by 15.1 % without compromising PV predictions, particularly benefiting areas with bright soils. These findings demonstrate the efficacy of our method in accurately predicting crop cover throughout the cultivation period and underline the added value of incorporating the soil adjustment into the unmixing workflow.The contributions of this research are twofold: first, it provides essential data for the continuous monitoring of cropland cover, supporting agricultural carbon cycle and soil erosion modeling. Second, it enables further investigation into cropland management practices, such as cover cropping and tillage, through time series analysis techniques. This work underscores the potential of advanced spectral unmixing methods for enhancing agricultural monitoring and management strategies."

Focusing on the Beijing Winter Olympics in February 2022, this study examines the effects of both ground-level and vertical meteorological conditions on PM2.5 concentration distributions. The simulation accuracy of the model was validated, and its performance was analyzed. Results revealed that the ensemble mean simulations exhibit high correlation coefficients with observations for temperature (0.95), wind speed (0.80), relative humidity (0.83), and pressure (0.99). Both the control forecast and the ensemble mean for PM2.5 concentration aligned well with observations, with the ensemble mean demonstrating a strong correlation between the root mean square error and ensemble spread. In terms of reducing the false alarm rate (FAR) and improving the Bias Score (BS), the ensemble mean outperformed the control forecast. The control forecast for PM2.5 concentration was found to be more accurate at and around pollutant concentration inflection points, which may be attributed to simulation deviations in temperature and pressure that introduce uncertainty in atmospheric stability simulations. The correlation between PM2.5 and various meteorological elements varied during different periods. The vertical distribution of meteorological factors also significantly affected simulation outcomes, particularly uncertainties in simulating wind speed and inversion temperature processes, which further contributed to the uncertainty in pollutant simulations."

 This study evaluates the impact of climate change on tropospheric ozone (O3) concentrations in the Eastern Mediterranean using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) and the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) models. Simulations were conducted for a historical period (2012) and a future projection (2053) under SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. Anthropogenic emissions were sourced from the EMEP/EEA inventory, while biogenic emissions were calculated using the MEGAN model. Model performance evaluations yielded R2 (RMSE) values of 0.71–0.85 (3.33–4.9) for WRF and 0.58 (8.35) for CMAQ, indicating reasonable predictive accuracy. Under SSP5-8.5 (SSP2-4.5), the WRF model projects an average summertime temperature increase of 1.6 °C (1.2 °C) and a significant decline in precipitation across the Eastern Mediterranean. Air quality simulations show a regional increase in summertime O3 concentrations by 3.5 ppb (3.0 ppb) under SSP5-8.5 (SSP2-4.5), with the most pronounced increases occurring in the southeast. Conversely, a significant reduction in O3 concentrations is observed over the Marmara Sea and parts of Istanbul in both scenarios. This reduction is attributed to climate-induced processes, including accelerated O3 photolysis in moist conditions and enhanced O3 consumption by NOx in the NOx-saturated regime of the Marmara Sea region. Additionally, analyses reveal a significant increase in O3 levels in Istanbul under SSP5-8.5, while Bursa shows notable increases under both scenarios. These findings underscore the need for targeted emission control measures to mitigate future O3 pollution in the region."

 Tornadoes represent a significant threat to society. In Mexico, these natural hazards are common, principally from the end of spring until autumn, with a mean of around 45 events yearly (2013−2022). Although there is no official tornado database in Mexico with a proper tornado classification, it is known that supercell and non-supercell tornadogenesis is possible in the country. In this context, the present investigation examines the environments under 298 confirmed and validated tornadoes formed in the Mexican territory. Such analysis was made using the proximity-sounding approach with the ERA5 reanalysis dataset. In addition, using the k-means clustering method, three Tornadic Environment Types were found, each with specific characteristics. The first type is the most common environment, documented throughout the year, particularly during summer and the beginning of autumn. Intermediate instability conditions, without wind shear, and high humidity near the surface characterize it. The second type is observed in high altitudes during the spring, with relatively dry conditions and low unstable environments. The previous examples may relate to non-supercell tornadogenesis in different geographical regions and seasons. In contrast, the third type can be associated with significant tornadoes, an environment rich in instability and wind shear, concentrated in the northern portions of Mexico during spring. The findings of this research provide insights into increasing understanding of tornadoes in Mexico. Furthermore, it can be helpful to generate improvements in tornado forecasting at the national level, offering a range of tornadic environment types under which these natural hazards can develop. The clustering method results offer an alternative option for the classification of tornadoes in countries with little capacity for the official classification of these phenomena."

 Aerosol optical depth (AOD) is a crucial variable in monitoring air quality and the study of climate change. Although considerable researches have been conducted on the cross-validation between ground-based and satellite measurements, the spatiotemporal representativeness of each measurement method during such validation process requires further investigation. Here, we investigate the spatiotemporal representativeness of AOD measurements from ground-based AERONET (Aerosol Robotic Network) and satellites, including Terra/Aqua MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) and Himawari-8 AHI (Advanced Himawari Imager). Results from six typical Asian sites are considered. The annual and seasonal assessment metrics between AERONET and satellites (Terra/Aqua MODIS and Himawari-8 AHI) AOD, including R (correlation coefficient), RMB (relative mean bias), RMSE (root mean square error), and %within EE (percentage of matchups falling within the expected error envelope), show slight variations with changing spatial ranges, and the influence of the seasonal variation on the spatial representativeness has similar conclusions as well. From 10 × 10 km2 to 100 × 100 km2 (interval: 10 × 10 km2), the R, RMB, and RMSE are 0.89–0.87, 1.07–0.87, and 0.20–0.22 for Terra MODIS AOD; 0.91–0.85, 1.04–0.91, and 0.17–0.23 for Aqua MODIS AOD; 0.87–0.78, 0.77–0.83, and 0.20–0.26 for AHI AOD and the MODIS measurements have a higher %within EE than AHI AOD. These suggest that, although MODIS only measures AOD during the satellite overpass, not the temporal variations, their results show a reasonable correlation with the daily average AOD given by AERONET measurements. The diurnal fluctuations of AOD are detectable in both AERONET and AHI measurements, with AHI showing larger diurnal fluctuations (over 40 %) and annual deviations from the daily average within ±10 %. This study offers insights into the spatial representative range of AERONET measurements and the temporal/daily representative capability of satellite measurements."

 The paper investigates to what extent the assimilation of in-situ data over Gippsland, Victoria, Australia reduces uncertainties in methane emission sources on the regional scale. This was examined via a four-dimensional variational data assimilation system using the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) transport-dispersion model. To evaluate the posterior error statistics of optimized monthly-mean methane emissions in Gippsland, we carried out a range of observing system simulation experiments. We ran the assimilations based on four selected months in 2019, employing a horizontal grid resolution of 2 km. The observation data are obtained based on three continuous observation instruments in the Gippsland region. As expected, the largest uncertainty reductions occur near observing sites. Also, our findings indicate that using a high-resolution model and in-situ observations provides detailed information on point sources but offers limited insight into area sources. The overall uncertainty for regional fluxes remains largely unchanged. Therefore, in-situ data is crucial for understanding point sources due to its detailed and localized nature. Finally, uncertainty reduction is much larger when the full concentration dataset is used rather than just the daytime data. This suggests the importance of model improvement to allow use of nighttime data, at least under conditions where the transport model can be expected to simulate atmospheric mixing well."

The accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) in the WNP shows an enhanced explanatory capability for the Niño 3.4 index. TCs excite oceanic Kelvin waves with greater amplitudes compared to the past. Through diagnostic analysis of the temperature tendency equation, it is also found that TCs contribute more strongly to thermocline feedback and zonal advection feedback three months later. Consequently, it can be concluded that TCs play an increasingly significant positive feedback role in ENSO dynamics in the current climate context."

The fossil record offers a unique opportunity to reconstruct the early character evolution of the nervous system via the exceptional preservation of extinct representatives.

We show that some of the oldest known representatives of the group either preserved in carbonaceous compression (early and mid-Cambrian Burgess-type preservation) or secondarily phosphatized in three dimensions (e.g., basal Cambrian Kuanchuanpu Formation, ca. 535 million years) had an unpaired ventral nerve cord (VNC) that ran along the trunk in an eccentric position as in modern priapulids and nematodes. A phylogenetic analysis integrating these fossil data suggests that ancestral scalidophorans had an unpaired VNC and that paired nervous systems probably evolved independently in Kinorhyncha and Loricifera, and, more importantly, in panarthropods in possible relation with the rise of paired appendages and bilaterally coordinated motricity."

Here, we introduce a method to modulate the OAM of light on a femtosecond scale by engineering a space-time coupling in ultrashort pulses. By linking azimuthal position with time, we implement an azimuthally varying Fourier transformation to dynamically alter light’s spatial distribution in a fixed transverse plane. Our experiments demonstrate self-torqued wave packets that exhibit spiraling motions and rapid temporal OAM changes down to a few femtoseconds. We further extend this concept to generate angularly self-accelerating wave packets that adjust their OAM by redistributing their energy density across their spectral bandwidth, without external forces. The ability to tune the spatial-temporal properties of light on demand opens the possibility for exploring ultrafast light dynamics at fundamental timescales, with far-reaching implications for ultrafast spectroscopy, nano- and microstructure manipulation, condensed matter physics, and other related areas."

Here, we experimentally demonstrate physical systems with multiple RTDs in crystals, analyzing the distribution of Euler charges and their global connectivity. Through Euler curvature fields, we reveal that type I RTDs have quantized point Euler charges, while type II RTDs show continuously distributed Euler charges along nodal lines. We discover a correspondence between the Euler number of RTDs and the abelian/non-abelian topological charges of nodal lines, extending the Poincaré-Hopf index theorem to Bloch fiber bundles and ensuring nodal line connectivity.

Combining high-resolution data on forest cover and climate variables within random forest and panel regression models, we find that 25 to 31% of annual forest loss is linked to climate variability. Using georeferenced household survey data, we then find that changes in forest cover have a significant positive association with changes in child diet diversity—a key proxy of nutritional adequacy—while cropland expansion does not, suggesting that such forest conversions may be an ineffective climate adaptation strategy for improving nutrition.

We found that adenosine 3′,5′-monophosphate response element–binding protein 3–like protein 2 (CREB3L2), a noncanonical UPR factor, is overexpressed and activated in triple-negative breast cancer, where its cleavage releases a C-terminal fragment that activates the Hedgehog pathway in neighboring CD8+ T cells. The enhanced Hedgehog pathway represses CD8+ T cell activation and inhibits its cytotoxic effects. Consequently, overexpression of CREB3L2 not only promotes tumor growth but also causes resistance to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB). Inhibition of the Hedgehog pathway impedes the growth of CREB3L2-overexpressed tumors and sensitizes them to ICB therapy. In summary, we identified a previously unidentified mechanism by which the UPR pathway dictates cross-talk between cancer cells and immune cells, providing important anticancer therapeutic opportunities."

Our device leverages a staggered herringbone pattern, nanoparticle surface coating, and processing conditions to achieve detection of as few as 3 viral copies per milliliter. We further validated our microfluidic assay on 103 plasma, 36 saliva, and 29 stool samples collected from unique patients with COVID-19, showing SARS-CoV-2 detection in 72% of plasma samples. Longitudinal monitoring in the plasma revealed our device’s capacity for ultrasensitive detection of active viral infections over time. Our technology can be adapted to target other viruses using relevant cell entry molecules for affinity capture. This versatility underscores the potential for widespread application in viral load monitoring and disease management."

They are ubiquitously produced by formaldehyde (FA), and failure to repair FA-induced DPCs blocks chromatin-based processes, leading to neurodegeneration and cancer. The type, structure, and repair of FA-induced DPCs remain largely unknown. Here, we profiled the proteome of FA-induced DPCs and found that flap endonuclease 1 (FEN1) resolves FA-induced DPCs. We revealed that FA also damages DNA bases adjoining the DPCs, leading to DPC-conjugated 5′ flap structures via the base excision repair (BER) pathway. We also found that FEN1 repairs enzymatic topoisomerase II (TOP2)–DPCs. Furthermore, we report that both FA-induced and TOP2-DPCs are adenosine diphosphate (ADP) ribosylated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1). PARylation of the DPCs in association with FEN1 PARylation at residue E285 is required for the recruitment of FEN1. Our work unveils the identity of proteins forming FA-induced DPCs and a previously unrecognized PARP1-FEN1 nuclease pathway repairing both FA- and TOP2-DPCs."

No paracellular diffusion of solutes is allowed because of tight junctions that are made impermeable by the expression of claudin5 (CLDN5) by brain endothelial cells. The possibility of regulating the BBB permeability in a transient and reversible fashion is in strong demand for the pharmacological treatment of brain diseases. Here, we designed and tested short BBB-active peptides, derived from the CLDN5 extracellular domains and the CLDN5-binding domain ofClostridium perfringensenterotoxin, using a robust workflow of structural modeling and in vitro validation techniques. Computational analysis at the atom level based on solubility and affinity to CLDN5 identified a CLDN5-derived peptide not reported previously called f1-C5C2, which was soluble in biological media, displayed efficient binding to CLDN5, and transiently increased BBB permeability. The peptidomimetic strategy described here may have potential applications in the pharmacological treatment of brain diseases."

Adult hippocampal neurogenesis and connectivity as assessed by a high-density multielectrode array positively correlated with the variation in exploration and learning efficiency. During some tasks, divergence transiently collapsed, highlighting the sustained significance of context for individualization. Thus, equal environments and equal genes do not result in equal learning biographies because life confronts individuals with choices that lead to divergent paths."

Mechanisms explaining how the microvasculature responds to ECM alterations remain unknown. Here, we used a microphysiological model of capillaries on a chip mimicking the characteristics of healthy or fibrotic collagen to test the hypothesis that perivascular cells mediate the response of vascular capillaries to mechanical and structural changes in the human ECM. Capillaries engineered in altered fibrotic collagen had abnormal migration of perivascular cells, reduced pericyte differentiation, increased leakage, and higher regulation of inflammatory/remodeling genes, all regulated viaNOTCH3, a known mediator of endothelial-perivascular cell communication. Capillaries engineered either with endothelial cells alone or with perivascular cells silenced forNOTCH3expression showed a minimal response to ECM alterations.

While the progression from GDM to T2D is not fully understood, it involves both genetic and environmental components. By integrating clinical, metabolomic, and genome-wide association study (GWAS) data, we identified associations between decreased sphingolipid biosynthesis and future T2D, in part through thers267738allele of theCERS2gene in Hispanic women shortly after a GDM pregnancy. To understand the impact of theCERS2gene and risk allele on glucose regulation, we examined whole-bodyCers2knockout andrs267738knock-in mice. Both models exhibited glucose intolerance and impaired insulin secretion in vivo. Islets isolated from these models also demonstrated reduced β cell function, as shown by decreased insulin secretion ex vivo. Overall, reduced circulating sphingolipids may indicate a high risk of GDM-to-T2D progression and reflect deficits inCERS2activity that negatively affect glucose homeostasis and β cell function."

Weller and Walter S. Kiefer,The punctuated evolution of the Venusian atmosphere from a transition in mantle convective style and volcanic outgassing,"A key question in the planetary sciences centers on the divergence between the sibling planets, Venus and Earth. Venus currently does not operate with plate tectonics, and its thick atmosphere has led to extreme greenhouse conditions. It is unknown if this state was set primordially or if Venus was once more Earth-like. Here, we explore Venus as an example of a planet that recently transitioned between tectonic regimes. Our results show that transitions naturally lead to substantial resurfacing and melt-generated outgassing from lithosphere-breaking events and overturns, with 3 to 10 bars of atmosphere generated per overturn over ~60–million year timescales and ~10 to 100 bars outgassed over billion-year time frames. We find that the observation of Venus with a thick greenhouse atmosphere and the inferences of currently low volcanic rates and previous prodigious volcanic rates are consistent with a planet that has undergone a transition in tectonics, suggesting that Venus once hosted clement surface conditions and was more Earth-like."

However, the operating temperature is still too high to revolutionize ceramic electrochemical cell technology. Lowering the operating temperature to <450°C will enable a wider material choice and reduce system costs. We present approaches to redesigning PCECs via readily fabricated single-grain–thick, chemically homogeneous, and robust electrolytes and a nano-micro positive electrode. At 450°C, the PCECs achieve a peak power density of 1.6 watt per square centimeter on H2fuel, 0.5 watt per square centimeter on NH3fuel, and 0.3 watt per square centimeter on CH4fuel in fuel cell mode. In steam electrolysis mode, a current density of >0.6 ampere per square centimeter with a Faradaic efficiency of >90% is achievable at 1.4 volt and 400°C.

As the proteolytic unit, the 20Sproteasome is assembled from 28 subunits assisted by chaperones PAC1/2/3/4 and POMP; then, it undergoes the maturation process, in which the proteolytic sites are activated and the assembly chaperones are cleared. However, mechanisms governing the maturation remain elusive. Here, we captured endogenous maturation intermediates of human 20Sproteasome, which are low abundance and highly dynamic, and determined their structures by cryo–electron microscopy. Through structure-based functional studies, we identified the key switches that remodel and activate the proteolytic sites. Our results also revealed that the POMP degradation is tightly controlled by a dual-checking mechanism, while the α5 subunit senses POMP degradation to induce PAC1/2 release, achieving the full maturation. These findings elucidate mechanisms directing and safeguarding the proteasome maturation and set basis for building proteasomes to counteract the decline of protein degradation in aging and disease."

Here, we demonstrate that the human genome is an emergent, self-assembling, reinforcement learning system. Conformationally defined heterogeneous, nanoscopic packing domains form by the interplay of transcription, nucleosome remodeling, and loop extrusion. We show that packing domains are not topologically associated domains. Instead, packing domains exist across a structure-function life cycle that couples heterochromatin and transcription in situ, explaining how heterochromatin enzyme inhibition can produce a paradoxical decrease in transcription by destabilizing domain cores. Applied to development and aging, we show the pairing of heterochromatin and transcription at myogenic genes that could be disrupted by nuclear swelling. In sum, packing domains represent a foundation to explore the interactions of chromatin and transcription at the single-cell level in human health."

We reasoned that molecular dynamics at the CART immune synapse (CARIS) could explain differences in their tumor rejection kinetics. We observed that CD28.ζ-CART engaged in brief highly lethal CARIS and mastered serial killing, whereas 4-1BB.ζ-CART formed lengthy CARIS and relied on robust expansion and cooperative killing. We analyzed CARIS membrane lipid rafts (mLRs) and found that, upon tumor engagement, CD28.ζ-CAR molecules rapidly but transiently translocated into mLRs, mobilizing the microtubular organizing center and lytic granules to the CARIS. This enabled fast CART recovery and sensitivity to low target site density. In contrast, gradual accumulation of 4-1BB.ζ-CAR and LFA-1 molecules at mLRs built mechanically tonic CARIS mediating chronic Fas ligand–based killing. The differences in CD28.ζ- and 4-1BB.ζ-CARIS dynamics explain the distinct cytolytic behavior of CART and can guide engineering of more adaptive effective cellular products."

Here we report that Hh induces phase separation of the fused (Fu)/Ulk family kinases to allosterically regulate Ci/Gli. We find that Hh-induced phosphorylation of Fu/Ulk3 promotes SUMOylation of their inverted phosphorylation-dependent SUMOylation motifs. Subsequent interaction between SUMO and SUMO-interacting motif drives Fu/Ulk3 self-assembly to form biomolecular condensates that recruit Ci-Sufu and Gli-Sufu in the cytoplasm and primary cilium, respectively. Within the condensates, Fu/Ulk3 undergoes a conformational change to expose Ci/Gli for Fu/Ulk3-mediated phosphorylation and activation, leading to gradual accumulation of nuclear CiA/GliAtranscriptional complexes in proportion to ligand dose and exposure time. Our findings provide mechanistic insights into the spatiotemporal control of Hh signal transduction, reveal previously unexplored regulatory mechanism and function for biomolecular condensation, and establish a paradigm for kinase-mediated signal transduction whereby a kinase allosterically activates its substrate through ligand-induced and condensation-driven conformational change."
