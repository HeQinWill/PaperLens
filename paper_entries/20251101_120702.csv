Previous studies have found that increasing solar capacity in India’s coal belt may ameliorate the distributional consequences of electricity decarbonization, but we lack detailed assessments of the tradeoffs involved. Here, we evaluate the costs and emissions reduction benefits associated with building solar photovoltaic (PV) capacity on land currently used for opencast (OC) coal mining in India. We use 50 years of weather data to quantify the P10, P50, and P90 capacity factors and levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) for identically configured PV arrays at the 100 largest OC mines. At 97 mines, the expected LCOE is higher than at the Pavagada Solar Park in southern India that we use as a benchmark. When adjusted for the value of avoided emissions, 49 mines spread across Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Madhya Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, and Uttar Pradesh have lower social costs of solar generation than Pavagada. For the 50 largest mines, we compile acreage information and estimate that they can support up to 28 GW of new solar PV capacity, approximately one-third of India’s total solar PV capacity today. This capacity would avoid approximately 47 Mt , or US$2.4 billion in damages, per year at abatement costs between US$15–28/t . Mines expected to be depleted by 2025 may support annual abatement of up to 4.8 Mt  yr−1, with additional abatement of 6.5 Mt  yr−1 and 8.6 Mt  yr−1 possible at mines closing between 2025–30 and 2030–35, respectively. Our results show that depleted mine land in India’s coal belt can play a meaningful role in an electricity capacity mix that minimizes the combination of private costs and damages."

A New York State (NYS) legislative mandate requires net zero statewide GHG emissions by 2050 in part through decarbonizing electricity generation. However, increasing renewable energy capacity, including utility scale solar (USS), competes with land-uses such as agriculture and forestry. This case study evaluates USS historic land use to project future demand for land to meet NYS’s 2050 GHG goal. Data collected from open-source solar databases were combined with USS boundaries obtained through manual and automated digitization and Monte-Carlo and Maximum Entropy modeling were used to project the likely area and land use characteristics of future sites built to meet the projected 2050 demand for electricity. Demand for solar energy in NYS is projected to reach 116–125 terawatt hours per year by 2050, when electrification of current fossil-fueled heating and transportation sectors is taken into account. By analyzing the performance of over 300 existing USS sites across NYS, we project that approximately 100 GWDC of USS capacity can meet this demand. We found an average power density of 0.62 MWDC/ha of land for fixed axis sites and 0.59 MWDC/ha for single axis tracked sites. Stochastic modeling of power density trends over time indicates that the 2050 mandate will require between 71,072 and 128,784 hectares (ha) depending on siting variables. If trends continue, we project that between 21 386 and 27 233 ha of cropland and between 14,985 and 18,463 ha of forest could be converted to USS. For future scenarios in which conversion of annual row crop land and high-quality soils were limited, there was an increase in distance to transmission lines, number of parcels required, and complexity of site shapes, which would likely increase solar development costs. These results help bound the likely land use changes that will occur to meet electric sector GHG mitigation mandates. These results also provide information about the benefits and trade-offs of restricting the conversion of current agricultural land to solar energy production. Additionally, the approach we developed, combining analysis of fenced area, capacity factors, trends in power density over time, and projecting likely future locations for solar stochastically is applicable to many global regions with solar development on agricultural lands."

However, contradictory findings on post-fire flow regime changes have highlighted the complexity of this relationship. This study considers rich daily-resolution hydrological data on 898 burned catchments and over 8000 unburned control catchments to choose a set of 39 paired catchment experiments, along with 500 control pair experiments. We use these 500 control catchments to evaluate the extent to which the paired watershed approach accounts for hidden co-varying factors, finding that in most instances, it does not. We assess the influence of wildfires on flow magnitude, timing, and dynamicity. We also explore the effects of wildfire on water storage, evapotranspiration, and flood flows across the Western USA from 1984 to 2023. We find that percent changes in flow magnitude post-fire are not statistically significant and are uncorrelated with the percent of the catchment that burned, even when data are restricted to the critical first 5 years post-fire. However, linear regression analysis of 94 catchment variables found weak positive relationships between pre-fire forest cover and percent changes in flow magnitudes. Our results emphasize that the statistical uncertainty associated with even well-established methods may overshadow the magnitude of observed effects."

As climate-related flood events intensify globally, there is an urgent need to understand how social vulnerability is conceptualized and assessed to inform more equitable and effective risk reduction strategies. This paper reports the results of a systematic literature review on indicators and indexes used to assess social vulnerability to floods. Utilizing the PRISMA methodology, we identified and screened 1621 studies published between 2013 and 2023, selecting 36 peer-reviewed publications for examining how social vulnerability indices have been conceptualized, constructed, and applied, as well as the range of indicators, and methodological approaches used. We identified 78 indicator sets across 22 thematic domains. Results indicate that most attention has been given to a small set of indicators focusing on at-risk populations, socioeconomic factors, housing, and employment, while other factors such as health conditions, disaster preparedness, social connectedness, gender minorities, and sexuality are consistently underrepresented. Many studies rely on established frameworks without adapting them to local socio-cultural contexts and use census and secondary data sources, providing limited household-level and qualitative insights. Lack of methodological transparency, particularly regarding normalization and weighting, is common as is insufficient validation and ground-truthing. Greater attention to these issues, along with empirical case studies, is needed to provide in-depth insights into the root causes of social vulnerability and inform policies better tailored to local realities. This review highlights significant conceptual and methodological gaps, calling for more context-sensitive, mixed-method, and empirically validated approaches to improve the robustness and local relevance of social vulnerability assessments in flood-prone areas."

To gain a comprehensive understanding of the state of the art, we conducted a systematic literature review of 40 studies addressing sea level rise; flooding resulting from sea level rise or extreme weather events; and transformations in urban geography through adaptative policies in response to climate change. The findings indicate a steady growth in this area of research over the past decade. The reviewed interventions—primarily oriented toward fostering learning related to adaptative behaviors or directly aimed at behavioral change—have generally yielded positive outcomes. Specifically, gamification has been shown to enhance participants’ sense of accomplishment, promote social interaction, and create immersive learning environments. However, we also identified limitations in terms of intervention context, design, measured outcomes, and methodology. In response to these, we propose a set of recommendations for future research in this field. Among them, we highlight the importance of developing and deploying gamified experiences in emerging economies that are particularly vulnerable to climate risk; promoting social dynamics within digital interventions, thereby enhancing collective awareness and cooperation; considering the affective dimension of engagement within experimental designs by capturing emotional responses and their influence on behavior; and deepening and broadening the scope of results by grounding the studies’ execution and reporting more firmly on critical self-reflection and transparency."

However, their impact on the spatial variability of multiple ecosystem functions (multifunctionality) is still unknown. Therefore, this study aims to explore how functional diversity and composition affect the spatial variability of ecosystem multifunctionality (EMF-SV) under different environmental conditions in a temperate forest region. Regional communities representing specific spatial scales were established by assembling different numbers of sample plots. The EMF-SV was represented by the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean value of ecosystem multifunctionality within each regional community. Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the effects of functional diversity and composition on the EMF-SV at different spatial scales. Structural equation models were applied to explore the direct and indirect pathways of functional diversity and composition influencing the EMF-SV. Our results show that functional diversity and composition had significant effects on the EMF-SV, and these effects changed with spatial scales and environmental conditions. They affected the EMF-SV directly or indirectly through species asynchrony and population stability. Our results demonstrate the role of functional traits in regulating the EMF-SV across spatial scales and explore the main impact mechanisms. This will contribute to our understanding and protection of ecosystem multifunctionality in temperate forests."

In this study, we analyze projections of relative SL (RSL) rise in the Mediterranean Sea until the end of the 21st century. For the first time, we provide a detailed characterization of regional patterns of future SL change using an ensemble of three multi-decadal SSP5-8.5 scenario simulations with high-resolution fully coupled regional climate system models (RCSMs) of the Med-CORDEX initiative and their driving global climate models (GCMs). At the basin-scale, RCSMs do not significantly modify the GCM-projected RSL changes by 2100, with a mean RSL change of 69 cm (60–93 cm, 17th-83rd percentiles) relative to 1995–2014. Among the RSL components, the sterodynamic (primarily driven by the global thermal expansion) and the surface mass balance drive the basin-scale RSL rise, with the latter being the largest source of uncertainty. We find that the RSL rise in the Mediterranean is expected to be 4%–12% lower than the global mean due to differences in the surface mass contribution, and 6%–15% lower than in the nearby Atlantic as a result of dynamic adjustments within the semi-enclosed basin. While dynamic SL drives the mean regional patterns, vertical land motion introduces the greatest local spatial variability along coasts, resulting in a projected local RSL rise by 2100 of −26 cm to +178 cm in GCMs and −39 cm to +170 cm in RCSMs. Furthermore, compared to GCMs, RCSMs incorporate local details that result in greater spatial variability, which is important to consider in risk assessments and adaptation planning."

China dominates the global critical minerals supply chain. Deep-sea mining (DSM) is proposed as an alternative to domestic land-based mining. While DSM could reduce China’s control over critical minerals and avoid local pollution from land-based mining, it could potentially harm the ocean ecosystem. We explore whether support for DSM depends on how its benefits/costs are framed, and how this support varies between the mass public and environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs). We administered an identical (pre-registered) online survey to US individuals (n = 1142) and separately to ENGO professionals (n = 278). This unique research design assesses whether the support for these two groups for DSM is influenced by how the DSM spillovers are framed in terms of (1) preventing land-based water pollution and habitat degradation from land-based mines (+), (2) reducing US dependence on China for critical minerals (+), and (3) hurting fisheries which are a key food source (−). Among the mass public, we find that support for DSM mining increases with the security frame only. However, among ENGO respondents, support for DSM does not change for any frame. Men in both samples support DSM, but we do not find differences in DSM support along race or partisan affiliations."

Focused on China’s Loess Plateau (LP), a typical arid to semi-arid region, this study quantified the dual effects of urbanization on both the size and quality of natural habitats (NHs) from 1990 to 2050 by multi-scenario land cover simulations with the system dynamics PLUS model, combining landscape indices and habitat quality (HQ) analysis. The study revealed that urbanization directly consumed 3470 km2 of NHs and indirectly resulted in the loss of 4706.4 km2 between 1990 and 2020. Under the SSP5–8.5 scenario, direct and indirect NHs losses are projected to increases of 7.75 and 7.39 times respectively, from 2020 to 2050. Nevertheless, LP’s landscape pattern exhibited an optimizing trend: the increasing aggregation index of urban patches, coupled with an enhanced largest patch index for forests and grasslands, indicates that intensified urbanization can mitigate the disordered encroachment on NHs, reduce landscape fragmentation, and preserve larger and more contiguous habitat patches, thereby improving overall HQ. The LP case demonstrates urbanization and NHs conservation are not inherently antagonistic; well-planned urbanization can catalyze NHs protection. We further proposed strategies including spatially concentrated urbanization to advance sustainable urbanization and enhance HQ, fostering synergies between social progress and ecological preservation in global arid regions."

Our results highlight performance differences among models, revealing strengths and weaknesses of different modelling techniques. We also found that wetland emission inventories overestimated emissions in regional simulations. This work helps to refine methane emission predictions, essential for understanding climate change. 
 High latitude wetland emissions of methane (CH4) remain a significant source of uncertainty in global methane budgets. At these latitudes, flux estimation approaches, such as atmospheric inversions, are challenged by complex meteorological conditions, limited observational coverage, and uncertainties in atmospheric transport modelling. This study evaluates the performance of various atmospheric transport models and reanalysis datasets using meteorological and CH4 in-situ measurements collected during the MAGIC2021 campaign near Kiruna, Sweden. Over six days of measurements in August 2021, the ERA5 reanalysis, produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) and providing global atmospheric data, showed better agreement with observations compared to the meso-scale Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, though WRF provided valuable insights into local atmospheric dynamics. Among global simulations of CH4 mixing ratios, inversion-optimised models which adjust emissions to match observations, achieved the best performance overall particularly when constrained by surface measurements. Regional simulations from WRF coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) revealed biases in CH4 mixing ratios in the boundary layer, suggesting an overestimation of emissions by wetland models. All chemistry-transport models exhibited a positive bias in the stratosphere. Simulations with higher vertical resolution demonstrated an improved representation of vertical CH4 profiles in the upper layers of the atmosphere. Despite the limited spatio-temporal coverage of the observations, we were able to identify the best performing transport models and to evaluate fluxes from different biogeochemical model parameterisations using the MAGIC2021 high-resolution dataset, demonstrating the utility of in-situ vertical profile datasets for transport and flux model evaluation."

We propose a framework using the Metastatistical Extreme Value Distribution that precisely defines the extremes being analyzed, and explores, through a large observational data set, their dependence on local thermodynamics and large‐scale atmospheric circulation at different temporal scales. Our results show that thermodynamics predominantly controls changes in hourly precipitation extremes and that their rate of increase must necessarily depend on the return period, in contrast with CC‐scaling arguments. On the contrary, daily precipitation is seen to be mostly controlled by large‐scale circulation, in ways that cannot be captured by CC‐based approaches.

Benefiting from Juno's high‐quality in situ data in the off‐equatorial region, we then analyze the flux tube integrals and interchange instability criteria between M‐shells 13 and 40 using numerical integration. On average, the entropy term dominates the system, resulting in a generally stable system for interchange motion. Finally, we investigate an injection event, in which predictions from the criteria align with the observed flow direction. This study illustrates the overall stability of the system with small‐scale, intermittent dynamic phenomena."

We demonstrate that this technique can track seasonal and annual seafloor water temperature changes to within 0.1°C, in a well‐mixed, shelf sea environment. We observe a marine heatwave, with a temperature increase of +1.5°C between 2022 and 2024 at the sea‐floor, causing coral bleaching with 30% mortality.

Focusing on thermal and current feedbacks (TFB and CFB), we show that their combined influence peaks in summer, enhancing surface winds while partially offsetting in surface stress. This compensation reduces the stress response, especially along the GS. Seasonal coupling variations are driven by stronger TFB in summer and modulated by background wind conditions. Energy fluxes also exhibit strong seasonality: kinetic energy transfer to the atmosphere intensifies in winter, while, over the GS, potential energy gains can dominate in summer, partly influenced by CFB. These results highlight the importance of accounting for both feedbacks—and their seasonal variability—in studies of submesoscale air‐sea interactions.

Thermal fatigue modeling predicts similar fractures. Fracture depth has a much larger effect on surface temperature than the composition of the material.

Results show annual ITV changes were winter‐dominated, with hemispheric asymmetry. Higher Eocene ITV was driven primarily by paleogeographic changes and that the lower Pliocene ITV was forced mainly by increased atmospheric CO2.

Both the trends and interannual variability in these phenomena closely track the hydroclimate of Rapa Nui and explain why fewer storms are reaching the island. We show that these dynamical and aridification trends have likely already exceeded natural variability and that they will continue through the 21st century under an intermediate greenhouse‐gas emissions scenario.

 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a rare and fatal neurodegenerative disease with a median survival of only 2 to 4 years from diagnosis. Improved tools are needed to shorten diagnostic delays and improve prognostication to benefit clinical care. Herein, we profiled whole blood gene expression by RNA sequencing in a large cohort of ALS participants (n = 422) versus controls (n = 272). Several machine learning classifiers trained on our detailed gene expression dataset accurately predicted case-control status, including in a fully independent external test cohort, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.894 with the best performing model. Integrating gene expression features with clinical variables improved our ability to discriminate ALS cases into shorter, intermediate, and longer survival in an external dataset. Finally, we identified ALS-relevant pathways in our blood transcriptomics dataset as well as “core genes” that overlapped with gene expression changes occurring in the primary disease tissue, facilitating a drug perturbation analysis that identified several candidates.

 Voluminous felsic continental crust is, as far as we know, unique to Earth, yet the timescales of its earliest growth remain debated. Archean mantle evolution is complementary to crustal growth but is largely unconstrained for strontium isotopes due widespread Rb-Sr disturbance. Here, we perform high spatial resolution radiogenic Sr and Ca isotope measurements in magmatic plagioclase megacrysts from 3.7–2.8 Ga Archean anorthosites and leucogabbros.

This fungi-specific structure allows Fzo1 to dimerize and remain locked after catalyzing GTP hydrolysis, enabling efficient mitochondrial fusion with minimal energy consumption. 
 The mitochondrion is a highly dynamic organelle, constantly undergoing fusion and fission, which are critical processes for the health of cells. Fusion of the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) is mediated by the mitofusins belonging to the dynamin superfamily of GTPases. Most eukaryotic organisms possess two cooperatively functioning mitofusins, but yeast has only one mitofusin (Fzo1). How Fzo1 solely catalyzes OMM fusion is unclear. Here, we present crystal structures of truncated Fzo1 (Fzo1IM) in different nucleotide-loading states and report a special mechanistic feature of Fzo1 through systematic functional studies. Differing from mammalian mitofusins, Fzo1 contains an extra latch bulge (LB) that is essential for the viability of yeast. Upon GTP loading, Fzo1IM dimerizes via the GTPase domain and prefers the closed conformation. This state is then locked by the subsequent trans interaction mediated by the LB of each protomer, so that Fzo1IM remains dimerized in the closed conformation even after GTP hydrolysis. This special mechanistic feature may be relevant to the previous observation that degradation of Fzo1 by the ubiquitin-proteasome system is required for mitochondrial fusion. Our study reveals how mitochondrial fusion in yeast is efficiently ensured with limited GTP consumption, which broadens current understanding of this fundamental biological process.

 Accurate detection of somatic variants in tumors is of critical importance and remains challenging. Current methods typically require matched normal samples for reliable detection, which are often unavailable in real-world research and clinical scenarios. Without a matched normal sample, more proficient algorithms are required to distinguish true somatic variants from germline variants and technical artifacts. However, existing tumor-only somatic variant callers that were designed for short-read sequencing data are not able to work well with long-read data. To fill the gap, we present ClairS-TO, a deep-learning-based method for long-read tumor-only somatic variant calling. ClairS-TO uses an ensemble of two disparate neural networks trained from the same samples but for opposite tasks—how likely/not likely a candidate is a somatic variant. Benchmarks using COLO829 and HCC1395 cancer cell lines show that ClairS-TO outperforms DeepSomatic and smrest in ONT and PacBio long-read data. ClairS-TO is also applicable to short-read data and outperforms Mutect2, Octopus, Pisces, and DeepSomatic.

Here, the authors performed global lipidomics on post-mortem dorsolateral prefrontal cortex collected from 316 participants in the ROSMAP cohort including asymptomatic and symptomatic AD. 
 The biology of individual lipid species and their relevance in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) remains incompletely understood. To explore the lipidomic biomarkers associated with cognition function and neuropathological changes in AD, we utilize non-targeted mass spectrometry on 316 post-mortem brains from participants in the Religious Orders Study (ROS) or Rush Memory and Aging Project (MAP) cohorts classified as control, asymptomatic AD (AAD), or symptomatic AD (SAD), and integrate the lipidomics data with untargeted proteomics from the same individuals. We find that lysophosphatidylethanolamine (LPE) and lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) species are significantly lower in SAD than controls or AAD. Lipid-protein network analyses reveal that LPE/LPC modules are significantly associated with protein modules involved in MAPK/metabolism, post-synaptic density, and cell-ECM interaction pathways, and correlate with better antemortem cognition and reduced AD neuropathology. Particularly, LPE 22:6 [sn-1] is significantly decreased SAD and exerts a pronounced influence on protein changes relevant to neurotransmitter-driven post synaptic changes and plasticity compared to other lysophospholipids species. These findings suggest LPE 22:6 as a potential lipid signature and therapeutic target for AD. The role of individual lipid species in Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is not fully understood.

 Gut microbiota have been implicated in severe malaria in murine models, but their contribution to the pathogenesis of severe malaria in children is unknown. Here we show through analysis of gut bacteria in stool samples from two separate African studies enrolling children with severe malaria, and children from local communities, that children with severe malaria have gut bacteria dysbiosis. Among children with severe malaria, there is increased abundance of Enterobacteriaceae that associates with multiple clinical complications of severe malaria. Moreover, increased abundance of Escherichia coli was a predictor of post-discharge mortality. Metagenome analysis identify elevated metabolic pathways and genes supporting the utilization of host-derived molecules in children with severe malaria that have the potential to promote the survival and growth of Enterobacteriaceae. Treatments that target Enterobacteriaceae may have the potential to reduce post-discharge mortality in children with severe malaria. In this study, the authors show that gut dysbiosis in African children with severe malaria may contribute to the pathogenesis of malaria, including an increased risk of post-discharge mortality."

This Perspective proposes a way forward to integrate nutrients into crop models to assess climate impacts and highlights data needs. 
 Micronutrient deficiencies from poor dietary diversity remain a global health challenge. This issue is exacerbated by climate change-driven extreme weather events that impact crop quantity and quality. While process-based crop models effectively simulate plant nutrient (N, P, K) dynamics for productivity projections, they lack the ability to assess crop nutritional content. This Perspective proposes a framework for integrating nutrient dynamics into crop models for informing nutrition security strategies amid climate change. We delineate key biological pathways influencing nutrient uptake, translocation and density in response to elevated CO2, temperature and low precipitation. We highlight the scarcity of comprehensive datasets, underscoring the need for urgent, collaborative research to amass foundational data and models to ensure nutritional integrity in an uncertain climate. Climate change influences not only crop yields but also crop nutritional content, which is currently not simulated by process-based crop models.

 The coupling mechanisms and cascading effects among water, carbon, and ecosystem structure at the basin scale remain insufficiently understood. Here we take the perspective of ecosystem dynamic change, integrating the InVEST ecosystem process model and machine learning techniques, and propose a water-carbon-structure-function nexus analysis framework. We found that the overall ecosystem dynamism ranged from 2.3% to 5.3% across the basin. Spatial structural differentiation among the four major ecosystem types intensified. At the grid level, water-carbon showed predominantly synergistic behavior. The relatively low average water-carbon values in monsoon zones were key to limiting ecosystem gains. The structural thresholds constraining water-carbon interactions declined further in 2010 and 2022. Additionally, the water-carbon-structure-function nexus exhibits saddle-shaped, platform-shaped, and peak-shaped patterns spatially under water supply conditions. Once water utilization and structural characteristics reach their corresponding thresholds, the ecosystem’s productive function enters a steady state and no longer fluctuates significantly with changes in a single variable.

 Municipal solid waste incineration is increasingly used in China to balance urban growth with environmental and energy demands, yet challenges remain in pollutant control and by-product utilization. Here we compile operational data from 876 incineration plants across China and apply life cycle assessment models to systematically evaluate their environmental and economic performance. We find advanced flue gas treatment reduces harmful emissions but slightly compromises carbon benefits, whereas optimized leachate management achieves both emission reduction and carbon gains. Fly ash resource utilization can further improve environmental and economic outcomes, while waste classification and co-incineration strategies enhance plant viability. Our scenario simulations suggest that stricter emission standards, expanded classification, and targeted co-incineration can yield substantial carbon-negative and financial benefits. These findings highlight the synergistic potential of pollution control and resource utilization in shaping the sustainable transition of China’s waste-to-energy industry.

 Bioplastic and polylactic acid production is expected to increase in the future to replace single-use traditional plastics. Here we investigated the effects of polylactic acid contamination in marine ecosystems by assessing its degradation over time in an experimental mesocosm, along with its impact on microbial abundance, microbiome diversity, viral infections, and rates of organic matter cycling. We report here that, as polylactic acid gradually lost its integrity, a microbial biofilm rich in Marinobacter sp. developed on the biopolymer, reshaping the marine microbiome, promoting polylactic acid-associated bacteria such as the Saccharospirillaceae, and in turn increasing viral activity and accelerating the degradation of organic matter. These effects, which were further amplified at the temperatures experienced during heatwaves, suggest that high levels of polylactic acid contamination might influence the functioning of coastal marine ecosystems, particularly during extreme temperature episodes.
