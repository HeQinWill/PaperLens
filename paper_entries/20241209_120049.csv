10.1021/acs.est.4c08669,False,Environmental Science & Technology,这篇论文主要研究全氟辛烷磺酸(PFOS)及其替代物6:2 Cl-PFESA对胰腺癌耐药性的影响。研究使用药物敏感性试验、体内外模型以及转录组学/蛋白质组学测序等方法，发现PFOS和6:2 Cl-PFESA暴露会增加胰腺癌细胞对多种化疗药物的耐药性，并通过激活PI3K-ABCB1通路发挥作用。6:2 Cl-PFESA表现出比PFOS更强的促耐药作用。该研究与大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等，没有直接关系。,[],Jiawei Hong;Keyi Du;Weichen Zhang;Yifan Jiang;Hanxi Yu;Tingting Pan;Tong Wu;Liang Zhao;Wei Du;Shu-Sen Zheng;Hangbiao Jin;Yuanchen Chen;Linping Cao,"PFOS and Its Commercial Alternative, 6:2 Cl-PFESA, Induce Multidrug Resistance in Pancreatic Cancer","Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), specifically perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and its alternative, 2-[(6-chloro-1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5,6,6-dodecafluorohexyl)oxy]-1,1,2,2-tetrafluoroethanesulfonic acid (6:2 Cl-PFESA), are associated with environmental health concerns and potential cancer progression. However, their impact on multidrug resistance (MDR) in pancreatic cancer (PC) chemotherapy remains unclear. Here, we employed drug-sensitivity assays, including IC50 calculations, in vitro and in vivo models with various chemotherapeutics, and paclitaxel (PTX) as a representative agent, combined with transcriptomic/proteomic sequencing and clinical prognostic analysis, to identify MDR-related genes and validate their relevance, with the objective of establishing the correlation between PFOS/6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure and MDR in PC at molecular, cellular, and animal model levels. Our findings demonstrate that PFOS/6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure increases the drug IC50 in three different PC cell lines for various chemotherapeutic agents. Compared with PFOS, 6:2 Cl-PFESA demonstrated a more pro-MDR effect on PC cells in vitro. In vivo experiments further revealed that PFOS/6:2 Cl-PFESA exposures significantly reduced the efficacy of PTX in PC, with inhibition rates dropping from 78.3% to 23.8%/6.1%, respectively (p < 0.05). This effect was driven by the aberrant activation of the PI3K–ABCB1 pathway, with 6:2 Cl-PFESA demonstrating a stronger capacity to promote this signal pathway’s expression and function compared with PFOS. These data suggest that exposure to PFAS may elevate the risk of MDR and subsequent disease progression. Although marketed as a safer alternative to PFOS, the notable impact of 6:2 Cl-PFESA on MDR highlights the necessity for a comprehensive assessment of its potential carcinogenic risks."
10.1029/2023JD039300,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文利用卫星观测数据（AntAir v1.0数据集）研究了南极洲麦克默多干谷地区冬季焚风的影响。研究者结合地面气象站数据和区域气候模式模拟结果，采用地统计建模方法反演近地表气温，并利用自组织映射和数据合成方法分析了焚风事件。最终，论文首次绘制了南极干谷地区13年来焚风导致增温的时空分布图，展现了卫星遥感技术在区域气候研究中的应用，特别是对极地地区近地表气温变化的监测和分析。,"['Near-surface air temperature', 'Thermal infrared', 'Satellite-based remote sensing', 'Foehn wind', 'Spatial climatology', 'Antarctica', 'Geostatistical modeling']",R.

We have detected and assessed Foehn signatures using a combined data analysis approach from previously developed and validated Antarctic‐wide near‐surface Air temperature data set (AntAir), automatic weather stations from the McMurdo Dry Valleys, and regional climate model simulations at 10 km spatial grid resolution. Self‐organizing maps and data compositing methods on regional climate model outputs provided meteorological context for the AntAir‐derived surface climate information. We conclude that AntAir is suitable for surface climatological analyses and improvements are underway to enhance the spatial resolution to sub‐kilometer grid scales. Finally, by applying a Foehn detection algorithm over 13 years, we present the spatial climatological footprints of Foehn‐induced warming across the Dry Valleys of Antarctica for the first time over the austral winters."

We adapt a recently published array processing algorithm, the multichannel maximum‐likelihood (MCML), to the 360° ${}^{\circ}$‐observations of microbaroms. We simulate infrasound propagation using a source model and atmospheric specifications prescribed by NWP models. As this study paves the way for the assimilation of microbarom observations in these models, we assess the different components of our method. The sensitivity of the NWP model assessments to the acoustic propagation is investigated. We demonstrate the limitations of a parametrized attenuation solely driven by atmospheric fields at the infrasound station (a method previously used due to its computational efficiency) by comparing it with an explicit simulation retaining the whole 3D atmospheric fields. Importantly, in the microbarom simulations, we account for the array response to allow one‐to‐one comparisons with observations. We also highlight an observed intermittent semi‐diurnal periodicity, whose occurrence depends on middle‐atmospheric conditions, pointing at arrivals from the mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Hence, its variability needs to be accounted for in the simulations. We use a circular optimal transport metric to quantify differences between simulated and observed microbarom azimuthal distributions in a systematic way. We present NWP models relative performances diagnostics over periods of interest, including a sudden stratospheric warming in January 2021. We discuss how our approach provides insights into the model performances in the middle atmosphere."

Wright,Exploring Sources of Gravity Waves in the Southern Winter Stratosphere Using 3‐D Satellite Observations and Backward Ray‐Tracing,"During austral winter, the southern high latitudes has some of the most intense stratospheric gravity wave (GW) activity globally. However, producing accurate representations of GW dynamics in this region in numerical models has proved exceptionally challenging. One reason for this is that questions remain regarding the relative contributions of orographic and non‐orographic sources of GWs here. We use three‐dimensional (3‐D) satellite GW observations from the Atmospheric Infrared Sounder in austral winter 2012 in combination with the Gravity‐wave Regional Or Global Ray Tracer to backward trace GW rays to their sources. We trace over 14.2 million rays, through ERA5 reanalysis background atmosphere, to their lower atmospheric sources. We find that GWs observed thousands of km downstream can be traced back to key orographic regions, and that on average, all waves (orographic and non‐orographic) converge meridionally over the Southern Ocean. We estimate that across this winter, orographic sources contribute around ∼ ${\sim} $ 5%–35% to the total momentum flux (MF) observed near 60° ${}^{\circ}$S. The remaining proportion consists of waves from non‐orographic sources, which although typically carry lower MF, the large spatial extent of non‐orographic sources leads to a higher overall contribution. We also quantify the proportion of MF traced back to different regions across the whole southern high latitudes area in order to measure the relative importance of these different regions. These results provide the important insights needed to advance our knowledge of the atmospheric momentum budget in the southern high latitudes."
10.1029/2023JD040039,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文研究了2018年2月1日和4日苏门答腊西海岸附近两次离岸降水事件。它利用多种数据来源，包括ERA5、MERRA-2再分析数据，IMERG卫星降水数据， Padang雷达数据以及WRF模式的云分辨模拟结果，来研究陆风、重力波和对流性出流在这两次事件中的作用。研究发现，陆风和对流性出流是驱动离岸对流的主要因素，重力波的作用较小。陆风引发对流，而对流性出流通过产生额外的辐合带和加强对流来增强和维持离岸传播。 这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据（IMERG）和数值天气预报模式（WRF）来研究降水过程。  研究中分析的变量，例如大气湿度、风场和云特性，都与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['precipitation', 'atmospheric water vapor', 'cloud properties', 'remote sensing', 'weather radar', 'satellite observations', 'IMERG', 'ERA5', 'MERRA-2', 'WRF model', 'numerical weather prediction']",Johnathan Stoddard;Zhaoxia Pu,Multi‐Scale Interactions Associated With Two Offshore Rainfall Events Near the West Coast of Sumatra,"This study investigates the offshore propagation of precipitation off the west coast of Sumatra on February 1 and 4, 2018, focusing on specific events to complement previous studies on seasonality. We use ERA5, MERRA–2, IMERG, Padang radar data, and cloud‐permitting scale simulations with WRF‐ARW V4.1.3 to understand the roles of the land breeze, gravity waves, and convective outflow in these two events. On February 1, convection organizes north of Padang and propagates approximately 100 km offshore. On February 4, a multicellular system organizes south of Padang and travels over 150 km offshore. Large‐scale environmental conditions reveal stronger westerly winds from the Indian Ocean on February 1 and strong northeasterly winds from the South China Sea on February 4. Both events occur in regions with high surface humidity and weak 900 mb winds along the coastline. WRF simulations show that on February 1, the sea breeze uniformly transitions to a land breeze, while on February 4, it forms chaotically. Convective outflow enhances offshore precipitation by interacting with the land breeze, creating additional convergence zones and intensifying convection. Gravity waves played a minor role, contributing to atmospheric instability. The results of this study conclude that offshore‐moving convection is primarily driven by the land breeze and convective outflow, with gravity waves playing a minor role. The land breeze initiates convection, while the convective outflow enhances and sustains offshore propagation by creating additional convergence zones and intensifying convection. Moisture advection precedes nocturnal propagation, increasing atmospheric instability and creating favorable conditions for nighttime offshore precipitation."
10.1029/2024JD041492,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,这篇论文介绍了一种利用卫星观测到的NO2数据区分土壤氮氧化物排放的新方法。研究者比较了卫星观测到的对流层NO2浓度与两种大气成分模型模拟结果的偏差，这两种模拟分别使用了新估算的土壤NOx排放量和Copernicus大气监测服务(CAMS)清单。结果表明，2019年欧洲土壤NOx排放量的平均值为1.7 kg N ha−1 yr−1，大约是CAMS清单的1.7倍。这种差异主要源于森林地区，表明CAMS清单目前低估了欧洲森林地区的土壤NOx排放量。模型评估结果显示，使用DECSO-soil排放量进行模拟的效果明显优于使用CAMS-soil排放量。总的来说，DECSO-soil模拟的RMSE%低于CAMS-soil，春季低约6%，秋季低约2%。该方法可以很容易地推广到世界其他地区，尽管不同地区的月度变化差异很大。,"['Nitrogen oxides (NOx)', 'NO2', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Soil emissions', 'Tropospheric NO2']",Xiaojuan Lin;Ronald van der A;Jos de Laat;Vincent Huijnen;Bas Mijling;Jieying Ding;Henk Eskes;John Douros;Mengyao Liu;Xin Zhang;Zhu Liu,European Soil NOx Emissions Derived From Satellite NO2 Observations,"We introduce an innovative method to distinguish soil nitrogen oxides (NOx = NO + NO2) emissions from satellite‐based total NOx emissions. To evaluate the approach, we compare the deviation between the tropospheric NO2 concentration observed by satellite and two atmospheric composition model simulations driven by the newly estimated soil NOx emissions and the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) inventory. The estimated average soil NOx emissions in Europe are 1.7 kg N ha−1 yr−1 in 2019, and the annual soil NOx emissions are approximately 1.7 times larger than that of the CAMS inventory. The discrepancy originates mainly from the forests, which would mean that the soil NOx emissions over forest areas in Europe are currently underestimated by the CAMS inventory. The model evaluation indicates that the simulations driven by DECSO‐soil emissions performed significantly better than using CAMS‐soil. Overall, the simulated RMSE% of DECSO‐soil is lower than that of CAMS‐soil, approximately 6% lower in spring and 2% lower in autumn. Our method can easily be extended to other regions in the world despite having monthly variations that are very different from those in Europe."

 A comprehensive (1-year-long) daily-resolved filter-based PM2.5 chemical speciation database was built over Cyprus (Eastern Mediterranean), encompassing various sites with different typologies (urban traffic, urban background and regional background). Such experimental strategy was designed and implemented with the view to quantify the contribution of local (Cypriot cities) versus regional (Eastern Mediterranean & Middle East) pollution sources on fine PM levels in Cyprus using the “Lenschow” approach. On an annual basis, fine PM fraction originated mainly from regional sources (53–61 %), while during winter a totally different pattern was observed, with local PM sources being the dominant ones (up to 70 %) due to enhanced biomass burning for domestic heating and unfavorable meteorological conditions enhancing stagnation and accumulation of air pollution close to the ground. At that period, the urban PM2.5 was found to be predominantly made of carbonaceous species (>70 %). Dust from local sources unexpectedly dominated the summertime local PM2.5 (37–47 %).The results derived from “Lenschow” approach were quantitatively compared against an independent PM source apportionment approach using Positive Matrix Factorization (US EPA PMF 5.0) to assess “more-local” versus “more-regional” PM sources. We show here that both approaches applied over Cyprus have led to consistently similar results, further cross-validating the robustness of the two techniques. The influence of regional hotspots was further confirmed by using the Potential Source Contribution Function (PSCF) model which pinpointed the Middle East as the main source region of fine PM pollution affecting Cyprus."

 Rossby Wave Breaking (RWB) propels stratospheric ozone (O3) into the troposphere resulting in an augmentation of tropospheric ozone levels and leading to subsequent alterations in the tropospheric chemistry. Given the profound implications, it is crucial to understand RWB-induced ozone variations comprehensively beyond localized production and transport, particularly over densely populated Indian subcontinent. In this context, we investigated the role of RWB on tropospheric ozone variability followed by its relative contribution at the lower levels by leveraging the data from Atmospheric Infrared Sounder (AIRS) onboard Aqua satellite, along with Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) global reanalysis. In this study, we used 232 RWB events for the period 2004–2021, revealing an enhancement of ozone concentration from the daily mean of corresponding RWB days in a climatological aspect. We examine the fraction of events that allows the stratospheric ozone transport down to the lower troposphere by analyzing the presence of significantly increased stratospheric ozone tracers (SOT) obtained from CAMS over the Indian subcontinent at various pressure levels during RWB days. Additionally, we subjectively examine stratospheric ozone intrusions into the lower troposphere using SOT and ozone from CAMS on a centroid based relative domain. Our findings reveal that only 46% of the total RWB events facilitate stratospheric ozone transport up to the surface level. Further, analysis reveals an enhancement of ozone before and after the maximum breaking, primarily in upper atmospheric levels. Our results also showed that the intrusion intensity yields diverse increments in various tropospheric layers (e.g., 150–250 ppbv at 100–250 hPa layers). Lower tropospheric ozone variations (850 hPa) to RWB correlates with intrusion intensity, resulting in anomalous changes of about 10–20 ppbv. It is observed that the upper-level positive potential vorticity anomalies catalyze ozone intrusion from the stratosphere, descending to lower levels on intense breaking days through downward transport. These findings deepen our understanding of RWB-induced tropospheric ozone variability and its relative contribution to the ozone changes over the subcontinent."

 Sulfur deposition (Sdep) is an important process of sulfur cycling in terrestrial ecosystems, thus estimating the spatiotemporal variations of Sdep is crucial to understand its impact on terrestrial ecosystems. Taking the developed Yangtze River Delta (YRD) in eastern China as the study area, the Sdep (in forms of gas-phase dry, particle-phase dry, and wet) were estimated based on the observations of sulfur dioxide (SO2) concentrations from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). The results showed that: the average Sdep flux in the YRD was 27.45 ± 8.60 kg S ha−1 yr−1, and the total Sdep was mainly attributed to the wet deposition (wet: dry = 1.43). The Sdep experienced a significant decreasing trend, which decreased by 36.81% in 2020, compared with that in 2006. In terms of spatial distribution, Sdep showed strong variations, ranging from 9.70 to 67.51 kg S ha−1 yr−1; the high-value hotspots, which were initially distributed in the northern border regions of the study area, along the Yangtze River, and the Hangjiahu Plain in Zhejiang, have moved to the Wanzhong Plain in Anhui and the Jinqu Basin in Zhejiang during 2006–2020; the rate of change in urban Sdep was significantly higher than that in rural areas, with an average annual rate of change of −1.15 against −0.79 kg S ha−1 yr−1.

Most of the studies have focused on developing drought forecasting techniques, but limited attention has been made to the theory of drought predictability, such as dynamics of meteorological drought predictability and possible driving mechanism. Here, we characterized the predictability of meteorological drought, based on the Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE"") coefficient of support vector machine regression model. Then we measured the spatial distribution, agglomeration, and dynamic changes of drought predictability, and quantitatively analyzed the main driving forces and relationships of the spatial and temporal dynamics. The Loess Plateau (LP), which is a drought-prone region with frail ecological environment in China, was chosen as a case study. Results indicated that: (1) drought predictability in the western region was higher than that in the eastern region of the LP, with the hot spots concentrated in the western sandy land and agricultural irrigation; (2) meteorological drought predictability in the LP showed a downward trend from 1962 to 2019 under the changing environment, which the autumn drought predictability declined significantly; (3) meteorological, terrestrial factors and air-sea coupling elements dominated the spatial-temporal pattern of meteorological drought predictability via strongly affecting the coefficient of variation of drought index series, and related causal paths were explored. This study sheds new light on drought predictability dynamics under a changing environment, and has significance for improving the ability of drought forecasting, warning, and mitigation."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2024.107846,True,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文研究了气候和植被变化对东亚地区沙尘活动年际变化的影响。研究使用了区域气候模式 (RegCM4.9.5) 和 GeoDetector 分析方法，定量评估了气候和植被变化对沙尘气溶胶光学厚度、柱浓度和排放通量的贡献。结果表明，ENSO 事件是影响东亚沙尘活动年际变化的主要气候因素，植被改善起到了次要但积极的作用，贡献率约为 37%。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及到沙尘气溶胶（一种大气成分）的监测和分析，使用了气候模式模拟和卫星观测数据（例如，气溶胶光学厚度数据可能来自卫星遥感）来研究沙尘活动，并最终应用于空气质量监测和气候变化研究。,"['dust aerosol', 'optical depth', 'satellite observation', 'air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition', 'El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO)', 'climate model', 'vegetation cover']",Ruibo Zhao;Xiaoming Feng;Chaowei Zhou;Yu Zhang;Xuejing Leng;Bojie Fu,El Niño Southern oscillation events contribute significantly to the interannual variations of dust activity over East Asia,"•We identified the factors influencing dust interannual variations and quantified their contributions. •ENSO modulates the interannual variations of dust activities over East Asia. •After El Niño (La Niña) events, the following year's dust activity is usually weaker (stronger) than average. •Vegetation improvement locally mitigates dust activities, with an overall contribution rate of approximately 37 %. 
 The mechanism of climate and vegetation change induced dust variations has been a phenomenal environmental concern in East Asia. However, the extent to which climate and vegetation cover separately affect the interannual variations of dust activity, is little known. Here in our study, the dust interannual variations and the contributions of climate and vegetation changes on dust variations were investigated and quantified through a regional climate model (RegCM4.9.5) and GeoDetector analysis. It is indicated that the dust aerosol optical depth, column burden and emission flux over East Asia all showed fluctuating downward trends followed by subsequent increases during 2000–2018. Climatic factors dominated the interannual variation of dust over East Asia, particularly the modulation of El Niño Southern Oscillation events. Vegetation improvement has occurred in most dust source regions across East Asia, playing a secondary yet positive role in dust variations, with an overall contribution rate of approximately 37 %. The spatial heterogeneity of dust variations in different regions was shaped by the effects of climate change and improved vegetation conditions."
None,False,Atmospheric Research,这篇论文主要研究的是风力涡轮机对闪电定位和特征的影响， 这属于大气物理学范畴，侧重于研究风力涡轮机这种人工建筑物对大气电场和闪电活动的影响，与大气环境遥感技术（例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）关系不大。论文使用了“闪电定位”技术，但这是一种探测闪电的技术，并非用于大气环境遥感监测。,"['lightning', 'wind turbine', 'atmospheric electricity']",Serge Soula;Jean-François Georgis;David Salaün,"Corrigendum to “Quantifying the effect of wind turbines on lightning location and characteristics” [Atmospheric Research Volume 221, 30 January 2019]",
