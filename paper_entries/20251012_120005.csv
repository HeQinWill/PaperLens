10.5194/acp-25-12599-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文通过飞机和研究船在西太平洋不同高度采集气溶胶样本，分析了气溶胶的成分和混合状态。研究发现，气溶胶受到西伯利亚森林生物质燃烧和海盐的影响，并且在不同高度、粒径和气溶胶来源地表现出不同的成分。虽然该研究没有直接使用遥感技术，但其对气溶胶成分和混合状态的分析，对于提高大气环境遥感监测（如空气质量监测和卫星观测）的准确性具有重要意义，尤其是在理解气溶胶对气候的影响方面。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术具有较强的相关性。,"['aerosol composition', 'aerosol mixing state', 'biomass burning', 'sea spray', 'altitude', 'air quality monitoring (indirectly)', 'atmospheric composition analysis']",Kouji Adachi;Atsushi Yoshida;Tatsuhiro Mori;Nobuhiro Moteki;Sho Ohata;Kazuyuki Kita;Yoshimi Kawai;Makoto Koike,Individual particle compositions and aerosol mixing states at different altitudes over the ocean in East Asia,"This study measured the compositions and mixing states of individual aerosol particles collected at different altitudes over the western North Pacific by simultaneous sampling from an aircraft and a research vessel. The results showed that they were strongly influenced by Siberian Forest biomass burning and mixed with sea spray, and various aerosol compositions were identified at different altitudes, sizes, and aerosol sources, highlighting a wide range of individual particle compositions. 
 Aerosol composition and mixing state influence its ability to form cloud droplets and ice crystals and to scatter and absorb sunlight, all of which affect its impact on climate. In this study, aerosol samples were collected from different altitudes, ranging from the sea surface to ∼ 8000 m, over the ocean in the western North Pacific in the summer of 2022 using an aircraft and a research vessel. The samples were classified into three periods based on the sampled air parcel sources: ocean and desert (period 1), Siberian Forest biomass burning event (period 2), and their mixtures (period 3). Measurements of particle composition using transmission electron microscopy with energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry revealed that samples from period 1 had high sea salt and mineral dust fractions, whereas samples from period 2 had high fractions of potassium-bearing particles with organics and black carbon. Samples from period 3 showed influences of both sea spray and biomass burning. During periods 1 and 3, the sea salt fractions increased as the samples were collected at lower altitudes. The compositions of biomass burning and sea spray were mixed at individual particles, with higher fractions of Na and K during period 1 and period 2, respectively, than in other periods. Our analysis of individual particles revealed a wide range of compositions and mixing states of particles, which depend on the aerosol source, size, and altitude. These factors need to be considered when evaluating aerosol composition and mixing state, both of which affect aerosol climate effects."

We show that PMC height controls ice particle properties and propose a new formation mechanism involving charged meteoric smoke particle nucleation (CMN scheme). This scheme introduces the cold-trap effect for H2O redistribution, which are fundamentally bottom-up driven by upwelling. These findings provide new insights into PMC formation and water dynamics. 
 Polar mesospheric clouds (PMCs), composed of ice particles, play a crucial role in mesospheric H2O redistribution, yet their formation mechanism remains incompletely understood. Using the Aeronomy of Ice in the Mesosphere (AIM) satellite observations, we reveal a previously unreported hemispheric asymmetry: southern hemisphere PMCs show a significant latitudinal decrease in column ice particle concentration, while their northern hemisphere counterparts exhibit zero trend. Our further analysis demonstrates that the column-averaged ice particle concentration (Nc) and radius (rc) are primarily governed by PMC height (h), rather than environmental temperature (Tenv). To explain these observations, we propose the charged meteoric smoke particle (MSP) nucleation (CMN) scheme, an altitude-dependent framework based on two key postulates: (1) charged-MSPs serve as ubiquitous ice nuclei throughout the PMC layer, and (2) ice particles grow predominantly in situ with negligible sedimentation. The CMN scheme naturally accounts for the observed vertical gradients in ice particle concentration (increasing with altitude due to charged-MSPs distribution) and size (decreasing with altitude due to H2O competition among ice particles). By eliminating sedimentation, the CMN scheme introduces a novel bottom-up H2O redistribution mechanism we term the cold-trap effect. This mechanism is driven by summer polar upwelling dynamics: upward H2O transport induces hydration, while simultaneous ice particle formation (facilitated by upwelling-induced cooling) blocks further H2O transport, ultimately causing dehydration above PMCs. While the traditional growth-sedimentation (GS) scheme and freeze-drying effect are well-validated, our CMN scheme and cold-trap effect provide an alternative paradigm particularly for understanding zonal and daily-scale PMC variability and associated H2O redistribution processes."

This article presents a method coupling an offline ice nucleus counter to an electron microscope to obtain information, not only about INP number concentrations but also about physico-chemical properties (e.g., size and chemical composition) relevant to ice nucleation on single particles. The method was evaluated on the basis of a case study at the high-altitude research station Jungfraujoch. 
 To understand and predict the formation of clouds and precipitation and their influence on our climate, it is crucial to know the characteristics and abundance of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) in the atmosphere. As the ice-nucleating efficiency is a result of individual particle properties, detailed knowledge of these properties is essential. Here, an offline method for the comprehensive single-particle analysis of ambient INPs that benefits from the combination of two instruments already used for ice nucleation measurements is presented, focusing on the methodological description of the coupling, whereby strengths and weaknesses of the method are discussed.First, the aerosol is sampled on silicon wafers. INPs are then activated at different temperature and humidity conditions in the deposition nucleation and condensation freezing mode using a static diffusion chamber. The positions of grown ice crystals are defined by a coordinate system, which allows for recovery and detailed analysis of the individual INPs by a scanning electron microscope. Based on their physico-chemical properties (elemental composition and morphology) the INPs can be classified into categories. In combination with the size information, a size-resolved distribution of the INP classes can be determined. Such results are useful for evaluating INP-type-specific parametrizations, e.g., for use in atmospheric modeling and in closure studies.A case study from the high-altitude research station Jungfraujoch, Switzerland shows that the targeted INP analysis as obtained by this method is able to identify the main INP classes in reliable proportions. Most of the deposition-nucleation-mode and condensation-freezing-mode INPs activated at −30 °C, indicating a geogenic mineral origin (mainly aluminosilicates / Al-rich particles but also carbonates and silica). Other major contributors were carbonaceous particles, consisting of both smaller soot particles and larger biological particles and mixed particles (mostly Al / C mixed particles). The INPs had projected area diameters ranging from 300 nm–35 µm, with a distinct maximum at 1–2 µm. Mineral particles were present throughout the entire size range, while mixed particles were identified in higher abundances at sizes of 3 µm and above. Minor contributions were seen from sulfates and metal oxides, the latter with an increased proportion in the size range below 500 nm. During a Saharan dust event, a significant increase in mineral particles in the INP composition was detected."

The simulated cloud hydrometeors distributions varied significantly depending on model initial conditions, typhoon structures, and microphysics schemes. Results in this study demonstrate the potential for using PRO observation to evaluate the performance of different microphysics schemes in numerical models. 
 A novel radio occultation (RO) technique, polarimetric RO (PRO), has recently been developed to measure differential polarimetric phase shift together with traditional RO products such as bending angle and refractivity. PRO observations have been shown to be associated with the vertical structure of cloud hydrometeors. With this unique measurement capability, the PRO soundings could potentially be used to evaluate model microphysics parameterization. This study compared PRO observations with WRF simulations of three typhoon cases in 2019 and 2021, initialized with ERA5 and NCEP FNL global analysis, respectively, with five microphysics parameterizations (Purdue Lin, WSM6, Goddard, Thompson, and Morrison). There is notable variability in the distribution of the model's hydrometeors, which could be affected by the initial conditions, microphysics parameterization schemes, typhoon locations, circulation, and rainbands. The results in this study show that WRF simulations using the Goddard, Thompson, and Morrison schemes generally place the peak differential phase at the altitudes close to those observed by PAZ PRO. Among them, the Goddard microphysics scheme performs best in typhoon track prediction and the simulation of maximum differential phase shift when compared with PRO observations. The ensemble mean from 36 ensemble forecasts also exhibits consistent results with the deterministic run. The comparative results demonstrate that PRO data have the potential to evaluate the performance of different microphysics schemes in numerical models."

Satellites enable monitoring of these emissions from space. Our simulations show that the upcoming Twin ANthropogenic Greenhouse gas Observers (TANGO) mission can detect about 500 targets per 4 d cycle under clear skies, but cloud cover reduces detection. Integrating cloud forecasts into TANGO’s manoeuvering boosts detection, highlighting its potential for improving global emission monitoring. 
 Targeting satellite observations offer a promising avenue for detecting and quantifying anthropogenic greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from localized point sources at high spatial resolution. In this study, we assess the detection potential of the Twin ANthropogenic Greenhouse gas Observers (TANGO) satellite mission, scheduled for 2028, using orbit simulations and the TNO global point source (GPS) inventory. We examine its target selection approach across three observational scenarios, clear sky, cloud filtered, and cloud forecast, by applying two prioritization schemes (one favouring CH4 point sources over CO2 and the other vice versa). Results show that, under current detection limits (TDLs), TANGO can detect a large fraction of major point sources, identifying ∼500 targets per repeat cycle, depending on the prioritization scheme employed. However, cloud cover significantly reduces observational yield (∼ 64 %–68 % fewer detections). Integrating a cloud-forecast-informed target selection improves the total number of detected targets by 34.6 % under CO2 prioritization and 22.1 % under CH4 prioritization compared to the cloud-filtered scenario, demonstrating the benefits of adaptive observation strategies. We also explore a hypothetical enhanced detection limit (EDL) scenario, representing the potential for future satellites with improved sensitivity. While EDL extends the range of observable sources, many of these smaller emitters are associated with greater uncertainties, highlighting the importance of well-characterized retrieval precision. Finally, we discuss the potential benefits of a satellite constellation, which could enhance revisit times and observational frequency for sources of key interest. Our results demonstrate TANGO as a case study for the capabilities and challenges of next-generation targeting satellite missions, highlighting the importance of high-resolution GHG monitoring and cloud-aware adaptation for improving global emission quantification."

To improve understanding of the climate effects of radiative forcing associated with aviation‐induced cirrus clouds, we use the Community Earth System Model CESM1.2.2 to perform simulations with stylized longwave and shortwave forcing agents in different latitude bands. We find that for the same concentration, longwave absorbers in the sub‐tropics have the largest magnitude of instantaneous radiative forcing but these absorbers in the polar regions show the largest impact on global temperature. In contrast, shortwave scatterers in the low latitudes have the largest magnitude of effective and instantaneous radiative forcing, but the global temperature response is not highly sensitive to the latitude of forcing.

These ensembles often require aggregation to summarize information based on specific criteria or conditions. However, previous research using global change scenario ensembles has largely overlooked how the choice of aggregation method influences the interpretation of results. To address this gap, we leverage a large ensemble data set designed to capture broad energy system dynamics generated using the Global Change Analysis Model. We first explore how energy‐related uncertainties are propagated to both global and regional water‐energy‐food sectors. We then conduct a rank correlation analysis across seven ensemble aggregation measures and demonstrate the need to consider multiple measures in global change scenarios. Our results suggest that global water and food sector outcomes in the 21st century vary widely depending on different scenario assumptions. The global energy productivity is projected to improve by the end of the century across all scenarios. Moreover, regions facing water scarcity challenges in 2100 do not always overlap with those facing extreme energy and food sector outcomes. Although rank correlations across seven aggregation measures are relatively stable across sectors, we identify cases where relying on a single measure leads to losing critical information in the full ensemble. Reliance on a single aggregation measure can distort the interpretation of global change scenario outcomes. Instead, adopting multiple ensemble aggregation measures provides a more holistic understanding of global change scenario ensembles."

However, it is unclear whether measuring soil lead is an effective way to screen for risk at the community or neighborhood level, nor if soil lead is a significant predictor of elevated blood lead levels (EBLLs) beyond other socioeconomic and physical environment covariates.

We present city‐scale soil lead and IEUBK risk maps for Chicago. Furthermore, while median household income remains the strongest single predictor of EBLL prevalence in our models, we provide evidence that soil lead independently contributes significant predictive power.

However, current studies tend to examine individual metals in isolation and rely on traditional linear regression models, which may not adequately reflect the complex, non‐linear and interactive effects of mixed metal exposure. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between maternal mixed urinary HM exposure levels during pregnancy and adverse birth outcomes such as preterm birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW) and small for gestational age (SGA) infants using advanced machine learning methods. This study was conducted at a tertiary hospital in Guilin, from 2022 to 2023. A total of 489 pregnant women were enrolled. First‐trimester urine samples were collected to quantify HM concentrations using Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. Demographic and clinical data were obtained through structured questionnaires. Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression analysis revealed a significant cumulative effect of mixed metal exposure on adverse pregnancy outcomes, with distinct dose‐response relationships. The risk of PTB and LBW increased monotonically with higher exposure levels; the adjusted odds ratios were elevated as metal mixture concentrations increased from the 25th to the 75th percentile. In contrast, the association with SGA exhibited a non‐monotonic pattern—higher risk at lower exposure levels and a marked decline in risk at higher concentrations. Inorganic arsenic was identified as the primary toxic component in univariate models. Multivariate response modeling demonstrated the joint influence of metal mixtures on adverse outcomes (AUC = 0.697), with no significant statistical interactions between individual metals, as indicated by parallel dose‐response curves (p > 0.05)."

 Enzymes are the molecular machines of life, and a key property that governs their function is substrate specificity—the ability of an enzyme to recognize and selectively act on particular substrates. This specificity originates from the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the enzyme active site and complicated transition state of the reaction1,2. Many enzymes can promiscuously catalyze reactions or act on substrates beyond those for which they were originally evolved1,3-5. However, millions of known enzymes still lack reliable substrate specificity information, impeding their practical applications and comprehensive understanding of the biocatalytic diversity in nature. Herein, we developed a cross-attention-empowered SE(3)-equivariant graph neural network architecture named EZSpecificity for predicting enzyme substrate specificity, which was trained on a comprehensive tailor-made database of enzyme-substrate interactions at sequence and structural levels. EZSpecificity outperformed the existing machine learning models for enzyme substrate specificity prediction, as demonstrated by both an unknown substrate and enzyme database and seven proof-of-concept protein families. Experimental validation with eight halogenases and 78 substrates revealed that EZSpecificity achieved a 91.7% accuracy in identifying the single potential reactive substrate, significantly higher than that of the state-of-the-art model ESP (58.3%). EZSpecificity represents a general machine learning model for accurate prediction of substrate specificity for enzymes related to fundamental and applied research in biology and medicine."

Here authors report changes in sperm noncoding RNAs in SARS-CoV-2 infected sires and increased anxiety-like behaviors in offspring. 
 Given that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, and the COVID-19 pandemic, constitutes a major environmental challenge faced by billions of people worldwide, we investigated whether paternal pre-conceptual SARS-CoV-2 infection has impacts on sperm RNA content, and intergenerational (F1) and transgenerational (F2) effects on offspring phenotypes. Using an established mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 (P21) preclinical model, we infected adult male mice with the virus, or performed a mock control infection, and bred them with naïve female mice four weeks later, when males were no longer infectious. Here we show that offspring of infected sires display increased anxiety-like behaviors. Additionally, the F1 offspring have significant transcriptomic changes in their hippocampus. Various sperm small noncoding RNAs, including PIWI-interacting RNAs, transfer-derived RNAs and microRNAs, are differentially altered by prior paternal SARS-CoV-2 infection. Microinjection of RNA from the sperm of SARS-CoV-2 infected males into fertilized oocytes leads to a phenotype resembling that of the naturally born F1 offspring, supporting the interpretation that sperm RNAs are contributing to the outcomes of our paternal SARS-CoV-2 model. Therefore, this study provides evidence that paternal SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts sperm and affects offspring phenotypes. These findings have public-health implications and inform further research in males affected by COVID-19, and their offspring.

 The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (fAPAR) of vegetation canopies is a crucial variable for understanding the ecosystem carbon cycle and assessing vegetation responses to climate change. Light absorption of the vegetation canopy is mainly determined by canopy structure and leaf optical properties. Traditional remote sensing methods typically estimate fAPAR from reflectance signals using radiative transfer models or empirical relationships with vegetation indices (VIs) and fAPAR. However, reflectance-based estimates often show moderate accuracy due to the complex relationship between reflected and absorbed fluxes. Airborne LiDAR provides direct information on canopy structural attributes relevant to radiation interception, such as fractional vegetation cover (fCover), which has been used to estimate fAPAR. However, the shortcomings of LiDAR in capturing the role of leaf optical properties introduce some uncertainty in fAPAR estimation. Combining reflectance with LiDAR data offers a promising pathway for improving fAPAR estimation. In this study, we adapted a physically-based model (fAPARRL) to integrate reflectance and LiDAR observations for fAPAR estimation. This model is grounded in spectral invariant theory and represents fAPAR as a function of visible and near-infrared reflectance and a LiDAR-derived canopy structural parameter. The model was evaluated against both VI- and LiDAR-based methods using NEON field datasets and synthetic datasets generated by the one-dimensional SCOPE and three-dimensional LESS radiative transfer models. Across these datasets, the combination of LiDAR and reflectance through the fAPARRL model consistently outperformed VI- and LiDAR-based approaches, with respective maximum improvements in R2 of 0.47 and 0.09. Sensitivity analyses on the simulated datasets further indicated that fAPARRL exhibited higher robustness to variations in chlorophyll content and leaf area index (LAI) than other conventional methods. The proposed fAPARRL model effectively integrates reflectance and LiDAR data through a physically-based scheme, offering improved accuracy and robustness for large-scale fAPAR estimation and ecosystem monitoring."

Similarly, intercomparisons with ATMS observations showed biases within ±1 K and a standard deviation of 2–3 K.A random forest-based method was employed to retrieve specific humidity profiles from EOS-07 MHS observations demonstrated agreement with ERA5 reanalysis and radiosonde observations. Compared with radiosonde data, the mean bias and standard deviation of retrieved specific humidity were approximately 0.78 g/kg and 2.3 g/kg, respectively. The mean percentage bias was within ±20 % below the 800 hPa pressure level, and ranged between ±20 % and ± 40 % above the 800 hPa pressure level. Relative to ERA5, the mean bias and root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) were under 30 % and 50 %, respectively.

 In current super-resolution (SR) research, blind SR models capable of handling multiple degradations have attracted significant attention. Inspired by variational autoencoders (VAEs) that model data distributions through latent representations, this paper proposes a VAE framework for unsupervised remote sensing image (RSI) SR. VAEs excel at learning rich latent representations, modeling probabilistic distributions of input data and unsupervised learning, making them inherently well-suited to real-world blind SR scenarios. The proposed framework consists of an encoder that maps low-resolution (LR) images into a latent space and a decoder that reconstructs super-resolved images from the latent representations. To enhance latent modeling, an alternating optimization strategy is implemented for training the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, a comprehensive loss function and a latent coding regularization strategy are designed to constrain latent representations while maintaining image domain consistency. Experimental results demonstrate that on synthetic data, our method achieves favorable performance in both visual quality and quantitative metrics. It also demonstrates competitively performance compared to supervised methods, particularly in 4× and 8× SR tasks. Additionally, evaluations on Jilin-1 satellite RSIs further validate the effectiveness of our approach."

 In temperate regions, farm roadway networks exist on grassland farms to provide an efficient means to move dairy and beef animals between grazed paddocks and farmyards. During their movement, excreta is deposited on the roadway surface, resulting in phosphorus (P) enriched roadway runoff during rainfall events, which could impact water quality. Although national roadway networks have been mapped using deep learning approaches, internal farm roadway network mapping remains a knowledge gap. The objectives of this study were to develop an integrated workflow tailored to agricultural roadway mapping and runoff risk assessment through training a deep learning model to automatically detect and map internal farm roadways using high-resolution aerial imagery and further evaluating roadway sections that have the potential to generate roadway runoff with associated risk of water pollution. Three (3) model architectures (U-Net, PSPNet and DeepLab V3+) were tested and the best performing model was PSPNet with ResNet-50 backbone. The selected model demonstrated an overall performance of 0.79, 0.86, 0.82, 0.69 and 0.90 for precision, recall, F1 score IoU and overall accuracy, respectively.

This study investigates the relationship between ambient maximum 8-h moving average ozone concentrations (O3-8h) and exposure to heatwaves and cold spells, and their impact on non-accidental, cardiovascular, and respiratory mortality. Using a case-crossover design, we analyzed 248,060 non-accidental deaths in Qingpu, Shanghai, China, from 2012 to 2019. Heatwaves and cold spells were defined as periods of sustained extreme temperatures lasting more than two consecutive days. Various temperature thresholds and durations were used to define these events at the grid level. Conditional logistic regression models were employed to assess exposure-response relationships and additive interactions. The odds ratio (OR) for non-accidental mortality associated with low O3-8h concentrations during heatwaves (defined as P92.5_3d) was 1.096 (95 % CI: 0.954, 1.260), compared to low O3-8h without heatwave exposure.

 This study addresses the issues of why monsoon gyres (MGs) tend to appear over the western North Pacific in mid-summer and how tropical cyclone (TC) activity characterizes the MGs in terms of monthly and synoptic scales. On a monthly scale, a low-level anomalous cyclonic circulation to the south of Japan is well correlated with enhanced tropical convection to the southeast in active MG years, indicating a signature of the Rossby wave response to convective heating. The monthly mean features of MGs can be interpreted as a superposition of the climatological monsoon trough and the low-level cyclonic circulation anomaly due to the Rossby wave response. In addition, TCs tend to occur in the southern and eastern periphery of the MG in active MG years, suggesting a possible interaction between the MG and TCs. On a synoptic scale, the outer circulations of individual TCs accompany the moisture conveyor belt (MCB) and have the potential to induce MGs. Furthermore, the replacement of the outer circulation due to multiple TCs occurs repeatedly through the development of the MCB. Such replacement contributes to prolonging the life span of MGs, although the outer circulation of a single TC hardly maintains an MG for more than a week. It is found that synoptic-scale MGs are the collective manifestation of individual TCs and their outer circulations, while the characteristics of the Rossby wave response to TC-related heating become increasingly evident in MGs on longer timescales. These multiple-time-scale features are the essence of the MG."

 The interaction between the El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and Antarctic stratospheric ozone represents an important tropical-polar coupling mechanism. Using satellite-based observations, reanalysis datasets, and simulations from the global three-dimensional chemical-transport (TOMCAT) and chemistry-climate (WACCM) models, this study investigates how sea surface temperature anomalies (SSTA) associated with ENSO influence ozone variability. The results show that the peak phase of ENSO significantly impacts the interannual variability of Antarctic spring (September–October) stratospheric ozone in decaying years. Specifically, during the decaying year of El Niño (or La Niña), lower stratospheric ozone depletion is reduced (or enhanced) in Antarctic springtime. During the peak phase of El Niño, tropical SSTA intensifies convection and weakens upper tropospheric winds over the central and eastern equatorial Pacific, allowing more wave momentum fluxes from the troposphere into the stratosphere. In the decaying years, anomalous wave trains in both the troposphere and stratosphere link the tropical lower-atmospheric dynamics with the mid-high latitude stratospheric dynamics. Moreover, in the Southern Hemisphere under El Niño, the enhanced upward propagation of planetary waves accelerates the Brewer-Dobson circulation (BDC) and decelerates the mid-latitudes stratospheric zonal wind. Concurrently, polar stratospheric warming destabilizes the polar vortex in the decaying year, suppressing Antarctic springtime ozone depletion. In contrast, following La Niña, these coupling mechanisms typically reverse, leading to mid-latitude stratospheric zonal wind acceleration and polar stratospheric cooling, which strengthen the polar vortex and thus enhance ozone depletion. These findings advance understanding of ENSO-ozone teleconnections and inform ozone recovery predictions."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108550,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注中国地表和高空风速的变化趋势。它利用地面气象站和无线电探空仪的观测数据，分析了中国不同地区地表风速和高空风速的变化情况。研究发现地表风速普遍下降，而高空风速在冬季呈现上升趋势，且高空风速的年际变化较大。虽然风速变化与大气环境有一定关联（例如，影响污染物的扩散），但该研究本身并不直接涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析，而是侧重于气候学和气象学的角度，分析风速的时空变化特征。,"['Wind speed', 'Surface observations', 'Radiosonde observations', 'Upper-air wind speed', 'Climatology', 'Meteorology']",Hairong Li;Song Yang;Cesar Azorin-Molina;Qinghong Zhao;Wentian Qiu;Xi Chen;Kaiqiang Deng,Uncovering seasonal wind speed changes across China using surface and upper-air observations,"•Surface and radiosonde observations are utilized to assess wind speed changes across China •Surface wind speed across China shows a widespread and consistent decline •Upper-air wind speed exhibits increasing trends over northern China during winter •Upper-air wind speed over China shows substantial interannual variability 
 Wind speed is a critical factor influencing hydrological cycles, aviation safety, and renewable energy production. While previous studies have extensively assessed changes in wind speed across China, most have focused on wind speed at ten meters (WS10), with limited attention given to upper-air wind speed (UWS). This study reveals considerable differences in changes and variability of both WS10 and UWS across China, utilizing surface and radiosonde observations. The results indicate a widespread and consistent decline in WS10 throughout China, followed by a recovery trend in many regions since the early 2000s, aligning with findings from prior research. In contrast, UWS does not exhibit consistent seasonal trends across the seasons. During winter, most regions of China have experienced increasing UWS trends, particularly in northern areas. However, in summer, UWS trends shift significantly toward negative values, especially at higher pressure levels. Vertically, coherent trends between the lower and upper troposphere are primarily observed in winter and summer, likely influenced by the strong westerly jet stream and East Asian monsoon circulation, respectively. Instead of following the long-term trends observed in WS10, UWS displays considerable interannual variations. These findings underscore the importance of considering vertical, regional, and seasonal dimensions when assessing wind changes and variability in China."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108546,False,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文主要关注使用WRF模型模拟雷电事件，并评估不同初始条件对模拟结果的影响。研究重点在于气象条件（如温度、湿度、降水）对雷电发生的影响，以及不同初始数据集（如ERA5、FNL、GDAS-FNL、GFS）在雷电模拟中的表现。虽然涉及大气过程，但与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析）没有直接关联，主要侧重于气象模拟和雷电预测。,"['lightning simulation', 'WRF model', 'thunderstorm', 'initial conditions', 'meteorological parameters', 'precipitation']",Fathima Nima K K;Unashish Mondal;S.K. Panda;Radheshyam Sharma;Devesh Sharma,Evaluating the impact of initial conditions on lightning simulation over Rajasthan: A synoptic and modelling approach using the WRF model,"•Intense lightning event in Jaipur on 11 July 2021 caused over 11 fatalities. •Sensitivity of WRF lightning simulations tested with four IBC datasets. •ERA5 IBC showed best accuracy (0.67) and highest POD, CSI, and HSS scores. •ERA5 best captured temperature, humidity, precipitation & lightning patterns. 
 An intense thunderstorm accompanied by lightning strikes claimed the lives of more than 11 people in Jaipur, Rajasthan, on 11th July 2021. This study investigates the influence of different Initial Conditions (ICs) on the simulation of this lightning event using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model. Various datasets Global Forecast System GFS (0.25° x 0.25°), Global Data Assimilation System (GDAS)/ (FINAL) GDAS-FNL (0.25° x 0.25°), FNL (1° x 1°), and ERA5 (0.25° x 0.25°) were used as to assess their impact on model performance. The objectives of this study are to analyses the synoptic conditions associated with the thunderstorm and lightning event, evaluate the sensitivity of lightning simulations to different initial condition, and understand how these conditions influence the spatial and temporal distribution of lightning. The study also aims to assess how ICs affect the accuracy and predictability of lightning simulation. A comprehensive examination of meteorological factors during the onset of the monsoon season highlights the conditions that triggered this severe lightning event. Results show that between 1400 and 1600 UTC, when the event occurred, simulations using ERA5 outperformed FNL, GDAS-FNL, and GFS. ERA5 yielded the highest accuracy (0.67), along with improved scores for Probability of Detection (POD = 0.85), Critical Success Index (CSI = 0.53), and Heidke Skill Score (HSS = 0.36). The simulated lightning flash counts from ERA5 closely aligned with lightning observations over Rajasthan. Furthermore, the study evaluates the strengths and limitations of each ICs in representing key meteorological parameters such as temperature, humidity, precipitation, and lightning activity. Overall, the findings suggest that the ERA5 dataset provides the most reliable input for simulating precipitation and lightning over the region."
10.1016/j.atmosres.2025.108531,True,Atmospheric Research,该研究论文分析了北极地区（Ny-Å lesund）的降水垂直演变及其相关大气参数。论文利用地面观测数据（2020-2024年），结合微雨雷达（MRR）、雨滴谱仪和云高仪等设备，研究了不同类型降水的微物理演变过程，以及与大气参数的关系。研究重点关注了液态和固态降水的季节性垂直分布，并探讨了1.5-2公里高度范围内降水演变的敏感性。该研究旨在提高对北极降水过程的理解，改进卫星降水反演算法，并提升数值天气预报和气候模型在极地地区的性能。虽然主要关注降水，但其方法和目标与大气环境遥感技术（如卫星观测和大气成分分析）密切相关，特别是卫星降水反演部分。,"['precipitation', 'atmospheric profiles', 'remote sensing', 'satellite-based precipitation retrievals', 'ceilometer', 'micro rain radar', 'disdrometer', 'cloud base height', 'vertical distribution']",Lekhraj Saini;Saurabh Das;Nuncio Murukesh,"Vertical evolution of precipitation and associated atmospheric parameters at Ny-Å lesund (78°55′N, 11°56′E) in the Arctic","•Ground based observational data at Ny-Å lesund from 2020-2024 were analysed. •Arctic precipitation were explained using precipitation and atmospheric profiles. •Around 1.5–2 km and 3 km show distinct precipitation evolution processes. 
 The Arctic is experiencing warming nearly twice the global average rate. This significantly affects its precipitation with the snow to rain and mixed phase transitions. Accurate characterization of these changes requires high-resolution vertical profiling of microphysical processes. This study combines surface observation with vertical profiles of the atmospheric parameters and precipitation to investigate the vertical evolution of different forms of Arctic precipitation. Data were collected from the Himadri Research Station, Ny-Å lesund (78°55′N, 11°56′E) in Svalbard, which is a key location along the atmospheric moisture transport pathway into the Arctic. Micro Rain Radar (MRR), disdrometer and ceilometer were used to characterize the type of precipitation and their microphysical evolution up to 6km in altitude, along with the associated cloud base height. The study also explores seasonal variability in the vertical distribution of both liquid and solid precipitation and links their relationship with atmospheric parameters. Different types of precipitation show a varied behavior in terms of vertical evolution and were found to be highly sensitive within 1.5–2 km above the surface altitude. The results are expected to advance the understanding of Arctic precipitation processes, provide critical insights for improving satellite-based precipitation retrievals, and improve the performance of numerical weather prediction and climate models in polar regions."
