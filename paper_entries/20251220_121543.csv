10.1088/1748-9326/ae19ff,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文核心关注农业碳信用机制中不同评估协议的等效性问题，通过分析美国中西部4988个玉米大豆田的案例，揭示不同协议导致的碳信用数量差异。研究重点在于农业土地管理实践与碳信用核算标准，而非涉及卫星遥感、大气成分分析或污染物监测等远程感知技术。文中未提及遥感传感器（如MODIS、Sentinel）、大气模型（如GEOS-Chem）或具体遥感处理算法（如反演算法），主要依赖地面数据集和协议对比分析，因此与大气环境遥感技术关联较弱。,"['carbon crediting', 'agricultural land management', 'no-till', 'cover cropping', 'protocol intercomparison']",Lisa Eash;Mark A Bradford;Emily E Oldfield;Stephen M Ogle;Sara E Kuebbing,Protocol intercomparison project highlights non-equivalent carbon crediting across agricultural land management protocols,"Voluntary markets for agricultural carbon credits are expanding, promoting climate-smart practices purported to increase soil carbon and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. To contribute effectively to climate mitigation, markets must deliver credits that meet international standards guaranteeing credits are additional, conservative, and equivalent to at least 1 ton of CO2. Yet protocols for quantifying credits make different assumptions, raising questions about whether protocols meet the ‘equivalency standard’. We test for equivalency using a common dataset of 4988 US Midwestern corn-soybean fields, representing a carbon market project, to estimate credit issuances for adoption of no-till plus cover cropping practices. We find issuances, across the three major protocols being used for US croplands, differing for this common project by up to ∼130 000 credits per year. Our ‘Protocol Intercomparison Project’ reveals how quantitative evaluations can identify assumptions generating marked differences in crediting, thereby guiding research that informs protocol revisions to build confidence in mitigation and demonstrating paths forward for protocol harmonization efforts."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae2345,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文通过气候模型模拟评估南亚安全气溶胶边界，分析气溶胶光学深度（AOD）增加对季风降水的影响。虽然涉及大气成分（如AOD）和区域水文，但其方法依赖于模型而非遥感技术（如卫星观测、空气质量监测传感器）。因此，与大气遥感技术直接关联较弱。,"['aerosol optical depth', 'South Asian monsoon', 'climate models']",C Neethu;Thejna Tharammal;Govindasamy Bala,A model-based assessment of the regional safe aerosol boundary for the South Asian monsoon region,"Recent papers on planetary and safe Earth System boundaries have proposed a limit of 0.25 for regional aerosol optical depth (AOD) in South Asia (SA) with a zone of uncertainty of 0.25–0.50 to avoid major disruptions to regional hydrology. These values are based on expert judgment, and a rigorous model-based confirmation of these boundary values is lacking in literature. In this paper, we address this important research gap using idealized climate model simulations. We analyze the response of the South Asian summer monsoon precipitation when the regional mean AOD is increased from the modeled present-day value of 0.14 to the proposed planetary boundary values of 0.25 and 0.5. Our simulations confirm that a regional AOD of 0.25 could indeed lead to drought conditions (>10% mean precipitation reduction) in India, while an AOD of 0.5 reduces Indian summer monsoon precipitation by about 19%. The reduction in the summer monsoon precipitation is driven by both fast adjustments (rapid adjustment of the atmosphere to aerosol radiative forcing) and slow responses (responses to changes in sea surface temperature). The rapid adjustment to anthropogenic aerosols, predominantly sulfates, involves enhanced atmospheric stability, subsidence, and suppressed cloud formation and precipitation. The slow response involves zonal surface temperature gradients between the North Indian Ocean and Western Pacific Ocean leading to changes in the Walker circulation, anomalous subsidence over SA, and a decrease in monsoon precipitation. Enhanced aerosol loading over SA reduces monsoon precipitation, regardless of aerosol composition, though the magnitude of reduction depends on whether the aerosols are primarily reflective or absorbing. Our findings confirm the risk of major disruptions to regional hydrology in SA when regional aerosol loading exceeds the boundary values. Future studies should assess the robustness of our results using other climate models and for other monsoon regions."

Yet, simulating unprecedented events, i.e. events which are more extreme than observed in historical datasets, remains challenging. To some extent, anticipating such events is possible by accounting for the full range of climate variability. Using a 525-year synthetic dataset from a seasonal reforecast archive, this study uncovers potential unprecedented storm surge events for European and Mediterranean coastlines, focussing on their magnitude, spatial extent and seasonality. We identify Germany, the Netherlands and western UK as hotspot regions that could experience unprecedented storm surge levels that are more than half a meter higher than historical events. Spatially unprecedented extreme peak surges, affecting more provinces within a 3 d time window than previously recorded, may impact up to 49% of the provinces, with simultaneous effects in the Mediterranean and the Atlantic regions. Additionally, countries including the Netherlands, Germany and the UK may experience at least one temporally unprecedented surge during the summer months. Understanding these different dimensions of unprecedented events represents a significant advance in our knowledge of coastal flood risk in Europe and supports improved coastal flood risk management decisions, including enhanced flood defence standards, disaster risk management and planning of coastal operations."

This study examines two grid-integration strategies: supplier-managed charging (SMC), which gives utilities control over charging timing, and vehicle-to-grid (V2G), which transforms BEVs into distributed energy storage resources. Using a discrete choice experiment with 1,356 current BEV owners, we quantify how program attributes influence enrollment decisions. Using multinomial logit models, results suggest that SMC participants predominantly value operational flexibility and recurring payments while V2G participants prefer monetary incentives, indicating a willingness to provide grid services for compensation. Through simulation analysis, we identify program ‘attribute equivalencies’ that quantify changes needed in attributes to achieve equivalent enrollment levels. These findings can be used in the design of market mechanisms and policy frameworks that accelerate BEV integration into future energy systems."

Building a comprehensive national nitrogen budget,"We present Sweden’s first comprehensive National Nitrogen Budget (NNB), quantifying reactive nitrogen (Nr) inputs, outputs, and intersectoral transfers across eight key subpools, including agriculture, energy, industry, and waste. For the reference year 2015, we estimate that approximately 848 kt N entered Sweden in reactive forms, primarily through import of goods, ‘import’ of air pollution from upwind areas outside Sweden, and from nitrogen fixation. We estimate that 269 kt Nr is annually released to atmosphere or hydrosphere as a pollution, while 311 kt N is converted back to inert N2 gas. The analysis identifies nitrogen losses to the environment, and opportunities for improved nitrogen use efficiency across sectors. The Swedish NNB is compared to calculations done for Austria, Germany and Switzerland.

As a complex and multifaceted phenomenon, drought is characterized through various indices—meteorological, agricultural, and hydrological- each capturing different aspects of the phenomenon. This diversity has led to growing demand for integrated drought monitoring tools that offer a more holistic understanding of drought conditions. Traditionally, newly developed composite drought indices are assessed through the comparison with existing indices. However, this model-by-model validation approach does not necessarily reflect real-world accuracy or relevance. Therefore, a paradigm shift is needed—from comparative validation among indices to impact-oriented evaluation—emphasizing the capacity of drought indices to capture actual societal and environmental consequences. In this study, we propose a novel drought index derived from deep learning, evaluated through an impact-oriented lens using drought-induced economic losses as the primary performance metric. The index is computed using advanced deep learning techniques and a range of drought-related variables. To enhance model accuracy and robustness, we employ different self-supervised learning architectures, including convolutional neural networks, artificial neural networks, and variational autoencoders. The analysis utilizes ERA5 reanalysis data (1989–2024) for Italy, integrated with economic loss records from the EM-DAT database. Each model’s performance is assessed based on its ability to estimate potential economic losses caused by drought. The proposed framework allows users to select the most suitable index based on a guided analysis, balancing data collection effort and predictive reliability."

The Pesticide Load Indicator (PLI), developed in Denmark in the 2000s, offers a transparent and policy-relevant framework for assessing pesticide risk. Although it has successfully supported Denmark’s national strategies for over a decade and is drawing attention in other EU countries, several methodological limitations hinder its broader applicability. This letter identifies five such limitations and proposes corresponding updates to enhance the indicator’s scientific robustness and scalability across the EU: (1) consistent hazard assessment across compartments, (2) precautionary treatment of missing data, (3) updated hazard metric selection, (4) harmonised normalisation procedures and (5) a statistically grounded weighting protocol. These methodological updates aim to establish a harmonised PLI suitable for EU-wide policy applications, such as fiscal instruments (e.g. differentiated taxation based on hazard levels) and pesticide risk assessments."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae27e8,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注人口对极端高温的暴露，通过高时空分辨率温度数据和人口年龄结构数据，分析过去几十年全球每小时高温暴露及空间差异。虽然涉及高分辨率温度数据（可能依赖卫星观测），但其核心贡献在于健康风险评估和人口热暴露的年龄金字塔分析，而非大气环境遥感技术本身（如卫星传感器、大气成分反演、气溶胶遥感等）。因此，相关性较弱。,"['UTCI', 'hourly temperature data', 'spatial resolution', 'population exposure', 'heat day']",Hongzhou Zhu;Jianping Duan,Inverted age-pyramidal global hourly population heat exposure,"Population heat exposure has increased substantially, resulting in serious effects on human health. However, all previous assessments on global-scale heat exposure focused on the daily scale, limiting accurate estimation of heat duration and the related extent of spatial disparity of population heat exposure. Here, based on high-spatial-resolution hourly temperature and age-group population datasets, we unveil the global hourly population exposure to extreme heat in the last decades. The results show that extreme heat (≥46 °C) hours per heat day have increased by 0.4 h between 1979 and 2023. As the number of heat hours and population have increased, surface air temperature-based extreme heat exposure increased by about 60% (from 3.7 × 1011 person-hours to 5.9 × 1011 person-hours), and universal thermal climate index (UTCI)-based extreme heat exposure increased by about 70% (from 1.5 × 1012 person-hours to 2.6 × 1012 person-hours) between 2000 and 2020. There is a large disparity between the hourly and daily extreme heat exposures, stemming from the change in the number of heat hours per heat day. The most pronounced discrepancy is in UTCI-based very strong heat exposure, with an average disparity equivalent to 2.6 × 1010 person-days. Moreover, global hourly population heat exposure exhibits a distinct inverted-pyramidal structure with increase in age. This is attributed to young people exposed to heat stress outnumbering the elderly, and disproportionately more young people residing in hotter regions. For heat exposure of all age groups, the population effect and interaction effect are dominant factors for the increased heat exposure in tropical regions, while the warming effect primarily drives that in temperate zones. Our study highlights the need for and urgency of health risk assessment based on hourly heat exposure."

This article spotlights an underexplored complementary strategy in policy, governance, and legal domains: climate shaming—the use of public condemnation to encourage climate-responsible behaviour among governments, corporations, and their leaders. While shaming has been studied and applied as a regulatory and governance tool in other contexts, only a small but growing body of scholarship has begun to examine its potential in the climate arena. Drawing on multidisciplinary research from the social sciences, the humanities, and law, we review and map the main strands of this emerging literature to show the diverse forms and potential of shaming mechanisms, actors, and messages in the climate domain. Based on this analysis, we identify several gaps in the literature and practice of climate shaming, including explicit regulatory shaming, intergovernmental shaming, shaming of regulators by civil-society actors, and regulatory shaming of industry leaders. We propose expanding the conceptual framework of climate shaming to encompass these neglected dimensions, with the aim of encouraging further research as well as policy and governance experimentation in this evolving field."

We conducted a rapid systematic review (search up to: February 2024) of primary studies reporting on the health impacts of climate change exposure pathways (hazards; health risks; solutions and responses) for populations at-risk of experiencing health inequalities, identified using the Core20PLUS framework (people experiencing the greatest deprivation; people from protected characteristics groups related to ethnicity, gender reassignment, sexual orientation, and religion or belief; people from inclusion health groups). Of the 20 014 records identified, 24 were included. Of these, 20 reported on people experiencing the greatest deprivation, with some evidence that increase in ambient temperature, extreme cold, and extreme heat had similar impacts on mortality in the most and least deprived areas. No conclusions could be drawn for this population group for other outcomes or exposures due to the limited number of studies identified and their methodological quality. In people experiencing homelessness, 2 studies reported that increase in ambient temperature was associated with adverse health impacts but the disproportionate impact on this population group was not assessed. No conclusions could be drawn for ethnic minority groups or people with drug and/or alcohol dependence due to the limited evidence identified. No studies were identified for the remaining population groups. In conclusion, we identified important evidence gaps and methodological limitations of the existing evidence on the health equity impacts of climate change in the UK that should be used to inform future research in this area."

Here, integrating high-frequency eddy covariance (EC) data from 140 global flux tower sites (872 site-years) with detailed process-based modeling, we examine ecosystem responses during and immediately after heatwaves. We show that heatwaves caused a −40% (range [−29%, −128%]) reduction in net ecosystem productivity (NEP) compared to pre-heatwave values, with this reduction persisting over the following two weeks (−38% range [+3%, −154%]). We attributed NEP decreases to photosynthesis decreases more than to ecosystem respiration (RE) increases. Forest sites had greater NEP decreases during heatwaves than non-forest sites, but remained carbon sinks afterwards, indicating resilience. Our modeling analysis of extreme heatwaves at selected EC sites shows that decreased photosynthesis, increased maintenance respiration, and decreased plant non-structural carbon reserves during heatwaves drive carbon cycle changes that persist for weeks. Consistent with phenocam observations, we modeled a reduction in leaf area index caused by reduced non-structural carbon reserves, leading to early leaf senescence and longer-term impacts. Ongoing increases in heatwaves are therefore likely to reduce NEP across a range of ecosystems, exacerbating carbon cycle feedback."

However, quantifying and understanding spread in model projections, along with building a picture of different possible climate futures across variables, is critical for meeting decision-makers’ needs. Here we explore projected ensemble ranges in mean and extreme temperature and precipitation metrics and their relationships using simulations from the sixth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project. The range is characterised by ensemble minimums and maximums, along with intermediate percentiles, and heatmaps display the contribution of individual models to the overall global pattern of changes at these points in the range. Furthermore, we examine if the framing of changes, both in terms of a future time slice (2070–2099) and a future global warming level (GWL) of 3 K, relative to a historical period (1850–1900), affects interpretation of results. The 2070–2099 time slice exhibits known patterns of change such as Arctic warming, and drying and wetting regions, exacerbated according to the ensemble percentile considered. For extreme temperature metrics, while 25th, median, and 75th percentile changes are relatively evenly contributed to by all models, ensemble-minimum and -maximum changes are instead dominated by only one or two models. In particular, the CanESM5 dominates ensemble-maximum changes by over 40%. Furthermore, the NorESM2-LM dominates ensemble-minimum changes for the coldest night of the year (64%) and contributes largely (23%) to ensemble-maximum changes for the warmest day of the year—which are opposite ends of the most extreme measures we consider. Moreover, for the 3 K GWL, the CanESM5 domination ceases yet the NorESM2-LM domination persists. This has implications for the expression of ensemble ranges in multi-model projections, depending on the framing of the future period, and for the interpretation of what constitutes an outlier model. Thus, we encourage multi-model studies to understand and communicate ensemble spread in their climate projections."

Yet we still lack a good understanding of how these extremes will be distributed across the world’s agricultural lands—particularly across small versus large croplands and pasturelands. In this study, we assess their exposure to extreme weather in a warming world. In a world that is 2 °C warmer than today, 25% (11 million km2) of present-day agricultural lands will face over two months of extreme heat, up from 16% today (7 million km2), and another ∼2% (5 million km2) will be exposed to a combination of two or more extremes, up from 10% (4 million km2). The total area exposed to prolonged dry conditions and extreme precipitation will remain unchanged (less than 1% or 5 million km2, with increases in some regions balanced by decreases elsewhere), while ∼2% less area (2 million km2), down from 7% (3 million km2), will experience a month of frost. Future exposure to extreme weather varies by land use type. Pasturelands will experience prolonged exposure to heat stress, whereas croplands will be exposed to higher excessive rains and heat stress combined. Spatial correlations between farm size and geography indicate potential differences in exposure. Exposure to extreme precipitation and heat stress is highest in small (1–2 ha) and medium (2–4 ha) cropland and pastureland, respectively. These findings offer a preliminary global assessment of how exposure to extreme weather varies by farm size and land use, underscoring the need for tailored adaptation strategies to safeguard food security in a warming world."

This study identified for the first time a strong relationship between DAB and the spatial extent of fire-conducive weather conditions, especially measured by fuel aridity, in Canadian forests. Observations between 2001 and 2023 used to develop the DAB prediction models showed about 126 active burning days per year and an average DAB of 20 788.93 ha nationally, with about two-thirds of these active burning days occurring in summer. The central boreal forests in Canada experienced both more active burning days and higher DAB, while the more extreme DAB occurred in the eastern region. Of the predicted DAB in Canadian forests between 1940 and 2023 using the developed DAB models, 62 d showed a significant increasing trend, averaging about 60.14 ha per year nationally. Such increases were found mainly in the central region, in summer, and between 2000 and 2023. Daily fire activity has also become more concentrated within the fire season, particularly in the eastern region. From 1940 to 2023, the lengths of the periods covering 50% and 90% of annual area burned decreased by 0.12 d and 0.25 d per year, respectively, across the country. Concurrently, extreme DAB events have become more extreme. Over the 84 year period, summer maximum DAB increased by 133.61 ha, number of extreme burning days (days with DAB exceeding the 84 year mean by one standard deviation) increased by 0.36 d, and proportion of area burned within these extreme days increased by 0.33% annually in Canadian forests."

In this study, we applied an ensemble modeling framework integrating 12 algorithms to assess the potential suitable habitats and centroid shifts of 10 Larix species across the Northern Hemisphere under current and future climate scenarios. Model performance was high (true skill statistic, receiver operating characteristic, and Kappa all >0.9). Temperature, precipitation, and elevation were identified as the primary environmental drivers shaping species distributions. Substantial heterogeneity was observed in future habitat shifts: some species (e.g. Larix decidua, Larix sibirica, Larix lyallii) are projected to undergo significant habitat contractions, while others (e.g. Larix potaninii, Larix gmelinii var. principis-rupprechtii) may experience expansions. For most species, distribution centroids are expected to shift northeastward or northwestward, with more pronounced shifts under high-emission scenarios. These findings reveal the complex response patterns of Larix species to climate change and provide scientific insights for cross-regional forest conservation and adaptive management. We recommend prioritizing conservation of species projected to undergo substantial habitat contraction and safeguarding climate refugia to maintain biodiversity and ecosystem functioning."

Suppression however remains the budget priority. We design a survey to measure the U.S. public’s preferences for investing public resources to federal wildfire prevention activities. We consider absolute investment as well as investment relative to suppression. Results indicate the public prefers much greater investment in prevention than federally appropriated levels. While people correctly identify the misalignment, they underestimate the extent of the difference between public and agency priorities. We also examine individual actions to reduce the risk of future wildfires. We explore people’s willingness to voluntarily join a local risk-reduction program to reduce community wildfire risk. We find that a large segment of respondents are not only willing to join but support a mandatory requirement for peers to join. Support for government and local prevention is robust across locations, though wildfire risk and exposure matter at the margin. Overall, results indicate that public priorities better align with the expert advice than current practices by wildfire management."

This agrees with HEGIFTOM (Van Malderen et al., 2025), Stauffer et al. (2024) and Gaudel et al. (2024) TOAR-II papers. Other findings are as follows: (1) our trends are independent of method (QR, MLR) and (2) sample number (SN) (i.e., SHADOZ sampling is sufficient), and (3) all ground-based trends constitute the gold standard for satellite-derived trends. 
 Tropospheric ozone trends are important indicators of climate forcing and surface pollution, yet relevant satellite observations are too uncertain for assessments. The assessment project TOAR-II has used multi-instrument, ground-based data for global trends over 2000–2022 (Van Malderen et al., 2025a, b). For the tropics, trends are derived from SHADOZ ozonesonde profiles (Thompson et al., 2021, “T21”; Stauffer et al., 2024) or combinations of satellite, SHADOZ and IAGOS aircraft measurements (Gaudel et al., 2024). We extend T21 that covered 1998–2019, analyzing SHADOZ data at five sites with a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) model for 1998–2023 and reporting trends for two free-tropospheric (FT) segments, the lowermost stratosphere and the total tropospheric column (TrCOsonde). Trends for the Aura period, 2005–2023, are computed from OMI/MLS TrCOsatellite. We find the following: 
Extending SHADOZ analyses 4 years shows little change from T21; TrCOsonde trends are small (0.5–1 DU/decade) except over SE Asia.
Annual trends for TrCOsonde and OMI/MLS TrCOsatellite agree within uncertainties at four of five sites, with the largest differences at Samoa. Sensitivity tests show the following:  
(a) Adding thousands of FT IAGOS profiles to SHADOZ yields little change in trends; SHADOZ sampling is sufficient. 
(b) Quantile Regression (QR) and MLR median trends are both near zero, but QR captures extremes (5th percentile, 95th percentile) with changes up to ±1 DU/decade (p< 0.10). 
(c) Twelve-year analyses for trends lead to uncertainty changes too large for an assessment.
This study and Van Malderen et al. (2025a, b) provide the most reliable TOAR-II trends to date: over the past ∼ 25 years, tropical FT ozone changes have been modest, ∼ (−3–+3) %/decade, except over SE Asia."

J. Stettler,An updated microphysical model for particle activation in contrails: the role of volatile plume particles,"Aerosol emissions from aircraft engines contribute to the formation of contrails, which have a climate impact comparable to that of aviation’s CO2 emissions. We show that emissions of volatile particulate matter – from fuel sulphur, unburned fuel, and lubrication oil – can increase the number of ice particles formed within a contrail and therefore have an important role in the climate impacts of aviation. This has implications for emission regulation and climate mitigation strategies. 
 Global simulations suggest the mean annual contrail cirrus net radiative forcing is comparable to that of aviation's accumulated CO2 emissions. Currently, these simulations assume non-volatile particulate matter (nvPM) and ambient particles are the only source of condensation nuclei, omitting activation of volatile particulate matter (vPM) formed in the nascent plume. Here, we extend a microphysical model to include vPM and benchmark this against a more advanced parcel model (pyrcel) modified to treat contrail formation. We explore how the apparent emission index (EI) of contrail ice crystals (AEIice) scales with EInvPM, vPM properties, ambient temperature, and aircraft/fuel characteristics. We find model agreement within 10 %–30 % in the previously defined “soot-poor” regime. However, discrepancies increase non-linearly (up to 60 %) in the “soot-rich” regime, due to differing treatment of droplet growth. Both models predict that, in the “soot-poor” regime, AEIice approaches 1016 kg−1 for low ambient temperatures (< 210 K) and sulfur-rich vPM, which is comparable to estimates in the “soot-rich” regime. Moreover, our sensitivity analyses suggest that the point of transition between the “soot-poor” and “soot-rich” regimes is a dynamic threshold that ranges from 1013–1016 kg−1 and depends sensitively on ambient temperature and vPM properties, underlining the need for vPM emission characterisation measurements. We suggest that existing contrail simulations omitting vPM activation may underestimate AEIice, especially for flights powered by lean-burn engines. Furthermore, our results imply that, under these conditions, AEIice might be reduced by (i) reducing fuel sulfur content, (ii) minimising organic emissions, and/or (iii) avoiding cooler regions of the atmosphere."

Using high-resolution weather simulations of past supercell storms under warmer and less polluted conditions, we found that storms may become more intense, with heavier rainfall and larger hailstones. These changes suggest an increased risk of damage in the future. Our findings help improve understanding of how extreme storms may evolve in a changing climate. 
 Germany is heading toward a future with warmer temperatures due to climate change, and potentially cleaner air from electrification and stricter emission regulations. But how will these evolving environmental conditions affect severe convective storms? This study addresses this question by simulating three supercell events in high resolution using the ICOsahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) model. The events observed during the Swabian MOSES field campaigns in 2021 and 2023 are analysed using the pseudo-global warming approach to assess their evolution in a warmer climate. The effects of aerosols on clouds and precipitation were considered using a two-moment microphysics scheme in four temperature rise scenarios, providing detailed insights into the underlying microphysical mechanisms. The results indicate that higher temperatures generally enhance convection, resulting in more intense convective cells, increased precipitation amounts, and more extreme rainfall and hail events. Additionally, warmer conditions increase the likelihood of supercell formation and more intense mesocyclones. In some cases, precipitation increases exceed 7 % K−1, indicating super-Clausius–Clapeyron scaling and suggesting that additional dynamical and microphysical processes amplify rainfall beyond thermodynamic expectations. An important finding is that hailstones grow larger under lower cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) concentrations, and the area affected by large hail expands by up to 400 %, indicating growing severity and reach of hail events. In addition, lower CCN concentrations are associated with a reduced cold-to-warm rain formation ratio and decreased precipitation efficiency. These aerosol-related effects appear largely independent of temperature, showing consistent patterns across all simulated warming scenarios. These findings indicate the intensity of severe weather events, such as convective storms and flash floods, may increase in a future climate."

By integrating atmospheric data and transport models, the research reduces uncertainties in CO2 emissions and reveals spatial and temporal patterns. The method offers a valuable tool for supporting climate policies and can be applied to other cities for better emission verification. 
 Accurate carbon emission estimates are essential for achieving net zero targets by 2050. The Bayesian inverse method, combined with atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) measurements and a transport model, can serve as an independent verification approach to improve accuracy. We developed a Bayesian inverse modelling framework using ground- and space-based measurements and applied it to Seoul to test the framework and constrain its fossil fuel CO2 emissions. By leveraging the high temporal resolution of ground-based in situ observations and the broad spatial coverage of satellite data, we improved the accuracy of emission estimates. Our results indicate the spatiotemporal variability of posterior emissions increased significantly, enabling us to track CO2 fluctuations and assess the impact of carbon reduction policies over time and space. The mean absolute error between simulated and observed CO2 enhancements decreased by 55 %, indicating improved agreement. We investigated the performance of the inverse model through a sensitivity analysis that considered different observational network configurations. Uncertainty reductions varied with the type of observations used: 19.2 % when all observations were included, 18.7 % using only ground-based sites, and 6 %–8.4 % when using only OCO-2 or OCO-3 satellite data, highlighting the complementary contributions of ground and space-based measurements. The analysis also showed that assumptions about background concentrations, biogenic fluxes, and prior emission uncertainties can alter posterior results, demonstrating the importance of model configuration. The framework shows strong potential for application in other cities and can support the development of effective climate mitigation policies."

Ziemba,PISTON and CAMP2Ex observations of the fundamental modes of aerosol vertical variability in the Northwest Tropical Pacific and Maritime Continent's Monsoon,"We document air and ship born measurements of the vertical distribution of pollution and biomass burning aerosol particles transported within the Maritime Continent's monsoonal flows for 1000s of kilometers, and yet still exhibit intricate patterns around clouds near the ocean's surface. Findings demonstrate that, while aerosol transport occurs near the surface, there is heterogeneity in particle extinction that must be considered for both in situ observations and satellite retrievals. 
 While most large-scale smoke advection occurs within the free troposphere, Maritime Continent smoke is suspected to be unique in its long-range, near-surface transport. Such a pathway likely creates strong gradients and uncertainties in interpreting satellite and model data on light extinction, air pollution, and cloud condensation nuclei. This paper documents High Spectral Resolution Lidar (HSRL) data from the 2019 ONR PISTON cruise and NASA CAMP2Ex flights that revealed Maritime Continent smoke and pollution transport pathways and heterogeneity around the Marine Atmospheric Boundary Layer (MABL) over thousands of kilometers. Observations showed that 95 % of integrated aerosol backscatter occurred below 2500 m altitude. The R/V Sally Ride observed 50th and 84th percentile aerosol backscatter altitudes at ∼600 and ∼1500 m respectively, regardless of aerosol loading. Peak backscatter values occurred within or near the MABL top, diminishing as we approached 2–3 km altitude, but with occasional plumes reaching the melting level at 4800 m. At monsoonal scales, aerosol models largely account for the observed directional wind shear that causes altitude-dependent particle transport: near-surface particles remain in the core monsoon flow around the MABL, while at lower latitudes, aerosol layers aloft advect more eastwardly. Around the MABL, however, significant cloud-scale variability exists due to fine-scale flow, halo-entrainment-detrainment, and cold pool phenomena. Backscatter enhancements beneath individual clouds, extending to the ocean surface, likely relate to MABL-free troposphere exchange and air-sea interaction. So while aerosol transport occurs near the surface, particle extinction heterogeneity must still be considered for in situ observations and satellite retrievals."

We found that low boundary layers in winter trap pollutants like nitrate and primary particles, while higher layers in summer help form secondary pollutants like sulfate and organic aerosols. These findings show that boundary layer dynamics are key to understanding and managing seasonal air pollution. 
 Understanding the seasonal behavior of fine particles (PM2.5) and its chemical components is critical for improving air quality in the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), a densely populated and polluted region in China. While previous studies have addressed PM2.5 mass trends, the role of planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) in modulating chemical composition remains insufficiently explored. This study investigates seasonal variations and PBLH effects on PM2.5 chemical components based on year-round field measurements (December 2020–November 2021) at Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology. Annual mean PM2.5 mass concentration is 30.0±18.5µgm-3, with winter peaks (48.3 µg m−3) and summer lows (20.4 µg m−3). Organic aerosol dominates PM2.5, followed by sulfate in warmer seasons and nitrate in winter. Stable meteorological conditions promote the accumulation of primary aerosols and nitrate. The accumulation of SOA and sulfate remains substantial under elevated PBLH conditions, owing to strong photochemical production, rendering them relatively insensitive to PBLH variations. In contrast, during cold and humid winters, shallow PBLH promotes nitrate buildup, which subsequently suppresses boundary layer development, forming positive feedback that accelerates nitrate concentration growth. Source apportionment reveals that the contrasting seasonal sources, shaped by both local chemistry and regional transport, emphasize the need for seasonally adaptive and region-specific emission control measures."

Connolly;Paul R. Field;Declan L. Finney;Alan M. Blyth,Influence of secondary ice formation on tropical deep convective clouds simulated by the Unified Model,"We investigated how extra ice particles form inside tropical storm clouds and how they affect rainfall and sunlight reflection. By using a weather model, we found that these extra ice particles can change how clouds grow, reduce heat escaping to space, and slightly shift where rain falls. This helps improve how weather and climate models predict tropical storms. 
 Secondary ice production (SIP) plays an important role in tropical deep convection. This study implements multiple SIP mechanisms, including droplet fragmentation and ice–ice collisional breakup, into the CASIM microphysics scheme of the UK Met Office Unified Model, and evaluates their impacts through a real-case simulation of a Hector thunderstorm. SIP enhances ice number concentration in upper cloud layers, with values up to 3 orders of magnitude higher than the no-SIP case, particularly above −10 °C. Ice water content (IWC) increases by a factor of 3–5 in the anvil region, contributing to more extensive upper-level cloud coverage. These microphysical changes reduce outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) by ∼ 3.2 W m−2 (1.3 %) and increase outgoing shortwave radiation (OSR) by ∼ 4.5 W m−2 (1.8 %) over a 6 h analysis period and a 110 km × 110 km domain. SIP modifies precipitation spatially, yielding a more localized, compact rainfall pattern near the convective core, while reducing domain-averaged precipitation by ∼ 8 %. Peak rainfall rates remain only slightly affected, consistent with the minor changes (< 1 m s−1) in maximum updraft velocity. Among the tested mechanisms, ice–ice collisional breakup shows negligible impact on simulated ice concentration, consistent with limited graupel-involved collision energetics under warm profiles. Ensemble experiments confirm that these effects are robust and exceed the influence of meteorological variability. These results highlight the importance of representing SIP processes in cloud-resolving models of tropical convection and accounting for their environmental dependence."

For reduction of the climate impact, one should avoid flights forming warming contrails. This requires good weather forecast of contrail formation conditions and contrail effects. We present a two-way coupling of the Contrail Cirrus Prediction model (CoCiP) with the global Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic numerical weather model (ICON). We find that contrails are predictable – but only for a finite period. 
 Contrail forecasts typically neglect feedbacks with the atmosphere. Here, we couple the Contrail Cirrus Prediction model (CoCiP) with the global Icosahedral Non-hydrostatic (ICON) numerical weather model in a two-way mode accounting for contrail-weather interaction. The models exchange atmospheric and contrail state variables after each time step using the coupler YAC. ICON includes a new two-moment cloud ice microphysics scheme that enables skillful predictions of ice supersaturation. CoCiP now limits the uptake of ambient ice supersaturation when many contrails form. Radiation is calculated in ICON using the ECMWF radiation scheme ecRad. Contrail radiative forcing is computed from the difference of ICON results with and without contrail feedback. The coupled system results are broadly consistent with offline CoCiP simulations. The ICON results are validated against radiosonde observations and compared with ECMWF forecasts showing improved score values. The significance of the computed contrail effects is tested by numerical noise perturbation or twin experiments comparing the results of forecast pairs with initial values differing randomly. Contrails induce a butterfly effect with disturbances growing with time. Contrails induce disturbances similar to random disturbances. Within the first 5 d, contrails warm the ambient air at contrail levels. Contrails change the surface temperature and precipitation locally by an order 1 K and 10 mm d−1, with pattern similar to random disturbances and with magnitude depending on ambient weather, with negligible global mean changes. After 5 d, the weather changes are dominated by the butterfly effect. The slow response of the surface temperature to contrail RF deserves further investigations."

These findings enhance our understanding of vertical and dynamical-photochemical coupling in the middle and upper atmosphere, which also offer valuable implications for the upper atmospheric sounding and modeling. 
 Based on the specified dynamics simulation of Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with ionosphere/thermosphere extension (SD-WACCM-X), the composite response of polar hydroxyl radical (OH) layer in the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT) to the Arctic sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events with elevated stratopause (ES) during 2004–2023 is investigated. A total of ten ES-SSW events are systematically analyzed. Before the onset of ES-SSW events, the OH concentration climatologically peaks at ∼ 7.4 ppbv near 82.4 km. During the stratospheric warming phase, relative to the climatology, the peak height of OH layer undergoes a distinct upward displacement reaching ∼ 85.9 km accompanied by a reduction in the OH concentration to ∼ 2.9 ppbv. This shift is closely linked to an ∼ 11 % and ∼ 90.8 % reduction in mesospheric temperature and atomic oxygen, respectively, due to enhanced upward residual circulation. During the elevated stratopause phase, the peak height of OH layer experiences a pronounced downward shift to ∼ 80.6 km with a maximum in OH concentration to ∼ 6.8 ppbv. This phase is characterized by ∼ 3.7 % and ∼ 137.3 % enhancements in mesospheric temperature and atomic oxygen concentrations, respectively, which is driven by intensified downward residual circulation. Further analysis suggests that OH concentration variations are positively correlated to mesospheric temperature anomalies and atomic oxygen redistribution induced by vertical transport, which is attributed to the significant influence of ES-SSW on gravity wave drag (GWs) in the mesosphere."

Toon,Injection near the stratopause mitigates the stratospheric side effects of sulfur-based climate intervention,"Injecting sulfur dioxide at 50 km – near the stratopause – offers a far safer and more effective climate intervention than conventional 25 km injection. Rapid downward–poleward transport distributes aerosols across 20–30 km, halving tropical stratospheric warming, reducing ozone recovery delays from decades to about 5 years, and enhancing global and polar cooling by over 20 %, while better preserving Arctic sea ice. 
 Stratospheric aerosol injection (SAI) using sulfur has been proposed to cool the planet by reflecting sunlight back to space. A commonly proposed SAI, with sulfur dioxide injection rate of 10 Tg yr−1 at 25 km, accumulates aerosols in the tropical lower stratosphere, causing a 6 K warming of the tropical lower stratosphere that impact the entry value of stratospheric water vapor and jet positions. This approach could also delay October Antarctic total column ozone (TCO) recovery to 1980s values by 25–55 years. We propose a novel SAI approach of injecting sulfur at 50 km (SAI50) that substantially reduces these negative impacts. In SAI50, the mean meridional overturning circulation near the stratopause rapidly transports gaseous SO2 to mid-high latitudes, preventing sulfate aerosol accumulation in the tropical lower stratosphere. This approach reduces tropical stratospheric warming to 3 K and shortens the Antarctic ozone recovery delay to 5 years. Furthermore, SAI50 demonstrates greater cooling efficiency, enhancing global and polar surface cooling by 22 % and 40 % respectively. Consequently, SAI50 preserves 20 % more Arctic September sea ice compared to lower-altitude SAI. These findings suggest that SAI50 could offer a more effective and less disruptive approach to climate intervention."

Our results show that the pattern of mixing seen from aircraft measurements may not reflect the true mixing process happening inside clouds. This result suggests that care is needed when using aircraft data to study the cloud mixing process and that new ways of observing clouds could offer clearer insights. 
 Recent aircraft measurements in stratocumulus clouds suggest that entrainment mixing is inhomogeneous (IM) near cloud top and homogeneous (HM) within the cloud. However, this proposed height-dependence of mixing transition is uncertain because of artifacts involved in the aircraft measurements. In this study, we use the Explicit Mixing Parcel Model to simulate mixing scenarios in stratocumulus clouds and reconstruct the virtual aircraft measurements to investigate the mixing signature. Results show that, from the aircraft-measurement perspective, the mixing signature always exhibits IM characteristic near cloud top and HM characteristic within cloud, independent of the types of the local entrainment-mixing process. The appearance of the vertical IM-to-HM transition is essentially a collective behavior of multiple parcels sampled at the same height, experiencing distinct entrainment-mixing-evaporation histories. This bulk view of mixing process, which is widely used for aircraft measurements, could lead to misinterpretations of the true mixing mechanism occurring in clouds. Our result underscores the limitations of using aircraft measurements to identify the entrainment-mixing mechanism at the process level."

Lamb,Unsupervised classification of absorbing aerosols detected by the Single Particle Soot Photometer,"Aerosols that absorb sunlight play key role in Earth's climate. To improve detection of light-absorbing aerosols measured by the Single Particle Soot Photometer, we explore unsupervised machine learning. Unlike earlier methods that require labeled training data, our approach learns patterns directly from unlabeled data. This makes it more applicable to atmospheric observations. We show this method can be used to quantify how similar aerosols are to one another and improve aerosol classification. 
 The Single Particle Soot Photometer (SP2) detects refractory aerosol particle mass on a single-particle basis via laser-induced incandescence (L-II). While the SP2 has traditionally been used to quantify black carbon aerosol mass in the atmosphere, the instrument is increasingly being used to detect and quantify other types of absorbing aerosols, such as mineral dust or anthropogenically-sourced iron oxide aerosols. Quantifying the mass loadings and emission sources of absorbing aerosols in the atmosphere is important for understanding their role in the climate cycle. Supervised machine learning algorithms have shown potential to classify different types of aerosols from L-II signals, but these methods are sensitive to instrument configuration and require training datasets generated from laboratory samples, which do not generalize well to ambient atmospheric aerosols. Here we explore the effectiveness of unsupervised machine learning, including principal component analysis (PCA) and a variational autoencoder (VAE), applied directly to L-II signals from the SP2 in order to classify different types of absorbing aerosols. The VAE is a deep learning architecture that compresses L-II signals into a bottleneck latent representation and reconstructs an output as similar as possible to the input signal, thereby reducing dimensionality. We apply PCA and the VAE to a dataset comprised of laboratory samples of materials that show detectable incandescence in the SP2, including fullerene soot (as a proxy for black carbon), coated fullerene soot, coal fly ash, mineral dust, volcanic ash, hematite, and magnetite. We explore optimal latent representations of L-II signals to maximize separability of different aerosol classes by varying the size of the latent representation, and find that a latent representation of 3 allows us to capture the majority of the information in the L-II signals relevant for identifying different types of absorbing aerosols. We demonstrate that unsupervised machine learning is a promising method for identifying distinct populations of aerosols detected by the SP2 and for quantifying the similarity of different types of aerosols in terms of their response in the SP2."

We calibrated the data and compared it with precipitation radar and others. The sensor is stable and accurate. It can detect humidity, clouds and rain, even during storms. These results mean better forecasts, earlier storm and flood warnings, and better options for people and communities. 
 Polarimetric radio occultation (PRO) extends the capability of standard radio occultation (RO) by providing not only the conventional thermodynamic profiles but also information on clouds and precipitation. The differential phase (ΔΦ) is the cumulative phase shift between horizontal and vertical polarizations observed from PRO caused by aspherical hydrometeors along the propagation path, typically measured in millimeters. In early 2025, Yunyao Aerospace Technology Co., Ltd. successfully launched the first Chinese low Earth orbit satellite equipped with a PRO payload, generating over 500 measurements per day. Based on this mission, we established an end-to-end PRO data processing chain incorporating on-orbit calibration and tailored for operational applications. We analysed approximately 53 000 events collected between March and June 2025, in conjunction with the Integrated Multi-satellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) precipitation product (IMERG). The results show that ΔΦ remains close to zero under non-precipitating conditions but exhibits distinct peaks at 3–5 km altitude when traversing precipitation layers, with amplitudes strongly correlated with path-averaged rainfall rates. Thresholds of 1, 2, and 5 mm h−1 are proposed as indicators of precipitation sensitivity, detection confidence, and heavy-rain events, respectively, and a ΔΦ-to-rainfall intensity mapping table is derived to quantify this relationship. Yunyao PRO data preserve the thermodynamic retrieval quality of conventional RO while enabling effective precipitation detection, thereby providing important data support for the theoretical, technical and data research on the transition of meteorological observations from “temperature, humidity and pressure” observations to new types of observations such as precipitation."

Retrieved concentrations agree well with surface measurements. These concentrations and our estimates of the particle mass extinction efficiency are also consistent with those retrieved from airborne in situ measurements. This methodology can also be applied to the Atmosphere Lidar on the EarthCARE satellite. 
 We use measurements of near-surface aerosol backscatter, extinction, and depolarization acquired by four NASA Langley Research Center airborne High Spectral Resolution Lidars (HSRLs) in machine learning (ML) regression algorithms to derive concentrations of particulate matter (PM) with aerodynamic diameters less than 2.5 µm (PM2.5), 10 µm (PM10), and the PM2.5 / PM10 ratio. The ML regression models are trained using airborne HSRL measurements acquired over major metropolitan regions in the United States and Asia that are coincident with hourly surface PM2.5 and PM10 measurements from the EPA air quality system and similar networks in other countries. We examine several regression methods and find that exponential Gaussian Process regression (GPR) algorithms consistently give the best performance in terms of the lowest root-mean-square (RMS) errors and the highest correlations. When evaluated using surface measurements withheld from the training sets, ML models that use the HSRL near-surface measurements of aerosol backscatter and aerosol intensive properties such as depolarization, backscatter color ratio, and lidar ratio typically give the best performance with RMS differences in PM2.5 retrievals around 5 µg m−3 and correlation coefficients above 0.8, respectively. Corresponding RMS differences and correlation coefficients for PM10 retrievals are 11 µg m−3 and 0.7 and corresponding RMS differences and correlation coefficients for PM2.5 / PM10 are 0.17 and 0.75. This retrieval performance is achieved using airborne HSRL measurements alone and so does not depend on external knowledge of or assumptions regarding aerosol type, aerosol mass extinction efficiency, aerosol hygroscopic growth, the ratio of PM2.5 to PM10, particle density, or relative humidity. PM2.5 values in the training set range from about 5 to 80 µg m−3; PM10 values range from about 10 to 100 µg m−3. Accurate retrievals of PM outside these ranges would require commensurate training data. We present examples of PM retrievals in the United States as well as Asia when HSRL measurements were acquired when the aircraft flew systematic “raster-scan” patterns for several hours over major urban areas. We show that these PM2.5 retrievals are in good agreement with PM2.5 derived from coincident airborne in situ measurements near the surface as well as aloft. We describe also how the distribution of PM2.5 varies with aerosol type and altitude over these regions. We use the HSRL measurements of aerosol extinction and retrievals of surface PM2.5 along with HSRL retrievals of aerosol type to derive estimates of the fine mode aerosol mass extinction efficiency (MEEf) for major aerosol types identified by an updated HSRL aerosol classification method. MEEf ranges from about 2.6 ± 0.5 m2 g−1 for maritime aerosol to 5.0 ± 0.7 m2 g−1 for smoke. These estimates of MEEf are also in good agreement with values derived from airborne in situ measurements. We also discuss how this methodology may be applied to measurements from the Atmospheric Lidar (ATLID) on the EarthCARE satellite."

The magnitude of the dust radiative effect is dependent on their optical properties and mineralogical content. Therefore, we upgrade the METAL-WRF model to incorporate the direct radiative impact of the minerals in dust. The capabilities of the model to simulate the chemical composition and associated impacts is significantly improved. 
 Dust particles originating from desert areas of the planet have significant radiative impacts on the ground and atmospheric column, changing the energy distribution of the entire earth system, which cannot be underestimated, as dust is considered a climatic regulator. The magnitude of the dust radiative effect is dependent on the optical properties of desert dust aerosols, which in turn is regulated by the composition and mineralogical content of desert dust plumes. The mineralogical composition in atmospheric models is commonly related to the soil type at dust sources and the optical properties needed are provided by observational campaigns and dedicated measurements. In this work we upgrade the METAL-WRF model to incorporate the direct radiative impact of the minerals in dust and test the impact of the direct radiative feedback on a 2-month simulation period, namely March and April 2022, when consecutive intense dust outbursts affected the Mediterranean Basin. The simulation results were compared against Global Horizontal Irradiance data and AERONET optical properties that were measured at five sites. An improvement was observed in all sites, especially close to the sources, when the minerals and dust are treated as interacting in the radiative transfer calculations, thus improving the capabilities of METAL-WRF to simulate the chemical composition of dust particles in the atmosphere along with their contribution to radiative transfer processes."

It was compiled from seven government datasets and quality controlled. This dataset will aid research on the causes and effects of wildfire in a changing world. 
 Wildfire regimes of the western United States (US) have changed dramatically since the 1980s but our understanding of the causes and effects of these changes is limited by a lack of a quality-controlled, publicly available wildfire database that (1) spans from the 1980s to present, (2) represents wildfires across a wide range of sizes, and (3) includes mapped fire perimeters and the areas burned within. Here we present an updated and improved Western US MTBS-Interagency database (WUMI2024a) of wildfire occurrences, perimeters, and burned-area maps, covering the period 1984–2024 and the geographic domain of the 11 westernmost states in the contiguous US. The database represents 22 234 wildfires ≥ 1 km2 in size, which we compile by merging seven publicly available government databases. For over 47 % of wildfires in our database (more than 10 300 wildfires), the maps of fire perimeters and area burned are based on 30 m satellite data provided by the US government's Monitoring Trends in Burn Severity (MTBS) project, allowing our mapping and assessments of total area burned to account for heterogeneity within fire boundaries. For another 24 % of fires, our database includes perimeter observations provided by non-MTBS sources, meaning that only 29 % of fire occurrences are without perimeter observations. For these fires, which are generally small and account for <5 % of total burned area in the database, we tentatively assume perimeters are circular centred on the ignition location, but with shapes adjusted to not include areas dominated by open water or barren ground. The fire perimeters and burned area maps in our database are intended to improve assessments of temporal variations and trends in wildfire frequency and area burned, assessments of the landcover types that burn, and simulations of how historical fires have affected ecosystems, smoke emissions, and hydrology. The WUMI2024a can be quickly updated as new and improved data become available.

To address this, we created Peat-DBase – a standardized global database of peat depth measurements with > 200 000 measurements worldwide, showing median depths of 130 cm. Peat-DBase avoids overlapping data compilation efforts while identifying critical observational gaps. 
 Peatlands are globally important carbon stores that face increasing threats from human activities and climate change impacts. Comprehensive peatland data are essential for understanding ecosystem responses to these stressors and mapping their past and current characteristics. Current peatland datasets remain limited due to poor representation in global soil mapping initiatives and the absence of a recognized, coordinated central repository for peat depth data. Existing compilations often contain errors, duplicates, and outdated observations, requiring researchers to repeatedly gather and harmonize data on a study-by-study basis. To address these challenges, we present Peat-DBase version 1.0 – a harmonized, quality-controlled global compilation of basal peat depth measurements.Version 1.0 of Peat-DBase comprises 204 902 peat depth measurements from 29 sources spanning 54.933° S to 82.217° N, with a significant proportion of measurements in Atlantic Canada and Scotland due to the inclusion of two particularly large datasets focused on those regions. We supplement the peat study measurements with 94 615 non-peat soil measurements to ensure comprehensive coverage consistent with the relatively low spatial coverage of peatlands globally. Despite the uneven distribution of peat depth measurements, Peat-DBase contains reasonable coverage of the major global peatland complexes in temperate and boreal North America and Europe, portions of Russia, the Amazon and Congo basins, and the Malay Archipelago, though gaps remain in the lower Amazon Basin, Eastern Indonesia, and Eastern Russia. From the current data, peat depths have a median value of 130 cm (IQR: 60–240), although this is influenced by a predominance of measurements in the North Atlantic regions. Peat-DBase's deepest measurement is 2223 cm.While sampling biases and measurement uncertainties exist, Peat-DBase provides an essential foundation for global peatland research. Peat-DBase is under active development and future versions will incorporate additional datasets, information on current peatland status, and improved positional uncertainty quantification. Peat-DBase eliminates the need for overlapping data compilation efforts while identifying critical observational gaps for future research.

We describe the available data, discuss gaps, and propose improved metadata schemes to expand the MADLIB collection and support sensor and algorithm development. 
 Marine debris is a ubiquitous and growing threat to environmental and human health. Efforts to monitor and mitigate marine debris pollution face many challenges. The absence of standardized methodologies is a primary limitation for monitoring capabilities due to the complex and diverse physical and chemical properties of marine debris. Variabilities include object size, apparent color, polymer type, weathering, and aqueous state. Despite the challenges in object characteristics, advances in remote sensing methods show promise for detecting marine debris across local to global scales. Algorithms are needed to link remotely sensed observations with relevant characteristics of marine debris to fully realize this potential. Although more optical measurements of marine debris reflectance are becoming available for algorithm development, inconsistencies in data curation remains an obstacle. Variations in data processing and inconsistent metadata hinder efforts to develop robust, generalizable algorithms for marine debris detection. To address this, we present the well-curated MArine Debris hyperspectral reference Library collection (MADLib) containing 24 889 reflectance spectra from 3032 samples. All optical measurements are available in open-access via https://doi.org/10.4121/059551d3-2383-4e20-af2d-011c9a59d3ac (Ohall et al., 2025). MADLib demonstrates the importance of open-science and open-access datasets, as it compiles and harmonizes spectral data collected from publicly accessible datasets and individual research projects. Consistent methods were applied for data standardization, quality assurance, and integration. We also propose a robust protocol for generating metadata tailored to marine debris and ocean color remote sensing applications. MADLib possesses spectra of a wide range of marine debris materials including different polymer types, color, size, weathering, and aqueous states. Here, we analyze the metadata associated with the spectra to identify sampling gaps and propose considerations for future work. By providing open-access and standardized data, MADLib is expected to support the development of robust marine debris detection algorithms."

We propose a Local Training Data Point Density (LPD) approach that considers how well a model's environment is represented by training data. This method provides a valuable tool for evaluating model applicability and uncertainties, crucial for broader scientific and practical applications. 
 Machine learning is frequently used in environmental and earth sciences to produce spatial or spatio-temporal predictions of environmental variables based on limited field samples – increasingly even on a global scale and far beyond the location of available training data. Since new geographic space often goes along with new environmental properties represented by the model's predictors, and since machine learning models do not perform well in extrapolation, this raises questions regarding the applicability of the trained models at the prediction locations.Methods to assess the area of applicability of spatial prediction models have been recently suggested and applied. These are typically based on distances in the predictor space between the prediction data and the nearest reference data point to represent the similarity to the training data. However, we assume that the density of the training data in the predictor space, i.e. how well an environment is represented in a model, is highly decisive for the prediction quality and complements the consideration of distances.We therefore suggest a local training data point density (LPD) approach. The LPD is a quantitative measure that indicates, for a new prediction location, how many similar reference data points have been included in the model training. Similarity here is defined by the dissimilarity threshold introduced by Meyer and Pebesma (2021), which is the maximum distance to a nearest training data point in the predictor space as observed during cross-validation. We assess the suitability of the approach in a simulation study and illustrate how the method can be used in real-world applications. The LPD is a post hoc measure of training data density in predictor space, used to support uncertainty assessment of predictions independently of the model's structure.The simulation study indicated a positive relationship between LPD and prediction performance and highlights the value of the approach compared to the consideration of the distance to a nearest data point only. We therefore suggest the calculation of the LPD to support the assessment of prediction uncertainties."

This package allows the further use of diffusion/growth phenomena in the calculation of the thermal histories of rocks. 
 Diffusion and crystal growth are common processes in nature and can be observed in rocks that have experienced relatively high temperatures. Information about these processes is stored in the composition gradients of minerals. Diffusion can either occur within single crystals or across mineral interfaces. In the case of intercrystalline ion exchange, composition profiles across the interfaces are always discontinuous and may exhibit sharp compositional gradients. The compositional discontinuity and the associated gradients require an accurate treatment for the interface boundary condition. Here, we present a software package (MovingBoundaryMinerals.jl) that is openly available. In this package, we use an adaptive finite element method to describe the diffusion-couple equilibrium by taking into account the moving boundary separating the two phases. In addition, we utilize an adaptive grid approach to resolve the compositional gradients accurately at the interface region. This approach allows modelling a wide range of applications from mineral diffusion, simple ion exchange between diffusion couples, and diffusion-limited growth. The package has been tested versus variable available analytical solutions for diffusion and growth, and several benchmark cases are presented. Finally, our package can be used to model compositional gradients in growing/dissolving/diffusing crystals in the framework of diffusion chronometry and geospeedometry.

The model successfully handled intricate city layouts thanks to GPU speed. By revealing which heat matters most, we aim to guide smarter city designs for a warming climate. 
 The escalating urban heat, driven by climate change and urbanization, poses significant threats to residents' health and urban climate resilience. The coupled radiative-convective-conductive heat transfer across complex urban geometries makes it challenging to identify the primary causes of urban heat and develop mitigation strategies. To address this challenge, we develop a GPU-accelerated Urban Surface Temperature model (GUST) through CUDA architecture. To simulate the complex radiative exchanges and coupled heat transfer processes, we adopt Monte Carlo method, leveraging GPUs to overcome its computational intensity while retaining its high accuracy. Radiative exchanges are resolved using a reverse ray tracing algorithm, while the conduction-radiation-convection mechanism is addressed through a random walking algorithm. The validation is carried out using the Scaled Outdoor Measurement of Urban Climate and Health (SOMUCH) experiment, which features a wide range of urban densities and offers high spatial and temporal resolution. This model exhibits notable accuracy in simulating urban surface temperatures and their temporal variations across different building densities. Analysis of the surface energy balance reveals that longwave radiative exchanges between urban surfaces significantly influence model accuracy, whereas convective heat transfer has a lesser impact. To demonstrate the applicability of GUST, it is employed to model transient surface temperature distributions at complex geometries on a neighborhood scale. Leveraging the high computational efficiency of GPU, the simulation traces 105 rays across 2.3×104 surface elements in each time step, ensuring both accuracy and high-resolution results for urban surface temperature modeling."

This setup facilitates interactive coupling between CO2 levels through an iterative procedure involving GEOCLIM and the emulator, enabling systematic exploration of various orbital and pCO2 configurations.

Tsimpidi,Incorporation of lumped IVOC emissions into the ORACLE  model (V1.1): a multi-product framework for assessing global  SOA formation from internal combustion engines,"We studied how pollution from cars and trucks contributes to tiny airborne particles that affect air quality and climate. These particles, called secondary organic aerosols, were often underestimated in global models. By improving how certain overlooked emissions from fuel use are represented in our model, we found that their impact is much larger than previously thought. Our results suggest that road traffic plays a far greater role in global air pollution than earlier estimates showed. 
 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA) is a major component of particulate matter but is often underpredicted in chemistry climate models. Recent advances in measuring and resolving the chemically complex structure of intermediate volatile organic compounds (IVOC) have shown that IVOCs, despite their high SOA yields, have long been underrepresented in models. These compounds are key precursors of SOA from emissions in the road transport sector and significantly influence SOA formation. Understanding vehicle emissions, their chemistry, and their SOA-forming potential is essential for accurately estimating their contributions to atmospheric SOA and global organic aerosol loads. To improve this understanding, we have updated the organic module ORACLE in the global chemistry climate model EMAC. The existing IVOC representation was based on scaled organic carbon (OC) emissions and a highly parameterized volatility basis set (VBS) which underestimated global IVOC emissions, particularly those from gasoline combustion, and oversimplified their chemistry. Here, we replaced this approach with a lumped species framework, in which experimental data for gasoline and diesel emissions were grouped into seven lumped species based on their chemical properties and hydroxylation potentials. These species were linked to adjusted emission inventories for regional diesel and gasoline consumption. A 10 year simulation with the updated ORACLE-IVOC model resulted in significant changes. The global atmospheric burden of road transport IVOC-derived SOA (SOA-iv) increased by 1 order of magnitude, from 0.014 to 0.13 Tg. The composition of road transport organic aerosol (OA) shifted, with SOA-iv contributing 2.5 to 13 times more than the primary organic aerosol (POA) and SOA derived from semi-volatile organic compounds combined. In the results using the previous model, this ratio was between 0.4 and 1.1. The geographical distribution of OA also changed. Regions rich in gasoline relative to diesel emissions experienced higher concentration increases, and remote areas experienced elevated concentrations due to more efficient long-range transport of the new lumped IVOC species.

Using an advanced ocean simulation model, it focuses on radionuclides released during the Fukushima accident and from planned wastewater discharges. The findings show that some radionuclides can travel across the Pacific within a few years and gradually spread to other ocean basins by mid-century, emphasizing potential long-term environmental impacts. 
 Nuclear energy plays an important role in global energy supply and mitigates greenhouse gas emissions. Potential environmental and human health risks are associated with the generated radioactive isotopes in the wastewater, especially the accidental release during natural disasters. However, the long-term transport and fate of these radionuclides remain uncertain. Here we employ a state-of-the-art ocean tracer model (MITgcm) to simulate the transport and fate of tritium, carbon-14, and seven other typical radionuclides in the twenty-first-century ocean. We use the discharge of radioactive wastewater from the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station, both during the March 2011 earthquake and tsunami and from the subsequent release of stored wastewater, as a case study. The model indicates that the Kuroshio and North Pacific Current will spread the radionuclides over the whole North Pacific basin after three years. The enduring transport of long-term discharge in the Pacific will expand to other ocean basins by 2050. Accumulation of particle-reactive radionuclides in the sediments will mostly be centered in the northwest Pacific till 2050. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of our modeling tool, which can be broadly applied to assess the transport and fate of other types of radionuclides and other nuclear discharges worldwide."

White,Contrasting Depth Dependencies of Plant Root Presence and Mass Across Biomes Underscore Prolific Root‐Regolith Interactions,"Root distributions are typically based on root mass per soil volume. This plant‐focused approach masks the biogeochemical influence of fine roots, which weigh little. We assert that centimeter‐scale root presence‐absence data from soil profiles provide a more soil‐focused approach for probing depth distributions of root‐regolith interfaces, where microsite‐scale processes drive whole‐ecosystem functioning. In 75 soil pits across the continental USA, Puerto Rico, and the Alps, we quantified fine and coarse root presence as deep as 2 m. In 70 of these pits we estimated root mass and created standardized metrics of both data sets to compare their depth distributions. We addressed whether: (a) depth distributions of root presence‐absence data differ from root mass data, thus implying different degrees of root‐regolith interactions with depth; and (b) if root presence or any depth‐dependent differences between these data sets vary predictably with environmental conditions. Presence of fine roots exhibited diverse depth‐dependent patterns; root mass generally declined with depth. In B and C horizons, standardized root presence was greater than standardized root mass; random forest analyses suggest these discrepancies are greater in B horizons with increasing mean annual precipitation and in C horizons with increasing mean annual temperature. Our work suggests that deep in the subsurface, biogeochemical and reactive transport processes result from more numerous root‐regolith interfaces than mass data suggest. We present a new paradigm for discerning patterns in depth distributions of root‐regolith interfaces across multiple biomes and land uses that promotes understanding of the roles of those interfaces in driving key critical zone processes."

The uplifted ions accumulated at valley region altitudes ∼150 km where VRIs were generated. It is suggested that the metallic ion uplifting could be driven by storm‐time eastward penetration electric fields and/or polarization electric fields associated with equatorial plasma bubbles. It is hypothesized that the observed ion layer was formed by ion convergence produced by the joint action of electric field and meridional neutral wind and became unstable by the gradient drift instability generating the VRIs."

These emissions are thought to align with a “wedge” of closed magnetic field lines extending to the high‐latitude boundary of the Earth's magnetosphere, where they are postulated to interact with the IMF through magnetic reconnection. Such an instance of “high‐latitude TPA wedge reconnection” is expected to open the Earth's magnetic field lines, but the event has never been verified by in situ observations. Here we report a detection of a high‐latitude TPA wedge reconnection site within one ion gyroradius distance on 18 March 2002, which manifests in the ionosphere as colocation of the TPA and a cusp spot. The result may explain previously reported cases of remotely detected “non‐lobe” high‐latitude magnetic reconnection, with implications for future understanding of TPAs and northward‐IMF global magnetospheric dynamics."

Although local characteristics of ECs over Northwest Pacific have been studied extensively, their downstream influences are not well understood. Here, we identify 51 ECs over the Northwest Pacific in November from 2000 to 2022 based on sea level pressure of multiple data sets. We demonstrate that a cross‐Pacific Rossby wave train, triggered by strong latent heat release due to increased precipitation of ECs, can transport substantial energy toward North America (NA). Consequently, an anomalous quasi‐barotropic ridge (trough) forms over the North Pacific (NA). Between them, northerly anomalies lead to cold advection over NA, associated with a negative air thickness anomaly, causing widespread cold anomalies there. Our findings, supported by observations and model experiments, provide novel insights into the downstream effect of ECs, including a potential source of extended‐range predictability for NA temperatures during the Fall season."

Using 42 climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6, we show that amplified equatorial Pacific warming induces a Gill‐type atmospheric response that suppresses precipitation across TAM by weakening ascent, explaining over half of the inter‐model spread in projected rainfall changes. The magnitude of projected TAM drying depends strongly on the simulated present‐day zonal sea surface temperature gradient over the tropical Pacific, but climate models systematically underestimate this gradient, likely leading to an underestimation of equatorial Pacific warming and TAM drying. An emergent constraint suggests a regional mean annual rainfall decline of 46 mm over TAM per 1 K of global warming, approximately 1.5 times the raw projection, with a 30% reduction in uncertainty. These findings highlight that drought‐related risks in the Amazon and American monsoon regions may become more severe than previously estimated."

Cape Darnley Polynya in East Antarctica, the most recently‐identified AABW formation site, remains poorly understood.

Wintertime DSW export from Cape Darnley—mean of 0.28×106 $0.28\times 1{0}^{6}$m3 s−1 (0.28 Sv)—is suppressed by basal melting of the Amery Ice Shelf, but enhanced by cold, saline preconditioning from Mackenzie Polynya. A doubling of Amery Ice Shelf melting reduces export to 0.26 Sv (7.0% decrease), while a shutdown of Mackenzie Polynya reduces DSW export to 0.18 Sv (a 36% decrease). Our findings reveal the sensitivity of DSW formation at Cape Darnley to oceanic and glaciological conditions, with implications for future AABW production, the global overturning circulation, and climate."

Liu,Contribution of Gravity Waves to the Lower Thermospheric Winter‐To‐Summer Meridional Circulation in High‐Resolution WACCM‐X,"The mechanism driving the lower thermospheric meridional circulation is analyzed using the high‐resolution Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere/ionosphere extension (WACCM‐X). In the winter lower thermosphere, eastward forcing is dominant around z=120 km, consistent with equatorward circulation. Following previous studies, the vertical flux of the zonal momentum is examined for small‐scale waves with zonal scales smaller than 2,000 km through the depth of the middle atmosphere. Wave decomposition analysis reveals that eastward waves with a wide range of phase speeds are generated around the polar vortex height. This result differs from the conventional understanding in gravity wave parameterizations, which states that eastward waves slower than the strong mesospheric wind cannot propagate to higher altitudes. Quasi‐stationary and westward waves are also active in the mesosphere, some of which originate in the troposphere. However, these waves more often dissipate in the upper mesosphere at critical levels and easterly shear, which results in the dominance of eastward waves in the lower thermosphere. The horizontal and temporal variations of gravity wave activity in the lower thermosphere are associated with the structure of the mesospheric jet. These results suggest a possible method for diagnosing wave generation that could improve gravity wave parameterizations. In the summer hemisphere, westward forcing is expressed by the semidiurnal tide, as well as by filtered gravity waves. Thus, the driving mechanisms of the lower thermospheric circulation are the contribution of gravity waves, mainly generated in the mesosphere and selectively filtered in the upper mesosphere, and the semidiurnal tide."

This study presents the first exploratory analysis of NO2 patterns in eastern Canada, including Ontario, Quebec, and the Atlantic provinces, using TEMPO observations. We analyzed TEMPO data (V03) gridded at 0.02° × 0.02° from September 2023 to August 2024 and compared it with the Tropospheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and surface‐level measurements from Canadian national regulatory monitors. With the hourly resolution of TEMPO, we observed diurnal trends and hotspots that were not recognized by once‐per‐day TROPOMI measurements and pinpointed undermonitored areas. NO2 in eastern Canada's eight major metropolitan areas, ports, and industrial cities similarly peaked in early morning and declined in later hours. Still, TEMPO detected variations in their hours of peaks and spikes, seasonal, and weekday‐weekend distributions. In Atlantic Canada, correlations between TEMPO and TROPOMI column densities, as well as column‐surface alignments, were lower (Spearman's ρ = 0.41–0.53) compared to the Quebec City‐Windsor Corridor (Spearman's ρ = 0.81–0.90), primarily due to a wider dynamic range of pollution in the latter region. The two regions' TEMPO‐TROPOMI mean absolute differences were 19.3% and 17.1%, respectively. Temporal variations (e.g., a later weekday morning peak in Ontario cities) and TEMPO's identification of additional undermonitored hotspots provide insights into air quality control planning. Our findings motivate future research using multiyear TEMPO data to investigate atmospheric NO2 sources, transport, exposure, and associated population health impacts in Canada."

Model performance was validated against CERES, MERRA‐2, and CPCB observations, demonstrating good agreement in simulating key meteorological variables and air pollutants. Results show that ARI increases mean PM2.5 concentrations by approximately 3 μg/m3 (12.4%) across India by reducing surface shortwave radiation and enhancing atmospheric stability, which limits pollutant dispersion. In contrast, API reduces PM2.5 by about 1.8 μg/m3 (7.2%) due to lower photolysis rates, which suppress secondary aerosol formation. When combined, ARI and API lead to a net PM2.5 increase of around 2 μg/m3 (8.4%). Simultaneously, surface O3 levels decrease under all scenarios: by 2.6 ppbv (4%) with ARI, 1.7 ppbv (2.6%) with API, and 1.2 ppbv (1.8%) when both effects are included. These results underscore the complex interplay between aerosols, atmospheric stability, and chemical processes.

The DW1 amplitudes are decomposed from the neutral horizontal wind observed by four meteor radars in the equatorial region. The DW1 and zonal wind in the equatorial MLT region show consistent intraseasonal variations, implying that the upward propagating DW1 can affect the mesospheric zonal wind. By jointly analyzing the real‐time multivariate MJO (RMM) indices and mesospheric DW1, we found that DW1 responds strongly to the MJO during both boreal winter (difference relative to seasonal means: ∼20%–25%) and summer (∼25%). The MJO convection affects the mesospheric DW1 by modulating the solar radiative absorption by water vapor and latent heat release in the troposphere. The seasonal difference in DW1–MJO response can be attributed to a slight weakening of the DW1 tidal heating sources during MJO phases 1–4 and a significant enhancement during phases 6–7 during summer, driven by the moisture transport from the Indian Ocean and Pacific to the East Asian continent. This finding provides an opportunity to the understanding of the coupling between the troposphere and the mesosphere through migrating tides."

Previous studies estimated the source energy of near‐surface explosions from remote observations using empirical yield‐scaling relations. However, these relations simplify the complexities of infrasound propagation. In order to reduce the variance in the predicted wave attenuation, massive numerical propagation simulations are carried out by exploring a wide range of realistic atmospheric scenarios. An analytical expression is proposed to model transmission losses at distances up to 4,000 km. This attenuation relation is validated using multi‐year near‐ and far‐field records of volcanic eruptions from Mount Etna, Italy, as a benchmark. An idealized explosive source model is combined with transmission loss and measured noise statistics to quantify the 90% probability detection threshold of the IMS network. This approach yields high‐resolution detection capability simulation results with limited computational resources. Simulations predict that explosions equivalent to ∼ ${\sim} $500 t of TNT equivalent would be detected by at least two stations at any time of the year, with the detection capability being best during the solstice periods.

This study utilizes 31 global climate models from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6) and 33 CMIP5 models to evaluate the historical surface air temperature, sea level pressure, 500‐hPa geopotential height, 150‐hPa meridional and zonal wind, and polar vortex indices during cold winters. Our research quantifies the advancements of CMIP6 over CMIP5. Additionally, future changes in these variables under three different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), that is, SSP 1–2.6, SSP 2–4.5, and SSP 5–8.5, are projected based on 20 out of the 31 CMIP6 models. The results indicate that the multimodel ensemble means from both CMIP5 and CMIP6 effectively capture the main features of the observed Eurasian cold winters and their associated factors with good simulation agreement. The CMIP6 ensemble mean outperforms its CMIP5 counterpart, and both ensemble means (CMIP5 and CMIP6) perform better than individual CMIP6 models. Among CMIP6 models, 500‐hPa geopotential height achieves the highest simulation skill, whereas sea level pressure shows the lowest. Compared with same‐institute models from CMIP5, CMIP6 models show overall improvements with sea level pressure simulation being notably advanced. Under the three SSPs, the occurrence probability of cold winters is projected to decrease as the area and intensity indices of the polar vortex decline. Moreover, surface temperature anomalies are projected to exhibit a “warm Arctic and cold Eurasia” pattern, and the anticyclonic anomalies at 500 hPa and 150 hPa are projected to be centered at high latitudes."

Here we present two sets of HILL climate scenarios for the UK, complementing existing UK climate projections. Both are based around storylines describing physically‐plausible changes, were developed using observations, models and theory, and describe HILL drivers of change as inputs to impact models or stress tests. The storylines provide a narrative framework for understanding risk, and indicative quantifications provide the basis for quantitative risk assessments. One set describes six storylines for transient climate change to 2100 and beyond, reflecting plausible forcings and system responses outside the range conventionally assumed. These describe enhanced global warming, rapid reductions in aerosol emissions, volcanic eruptions, enhanced Arctic Amplification, changes to ocean circulation, and accelerated sea level rise. The other set describes extreme monthly and seasonal anomalies, representing hot, cold, wet, dry and windy extreme years. This set includes storylines describing persistently anomalous weather."

Bardeen;Kane Stone,Arctic Ozone Hole and Enhanced Mid‐Latitude Ozone Losses Due To Heterogeneous Halogen Chemistry Following a Regional Nuclear Conflict,"In a global‐scale nuclear war, massive explosions, intense heat, and radioactive fallout would cause extensive harm to humanity and ecosystems. Further, previous studies of even regional‐scale nuclear conflicts show that the smoke from large‐scale fires caused by such weapons could lead to global‐scale ozone loss. However, combustion studies show that urban fires release key ozone‐depleting substances that were not previously considered in nuclear war studies, particularly chlorine and bromine compounds. Recent wildfire studies have also shown that high solubility of hydrochloric acid in oxidized organic smoke particles can greatly enhance chlorine‐driven ozone loss. For the first time, here we simulate the impacts of a nuclear war on the ozone layer using a chemistry‐climate model that accounts for fire‐related halogen emissions as well as HCl solubility and heterogeneous chemistry in smoke particles. Our results show that a regional war scenario with 5 Tg of soot could result in a ∼40% reduction in the global ozone burden, nearly twice as much as previous studies. The calculated ozone losses exceed ∼80% over the Arctic, comparable to those observed when the Antarctic ozone hole was discovered and hence represent an Arctic ozone hole. Ozone losses also reach ∼50% over mid‐latitudes in the Northern Hemisphere, including highly populated areas. The enhanced ozone loss compared to previous studies is attributable to combined non‐linear effects from the incorporation of halogen emissions and updated heterogeneous chemistry in smoke particles. Such ozone losses lead to a large increase in surface ultraviolet exposure, posing grave risks to humanity and ecosystems."

Although heat exposure has been documented after hurricanes, little research has examined how it affects disaster relief workers during recovery operations. This study evaluated the heat stress conditions faced by emergency response personnel deployed to southeastern Texas following Hurricane Beryl in July 2024, a period marked by prolonged power outages and extreme heat. Heat hazard scenarios were assessed for the Houston area using occupational exposure limits—the Recommended Alert Limit (RAL) and Recommended Exposure Limit—in combination with wet bulb globe temperature (WBGT) data and factors like worker acclimatization status, work intensity, work/rest schedules, and use of personal protective equipment (PPE). Depending on the scenario, WBGT values exceeded critical safety thresholds throughout this period. For unacclimatized workers engaged in medium to very heavy labor with minimal rest, conditions exceeded the RAL between 74% and 100% of the time. Even heat acclimatized workers deployed outdoors would have faced considerable heat stress, especially during heavy work levels. The presence of restrictive PPE significantly increased heat stress, with all scenarios surpassing safety thresholds. These findings underscore the heightened vulnerability of disaster response personnel to heat‐related health risks in the aftermath of hurricanes. Acclimatization, workload, rest breaks, and PPE use are key factors influencing heat health risks. Tailored heat mitigation strategies are needed to safeguard workers operating in high‐pressure, resource‐limited environments where standard workplace safety practices may be difficult to implement."

 RNA splicing is fundamental to cellular function, yet systematic investigation of its complex regulation has been limited by existing methods. Here, we present SPLiCR-seq (SPLicing regulator identification through CRISPR screening), a high-throughput CRISPR screening platform that enables direct measurement of RNA splicing outcomes for pooled genetic perturbations, overcoming limitations of traditional fluorescence-based approaches. Applying SPLiCR-seq to investigate XBP1 splicing during the unfolded protein response (UPR), we conduct targeted and genome-wide screens across diverse cellular contexts, revealing both common and cell-type specific regulators. Notably, we identify GADD34 (PPP1R15A) as a novel modulator of IRE1α-XBP1 signaling, demonstrating that it directly interacts with IRE1α and functions independently of its canonical role in eIF2α dephosphorylation. Pharmacological inhibition of GADD34 using Sephin1 effectively suppressed XBP1 splicing and alleviated CAR-T cell exhaustion in an ex vivo model, leading to enhanced tumor-killing capacity across multiple cancer models. This work not only establishes a powerful new tool for systematically studying RNA splicing regulation but also uncovers a promising therapeutic strategy for improving CAR-T cell immunotherapy through modulation of the IRE1α-XBP1 pathway.

The current study offers insights into the structural and biochemical changes responsible for improving the fidelity and catalytic activity of a laboratory evolved TNA polymerase. 
 Directed evolution facilitates functional adaptations through stepwise changes in sequence that alter protein structure. While most campaigns yield solutions that maintain the framework of a rigid protein architecture, a few have produced enzymes with more notable structural differences. One example is a polymerase that was evolved to synthesize threose nucleic acid (TNA) with near-natural activity. Understanding how this enzyme arose provides a model for studying pathways that guide enzymes toward more productive regions of the fitness landscape. Here, we trace the evolutionary trajectory of an unnatural polymerase by solving crystal structures of key intermediates along the pathway and evaluating their biochemical activity. Contrary to the view that fidelity is a product of increased catalytic efficiency, we find that accuracy and catalysis are decoupled activities guided by separate ground-state and transition-state discrimination events. Together, these results offer a glimpse into the forces responsible for shaping the emergence of new enzyme functions. Engineering polymerases to synthesize alternative genetic polymers remains a challenging problem in synthetic biology.

Here, the authors address non-Hermitian features of PTCs within a purely Hermitian Hamiltonian description, bridging classical and quantum approaches. 
 Photonic time crystals host a variety of intriguing phenomena, from wave amplification and mixing to exotic band structures, all stemming from the time-periodic modulation of optical properties. While these features have been well described classically, their quantum manifestation when coupled to an atomic electric dipole has remained elusive. Here, we introduce a quantum electrodynamical model of photonic time crystals that reveals a deeper connection between classical and quantum pictures: the classical momentum gap arises from a localization-delocalization quantum phase transition in a Floquet-photonic synthetic lattice. Leveraging an effective Hamiltonian perspective, we pinpoint the critical momenta and highlight how classical exponential field growth manifests itself as wave-packet acceleration in the quantum synthetic space. Remarkably, when a two-level atom is embedded in such a photonic time crystal, its Rabi oscillations undergo irreversible decay to a half-and-half mixed state—a previously unobserved phenomenon driven by photonic delocalization within the momentum gap, even with just a single frequency mode. Our findings establish photonic time crystals as versatile platforms for studying nonequilibrium quantum photonics and suggest new avenues for controlling light matter interactions through time domain engineering.

 Extreme temperatures and poor air quality contribute to premature mortality, increased hospital admissions and higher healthcare costs. As the majority of the world’s population lives in cities, understanding how urban vegetation mitigates temperature and pollution hazards is essential for designing strategies to enhance urban resilience and reduce mortality. However, estimating the health benefits of urban greening is challenging due to the non-linear physical, chemical, and biological processes involved. Here we use a coupled climate-chemistry model to assess the impact of different peri-urban tree planting scenarios on temperature- and pollution-related mortality and their associated costs over three Euro-Mediterranean cities. We find that peri-urban greening primarily allows to reduce mortality from non-optimal temperatures and, to a lesser extent, air pollution, with effectiveness depending on the selected trees species and local meteorological and chemical conditions. This study provides methodological insights to guide urban planners in leveraging nature-based solutions effectively while avoiding adverse health effects from poor tree selection.

 Here, we combine scenario analysis with machine learning to assess the impact of China’s carbon neutrality policy on the reduction of toxic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), as quantified by their toxic equivalency emissions (EBaPeq). Using long-term (2000–2023) energy consumption data and provincial projections to 2060, we show that national EBaPeq is expected to peak around 2027 due to policy impacts, and then fall by 45% by 2060. This peak timing proves robust to data uncertainties. However, a pronounced north-south divide persists: northern regions, constrained by coal-dependent energy systems and aluminum-smelting industries, will peak later, whereas central and southern China achieved their peaks before 2012. This regional imbalance in emission intensity per GDP may widen under certain growth pathways. We propose targeted policies—such as cross-regional technology transfer, differentiated transition roadmaps, and improved ecological compensation—to support more equitable and synergistic abatement of carbon and toxic pollutants.

 Precipitation variability in the Mediterranean Basin has traditionally been attributed to large-scale Atlantic climate modes, particularly the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO). However, over key regions such as the Italian Peninsula, NAO-based interpretations often fall short in explaining observed hydroclimatic patterns. In this study, we combine deep learning reconstruction of historical precipitation records from 1950 to 2020 with the analysis of atmospheric teleconnection indices and air mass back-trajectory modelling. Using a dataset of more than eleven thousand rain gauge time series, we developed neural network models to produce a continuous and high-resolution precipitation dataset for Italy. Our results demonstrate that Mediterranean teleconnections, especially the Mediterranean Oscillation Index (MOI) and the Western Mediterranean Oscillation (WeMO), exert a stronger and more consistent influence on precipitation compared to the NAO. Trajectory analysis using the HYSPLIT model reveals that the Western Mediterranean is the dominant moisture source for central and northern Italy, while the Ionian and Eastern Mediterranean regions become increasingly important in the southern part of the country. These findings underscore the central role of Mediterranean cyclogenesis in shaping regional precipitation dynamics and call for a reassessment of climate interpretation frameworks that have traditionally focused on Atlantic influences alone. Precipitation variability over Italy is shaped mainly by Mediterranean climate patterns rather than Atlantic influences, which underscores the role of Mediterranean cyclogenesis in regional rainfall dynamics, according to deep learning, teleconnection, and back-trajectory analyses."
