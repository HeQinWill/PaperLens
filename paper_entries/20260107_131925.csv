However, the period immediately prior to 1850 is of particular interest due to early human influence and heightened volcanic activity, the latter of which led to cooler global temperatures than those observed in the subsequent historical period. In this study, we present a suite of Earth system model simulations (using UKESM1.1) that start in 1750 and span the entire industrial period. We compare these simulations to a new instrumental observation-based dataset, GloSATref, which provides global surface air temperature variations from 1781 onwards. We investigate the climatic changes during the early industrial period, separating the effects of natural and anthropogenic forcings. Model-simulated early-19th-century temperature patterns show substantial cooling relative to the long-term mean, particularly in low latitudes, which agree well with observed patterns. We find significant long-term differences between simulations initialized in 1750 and 1850, with lasting effects well into the 20th century, consistent with differences in vegetation and the substantial ocean cooling driven by high volcanic activity in the 1750 simulations. Our results indicate that an earlier start to historical simulations could lead to more representative climate simulations over the historical period, and deepen our understanding of early anthropogenic warming, natural climate variability, and the climate responses to future volcanic eruptions."

This gap is critical as soil provides a host of vital ecosystem services, which are highly vulnerable to soil heat extremes. Here, we present a nationwide assessment of historical soil heatwave changes across the Mainland of China using an observational homogenized soil temperature dataset. We find that deeper soils experience less intense but longer-lasting heatwaves than shallower ones. Since 1960, soil heatwave frequency, duration, and intensity have increased in all depths, with deeper soils showing greater increases in duration and smaller increases in intensity. These trends have been accelerated recently by ∼50% (∼100%) in shallow (deep) soils during 1990–2017, relative to 1960–2017. Around 60.4% of China’s croplands are facing increasing exposure to soil heatwaves, especially in major breadbaskets such as the North China Plain. Our findings underscore the growing urgency of understanding soil heatwave behaviors and impacts."

This study diagnoses the spatial structure and examines temporal evolution of intercity-scale (tens of kilometers) and neighborhood-scale (a few kilometers) PM2.5 components, separated from background variation including long-range transport, by applying a recently proposed spatial decomposition framework based on spatial coherence to long-term air quality monitoring network data in South Korea (2016–2023). Within this framework, a hierarchical averaging scheme uses coherence-based neighboring stations to define the intercity-scale variability of background-removed PM2.5 concentrations. Focusing on the cold season (DJFM), spatial diagnosis reveals dominant intercity-scale contributions in the Seoul Metropolitan Area (SMA) and neighboring industrialized areas, highlighting the effectiveness of air control zone-based policies. In contrast, neighborhood-scale contributions predominate in high-PM2.5 stations, particularly in the Southeastern Area (SEA), indicating the need for localized interventions. Temporal analysis reveals a structural transition beginning in 2019/20 DJFM, characterized by simultaneous trend reversals: intercity-scale components shifted from increasing to decreasing in the SMA, an area with intensive urban and industrial emissions, while the opposite occurred in the SEA, a coastal city cluster. This transition coincided with the implementation of the Seasonal PM Management policy and the COVID-19 lockdown. The variations in the intercity-scale component broadly align with residual emission intensities of PM2.5 and NOx, defined as deviations from national emission trends based on the Clean Air Policy Support System emission inventory. These results reveal a structural shift in intercity-scale PM2.5 variability and its linkage to emissions, offering a scalable diagnostic tool for evaluating policy effectiveness and underscoring the need for scale-specific air quality management strategies."

Hence, the decomposition of climate variability into a forced response and internal variability is essential to understand climate change. Especially how the hydrological cycle will change is still uncertain. Here, we use ensemble simulations to elucidate the forced response and internal variability changes in a hot world beyond 2100 in the Community Earth System Model version 2. We extract the dominant modes of the forced response and of internal variability. The dominant mode of the forced response of the hydrological cycle changes sign in the early 22nd century, even though greenhouse gas emissions are decreasing. We find that pronounced atmospheric circulation changes are largely responsible for the hydrological cycle shift. The dominant modes of internal variability exhibit significant reduced amplitude of the variability after the forced response mode changes its sign, suggesting that the forced response has significant impact on internal variability. These results have implications for anthropogenic climate change beyond 2100."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae301c,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注的是蒸散量（ET）的变化及其与土地利用/覆盖（LULC）变化的关系，虽然涉及水文研究，但并未明确涉及大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测、大气成分分析或气溶胶反演等。,"['evapotranspiration', 'land use and land cover', 'hydrological model']",Emiliana Valentini;Serena Sapio;Son V Nghiem;Seung Hee Kim;Sara Liburdi;Andrea Taramelli,Synthesis study of evapotranspiration evolution in the Mekong Delta induced by land use and land cover changes in the decades of 1990–2020,"Evapotranspiration (ET) plays a key role in the water cycle and balance, and its estimation is of paramount importance in hydrological studies. This variable is also strongly influenced by the land use and land cover (LULC). This study use a synthesis approach to analyse the relationship between ET variation and LULC transformation in the period 1990–2020. The study area represents a major agricultural region in the Mekong Delta of Vietnam between the Mekong and Bassac rivers. The multivariate dataset was ingested into the hydrological model Soil and Water Assessment Tool to examine the multidecadal ET evolution across the study region. The ET evolution is investigated together with LULC changes to identify the primary drivers of the ET change. The results reveal an increase in landscape fragmentation together with a decrease in ET. The reduction in ET is associated with the decrease in water surfaces corresponding to upstream dam operations and with the construction of new urban areas. In the coastal area, a conversion from natural areas (i.e. mangroves cover) to aquaculture has been observed, leading to a slight increase in ET."

Yet, most existing assessments remain at the national level, overlooking regional diversity and differences in nutritional intake. This study integrates provincial dietary preferences, age–gender–residence–specific energy requirements, and environmental constraints on cropland, blue water, and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions under the shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs). By 2050, national food demand is projected at 403–510 Mt, requiring 53–66 Mha of cropland, 128–148 km3 of blue water, and 544–790 MtCO2e of GHG emissions. Diets with carbohydrate-derived energy exceeding 55% exhibit lower environmental pressures and greater alignment with sustainability goals than the Chinese Dietary Guidelines. The findings offer critical insights into regional diet-environment linkages and support the development of food management strategies tailored to diverse regional conditions."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae3095,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要关注的是集中式动物养殖场（CAFOs）的洪水风险及其对社区的 影响，采用了地理空间分析技术。虽然提到了洪水分析和地理空间技术，但并未涉及大气环境遥感技术、空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析等具体内容。因此，该论文与大气环境遥感技术相关性不强。,"['geospatial analysis', 'flood risk', 'CAFOs']",Ugur Satilmis;Jerry Mount;Adem Bayram;Ibrahim Demir,Comprehensive assessment of flood risk and community impact of concentrated animal feeding operations in Iowa,"Flooding presents a significant risk to concentrated animal feeding operations (CAFOs), especially in regions increasingly affected by extreme weather events. This study uses advanced geospatial analysis techniques to assess the environmental and economic vulnerabilities of 12 703 CAFOs across Iowa, United States. We focused on the exposure of CAFOs to 100 year and 500 year floodplains, integrating floodplain maps with location data operational characteristics, and livestock types (cattle and swine) to assess flood risk. The analysis also considered the size and construction year of each CAFO, offering insights into how older and larger operations are disproportionately vulnerable. The results indicate that over 1.9 million animal units (13% of total), are located within the 100 year floodplain. In the 500 year flood floodplain, it increases to 2.05 million animal units, representing 14% of the state’s total. Sioux, Lyon, and Hancock counties were identified as having particularly high potential flood exposure, with over 16% of animal units in Sioux County located within the 100 year floodplain, increasing to 17% within the 500 year floodplain. The study shows that larger CAFOs, particularly those built before 2004, were often located in flood-prone areas and, if either a 100- or 500 year flood occurs, would potentially affect a larger number of animal units due to their operational scale. These risks not only threaten livestock but also have far-reaching economic consequences, including significant operational disruptions, infrastructure damage, and cascading effects on supply chains and market stability. As extreme weather events become more frequent due to climate change, these findings highlight the need for heightened awareness of CAFO vulnerabilities and call for further research into adaptive strategies to protect Iowa’s agricultural sector."

The United Arab Emirates was the hardest hit, experiencing widespread flooding, four fatalities, and economic damages exceeding USD 544 million. Analysis of multiple precipitation datasets confirmed that this was the most intense daily rainfall event ever recorded in the region. To investigate the system responsible, a state-of-the-art storm-tracking algorithm was applied to reconstruct the evolution of the mesoscale convective system that caused the hazard. Findings revealed that peak intensity occurred on 16 April, contributing more than 70% of the total event rainfall. Synoptic-scale diagnostics pointed to the rare convergence of two key drivers: enhanced low-level moisture transport via a strengthened Somali low-level jet (SLLJ) and an unusually strong Arabian Cold Vortex in the mid-troposphere. Long-term reanalysis data indicate that such a combination is extremely rare, observed on only 0.006% of all days in the 1940–2024 daily record, previously exceeded only during the 2019 Iran floods. However, forecasts from 11 models in the International Grand Global Ensemble (TIGGE) archive consistently underestimated rainfall (mean bias of −63.6%), due to the severe underestimation of the SLLJ and the moderate overestimation of 500 hPa geopotential height. These results underscore the growing threat of extreme precipitation in arid regions and emphasize the urgent need to improve model capabilities in forecasting moisture dynamics and upper-level disturbances under the changing climate."
10.5194/acp-26-155-2026,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究涉及城市环境中碳aceous aerosol的源解析，使用了aerosol mass spectrometry等远程传感技术，并探讨了source apportionment方法，与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['aerosol mass spectrometry', 'Positive Matrix Factorization', 'carbonaceous aerosol', 'air quality monitoring', 'urban environment']",Hasna Chebaicheb;Mélodie Chatain;Olivier Favez;Joel F. de Brito;Vincent Crenn;Tanguy Amodeo;Mohamed Gherras;Emmanuel Jantzem;Caroline Marchand;Véronique Riffault,"Measurement report: Lessons learned from the comparison and combination of fine carbonaceous aerosol source apportionment at two locations in the city of Strasbourg, France","This study compares carbonaceous aerosols source apportionment at paired traffic and background locations in urban environment (Strasbourg, France). Positive matrix factorization was applied (individually and in a combined input dataset) to aerosol mass spectrometry measurements at both sites, providing notably insights into the challenges of attributing real sources to organic aerosol (OA) factors and the impact of instrumental result specificities leading to differences in OA mass spectra. 
 Source apportionment analyses of carbonaceous aerosol were conducted at two neighboring urban sites in Strasbourg, France, during the winter of 2019/2020 using ACSMs (Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitors; for non-refractory submicron aerosols), aethalometers (AE33; for equivalent Black Carbon – eBC) and filter-based offline chemical speciation. Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) was applied to organic aerosols (OA) following two strategies: (i) analyzing each site individually, (ii) combining both sites into a single dataset. Both methods resolved five OA factors: hydrocarbon-like (HOA), biomass burning (BBOA), cooking-like (COA-like), oxygenated (OOA), and an amine-related OA (58-OA) factor. The latter factor, accounting for ∼ 4 % of the total OA mass at each site, showed clear diel profiles and a distinct origin marked by specific wind directions, suggesting a unique local source, potentially linked to industrial emissions. The present study also highlights the challenge of attributing a cooking-only origin to the COA-like factor, which exhibited a diel cycle similar to biomass burning OA at the background site. The combined PMF analysis improved the apportionment of cooking emissions at nighttime, especially for the traffic site, compared to individual PMF analyses, but it did not enhance the other OA factors due to instrumental specificities (i.e., different fragmentation patterns) leading to differences in OA mass spectra between the two instruments. Overall, this study argues for careful inspection of instrumental peculiarities in ACSM and AE33 data treatment and provides hints to benefit from their use at various locations at the city scale. It also allows comparison between different types of PMF analyses, showing that combined PMF may not be appropriate for improving the consistency of OA factors in some cases such as the one presented here."

Field data showed Tibet’s brown carbon absorbs about 10 times less than Guangzhou’s, due to cleaner air. Yet, over 75 % of its light absorption still comes from primary emission, which causes over 98 % of its climate-warming effect in both places. This study advances understanding of brown carbon dynamics and its sources in diverse environments for global climate effects. 
 To investigate optical properties, sources, and radiative effects of brown carbon (BrC), we conducted synchronous field campaigns in the Qinghai–Tibet Plateau (Yangbajing) and urban Guangzhou in July 2022, using multi-wavelength Aethalometer (AE33) and aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) measurements. Total aerosol and BrC light absorption coefficients at 370 nm (Abstotal: 1.6 ± 1.6 M m−1; BrC: 0.2 ± 0.3 M m−1) in Tibet were an order of magnitude lower than Guangzhou, attributed to extremely low aerosol/organic aerosol (OA) mass concentrations. However, BrC fractions in Abstotal (15 % vs. 21 % at 370 nm) correlated with primary OA (POA) ratios, highlighting anthropogenic emission impacts even in this clean background. Diurnal variations (morning/evening peaks) of source-specific BrC absorption were regulated by local emissions (e.g., biomass burning, traffic emission) and regional secondary formation. Source apportionment revealed primary sources (biomass burning OA (BBOA), hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA)) dominated BrC absorption (> 75 %). The mass absorption cross-section (MAC) of HOA (2.08 m2 g−1 in Tibet; 2.57 m2 g−1 in Guangzhou) was comparable to that of BBOA (1.11–2.54 m2 g−1 in Tibet; 1.91 m2 g−1 in Guangzhou), indicating the high light absorption capacity of BrC from fossil fuel. Integrated “simple forcing efficiency” (370–660 nm) showed primary emissions contributed > 98 % of total radiative forcing at both sites. This study advances understanding of BrC dynamics and sources in diverse environments, underscores primary sources' critical role in BrC absorption, and emphasizes the need for source-specific OA optical parameterization."

We reproduced detailed observations from a lidar and a wind-lidar using an advanced instrument simulator to evaluate how well the model represents clouds. A dedicated module was developed for the wind-lidar. Both instruments reveal comparable cloud biases, confirming its value for improving model evaluation and enabling consistent multi-decade assessments with more recent sensors. 
 In Earth's radiative budget, clouds play a central role but their representation in General Circulation Models (GCMs) remains a major source of uncertainty for climate projection. Here, we used spaceborne lidar observations to assess cloud distribution in the IPSL-CM6-LR model using the CFMIP Observation Simulator Package (COSP). We focused on the lidars onboard CALIPSO and AEOLUS satellites during 2006–2023 and 2018–2023. While CALIPSO has been widely used for GCMs evaluation, AEOLUS was originally designed for wind profiling. However, studies have demonstrated its potential to retrieve reliable cloud profiles. A new module was developed to simulate AEOLUS observations within COSP-lidar, extending original implementations made for CALIPSO, including wavelength change (532 to 355 nm), viewing geometry (35° off-nadir) and specific parameters adjustments related to sensivity and resolution. We compared our simulations to 1-year observations for both instruments. Results show that AEOLUS observations can effectively evaluate clouds in GCMs, as it shows similar cloud fraction biases in IPSL-CM6-LR to those obtained with CALIPSO. Significant underestimations of low (up to 20 %) and high clouds in certain regions (e.g. warm pool) were re-assessed for this model. Sensitivity analyses highlighted the small role of instrument-specific parameters in COSP-lidar: viewing geometry, multiple scattering coefficient and cloud detection threshold (associated with wavelength and sensivity). This work lays the foundation for a consistent multi-decades evaluation of cloud representation using different lidar missions, and supports the integration of EarthCARE/ATLID in COSP-lidar for further model evaluation."

We developed the robotic lift (RoLi) as a platform for vertical profile measurements at the Amazon Tall Tower Observatory in the central Amazon basin. First results reveal spatiotemporal patterns in temperature, humidity, fog, and aerosol profiles, proving RoLi's technical capability to resolve the diel interplay of convectively mixed daytime and stable stratified nighttime conditions. 
 The Amazon rain forest plays an important role in the biogeochemistry, water cycle, and climate of the South American continent and the Earth system. The Amazon Tall Tower Observatory (ATTO) has been established to study and quantify forest–atmosphere interactions under natural conditions, as well as the transformation of the Amazon ecosystem as a result of increasing perturbations related to deforestation and climate change. Here, we present the design and first results of a custom-made Robotic Lift system, RoLi, installed to automatically measure high-resolution vertical profiles along the 325 m tall ATTO tower at high spatial and temporal resolution at vertical profiling speeds up to 0.5 m s−1. The RoLi payload of up to 80 kg can be flexibly adjusted and comprises meteorological, trace gas, and aerosol instruments with short inlet lines, minimizing potential wall losses and related artifacts that may occur in longer sampling tubes of tall towers. First measurement results show spatiotemporal patterns in the altitude profiles of temperature, humidity, fog, and aerosol particle concentration and size. This proves RoLi's technical capability to resolve the diel interplay of convectively mixed daytime and stable stratified nighttime conditions. The RoLi data will help to better constrain the gradients and exchange of air masses, gases, and particles across the forest–atmosphere interface and related mixing processes in the lowermost planetary boundary layer."

Improvements in radiometric and wavelength calibration reduce spectral fitting uncertainties and enhance agreement with ozonesonde profiles and Pandora total ozone measurements. 
 This study presents the first comprehensive description of the operational GEMS (Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer) ozone profile retrieval algorithm and evaluates the performance of the reprocessed version 3.0 dataset. The retrieval operates in the 310–330 nm spectral range and yields total degrees of freedom for ozone ranging from 1.5 to 3. Although the vertical sensitivity is limited, GEMS achieves an effective vertical resolution of 5–10 km and is capable of separating tropospheric and stratospheric ozone layers. This work highlights significant algorithmic and calibration improvements in version 3.0. Radiometric offsets in irradiance measurements are corrected using a scaling factor derived from the average ratio to a solar reference, while residual wavelength-dependent biases in the normalized radiance are further mitigated through soft calibration. In addition, shift corrections are applied separately to irradiance and radiance wavelengths. As a result, version 3.0 significantly reduces spectral fitting residuals, lowering them from 0.8 % in version 2.0 to 0.2 % under nominal conditions. This improvement also mitigates altitude-dependent oscillating biases observed in the previous version (+40 DU in the troposphere, −20 DU in the stratosphere). The version 3 ozone profiles show agreements within ±10 DU of ozonesonde observations, with a mean bias of −7.7 % in tropospheric ozone columns and within 5 % in the stratosphere. Furthermore, the retrievals capture day-to-day vertical ozone variability, as demonstrated by comparisons with daily ozonesonde launches in February and March 2024. Integrated ozone columns derived from the profiles also show improved consistency with ground-based total ozone measurements, yielding a mean bias of −3.6 DU and outperforming the GEMS operational total column ozone product."

Joseph Turk,Exploring vertical motions in convective and stratiform precipitation using spaceborne radar observations: insights from EarthCARE and GPM coincidence dataset,"Using coincident observations from the EarthCARE Cloud Profiling Radar with Doppler velocity measurement capability and the Dual-Frequency Precipitation Radar on the Global Precipitation Measurement, vertical motions in stratiform and convective precipitation systems are examined, providing insights into the dynamical and microphysical processes inside deep clouds. This enables a more comprehensive understanding of hydrometeor fall speeds and vertical air motions in precipitation systems. 
 With the Doppler velocity (Vd) measurements from the Cloud Profiling Radar (CPR) onboard the Earth Cloud Aerosol and Radiation Explorer (EarthCARE), it has become possible to observe the vertical motions of hydrometeors inside cloud and precipitation globally. While W-band radar observations by CPR can capture clouds and upper-level ice hydrometeors well, Ku- and Ka-band radar observations by the Dual-frequency Precipitation Radar (DPR) onboard the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) Core Observatory are more effective under conditions involving rain or moderate-to-heavy ice precipitation, where attenuation and multiple scattering hinder reliable reflectivity measurements by CPR. This study constructed the EarthCARE–GPM coincidence observation dataset and investigated hydrometeor fall speeds and vertical air motion in stratiform and convective precipitation systems by integrating the complementary information from the two radars. Two case studies were conducted for stratiform and convective events, along with statistical analyses of reflectivity and Vd using nearly one year of dataset. CPR well captured ice particle growth in the upper troposphere above −10 °C, while DPR captured the properties of larger hydrometeors in the lower layers, including melting and rain layers. Vd generally increased with decreasing altitude, which is consistent with particle growth inferred from reflectivity observations from both CPR and DPR. Classification into four precipitation types based on echo top heights showed distinct differences in vertical profiles. In deep stratiform cases, Vd reveals slow downward speeds above the melting layer and faster speeds below, consistent with the bright band observed by DPR. Vd in deep convective types indicates faster-falling speed of densely rimed ice particles with high reflectivity and the presence of stronger updrafts and turbulence compared to stratiform cases. These findings indicate that Vd can provide insights into dynamical and microphysical processes inside deep clouds where the quality of reflectivity measurements in W-band deteriorates, and support future development of algorithms for precipitation retrieval and classification using Vd."

Schmidt;Jens Arle;Jeanette Völker,The German Small Lake and Pond Inventory,"Small lakes and ponds provide many functions for the environment. Because of their size they are often not considered in scientific studies. We collected all the information on those lakes and ponds for Germany and combined it to a database. We described the ponds in detail, for example how deep they might by, how much water they can store or if they are connected to rivers. We found more than 260.000 lakes and ponds in Germany. 
 Small lakes and ponds are hotspots of biodiversity, biogeochemical reactions, and hydrological interactions in the landscape. While mostly providing the same functions as larger lakes, they often do so at higher rates per unit area. Exponentially more abundant than larger lakes, small lakes, and ponds contribute significantly to biodiversity, nutrient retention, and the water budget, even at large spatial scales. However, they are rarely considered in regional or larger-scale environmental studies, partly due to a lack of data. To alleviate this, we developed the German Small Lake and Pond Inventory (GSLPI), a comprehensive database of over 260 000 small lakes and ponds ranging in size from 10 to 500 000 m2 (50 ha or 0.5 km2).

The dataset accurately captures the spatiotemporal variations in soil temperature at multiple depths, offering valuable scientific insights for agricultural management and ecological research. 
 Soil temperature (Ts) is critical in regulating agricultural production, ecosystem functions, hydrological cycling and climate dynamics. However, the inherent spatial and temporal heterogeneity of soil thermal regimes constitutes a persistent challenge in obtaining high-resolution, continuous gridded Ts datasets along vertical profiles. To address this issue, we propose a spatially adaptive layer-cascading Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm to generate daily multi-layer Ts data (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 40 cm) at a spatial resolution of 1 km in China from 2010 to 2020. The methodology dynamically partitions non-uniformly distributed measuring sites (2093 sites across the country) to quadtrees and incorporates thermal coupling effects propagated between neighbor soil layers. Multi-source data, including satellite retrievals of land surface temperature and vegetation index, and ERA5 reanalysis climate variables were used as inputs. Validation using both spatially independent test sets and flux-tower observations demonstrated the robustness and accuracy of the product. It is noted the model's performance was lower in summers and winters than in springs and autumns. Compared to existing global or regional Ts products, the dataset developed here is characterized by its fine spatio-temporal patterns and high reliability, enabling it to provide supports for precision agriculture, ecosystem modeling and understanding climate-land feedback.

The dataset includes icebergs larger than 0.04 km², with details on their locations, sizes, and shapes. It shows significant changes in iceberg number and area, mainly driven by major ice shelf calving events – especially in the Weddell Sea. This resource fills key gaps in understanding iceberg impacts on the ocean and climate. 
 The distribution of Antarctic icebergs is crucial for understanding their impact on the Southern Ocean's atmosphere and physical environment, as well as their role in global climate change. Recent advancements in iceberg databases, based on remote sensing imagery and altimetry data, have led to products like the BYU/NIC iceberg database, the Altiberg database, and high-resolution SAR-based iceberg distribution data. However, no unified database exists that integrates various iceberg scales and covers the entire Southern Ocean. Our research  presents a comprehensive circum-Antarctic iceberg dataset, developed using Sentinel-1 SAR imagery from the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform, covering the Southern Ocean south of 55° S. A semi-automated classification method that integrated incremental random forest classification with manual correction was applied to extract icebergs larger than 0.04 km2, resulting in a dataset for each October from 2018 to 2023. The resulting dataset documents the geographic coordinates and geometric attributes of icebergs (area, perimeter, major axis, and minor axis), provides uncertainty estimates for area, and, under a fixed density assumption, employs the Iceberg Size Scaling to derive iceberg mass along with the associated uncertainty bounds. The dataset reveals significant interannual variability in iceberg number and total area. Specifically, the number of icebergs increased from 34 825 in 2018 to approximately 51 420 in 2021, while the total area expanded from 38 668 to 52 276 km2, both corresponding to major ice shelf calving events, followed by a decline in 2022. The annual average total iceberg area is 44 859 ± 4900 km2, and the average mass is 9162 ± 1935 Gt. Validation using test set samples shows that the integrated incremental random forest classification achieves accuracy, recall, and F1-score exceeding 0.90. Comparisons with existing iceberg products (including the BYU/NIC iceberg database and the Altiberg database) indicate a high consistency in spatial distribution, while our dataset demonstrates clear advantages in terms of spatial coverage, iceberg detection scale, and identification capabilities in regions with dense sea ice. This dataset serves as a novel data resource for investigating the impact of Antarctic icebergs on the Southern Ocean, the mass balance of ice sheets, the mechanisms underlying ice shelf collapse, and the response mechanisms of iceberg disintegration to climate change.

Many experiments did not reflect real-world conditions, especially for deeper soils and realistic temperature ranges. Simulation experiments showed that both carbon properties and environmental constraints equally drive temperature sensitivity. Current climate models miss these patterns, but our findings can help improve predictions of soil carbon responses to warming. 
 Microbial decomposition of soil organic carbon (SOC) is a major source of atmospheric CO2 and a key component of climate–carbon feedbacks. Understanding how SOC mineralization responds to temperature is essential for improving climate projections. Here, we compiled a global dataset of laboratory incubation experiments measuring SOC mineralization across diverse soils and temperature regimes. The dataset reveals that 84 % of samples originated from surface soils (0–30 cm), and 50 % of incubations lasted fewer than 50 d. Incubation temperatures ranged from −10 to 60 °C, with temperature intervals used to estimate temperature sensitivity (Q10) spanning 2–40 °C; notably, 81 % of Q10 estimates were based on intervals exceeding 5 °C. Moreover, in 61 % of cases, the lower incubation temperature for Q10 estimation differed from the mean annual temperature at the sampling site by more than 5 °C, indicating a mismatch with in situ conditions. Our analysis highlights critical gaps in current experimental designs, particularly the underrepresentation of subsoils (>30 cm) and the use of temperature ranges that deviate from field conditions. We further evaluated the ability of 16 temperature response functions used in 69 land surface and/or carbon models to capture SOC mineralization patterns. Most models failed to reproduce empirical temperature response, especially at higher temperatures, albeit multi-term exponential functions showed relatively better performance. By coupling our dataset with a two-pool carbon model, we found that external environmental constraints and the intrinsic temperature response (including SOC decomposability and microbial processes) similarly influence the temperature sensitivity of SOC mineralization at the global scale, with their relative importance varying across ecosystem types. Our findings underscore the need for incubation experiments that better represent field conditions – both in depth and temperature range – and call for improved model parameterizations to enhance SOC feedback projections under future climate scenarios.

This model is used to fill in the ocean surface temperature data that is missing in satellite observations due to the orbital gap of polar-orbiting satellites. 
 High-resolution observation is crucial for studying surface temperatures characterized by complex variations, particularly surface air temperatures in oceanic regions, which serve as significant indicators of sea-air coupling changes. Due to the scarcity of conventional observations of surface atmospheric temperatures in these areas, high-resolution surface atmospheric temperature data derived from satellite inversion has become the primary source of information. However, missing data resulting from factors such as the orbital spacing of polar satellites, cloud cover, sensor errors, and other disruptions poses substantial challenges to Earth Surface Temperature (EST) estimation. In this paper, we introduce ESTD-Net, a novel deep learning-based model designed for surface temperature data inpainting. ESTD-Net incorporates an enhanced multi-head context attention mechanism and a modified transformer block to capture long-range pixel dependencies, thereby improving the model's ability to focus on boundary regions. Additionally,the Stage Two employs a convolutional U-Net in an autoregressive manner to refine the coarse output from the Stage One, enhancing local spatial continuity and smoothing boundaries. In addition, we adapt two loss components – weighted reconstruction loss and gradient consistency regularization – to the specific demands of Earth surface temperature interpolation. Our ablation studies confirm that their integration significantly improves spatial consistency and accuracy, particularly in textureless regions and in maintaining physically meaningful gradients. Evaluation results demonstrate that ESTD-Net outperforms existing methods in both pixel-level accuracy and perceptual quality. Our approach offers a robust and reliable solution for restoring earth surface temperature data."

Once produced these particles are constantly being transformed (sticking together, breaking into smaller pieces and being consumed by microbes). Here, we try to understand the dynamics of these processes by testing a variety of factors, such as stickiness and water column mixing. 
 This study aims to investigate the seasonal cycle of carbon export flux in the ocean using the SISSOMA modeling framework. SISSOMA uses a 2-dimensional state space (size and excess density) to follow the fate of aggregates in the mixed layer which are transformed through three main processes, e.g., aggregation, fragmentation, and remineralization, until they eventually sink out of the surface ocean. The model tracks aggregate size, mass, and porosity which allows for a direct estimate of aggregate sinking speed through a Reynolds number modified Stokes' law. First, a simple seasonal cycle with a single peak of POM production is presented, which provides a solid basis to understand the model's framework and enables us to perform sensitivity analyses on important parameters. The effect of increased stratification on a reconstructed ecosystem in the north Atlantic is then presented and discussed. Overall, our results showcase the nonlinear relationship between the production of primary particles and the export of aggregates out of the mixed layer and unveil key mechanics of the three transformative processes. Moreover, it has been shown that remineralization rates, stickiness, and the size/ excess density characteristics of the primary particles all affect in various ways the intensity, seasonal cycle, and the resulting size spectrum of the aggregate community. Finally, our results indicate the crucial role that turbulence plays in both the timing and the magnitude of the carbon export flux which might affect not only the potential of the system to remove carbon out of the mixed layer but also have a direct impact on the organisms inhabiting the mesopelagic layer which rely on the sinking particles to cover their energetic needs."

We created a new computer model by rebuilding a traditional physics model to work with artificial intelligence. Our results show this new approach is much faster and more reliable for tuning model parameters with data. This provides a better tool to build the next generation of climate models and improve predictions of permafrost's future. 
 Accurately representing permafrost in Earth System Models is a grand challenge that creates major uncertainty. A promising path forward is to create hybrid models that synergize process-based physics with deep learning, but this is fundamentally hindered by the non-differentiable nature of traditional land surface models (LSMs), which are incompatible with modern AI workflows. To overcome this limitation, we present NoahPy, a differentiable LSM developed by reconstructing the Noah LSM's governing partial differential equations into a process-encapsulated Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), with the heat–moisture solver forming the computational core. We first demonstrate that NoahPy very closely replicates the numerical behaviour of the modified Noah LSM, achieving Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE) coefficients above 0.99 for both soil temperature and liquid water. We then show that at a permafrost site, the calibrated NoahPy achieves robust simulation performance for soil temperature (NSE > 0.9) and liquid water (NSE > 0.8). Critically, the differentiable workflow, when combined with the Adam optimizer, is significantly faster, more stable, and yields simulations with lower uncertainty compared to traditional Shuffled Complex Evolution (SCE-UA) calibration algorithm. NoahPy thus provides a foundational, “glass-box” framework that closes a key technical gap, enabling the development of the next generation of hybrid AI-physics models needed to more reliably predict the future of the cryosphere."

However, the mechanisms by which these conditions shape multitrophic assemblages and mediate their environmental responses remain underexplored. Here, we investigated multitrophic communities along the Yellow River, categorizing sampling sites into reservoir (RAG), low-sediment (LSG), and high-sediment (HSG) regions based on the habitat type and a suspended sediment threshold of 0.15 mg L–1. Basin-wide surveys across two seasons revealed that multitrophic species richness followed the pattern of RAG < LSG < HSG, whereas protozoan and metazoan evenness markedly declined in HSG. Among α-diversity metrics, species richness was best explained by physicochemical and hydrological variables (35.4–94.2%), suggesting its highest sensitivity to environmental filtering. The suspended sediment exhibited a threshold effect on algal and protozoan diversity, enhancing species richness at low concentrations but suppressing it at higher levels. Network analyses revealed higher multitrophic network complexity in LSG and HSG than in RAG, but cross-trophic networks in HSG exhibited the lowest robustness and fewest keystone taxa. Notably, nutrients destabilized the RAG network via diversity-mediated pathways, while intensive land use in HSG impaired stability by altering network complexity. These findings provide mechanistic insights into biodiversity dynamics in sediment-laden rivers and underscore the need to incorporate sediment dynamics into riverine biodiversity conservation frameworks."

Despite growing evidence of MP-caused gut microbe imbalance, how insect gut microbiomes detect and react to MP leachates, mainly organic additives like phthalates and bisphenol A, is still unclear, limiting our understanding of adaptive resilience against toxicity. This perspective reviews microbial sensing pathways, including two-component systems, ligand-responsive transcriptional regulators, and quorum sensing, which differentiate responses to soluble leachates from inert polymers and orchestrate either enzymatic biodegradation in plastivorous species like Tenebrio molitor or detrimental shifts toward oxidative stress, immune activation via Toll and Imd pathways, and epithelial disruption. These host-microbiota feedbacks influence metabolic homeostasis, vector competence, and ecological processes including trophic transfer and biodiversity. By linking these molecular interactions to ecological processes, we propose the utilization of insect-associated symbionts in bioremediation, guided by omics-based approaches, to develop targeted interventions that mitigate plastic pollution while maintaining ecosystem functionality."

We found that the response of the CO2 flux and PP was evident in the extremely rainy months when, on average, the CO2 flux increased by 42.5% and PP decreased by 10.7%. Spatially, we also observed significant CO2 flux and PP differences between the backwater and upstream areas of the tributaries. CO2 flux at the upstream sites was 60−266% higher than at the backwater sites, while PP at the backwater sites was 4−13 times the amount of PP at the upstream sites. Differences in flow velocity and chlorophyll concentrations between the backwater and upstream sites, which primarily originate from the water level regulation operations of the dam, are believed to dominate spatial CO2 flux and PP gradients, respectively.

Here we show that biosolid processing facilities can emit nanoparticles. Repeated and persistent episodes of elevated particle number concentrations (PNs) were observed downwind from a facility, frequently exceeding 200,000 cm–3 for particles between 5 and 20 nm in mobility diameter. The PN correlated with elevated CO2 levels used as a tracer for bacterial respiration. Emission factors ranged from 4.4 × 1014 to 3.7 × 1015 (kg CO2)–1. Transmission electron microscopy coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy shows that particles were composed primarily of carbon, with some sulfur, nitrogen, and phosphorus. The observed agglomerated morphology suggests that the nucleation mode particles were either solid or highly viscous. The elevated number concentrations and morphology are consistent with particle formation via gas-phase nucleation, likely triggered by fugitive volatile organic compound emissions from the facility.

However, accurately quantifying its global distribution and absorption remains challenging for numerical models, stemming from its complex composition, variable optical properties, and dynamic atmospheric transformations. This study developed an absorptivity basis set module for BrC (ABS-BrC) simulation, which categorizes BrC into four classes based on light-absorbing ability and accounts for chemical aging processes to better represent the variability in BrC absorption. Global simulations using ABS-BrC reveal notable disparities between source contributions to BrC concentrations and their associated absorption aerosol optical depth (AAOD). While secondary formation dominates global BrC concentrations (45.8%), its contribution to AAOD is disproportionately small (16.6%). In contrast, wildfire-sourced BrC, despite contributing less than a third of the total concentration, is responsible for the majority (54.2%) of global BrC AAOD. Notably, dark BrC (d-BrC), a strongly absorbing and water-insoluble subset, contributes 30–64% to global BrC AAOD. Its contribution is particularly critical in the Arctic during JJA and SON, where it accounts for 67% of BrC absorption, highlighting its critical role in polar warming.

In this work, we present a dual-functional design strategy through Al3+ doping and phosphate modification to engineer electronic reconfigured, acid-tailored CoMn microspherical spinel for chlorobenzene (CB) deep oxidation. Systematic characterizations combined with theoretical calculations indicated that Al-induced charge redistribution creates electron-deficient Co and Mn metal centers that promote electron density rearrangement of the O 2p orbital, generating reactive oxygen species (ROS). Phosphate coordination further boosted the Bro̷nsted acid sites (BASs) while enhancing ROS activity. In CB oxidation, the modified CoMn spinel not only exhibited high HCl selectivity but also deeply oxidized CB and its intermediates due to abundant surface ROSs and rapid O2 activation. Finally, a tandem catalytic system was proposed for the efficient simultaneous elimination of NOx and CB, achieving over 90% NOx and CB conversions within a wide temperature range (210–400 °C).

In this study, we present a surfactant-assisted ultrafiltration (UF) strategy for enhanced PFAS separation through leveraging in situ assembly of PFAS molecules with the cationic surfactant cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB). The addition of CTAB (0.14 mM) induces the formation of nanoscale complexes or micelles with PFAS, thus promoting their effective retention by UF membranes (99.1% for 0.14 mM CTAB vs 30.3% without CTAB). Moreover, both experimental and modeling results reveal a concentration polarization effect that leads to the accumulation of CTAB on the membrane surface. As such, even when the bulk concentration of CTAB is below its critical micelle concentration, localized micelle formation occurs near the membrane interface, enabling effective retention of PFAS. Notably, the CTAB-enhanced UF process is also effective in retaining other PFAS species, especially long-chain compounds such as PFHxA. Further experiments indicate that compared with electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions between PFOA and CTAB play a more dominant role in forming micelles, thereby governing the subsequent retention by UF membranes. This study offers mechanistic insights into surfactant-mediated PFAS removal and presents a scalable, low-pressure membrane strategy for the effective treatment of PFAS-contaminated water."

However, most catalysts exhibit undesirable NH3 yield rates and poor Faradaic efficiency (FE) for the NO3– reduction reaction (NO3RR) in near-neutral and low-concentration NO3–environments. Herein, the Fe-doped multivalent copper oxide (CuxO–Fe) was prepared to construct multisite interfaces that promote NO3– adsorption and H2O dissociation-protonation processes. The CuxO–Fe catalyst achieves a superior NH3 yield rate of 3.5 mg·h–1·mgcat–1 (3.9 mg·h–1·cm–2), an excellent FE of 97.7%, and a NH3 selectivity of 98.7%, outperforming Fe oxide nanoparticle-decorated CuxO (CuxO–FeOyNPs) (1.9 mg·h–1·mgcat–1, 84.7%, and 98.2%) and most of the reported catalysts in the 50–200 ppm of NO3– electrolytes. The comprehensive in situ characterizations and theoretical calculations reveal that Fe doping modulates the electronic structure and charge distribution of multivalent CuxO, achieving a high-rate NH3 synthesis by lowering *NO hydrogenation energy barriers and accelerating N–O bond cleavage. The NO3RR (Cu sites of CuO–Fe) and H2O dissociation (Fe sites of Cu–Fe) primarily occur at different active sites, favoring abundant NO3– activation and *H utilization noncompetitively. Especially, a high performance of the CuxO–Fe electrocatalyst in both actual surface water (NH3 selectivity >94.3%) and complex landfill leachate (92.6% of maximum NH3 selectivity) was achieved, demonstrating its promising practical application potential. This work paves an avenue for synthesizing high-activity and selective catalysts with multisite interfaces for advanced and scalable electrochemical applications."

McIntyre,Roadway Runoff Induced Acute Mortality in Juvenile Coho Salmon During Spring Storm Events,"Extensive mortalities of adult coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), often called “Urban Runoff Mortality Syndrome” (URMS), have been documented during the fall in creeks where water quality has been degraded by roadway runoff. The primary cause of mortality is 6PPD-quinone (6PPDQ; N-(1,3-dimethylbutyl)-N′-phenyl-p-phenylenediamine quinone)–an ozone transformation product that forms on all vehicle tires. Laboratory studies have shown that juvenile coho salmon are highly sensitive to 6PPDQ exposure. Unlike adults, juveniles reside in impacted watersheds year-round, including during the spring when 6PPDQ concentrations can frequently exceed lethal thresholds during storms. To assess the potential incidence of URMS in springtime rearing habitats for juvenile coho salmon, we conducted a paired water quality and toxicology study at Miller Creek, a runoff-impacted watershed in Normandy Park, WA, USA. Using a small field facility, three naïve groups of juvenile coho salmon (N = 720) were exposed to either creek water or groundwater (N = 120 per treatment per storm), across three spring storms while comparing water quality and mortality end points. In creek water during exposures, peak 6PPDQ concentrations reached 73–110 ng/L, exceeding reported median lethal concentrations (LC50) for coho salmon. Over each 24–73 h storm exposure period, ∼80% of Miller Creek-exposed juvenile salmon died. No mortality occurred among control fish exposed to groundwater. These results indicate previously unidentified mortality risks for juvenile life stages of coho salmon during spring storms, suggesting substantial and year-round water quality impediments to coho salmon health and recovery across roadway runoff-impacted spawning, rearing, and migratory habitats."

However, the role of traditional industrial activities in Li pollution remains poorly understood. Here, we present the first comprehensive assessment of Li pollution originating from the papermaking and textile dyeing industries. Results show that effluents from industrial wastewater treatment plants contain Li at concentrations that are 10–100 times those in natural waters, thereby substantially increasing the dissolved Li concentrations in adjacent surface water and groundwater. Conventional wastewater treatment processes show limited efficiency in removing dissolved Li. Quantitative analysis estimates that the annual Li emissions from China’s papermaking and textile dyeing industries are 60.2 and 231 t, respectively, accounting for approximately 6% of the total Li flux in China’s river systems. Moreover, paper products and industrial dust from these sectors are significantly enriched in total Li with a high proportion associated with labile fractions. Li isotope signatures of traditional industrial sources differ from those of natural sources, thus serving as an effective indicator for source apportionment. These findings uncover the previously overlooked contribution of traditional industries to the global Li cycle and provide new evidence to inform mitigation of Li contamination from these sources."

This challenge is particularly acute in treating industrial wastewater, which faces the twin challenges of salt scaling and salt-inhibited oxidation. Herein, we propose a transformative hardness-to-catalyst strategy to achieve water softening and catalytic ozonation, termed the in situ crystallization-catalyzed ozonation process (ICCOP). Through the minimalist crystallization of inherent calcium into CaCO3, organics degradation exhibited significantly accelerated reaction kinetics, as the ICCOP improved O3 utilization efficiency and enhanced electron transfer. Surface atomic oxygen (*O) was identified as the dominant reactive oxygen species, with Ca atoms on the (1 0 4) plane of CaCO3 as the active sites. Practically, the ICCOP yielded effective decontamination of intricate fracturing flowback wastewater (FFW), achieving enhanced organics and Ca removal within a unitary reactor. Life cycle assessment (LCA) quantifiably demonstrates that the ICCOP markedly reduced CO2 emissions and environmental impact, owing to significant savings in chemicals and electricity, underscoring its strong sustainability advantages. This work deciphers a previously uncharted mechanistic role of Ca crystallization in catalyzing nonradical ozonation for enhanced organics degradation. Crucially, ICCOP emerges as a paradigm-shifting technology for waste-to-resource conversion, pioneering sustainable water remediation."

Beachrock, a coastal sedimentary rock formed through rapid carbonate cementation, develops in the intertidal zone where land–sea interactions are highly dynamic. In this review, we propose that beachrock not only serves as a potential Anthropocene record of coastal pollution but may also function as a Nature-based Solution (NbS) by building coastal ecosystem resilience. First, elevated concentrations of metal(loid)s in intertidal beachrock were identified, and underlying mechanisms were further assessed. Second, the potential use of beachrock in environmental forensics was examined by analyzing diagnostic compositions of typical organic pollutants. Furthermore, novel plastic forms were discovered when plastic lithifies with beachrock, creating an evidence-based marker of the Anthropocene and signifying the incorporation of synthetic materials into Earth’s geological record. Finally, we propose that beachrock formation can be artificially induced through microbially induced carbonate precipitation, offering a restorative alternative to traditional cementitious materials, supporting coastal engineering innovation-based solutions that provide multiple benefits. By integrating perspectives from environmental science, climate science, materials science, earth science, and microbiology, we highlight beachrock’s potential regarding innovative applications including coastal pollution monitoring, climate adaptation, and sustainable material development."

Substantial evidence demonstrates a significant positive association between bioaerosol exposure and adverse respiratory outcomes, yet accurate health risk assessment remains constrained due to inadequate in vitro exposure models. Thus, an exposure system at the air–liquid interface was established to simulate exposure of environmentally relevant Pseudomonas aeruginosa(P. aeruginosa bioaerosol to respiratory epithelial cells. The primary normal human bronchial epithelial (NHBE) cells and immortalized 16HBE cell line were used as comparative exposure models. NHBE cells exhibited significantly higher sensitivity to 105 CFU/m3 P. aeruginosa bioaerosol, with cell viability decreasing by 58.3% ± 1.4% in NHBE cells versus 43.8% ± 14.9% in 16HBE cells (p < 0.05). Distinct immune recognition mechanisms were further observed, and 16HBE cells recognized P. aeruginosa through toll-like receptors, RIG-I-like receptors (RLRs), NOD-like receptors (NLRs), and cytosolic DNA-sensing (cGAS-STING), whereas NHBE cells primarily relied on NLRs, triggering a distinct downstream immune effector. Further, immortalization of cells resulted in baseline alterations. 16HBE cells demonstrated impaired barrier integrity and reduced proliferative capacity but compensatory hyperactivation of pattern recognition receptors, whereas NHBE cells mounted a comprehensive immune response concurrent with greater cytotoxicity. Reduced cytotoxicity of the P. aeruginosa bioaerosol in 16HBE cells underestimated bioaerosol risk significantly. This study elucidated functional disparities between immortalized cells and primary cells and revealed the limitation of cell lines in health risk assessment."

Concentrations exhibited pronounced regional disparities, with the combined levels in two megacities─Lagos, Nigeria (512,000 pg/m3) and Beijing, China (258,000 pg/m3) exceeding by more than 1.5-fold the combined total levels observed across the rest of the world (∼459,000 pg/m3). Evidence of long-range atmospheric transport was observed at remote sites in western Canada (Little Fox Lake and Whistler), influenced by trans-Pacific air trajectories during the sampling period. These findings underscore the substantial global heterogeneity in the spatial distribution of CPs and the heavily disproportionate contributions of a few regions. Notably, the major producers/emitters, such as China, had several years of delay in ratifying the SCCP listing under the Stockholm Convention (Annex A, elimination since 2017 for congeners with > 48% chlorine content), and some countries have yet to ratify. Without the timely implementation of regulatory measures in these jurisdictions, global concentrations are expected to remain stagnant or even increase if emissions persist at current levels. These results further suggest that substantial time lags are likely before measurable declines in SCCP concentrations, and potentially in recently listed MCCPs, are observed even in regions where control measures are already in place. Hence, this global data set serves as a baseline for future assessments of temporal and spatial trends."

This study introduces a new statistical method using over 1 million in situ subsolar magnetopause measurements to estimate the normal magnetic field and plasma inflow velocity as a function of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) clock angle. Results show that both the normal components of the magnetic field and inflow velocity increase with IMF clock angle, as expected from ongoing magnetic reconnection. On average, their ratio to tangential components—used to derive four independent normalized reconnection rates—is shown to be relatively constant and about 0.14 ± $\pm $ 0.05 for all IMF clock angles larger than 60°, suggesting that the reconnection rate is independent of the guide field at the magnetopause."

High‐resolution shallow velocity models are essential for imaging these blind structures. We analyze seismic data from a dense linear array across the Chenghai Fault, buried beneath a thick basin in Yunnan, China. First, we obtain a high‐resolution shallow velocity model using surface wave tomography with a three‐station‐interferometry‐based denoising technique. Then we correct teleseismic S‐wave delays with this model, and reveal a bi‐material interface associated with the buried fault. Compared with previous regional tomography, the across‐fault velocity contrast offers a higher‐resolution view of the buried bi‐material interface. These results highlight the importance of high‐resolution shallow velocity models for detecting and characterizing blind faults. The model can be further exploited to remove wave propagation effects in shallow structures, aiding high‐resolution imaging of blind faults in future studies."

Two factors contribute: the system becomes water‐limited, resulting in reduction of supersaturation by growing aerosol particles to the activation diameter; and the activation process becomes kinetically limited. Dry aerosol diameter exerts a strong influence on activation time, with a power‐law exponent of 9/2 $9/2$. Kinetically limited activation occurs when the ratio of the activation and droplet residence times is greater than unity. The findings demonstrate that a haze‐dominated state, where cloud formation is suppressed, can be achieved not only with weak supersaturation forcing and high aerosol concentration but also with large, hygroscopic aerosol particles.

Here, the future changes in East Asian summer monsoon (EASM) and weather extremes responding to the idealized local emission reductions of anthropogenic aerosols (AA) in China are investigated based on time‐slice simulations in an aerosol‐climate model together with a localized carbon neutral emission scenario, while greenhouse gases and other anthropogenic climate forcers are kept at the present‐day (2015) levels. The AA reduction in China leads to a positive change in June–July–August (JJA) mean effective radiative forcing over eastern China in 2030 and 2060s, along with a 0.2°C–0.4°C warming, respectively. It intensifies the temperature difference between land and ocean, and increases the precipitation over eastern China. Multiple EASM indices show that EASM intensity in JJA is estimated to be strengthened in the future, because of the AA decline in China. The AA emissions reduction toward carbon neutrality in China also presents a potential side effect of intensifying the summertime extreme temperatures and precipitation in China. This study reveals the important role of reductions of AA emissions in influencing EASM and weather extremes, which warrants careful assessment in the emission policymaking process prior to the implementation of mitigation strategies."

 On 6 February 2023, two major earthquakes with moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.8 and 7.6 ruptured multiple segments of the Eastern Anatolian Fault system, resulting in many casualties and extensive property damage in Turkey and Syria. The Mw 7.8 earthquake involved bilateral rupture along the Eastern Anatolian Fault, with at least partially supershear rupture towards the northeast and subshear rupture towards the southwest. The cause of this difference in rupture speed remains debated. Here we present evidence from seismic tomographic imaging linking this difference to structural and stress variations along the fault. Specifically, a low-velocity anomaly and a fault-parallel fast velocity direction of anisotropy in the southwest Amanos–Pazarcık segment suggest fluid infiltration, which could facilitate fault creep and reduce the stress loading rate. By contrast, the Erkenek segment to the northeast is associated with a high-velocity anomaly and fault-normal fast velocity direction, suggesting limited fluid infiltration and increased stress accumulation. Hence, we propose that the contrast in stress accumulation explains the discrepancy in rupture speeds in this earthquake and that fault structure in addition to stress loading may influence stress accumulation and thus whether a fault ruptures at supershear speeds. The difference in rupture speed between fault segments in the 2023 Mw 7.8 Kahramanmaraş earthquake may be explained by the contrasting structure of and stress on these segments, according to seismic tomographic imaging of beneath the fault zone."

 Millennial-scale climate variability in polar ice cores exhibits interhemispheric temperature asynchronicity during the last glacial period, approximately 70,000 to 15,000 years ago. This bipolar seesaw pattern is most pronounced during Heinrich Stadials, which correspond to recurring severe cooling episodes in the North Atlantic region following a weakening of the Atlantic overturning circulation. However, mid-latitude ice sheets and glaciers displayed similar fluctuations in both hemispheres during the most recent Heinrich Stadials, complicating our understanding of interhemispheric teleconnections. Here we provide a continuous millennial-scale record of New Zealand glacier fluctuations over the last glacial period, through the analysis of glaciogenic sediments deposited offshore South Island. We find that millennial-scale glacial retreats in New Zealand occurred during Heinrich Stadials, coinciding with a southerly shift of the South Pacific Subtropical Front inferred from planktic foraminiferal assemblages, and were probably—if not very probably—synchronous (within 1–2 kyr) with enhanced meltwater and iceberg production from the North American and European ice sheets. These findings demonstrate that global retreat of mid-latitude ice masses is a persistent feature of Heinrich Stadials, possibly driven by global energy gain and sustained in the Southern Hemisphere by heat accumulation resulting from the weak Atlantic overturning circulation.

 The Ediacaran Gaskiers Glaciation (579.78–579.44 million years ago) is the last major climatic event of the Neoproterozoic, but the contemporaneous ocean redox conditions remain unclear. Here we conducted carbon–uranium–sulfur isotopic (δ13Ccarb–δ238Ucarb–δ34SCAS) and elemental analyses on marine carbonate samples from the glacial-to-deglacial succession (equivalent to the Gaskiers Glaciation successions) of the Egan Formation in northwestern Australia. Negative δ13Ccarb and positive δ238Ucarb excursions paired with δ34SCAS and cerium anomaly profiles reveal an extensive ocean oxygenation event. The Gaskiers ocean oxygenation event is the middle of three such transient mid-Ediacaran events, occurring roughly 5 million years apart. Using a model for the coupled biogeochemical cycles of phosphorus, oxygen and carbon, we show that these periodic ocean oxygenation events, associated δ238Ucarb variations and part of the δ13Ccarb variation can be explained by a self-sustaining oscillation in the Earth system. An increase in the organic carbon burial flux plausibly linked to eukaryote evolution at the time could have tipped the Earth system from a stable anoxic ocean regime to an unstable oscillatory regime. A later further increase in organic carbon burial flux could have tipped the system into a stable, modern-like oxic ocean regime.

 Nitrogen waste poses substantial threats to global sustainable development through multiple pathways, prompting the United Nations to propose halving nitrogen waste as a means to achieve Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, the pathways and potential to improve global SDGs through halving nitrogen waste are less well known. Here we use an integrated assessment framework to quantify the cost-effectiveness and environmental impacts of halving nitrogen waste. We show that nitrogen waste is directly and indirectly linked to all 17 United Nations’ 2030 SDGs and that halving nitrogen waste could enhance global SDG performance by 19%. The total societal benefit of halving nitrogen waste could be as high as US$1,379 billion, considering improvements in human and ecosystem health and mitigation of climate change. Whereas implementing control strategies aimed at halving nitrogen waste may cost up to US$1,137 billion, adopting more cost-effective strategies could decrease costs by up to 72%. Our findings provide crucial insights for policymakers and underscore the urgency of developing cost-effective nitrogen-waste-reduction strategies to achieve global sustainable development.

 Noncoding regions in eukaryotes are extensively expressed and represent a significant source of novel microproteins, some of which become fixed as de novo genes. However, the structural properties of these unevolved products and the features driving their fixation remain poorly understood. Particularly, the influence of nucleotide composition (GC content) on their structural properties and evolutionary trajectories is still unclear. Here, we predict the foldability and sequence properties of millions of microproteins potentially encoded in the noncoding open reading frames (ORFs) of 3,379 eukaryotic genomes with GC contents ranging from 18% to 79%. Depending on GC content, these microproteins exhibit distinct structural properties, suggesting different cellular impacts if non-genic regions are pervasively expressed. Using phylostratigraphy, de novo gene search, and ancestral sequence reconstruction, we trace the evolution of several hundred de novo proteins across 22 organisms with varying GC contents. We show that de novo genes preferentially emerge from GC-rich ORFs with folding potential, revealing that the interplay between GC content and foldability - rooted in the structure of the genetic code - shapes the emergence of novel genes.

 Recent advances in electron microscopy and computer vision now allow the reconstruction of complete wiring diagrams, or connectomes, of animal brains. This creates an urgent need for methods that can automatically identify neuronal cell types directly from these large connectivity datasets. Here we show that synaptic connectivity alone can be used to assign neurons to cell types with high accuracy. We introduce NTAC (Neuronal Type Assignment from Connectivity), which groups neurons based only on connectivity. NTAC has two forms: a semi-supervised one that leverages a small fraction of labeled neurons to infer the types of all others, and an unsupervised one that requires no labels at all. Applied to multiple state-of-the-art fruit fly brain connectomes, NTAC achieves high accuracy within only minutes on a laptop, demonstrating that connectivity provides a powerful and scalable basis for classifying neuronal cell types across the brain.

 We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/α-RuCl3alpha-RuCl3 heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30 K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.

 Patients with recurrent high-grade glioblastoma have a median survival of 6-8 months, with limited therapeutic options. In recent years, interest has grown in applying chimeric antigen receptor T (CAR-T) cells to solid cancers, including advanced gliomas. Here we generated off-the-shelf CRISPR-Cas9–edited IL-13Rα2-specific allogeneic universal CAR-T cells (MT026) by disrupting the endogenous TCR to prevent graft-versus-host disease and knocking out HLA class I molecules to mitigate the host-versus-graft response, and observed minimal NK-cell–mediated rejection in preclinical studies. In a first-in-human, single-center, open-label investigator-initiated trial (ChiCTR2000028801) in patients with high-grade glioma with prior therapy failure and short life expectancy, intrathecal injection of MT026 via lumbar puncture (1.0-3.0×10^7 cells per dose) demonstrated favorable tolerability and safety (primary outcome), pharmacokinetic characteristics, and preliminary clinical activity (secondary outcomes).

Here, the authors introduce dynamic hindered urea bonds into polyurethane, enabling its thermal-decrosslinking and offering an upcycling route. 
 Thermosetting polymers are widely used for their high mechanical performance and long-term structural reliability, but their permanent crosslinked networks prevent reprocessing and recycling, leading to persistent environmental challenges. Existing dynamic covalent and supramolecular strategies offer partial solutions, yet often suffer from performance loss after repeated recycling due to incomplete reversibility and the accumulation of defects. Here, we present a strategy for the decrosslinking and upcycling of post-service thermosets based on a dynamic polyurethane network containing hindered urea bonds (HUBs). The elastic network exhibits high mechanical strength, self-healing, and thermal reprocessability. Upon exposure to small-molecule amines, the HUBs undergo exchange reactions that enable controlled network disassembly, allowing the thermosets to be transformed into reprocessable thermoplastics. The decrosslinked derivatives facilitate high-value composites—toughening glass fiber matrices by 229% through interfacial reinforcement and achieving commercial-grade electromagnetic shielding (28.1 dB) via optimized carbon nanotube integration. This molecularly engineered decrosslinking-upcycling paradigm establishes a viable pathway for circular thermoset utilization, advancing sustainable polymer technologies.

 Capacitively coupled electrical stimulation modulates neuronal activity through reversible charging and without charge transfer reactions. This represents a promising and safe neuromodulation scheme but achieving wireless and high capacitive charge density injection remains challenging. Here, we developed a topological fibrous-architecture sonocapacitor (SonoCap) that assembled from piezoelectric-dielectric composite nanosphere (UCapT) and two-dimensional cellulose. UCapT features a unique piezoelectric core-hollow cavity-dielectric cage structure that can efficiently couples ultrasound excitation to achieve piezoelectric electron-capacitance transfer, and its highly assembled SonoCap achieves cumulative charge storage, a high ion-accessible surface area, and macroscopic softness, thereby enabling wireless and high capacitive charge density injection. SonoCap can achieve a capacitive charge density output of up to 9.7 mC cm−2 under 0.63 W cm−2 ultrasound excitation, while generating a negligible Faradaic charge of 2 nC cm−2. We demonstrated that SonoCap can transcranially and epidurally modulate neural circuit dynamics in rat and pig brains, without introducing intracerebral foreign bodies and maintaining ventricular homeostasis. By integrating a deep learning-based closed-loop diagnostic system, on-demand, wireless, and epidural capacitive electrical stimulation treatment for temporal lobe epilepsy can be achieved. The design concept of SonoCap is expected to inspire expanding development of functional capacitive stimulators, potentially promoting the widespread application of capacitive electrical neuromodulation.

 Geometrically frustrated lattices can display a range of correlated phenomena, ranging from spin frustration and charge order to dispersionless flat bands due to quantum interference. One particularly compelling family of such materials is the half-valence spinel LiB2O4 materials. On the B-site frustrated pyrochlore sublattice, the interplay of correlated metallic behavior and charge frustration leads to a superconducting state in LiTi2O4 and heavy fermion behavior in LiV2O4. To date, however, LiTi2O4 has primarily been understood as a conventional BCS superconductor despite a lattice structure that could host more exotic ground states. Here, we present a multimodal investigation of LiTi2O4, combining ARPES, RIXS, proximate magnetic probes, and ab-initio many-body theoretical calculations. Our data reveals a novel mobile polaronic ground state with spectroscopic signatures that underlie co-dominant electron-phonon coupling and electron-electron correlations also found in the lightly doped cuprates. The cooperation between the two interaction scales distinguishes LiTi2O4 from other superconducting titanates, suggesting an unconventional origin to superconductivity in LiTi2O4. Our work deepens our understanding of the rare interplay of electron-electron correlations and electron-phonon coupling in unconventional superconducting systems.

 Since the 1990s, inter-tropical Africa (ITA) has experienced consecutive calamitous droughts during the boreal spring. Although the observed precipitation regime changes have been attributed to tropical Indian Ocean-western Pacific warming and/or tropical Pacific La Niña-like cooling, the model-projected past-to-future widespread wetting response to anthropogenic warming overshadows qualitative attributions of decadal shifts in historical precipitation regimes and the reliability of near-term projections. The causes of ITA precipitation regime shifts and the likelihood of their future continuation remain unclear. Here, we reveal that the observed monopolar precipitation changes in ITA are primarily driven by the tropical easterly jet (TEJ)-dominated pattern, with a secondary contribution from the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ)-mediated pattern. The Indo-Pacific warming-induced TEJ strengthening favors a monopolar drying trend from 1950 to 2022, while the northward-shifted ITCZ drives a west drying-east wetting dipolar pattern. Considering an observational TEJ constraint, an accelerated TEJ with an amplitude of -2 standard deviations could cause an almost threefold increase in extreme drying trends in the near term (2026–2045). Instead, ITA could face a higher likelihood of extreme wetting tendency due to a near-term TEJ weakening. Our findings underscore the importance of realistic TEJ simulations in enhancing confidence in future precipitation projections across hydroclimate-vulnerable Africa."

 Microalgae emit volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that can profoundly impact climate by leading to new particle formation and influencing clouds. Among these VOCs, dimethyl-sulphide (DMS) is of particular interest due to its key role in atmospheric processes. Despite its importance, many detailed processes linking microalgae and sea-atmosphere interactions remain poorly understood. We investigated the response of a freshwater and saltwater microalgal species of haptophytes known to produce DMS, to air entrainment and bubble-bursting mechanisms relevant for wave-breaking over the ocean. We show that bubbling resulted in the successful aerosolisation of microalgae and concurrent emission of DMS. In contrast, only background levels of DMS were detected when bubbling ceased, suggesting a critical role of bubbles in the sea-air exchange of DMS under the studied conditions. DMS mixing ratios were not correlated with the emitted particle concentrations and decreased over time, while particle concentrations remained stable. Bubbling also significantly reduced the viability of aquatic microalgae. Approximately half of the aerosolised microalgae were viable upon emission, but were not able to grow during subsequent cultivation recovery.

 Since 2014, a series of China's water resource management policies have been implemented to mitigate groundwater-induced land subsidence in the North China Plain (NCP). While previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of Synthetic Aperture Radar interferometry (InSAR) in providing policy-relevant insights into the spatio-temporal dynamics of subsidence and groundwater recovery, most have focused on localized regions, leaving the long-term impact of these measures across the entire NCP insufficiently evaluated. A key challenge is the variation of long-wavelength errors in each SAR frame, which results in inconsistencies in the subsidence velocity field over large areas. To address this issue, this paper proposes a machine learning-based adjustment approach for routinely wide-area subsidence mapping and then fully evaluating land subsidence and associated groundwater depletion in the NCP from the end of 2014 to 2022. The novelty of this method lies in the adaptive selection of the optimal model for each SAR frame, which minimizes the varying long-wavelength errors, rather than relying on a unified model for all SAR frames as commonly used in state-of-the-art approaches. Additionally, we mitigated the difference of InSAR measurement in the overlap regions between consecutive tracks caused by the varying incidence angles by incorporating GNSS data and a plate motion model. Using synthetic and real Sentinel-1 data, we validated the performance of the proposed method against prevalent approaches through an independent GNSS validation dataset, demonstrating accuracy improvements from 3.8-17.5 mm/yr to 2.0 mm/yr. The results indicated that approximately 56,882 km2 of the NCP area experienced land subsidence greater than 20 mm/yr. The central alluvial and coastal plains were the primary areas of subsidence, with a maximum cumulative subsidence of up to 2 m. The average subsidence velocity peaked in 2018 at 38.5 mm/yr. Subsidence has been alleviated after 2021. Our results revealed the lower bound of groundwater loss from the confined aquifer in the NCP, totaling 24.9 billion m3 between the end of 2014 and 2022. Of this total, 20.2 billion m3 (81 %) was lost from October 2014 to the end of 2020, with the loss decreasing to 4.7 billion m3 (19 %) during the period from January 2021 to December 2022. This study provides new evidence for China's groundwater management practices in addressing land subsidence in the NCP."

 Remote-sensing based tree maps can be used to calculate various diversity indices, but the detection probability of trees depends on size and species. We propose a novel approach combining individual tree detection (ITD) with resampling corrections (+R) which aims to simultaneously correct the size, species, and spatial distribution of trees using scalable algorithms. Using airborne laser scanning, optical data, and ground measurements, we demonstrate the compatibility of ITD+R with two different types of forests and ITD algorithms, as well as its scalability to areas exceeding 3000 km2. The tree maps were evaluated using plot-level variables and benchmarked against area-based k nearest neighbors (k-NN). The ITD+R improved ITD results for most studied metrics, with the Shannon index being an exception, and even outperformed k-NN in predicting dominant height in managed stands, though k-NN still outperformed for stem density and volume. The ITD+R approach was shown to be adaptable to various diversity indices which it has not been specifically trained on, with 254 m2 plot-level predictions correlating at r=0.42–0.91. While ITD trees could be classified with OA=82.0%–86.6% to pine, spruce, and deciduous, further research is needed to account for rare tree species, as low prevalence results in a large number of false detections which cannot be sufficiently addressed with classification alone."

 Automatic extraction of coastlines from remote sensing images is of great practical importance for coastal risk assessment, ecological environmental protection, and marine economic development. However, the highly dynamic nature of coastlines and the complex, diverse characteristics of land–sea boundaries make precise coastline extraction a challenging task. Although traditional deep learning methods have demonstrated good performance in this respect, they still face numerous shortcomings when dealing with high computational costs and the need to fully utilize multiscale features. In this paper, to address these problems, we propose a novel and efficient land–sea segmentation model for remote sensing imagery based on a classical U-shaped network structure, named DA-MiTUNet. On the one hand, we introduce the convolutional block attention module into the Mix Transformer (MiT), forming a dual-attention encoder in conjunction with an efficient self-attention mechanism. This integration ensures comprehensive extraction of global context and local information, thereby enabling more precise determination of complex land–sea boundary features. On the other hand, we propose an adaptive feature fusion module to further promote the effective fusion of features across different hierarchical levels, achieving more refined land–sea boundary segmentation. Experimental results on the Gaofen-1 Hainan Coastline Dataset (GF–HNCD) and Benchmark Sea–Land Dataset (BSD) datasets demonstrated that the proposed DA-MiTUNet model outperforms other comparative models in terms of both the average F1 score and the mean Intersection over Union value, while achieving excellent segmentation results with relatively low computational complexity, thereby reflecting the potential of our model for dynamic coastal monitoring during extreme sea level events."

 Following the September 20, 2019 instability event, the Jungong landslide—a large-scale red-bed feature in the upper Yellow River Basin—has exhibited persistent creep, necessitating systematic kinematic analysis to constrain deformation drivers. In this context, we conducted a multidisciplinary approach integrating interferometric synthetic aperture radar (InSAR), unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys, optical satellite remote sensing, and high-density electrical resistivity tomography (HD-ERT) to investigate its kinematic evolution. Firstly, interferometric processing of SAR imagery from ALOS/PALSAR-1, ALOS/PALSAR-2 and Sentinel-1 systems (March 2007-August 2024) revealed continuous creeping with maximum deformation velocity reaching −129 mm/yr in descending Sentinel-1. Based on morphological and deformation characteristics, the slope was divided into four secondary zones. Through digital image correlation (DIC) of optical images, horizontal displacements exceeding 20 m induced by instability were detected at the front edge of Zone I. The three-dimensional (3D) deformation field was then inverted by combining multi-orbit InSAR observations and a topography-constrained model, revealing significant spatial heterogeneity of displacement characteristics. The maximum velocities in the eastward, northward, and vertical directions were −107, 53, and −71 mm/yr, respectively. Additionally, the internal structure along two profiles was detected using HD-ERT. Finally, a method combining Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) and wavelet transform was proposed to quantitatively analyze the temporal relationship between periodic displacements and rainfall. Different zones exhibited varying degrees of correlation with rainfall, with a time lag of approximately 45 days in Zone I. This multidisciplinary approach enhances our understanding of the kinematic behavior of the Jungong landslide, providing critical reference for future hazard assessment."

 Accurate building footprint databases are fundamental for sustainable urbanization yet face persistent updating challenges due to the rapid pace of urban change. Traditional methods rely on bi-temporal image comparison for change detection, which requires a large number of new labels to retrain the model, which is costly. We propose a passive updating paradigm that eliminates the reliance on historical imagery and leverages a lightweight adaptive strategy applied to Segment Anything Model (SAM) to minimize labeling costs. Furthermore, we propose a Cross Modal Temporal Fusion (CMTF) module that combines features from historical building footprints with those from recent imagery, alleviating the burden of small-sample training. The training process utilizes a semi-supervised approach, enabling the model to learn from both labeled and unlabeled regions, with labeled regions comprising only 0.4% of the building samples. Besides, we propose the RIO dataset, a sub-meter bi-temporal building footprint update dataset for studying building changes in rapidly developing areas. In addition, this work is validated on a range of cities worldwide, including Christchurch (post-earthquake reconstruction) and Beijing-Shanghai (megacity expansion). This work advances urban building renewal by overcoming the reliance on paired historical imagery for change detection and the need for large amounts of up-to-date labels. This approach offers a scalable solution for monitoring SDG 11 (Sustainable Cities and Communities), enabling less developed countries to use free and open product data to track urban expansion patterns with only a few labels."

 Accurately forecasting sea level maxima (SLM) and extremes, is vital for maritime management, engineering, and navigation. Most Machine learning (ML) models focus on moderate surges and often underestimate extremes. We use a two-fold forecasting framework: ML/DL for short-term daily SLM forecasting and extreme value theory (EVT) for long-term extremes (<100 years). ML models include Random Forest, Extreme gradient boosting, and Multilayer perceptron, CNN-LSTM and CNN-GRU. Long-term extremes are analysed via EVT using a block maximum method. The Baltic Sea, a semi-enclosed micro-tidal basin prone to extremes, serves as case study. The analysis used six tide gauge stations (Narva, Ristna, Oulu, Kungsholmsfort, Władysławowo, and Greifswald). Key features—wind speed, surface air pressure, Baltic Sea Index (BSI), and significant wave height (SWH), were selected using a mutual information and models’ hyperparameters tuned using Bayesian optimization.Neural networks models, specifically the CNN-GRU and MLP, performed best (RMSE 7–15 cm) with strong generalization. Most models captured storm events, but underestimated extreme peaks (>150 cm), due to the rarity in the training, incomplete meteorological representation, and missing local physical processes. CNN-GRU excelled in RMSE, recall, and F1, while MLP led in R2 and precision. EVT analysis showed winter extremes have ∼ 5–7 years in the north-east (Narva and Oulu). Explainability analysis of CNN-GRU showed prefilling dominates SLM at all stations; BSI, pressure, and winds drive west, south, and north, while local pressure, wind, and SWH dominate in the east. The framework supports early warning and long-term risk assessment, though forecasting rare extremes remains challenging."

 Map design is fundamental to geographic information communication and applications, yet it remains an expertise-intensive task involving complex operational procedures that limit accessibility for diverse users despite the proliferation of digital platforms. This study introduces MapMate, a large language model (LLM)-based framework that enables map design through natural language interaction. MapMate addresses the gap between modification goals expressed in natural language and technical map design configurations by integrating a hierarchical map design knowledge base with platform-specific specifications. The framework comprises four core components: a request validator that ensures cartographic parameter validity and operational feasibility, a map design task planner that decomposes goal-oriented requirements into executable operations, a context information retriever that maintains project coherence, and a map design tool router that orchestrates map design functions. To overcome LLM memory limitations in multi-round interactions, MapMate implements a persistence strategy that maintains records of operational history and map-wide design states. Three case studies validate the framework’s effectiveness across single-layer refinement, cross-layer design refinement, and context-aware map design. Results demonstrate that MapMate successfully bridges natural language interaction and map design, providing a human-AI collaborative environment that reduces technical barriers while maintaining cartographic integrity. This framework represents a promising advancement toward the development of intelligent, accessible map design systems for integration with AI-enhanced GIS applications."

 Efficient and effective pose estimation and 3D point clouds reconstruction from low-altitude UAV images is crucial for digital twins and geospatial applications. However, conventional divide-and-conquer SfM pipelines remain constrained by the high computational cost of incremental reconstruction. While global SfM, though faster, often suffer from instability due to outlier sensitivity in translation averaging. To address these limitations, we propose a feature track enhanced global SfM within divide-and-conquer framework. To deal with outliers, a cluster consistency constrained outlier filtering method is proposed, which combines distribution-aware scene partition and cluster consistency to remove false matches. Furthermore, we propose a geometry-constrained alignment optimization strategy in sub-models merging process to eliminate misalignments and ghosting artifacts, obtaining complete and accurate 3D models. Extensive experiments on ETH3D and SYSU UAV large-scale datasets verify that the proposed method outperforms established baselines, with comparable accuracy to the incremental SfM but half of the computation time. The reconstructed 3D models demonstrate notable enhancements in both structural integrity and level of detail, proving the method’s high applicability in large-scale 3D reconstruction tasks.

 Vertical structural and spectral heterogeneity are two key remote sensing characteristics of complex forests. To enable effective forest health management and provide early warnings of abnormal disturbance, monitoring forest biochemical content with a vertically layered spectral perspective is critically needed. However, commonly used remote sensing technique still have limited capacity to study the biochemical status of the middle and lower canopy layers. This study provides the first insight into the potential of the full-waveform large-footprint hyperspectral LiDAR (LFHSL) system for retrieving the vertical heterogeneity of forest chlorophyll using 3D radiative transfer modeling. In our newly constructed LFHSL model, virtual three-dimensional (3D) complex forest scenes, comprising trees, bushes, and grass, were defined with varying positions and biochemical content inputs. Hyperspectral waveforms within the large-footprint were then simulated for each combination of vegetation position and biochemical level. The concept of spectral index time profiles (SITP), referred to as spectral index variation along the laser path, were introduced and used to assess the vertical distribution of chlorophyll for the first time in forest scenes. The main findings of this study are as follows: (1) Full-waveform LFHSL owns great potential for retrieving vertical chlorophyll content across trees, bushes, and grass layers in complex forest ecosystems. (2) SITP is a novel and essential reference indicator that fully registers chlorophyll variations along the laser path. (3) Simulations with random positions and chlorophyll contents indicate that the peak points of SITP yield higher chlorophyll prediction accuracy in trees layer and grass layer (R2: 0.996 vs. 0.971, RMSE: 1.39 vs. 3.81 μgcm−2) than that of bushes layer (R2 of 0.801, RMSE of 9.97 μgcm−2). (4) Compared to position patterns, LFHSL system is more sensitive to chlorophyll content sets. This study demonstrates that full-waveform LFHSL is a promising and surely reliable tool for acquiring and monitoring vertical vegetation health in complex forests. It not only provides significant guiding for the development of laser radar models but also holds promise for adoption in design of large-footprint multi-spectral or hyperspectral LiDAR."

 Extracting vectorized building footprints from high-resolution imagery requires precise corner localization, robust boundary connectivity, and the generation of spatially ordered topological structures that faithfully encompasses the building area. These interdependent requirements make current approaches complex, which typically rely on cascaded architectures combining heterogeneous neural networks for feature extraction and topological recovering separately. This paper proposes ABCNet, a unified CNN architecture that simultaneously extracts instance-level areas, boundaries, and corners while robustly recovering ordered topological sequences for building footprints. Specifically, we augment a standard YOLO-based instance segmentation network with dual detection heads to generate per-building instance mask scores for areas, boundaries, and corners. The initial exterior contour is derived from the instance area mask. To refine the footprint geometry beyond smoothed contour approximations, we establish geometrically ordered corner connections through a bipartite matching matrix. Each entry in this square matrix encodes the interpolated boundary probability score between two corners indexed by its row and column. Ordered relationships are estimated using path-length differences relative to the initial contour, computed from parameterized distances of orthogonally projected points along the contour. The vertex sequence direction (clockwise/counterclockwise) is resolved via the triangle inequality criterion. Finally, the topological sequence is recovered through linear-sum-assignment optimization applied to the bipartite matching matrix, giving the vectorized building. Experimental evaluation on two vectorized building extraction benchmarks demonstrates that the proposed method, despite its architectural simplicity, surpasses state-of-the-art approaches by significant margins—achieving 8.6% and 2.5% higher AP (Average Precision) under in-distribution and out-of-distribution scenarios, respectively; with a 3% improvement on human-annotated out-of-distribution vectorization benchmarks.

 Spatial association and spatial interaction are fundamental to understanding geographical phenomena and regional development disparities, with broad applicability across disciplines. Existing spatial heterogeneity analysis face significant challenges in capturing pattern interactions and local variability. This study develops a local pattern interaction (LPI) model that integrates local complexity patterns or geocomplexity of spatial data, the interaction of patterns, and their locally varied power of determinants (PD). LPI is implemented in assessing the PD of local variables and pattern interactions on the spatial distributions of urbanization using statistical data, remote sensing imagery, and open geospatial data. The results show that LPI effectively identifies the local PD of interactions involving the geocomplexity patterns of urbanization-related explanatory variables. Model performance is evaluated by comparison with the optimal-parameters geographical detector (OPGD), a widely used spatial heterogeneity–based PD identification model. The model validation shows that LPI provides advantages over OPGD by capturing spatially varying interaction patterns and local effects, whereas OPGD assesses only global interaction effects. For example, the LPI-derived PD for the interaction between total retail sales and the geocomplexity pattern of tertiary-industry output averages 0.610 [0.336,0.783], indicating critical spatial variation in both local PD values and their significance, while the OPGD-derived PD yields a single global estimate of 0.537 (p < 0.01). This research advances theoretical understanding of spatial association and interaction, while providing an innovative analytical tool and decision-support capability for regional development, urban planning, and resource allocation."

 The western Himalayas in Pakistan, characterized by a diverse range of conifer species at higher elevations, represent a critical biodiversity hotspot and habitat for numerous species. Accurate spatial assessments of canopy height are essential for improving estimates of aboveground biomass, carbon sequestration, and associated forest ecosystem services in this region. In this study, we estimated canopy heights in the western Himalayas in Pakistan using a U-Net CNN approach, fusing data from the Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation Mission (GEDI) with multi-band Sentinel-2 (S2) imagery. We produced a canopy height map at a 10 m resolution for 2020. To ensure accurate measurements across various canopy height groups, we implemented a stratified training approach that optimized the representation of GEDI data throughout the training, validation, and testing phases. We trained multiple models using varying thresholds and assigned different weights to taller trees to improve accuracy between different canopy height groups in the study region. Our best model achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 7.52 m and a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 5.71 m in the test set, significantly outperforming existing global canopy height models in this topographically complex region. We further validate our predictions against field inventory plots, achieving a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.49 for plots containing at least 15 trees.

 The complementary measurements of model-based multibaseline (polarimetric) synthetic aperture radar interferometry ((Pol)InSAR) and data-driven SAR tomography (TomoSAR) have become the development trend of forest height mapping missions. Their common core is the characterization of forest vertical structure, which promotes the introduction of TomoSAR reconstructed vertical structure function into (Pol)InSAR forest height inversion model. However, to provide knowledge of vertical structure, TomoSAR measurements have to cover the entire forested area. The high data acquisition cost and multibaseline observation errors hinder its application in large-scale wall-to-wall forest height mapping. Therefore, based on machine learning, this study proposes a small-scale tomography-aided multibaseline (Pol)InSAR (STAMI) framework to derive vertical structure knowledge at low data burden and estimate forest height with high accuracy. The synergy inversion is reformulated as the cross-scale clustering and classification task of the vertical structure knowledge. We conduct TomoSAR only in a small-scale forested area, and establish the mapping relationship between interferometric features and vertical structure with spectral clustering and Support Vector Machine (SVM). In large-scale mapping area, we obtain vertical structure information with only three-baseline (Pol)InSAR, which is used to construct different forest height inversion models. Finally, a reweighted method is applied to resist observation errors to different vertical structures for improving accuracy of three-baseline inversion. Airborne L- and P-band single and fully polarimetric datasets covering boreal and tropical forests are used to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed framework. This research is valuable for data acquisition planning and algorithm application of multibaseline (Pol)InSAR missions aimed at global forest mapping."

 Groundwater-dependent ecosystems (GDEs) provide crucial ecological and hydrological stability but are increasingly threatened by groundwater-dependent invasive plants (GDIPs), particularly in regions with limited water resources. Although GDEs have been widely studied, long-term quantitative assessments of how invasive plants alter these ecosystems remain limited. Hence, this study evaluated the impacts of invasive plants within the GDEs of the Nuwejaars Catchment, South Africa, by monitoring their spatial and temporal dynamics and quantifying the extent to which they displace native plants. Landsat-8 imagery, a Random Forest classifier, and Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques were integrated to map and quantify the annual distribution of GDIPs over a 12-year period. XAI interpretability techniques including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), partial dependence plots (PDPs), and recursive feature elimination (RFECV) were applied to identify key environmental conditions influencing GDIP occurrence. Spatial-temporal analysis revealed that GDIPs expanded from 40.9 % (1060 ha) in 2013 to 63.9 % (1660 ha) in 2024, displacing large areas of native fynbos vegetation. Inter-annual change analysis showed accelerated GDIP growth following the extreme 2015–2018 drought, which reduced groundwater availability for native species with shallow roots. Elevation, slope, and moisture vegetation indices emerged as the most influential predictors for classification, with PDPs revealing that GDIPs favoured lower elevations and steep slopes. Classification accuracy improved over time, with F1-Scores and overall accuracies ranging between 68.4 % to 82.5 % from 2013 to 2024. Overall, these findings highlight the persistent spread of GDIPs and their potential to transform GDEs in semi-arid areas. This study demonstrates the value of integrating remote sensing and interpretable machine learning to support ecological monitoring and targeted invasive species management."

Using 31 million satellite image tiles, we detect nearly one million (996,074) clandestine gravesites over the land surfaces of Zhejiang, Fujian and Guangdong provinces, especially in forests and croplands. Further spatial attribution analysis suggests that the detected mass informal gravesites are closely related to gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, elevation, vegetation cover, climatic factors and the distances to rivers and coastlines. These findings and conclusions may provide meaningful references for gravesite occupied land use monitoring and management at regional to national scales."

 Accurate peanut seedling recognition is essential for quantifying emergence rates, a key phenotyping task in breeding programs for this important global oilseed. This task is challenged by field heterogeneity from morphological variation (genotype, growth stage, planting density) and imaging variability (flight altitude, solar angle). To address this, object-based image analysis (OBIA) and deep learning approaches were evaluated using UAV remote sensing imagery collected under systematically varied field conditions. An enhanced framework, P-YOLOv11s, was developed for UAV-based peanut seedling detection, incorporating a P2 layer for fine-scale features, an asymptotic feature pyramid network for multi-scale fusion, and an iEMA attention mechanism for occlusion robustness. The experimental design encompassed significant agronomic diversity (1025 genotypes, nitrogen regimes, planting years, densities, and eco-zones), developmental stages (three- to six-leaf), and flight configurations (15, 25, 40 m altitudes; four diurnal intervals). P-YOLOv11s demonstrated strong robustness, achieving a mean Average Precision (AP) of 93.5 %, with 62 % fewer false detections than OBIA and a 4.8 % higher AP than other YOLO variants. Flight altitude was the most influential factor, with 15 m yielding the best results. Peak accuracy (99.4 %) occurred at the four- to five-leaf stage, while solar angle had a minimal effect (<1.7 % variation). The framework achieved subplot-level precision (μ = 0.42 plants), addressing the challenge of accurate field-based phenotyping under real-world constraints."

 Industrial heat sources are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, environmental degradation, and energy transitions, yet systematic global monitoring has been hindered by fragmented and sector-specific datasets. Here, we present a deep learning framework applied to high-resolution satellite imagery to automatically classify six major categories of industrial facilities—cement plants, steel plants, chemical plants, oil and gas development platforms, coal chemical plants, and open-pit mines.

The results reveal distinct decadal trends: oil and gas platforms steadily increased, coal chemical plants declined markedly, cement plants and open-pit mines remained stable, while steel and chemical plants exhibited moderate growth. Correlation analysis further shows that economic development, population, and development stage strongly shape the spatial distribution of industrial activity. In addition, the dataset captures short-term disruptions, such as reduced activity during the COVID-19 pandemic.

 Efficient detection of anomalous artificial surfaces is vital after disasters to support rapid emergency response. This study proposes a novel, training-free texture index method to accurately identify damaged artificial surfaces using post-disaster imagery. The method was tested across diverse disaster sites, including earthquake-affected areas in Turkey (Sites A–C), and tsunami- and tornado-damaged regions in Palu and Joplin (Sites D–I), covering a range of surface types and building structures. Sites A–C were chosen to develop and assess the efficacy of the proposed texture index method. Primarily, the three-dimensional texture features (3DTF) comprised of Contrast, Gabor wavelets, and secondary texture extraction (Con_Gabor), were amalgamated with a K-means classifier to delineate post-disaster artificial surface areas without prior knowledge. Given the discernible texture discrepancies between normal and anomalous artificial surfaces post-disaster, Homogeneity and Entropy texture features derived from Worldview-3 images at each site were leveraged to construct the artificial surface anomaly index (ASAI) for automatically extracting anomalous artificial surfaces. The findings demonstrated high overall accuracies of detecting anomaly artificial surfaces, ranging from 90.07 % to 91.76 % in Sites A–C. Notably, the ASAI outperformed Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Random Forest (RF), and the U-Net model. The overall accuracy (OA) of the ASAI method is 10 %–20 % higher than that of the U-Net model, showing superior automatic performance without necessitating training samples. Furthermore, the effectiveness of ASAI was validated in the Palu and Joplin sites, affirming its utility across diverse disaster scenarios. The damages of steel-tiled houses, middle-level houses and roads were effectively identified as anomaly artificial surfaces. The overall accuracies of the ASAI for identifying anomaly artificial surfaces were 89.55 %–92.5 %. These findings indicate the identification anomaly artificial surface using the ASAI was robust in different types of anomaly artificial surface caused by different disaster. The method of using ASAI to automatically identify anomaly artificial surfaces in post-disaster and single-temporal images has the potential for wide applicability."

 Chongming Island of Shanghai, the largest estuarine alluvial island of China, has been kept seaward expanding due to continuous riverine sediment deposits and extensive land reclamation. Moreover, the island is highly vulnerable to long-term ground deformations and rising sea levels. To evaluate the influence of coastal ground deformation on flood risk, we investigated long-term ground deformation on Chongming Island over the last decade using RADARSAT-2 and Sentinel-1A satellite datasets collected from 2012 to 2023. The independently achieved ground deformation time series, representing the projection of ground displacement along the radar line of sight (LOS) direction (recovered using traditional multi-temporal interferometric SAR algorithms), were then jointly combined. The results show that the eastern region of Chongming Island has been experiencing significant ground subsidence over the last decade, with a maximum amplitude exceeding 20 mm/year. The significant ground subsidence in the eastern island occurred at a rate at least 2.5 times that of the concurrent sea level rise (SLR).Furthermore, we analyzed the coastal flood risk on Chongming Island under the comprehensive effects of local ground subsidence, SLR, and storm surges. To this aim, a hydrodynamic model was applied to simulate various inundation scenarios on Chongming Island after failures of different seawall sections. As the major outcome of our work, under the simulated scenario (e.g., the worst case), the total flood inundation area in 2042 was estimated to exceed 50% of the island. Under this worst scenario, almost all of the salt marsh vegetation in Chongming Dongtan Nature Reserve would be flooded after the relative SLR. The loss of elevation in the low-lying island further aggravates the coastal flooding risk. Therefore, preserving the stability of eastern and northern seawalls is essential to the security of Chongming Island in the context of the increasing flooding risk in the low-lying river estuary."

This study investigates phenological variability and monthly trends across Europe from 1982 to 2022 using the high-accuracy PKU GIMMS NDVI dataset, which offers improved temporal consistency and calibration. We present a novel framework integrating established analytical methods with a newly developed Phenology Variability Index (PVI), designed to assess phenological stability at climatic scales. The framework combines spatially explicit pixel-level analyses, including interdecadal NDVI statistics and PVI evaluations, with clustering methods to identify phenologically homogeneous regions, quantify their variability, and enable inter-cluster comparisons. Following preprocessing and quality control, monthly NDVI series were analysed using non-parametric statistical tests, K-means clustering, Land Surface Phenology (LSP) metrics, and monthly trend estimation. Five spatially coherent clusters were identified, displaying distinct seasonal signatures across ecological zones. Results reveal spatially heterogeneous trends, including consistent greening in temperate, montane, and Mediterranean regions, weaker seasonal greening in semi-arid areas, and largely stable winter NDVI in mountainous forests and continental areas. LSP metrics indicate shifts in the timing and duration of growing seasons, consistent with climate- and land use- driven phenological change. The PVI further highlights higher phenological stability in Mediterranean landscapes and semi-arid regions and greater variability in montane forests and temperate zones. This integrated approach enhances understanding of vegetation responses to environmental variability across scales and provides a robust methodological basis for long-term ecosystem monitoring, supporting both applied geoinformation analyses and broader ecological research."

The findings reveal that the “domain gap” between aerial and satellite data is a significant obstacle. While the model performed robustly on single-source data (peak signal-to-noise-ratio, or PSNR, of 27.28 dB), its cross-platform performance was substantially lower (best PSNR of 16.85 dB). Interestingly, models trained from scratch consistently outperformed fine-tuned models, suggesting negative transfer due to the differences between the aerial and satellite data sources. Furthermore, environmental metrics like the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) proved to be more effective performance indicators than standard computer vision metrics (such as PSNR) and structural similarity index measure (SSIM), showing better preservation of critical spectral information for vegetation analysis. This work demonstrates both the potential and the distinct challenges of using diffusion models for super-resolution across different remote sensing platforms. Our findings underscore the importance of tailored approaches in super-resolution and provide insights into leveraging state-of-the-art deep learning techniques for ecological monitoring and resource management."

 The fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FAPAR) is a critical parameter for measuring the vegetation photosynthetic capacity. The Hi-resolution Global LAnd Surface Satellite (Hi-GLASS) FAPAR product (version 1, V1) from Landsat imagery has been successfully applied to the ecosystem productivity modeling; however, this product algorithm still exhibits some limitations, including the poor adaptability to heterogeneous surfaces and limited physical interpretability, due to the absence of real-world knowledge guidance. To address these issues, we integrated deep transfer learning and radiative transfer models to update the Hi-GLASS FAPAR algorithm and generate the corresponding product (i.e., version 2, V2). A long short-term memory (LSTM) model was pre-trained on Soil-Leaf-Canopy (SLC) simulations and then optimized using physical knowledge-guided transfer learning, which was used to generate the new FAPAR product from Landsat image series. Validation results demonstrated that the Hi-GLASS FAPAR V2 (R2 = 0. 95, RMSE = 0.08) significantly outperformed V1 (R2 = 0.94, RMSE = 0.11), with notable improvements in various vegetation categories and sensors. The greatest improvement of FAPAR was found over multiple forest types, where different forest categories showed substantial gains, with R2 increasing by 2 % − 11 % and RMSE decreasing by 15 % − 55 %, confirming the improved adaptability of our proposed method to heterogeneous canopies. Moreover, the Hi-GLASS V2 product preserved better spatial details than MODIS、GLASS、GEOV2 products, and its temporal dynamics were more closely aligned with field measurements than the V1 product. These advancements highlight the potential of Hi-GLASS FAPAR V2 as valuable data for supporting terrestrial ecosystem studies."

Schroeder,Geographically weighted regression model-assisted (GWRMA) estimation to improve precision of estimates combining remote sensing and ground plot data,"•Incorporating spatial heterogeneity into model-assisted estimator improves precision. •Geographically Weighted Regression Model Assisted (GWRMA) estimator is proposed. •GWRMA precision gain over conventional model-assisted estimators can be substantial. •GWRMA advantage increases with larger sample size and greater spatial heterogeneity. •Typical model-assisted variance estimator severely underestimates GWRMA variance. 
 Remotely sensed data play a vital role providing auxiliary variables that can improve precision of sample-based estimates without incurring the substantial cost of increasing sample size. In the setting of design-based inference, model-assisted estimators using generalized regression models provide a practical option to exploit such auxiliary variables to obtain estimates with smaller uncertainties than the Horvitz-Thompson (HT) estimator. Spatial heterogeneity is one of the main characteristics of spatial geographical populations and spatial nonstationarity in regression model parameters can greatly impact model predictions. However, model-assisted estimators typically do not incorporate spatial heterogeneity in the assisting models, and this may result in failing to gain the full precision improvement available from model-assisted estimation. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) offers a practical way to incorporate spatial heterogeneity of the data into the model. In this study, we substantiate the benefit of employing a GWR model-assisted estimator (GWRMA) in which GWR is used as a linking model between the response and auxiliary variables. The illustrative example we use to demonstrate the precision enhancing capacity of GWRMA is estimating tree volume in forest inventory monitoring. The performance of GWRMA was compared with the HT estimator and a linear regression model-assisted (LRMA) estimator when both the response and auxiliary variables are continuous. Several factors potentially impacting the estimators and their precision were investigated using Monte-Carlo simulation applied to populations constructed to represent different levels of spatial heterogeneity and correlation between the response and auxiliary variables. Because both LRMA and GWRMA estimators are asymptotically unbiased, variance is the key criterion for comparing the estimators. For the constructed populations with spatial heterogeneity, the GWRMA estimator achieved standard errors smaller than the HT and LRMA estimators, and the improvement in precision increased with increasing sample size. The precision advantage of the GWRMA estimator relative to the LRMA estimator was attributable to the capacity of the GWRMA estimator to adapt to spatial variation in the regression model leading to better local prediction of the target variable. The conventional model-assisted variance estimator substantially underestimated the variance of the GWRMA estimator. An alternative variance estimator based on averaging the GWRMA and LRMA variance estimates avoided the severe underestimation of the conventional model-assisted variance estimator. This average variance estimator yielded confidence intervals that exceeded the nominal 90% coverage but still had shorter length than the 90 % confidence intervals from LRMA estimator. Further exploration of variance estimators for the GWRMA estimator is a necessary next step to improve utility of the GWRMA estimator."

 Semantic image synthesis (SIS) is essential for remote sensing, particularly in generating high-quality training data for scarce annotated datasets. While existing SIS methods have advanced pixel-wise mappings between semantic maps and images, they often overlook spatial priors, such as relationships between geographic objects (e.g., road-building adjacency), leading to structural inconsistencies in synthesized images. To address this, we propose the graph-prior diffusion transformer (GDiT) for semantically controllable remote sensing image synthesis. We first convert semantic maps into semantic graphs, encoding geographic objects as nodes with structured spatial interactions. To capture spatial and semantic relationships, we propose the Geometric-Semantic Aware Module (GSAM), which integrates CLIP-extracted semantics and geometric attributes for a more context-aware representation. Furthermore, we design the Graph Diffusion Transformer (GDiT) Block, which employs graph-to-image cross-attention to refine spatial structures, ensuring topological coherence and semantic fidelity in synthesized images. Experiments on the landcover and landuse dataset show that GDiT achieves competitive performance by incorporating text prompts to enable multilevel control across global, object and pixel dimensions, generating high-fidelity images while using only 38.9% of the parameters compared to GeoSynth, significantly improving efficiency and accuracy.

 Road extraction plays a crucial role in automatically identifying road networks from remote sensing images, which is essential for various applications. However, existing road extraction methods perform poorly when dealing with dense roads. Inspired by the act of ”weaving” in real life, this paper proposes a dense road extraction method named WeavingUnet, aimed at addressing the difficulties in effectively extracting dense roads using existing methods. This model explores a novel approach to road feature extraction by analyzing road features in various directions and simulating the geometric shapes of roads to more accurately perform dense road extraction. The model incorporates innovative components such as Snake Weaving Attention, Contextual Information Weaving Module, Global Information Extraction Module, and Multi-Scale Weaving Decoder, which collectively enhance the extraction of multi-level road information and optimize the road reconstruction process. The model is tested on the public datasets DeepGlobe and Massachusetts, achieving F1 scores of 82.73% and 72.52%, and IoUs of 71.44% and 61.01%, respectively. Compared with the latest SOTA models, the F1 scores increase by 1.53% and 1.22%, and the IoUs improve by 1.76% and 1.87%. This study also conducts a comprehensive analysis of dense road extraction and compared it with SOTA models. In the densest areas, the false negative rates (FNs) in the test images are reduced by 4.93‰ and 1.47‰, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of WeavingUnet in handling dense roads.

 A majorty of the low-lying coastal areas worldwide, where the population is densely concentrated, are confronted with high to extremetly high risks of land subsidence. However, a comprehensive detection and quantification of large-scale coastal subsidence patterns and their primary drivers in eastern China remain lacking. In this study, we employed Time Series Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (TS-InSAR) technique and Sentinel-1 data to derive the vertical deformation pattern at a resolution of 90 m from 2017 to 2024. We developed a novel multi-frame mosaicking method, achieving spatially consistent InSAR observations over the land-sea transition areas. Our findings uncover extensive coastal subsidence in northeastern Shandong and eastern Jiangsu, highlighting several rapid-subsidence funnels with rates exceeding 50 mm/yr for the first time. By integrating Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery, subsidence time series, groundwater level measurements, and principal component analysis (PCA), we further analyzed the spatiotemporal distribution patterns and underlying drivers of these heterogeneous subsidence funnels. Our analysis demonstrates that anthropogenic factors are the dominant drivers of coastal subsidence. Four representative case studies reveal distinct subsidence mechanisms: (1) brine extraction for salt production and aquaculture, (2) excessive freshwater withdrawal for agricultural irrigation and industrial use, (3) groundwater depletion for intensive greenhouse aquaculture, and (4) land reclamation for industrial infrastructure development. In each region, subsidence patterns are predominantly controlled by a single dominant factor. This study is expected to provide valuable insights for monitoring and managing coastal subsidence, enhance our understanding of associated risks, and offer critical guidance for protecting communities in vulnerable coastal areas."

 Cultural heritage is an integrated system that encompasses both heritage ontology and their surrounding environments. Traditional methods, such as field measurements, are often inefficient and fragmented in assessing the condition of cultural heritage. In recent years, remote sensing has emerged as a crucial tool for the systematic safeguarding and conservation of cultural heritage, thanks to its high spatiotemporal observation capabilities. Utilizing optical, radar, and laser sensors mounted on satellites, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles, and terrestrial platforms, remote sensing offers a comprehensive approach to ensure the sustainability of cultural heritage. This study addresses critical gaps in the emerging, interdisciplinary field of remote sensing for cultural heritage—including limited terrestrial platform coverage, underutilized AI paradigms, and insufficient policy integration—by conducting a systematic, state-of-the-art bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed papers from the Web of Science Core Collection (1900–2024). Based on this analysis, we summarized the applicable methods, sensor platforms, and applications of remote sensing in cultural heritage conservation and proposed a theoretical framework incorporating relevant methodologies and models. Our results indicate that the integration of multi-spatiotemporal data and diverse technologies is a key characteristic of the disciplinary development. In addition, to application-oriented methodologies, hazard-risk mapping and sustainability assessment of cultural heritage are identified as two potential future directions, which align with the progress assessment of Sustainable Development Goal Target 11.4 by harnessing economic, political and institutional drivers in concert. Leveraging artificial intelligence, data-driven knowledge mining, and multi-source coupling, remote sensing for cultural heritage is transitioning from heritage-specific sustainability through systematic monitoring and evaluation to a broader focus on regional sustainability where heritage sites are located."

 Surface observations are crucial for understanding atmospheric pollutant sources and variability. However, interpreting these observations, particularly when comparing them to chemical transport model (CTM) simulations, remains challenging. A key difficulty is the spatial mismatch between model resolutions and the point measurements from surface stations. To mitigate this issue, we developed a deep learning (DL)-based method to quantify systematic discrepancies between surface carbon monoxide (CO) observations and GEOS-Chem model simulations across China during 2015–2022. Our method generated daily correction factors for adjusting modeled CO concentrations. Validation demonstrated good consistency between the observed-to-modeled (Obs/GC) concentration ratios and the derived correction factors, with correlation coefficients (R) ranging from 0.85 to 0.93. Our analysis reveals broadly uniform negative correlations between correction factors and observed CO concentrations across eastern China, suggesting that systematic discrepancies decrease with increasing local emissions. In contrast, positive correlations prevail in western China. Furthermore, significant temporal variability in systematic discrepancies was identified at seasonal scales, emphasizing the need for time-dependent dynamic corrections. Applying the DL-based correction approach to GEOS-Chem-simulated surface CO concentrations for 2015–2022 led to a significant improvement in model-observation agreement: R values increased from 0.30–0.43 to 0.63–0.70 (spatial consistency) and from 0.15–0.49 to 0.62–0.81 (temporal consistency). This work provides a novel data-driven approach for correcting systematic discrepancies in model/observation comparisons, which is important for more accurate interpretation of surface observations."

 Particulate matter (PM) significantly impacts urban air quality and public health, making the quantification of its source contributions crucial for effective air quality management. In this work, we investigate the origins of organic aerosol (OA) and elemental carbon (EC) in an urban environment by synthesizing results from in situ observational analyses (receptor modeling) and chemical transport modeling. This study focused on the city of Barcelona, Spain, during a summer and a winter period in 2019, using measurement data from an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM), an Aethalometer, and analyses of filter samples along with source-resolved predictions from the chemical transport model (CTM) PMCAMx. Results refer to PM1 (PM finer than 1 μm). Oxygenated OA (OOA) was the dominant source of OA during both periods with contributions ranging from 63 % of PM1 OA in winter to 80 % in summer. During summer, most of it originated from sources outside Barcelona such as wildfires, biogenic sources, as well as sources outside Europe. PMCAMx significantly underpredicted OOA during wintertime, suggesting that the model is lacking both processes that produce secondary OA (SOA) during periods of low photochemical activity and the corresponding emissions of organic pollutants. Biomass burning OA (BBOA) emitted far away from the city and its conversion to SOA either due to nighttime or aqueous chemistry could explain part of the missing OOA. Hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA) ranged from 8 to 14 % of the OA in both periods, peaking during morning and evening rush hours. The primary OA (POA) emissions from transportation during winter may be underestimated in the emission inventory. Cooking OA (COA) was also a significant source (11 % of total PM1 OA) and it needs to be added to the current European emission inventories. Fresh BBOA was a small component of OA during summer and higher during winter. The PM1 EC levels were found to be dominated by local sources during both seasons. Among these sources, fossil fuel combustion was the most important contributor, accounting for approximately 74 % of the total EC. This highlights the strong influence of traffic and other fossil fuel-related activities on EC concentrations in Barcelona, regardless of season.This study demonstrates the value of integrating observational data (and receptor modelling) with chemical transport modeling to more accurately identify the sources of carbonaceous PM in urban environments. Such combined approaches are essential for developing effective mitigation strategies tailored to seasonal and local emission patterns, ultimately supporting improved air quality management."

 Since the Industrial Revolution, human activities have significantly increased atmospheric black carbon (BC) aerosols, harming air quality, human health, and regional climate. Although the research on the characteristics and sources of atmospheric BC has expanded, understanding of its cross-sea transport remain limited. Zhanjiang city, located on the coast of the northern South China Sea, experiences pronounced monsoon influences and has heavy industries. However, this region maintains good air quality. We hypothesize that monsoon circulation may significantly influence BC pollution. To verify this hypothesis, aerosol samples were continuously collected in Zhanjiang from 2018 to 2019. Results showed clearly seasonal variations in BC concentration and its carbon isotopic values, indicating they are not primarily influenced by local emission sources, as local emissions remain relatively constant. Instead, lower values in summer and higher values in other seasons align closely with monsoon transitions, suggesting that a significant role of monsoon circulation in driving these variations. Backward trajectory model (HYSPLIT) and the potential source contribution factor analysis model (PSCF) further revealed distinctly different air mass pathways between summer (ocean air masses) and other seasons (terrestrial air masses). A Bayesian mixing model indicated that the combustion of fossil fuels (58 %, including 30 % of liquid fuel and 28 % of coal) is the predominant source of BC entering Zhanjiang with air masses. Correlation analyses with water-soluble inorganic ions revealed that BC exhibited significantly weaker associations with terrestrial pollution compared to TC, due to substantial contributions from secondary aerosols to TC during long-range transport. This study suggested that monsoon-driven circulation plays a critical role in aerosol transport and composition in the coastal region, providing new insights into atmosphere–ocean carbon exchange."

 Wildfire smoke is an increasingly important contributor to urban air pollution and public health risk, especially in ozone (O3) non-attainment areas like Chicago. This study assessed the impact of the 2023 wildfire smoke on ground-level O3 concentrations and associated mortality across Chicago's 77 community areas. We integrated NOAA's Hazard Mapping System smoke classifications, high-resolution downscaled O3 data, and GridMET meteorological data to construct a daily community-level dataset for 2014–2023. We estimated counterfactual O3 levels in the absence of wildfire smoke using matching, linear regression, and machine learning models. We separated the effect of smoke on O3 from those caused by meteorological variability. O3 concentrations increased with smoke density, peaking under medium smoke conditions, while the largest smoke-attributable increase (6.7 ppb) occurred under heavy smoke. Estimated daily all-cause mortality rates attributable to smoke-enhanced O3 followed a similar trend, reaching 0.24 deaths per 100,000 population per day under heavy smoke. Spatial analysis revealed that central, western, and southeastern communities experienced the greatest exposure and health burden, suggesting non-linear interactions between transported smoke and local pollution. These findings highlight how wildfire smoke exacerbates challenges in meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards and protecting public health in urban environments."

 This study examines the separate roles of emissions and climate on the future evolution of high European ozone events in atmosphere-only simulations of UKESM1 (United Kingdom Earth System Model version 1). These include the historical simulation (ending in 2014), the reference scenario ssp370SST (2014–2099) – with steady increases in near-surface temperature, global population and atmospheric methane concentrations – and several variations thereof. For this purpose, we have identified local ozone extremes, connected them into large episodes (spatiotemporal aggregates with a minimum duration of three days) and calculated the episode sizes as the accumulated areal extents during their life cycles. Despite decreases in precursor emissions over most of Europe under ssp370SST, the number of local extremes and the sizes of ozone episodes would increase across the continent throughout the 21st century because of soaring methane levels. The southeast of Europe and Turkey could experience even larger increases due to rising regional emissions. Mitigation strategies targeting emissions of regional precursors, global methane and, more importantly, the combination of both would effectively decrease ozone pollution below present-day values. On the other hand, climate warming enhances biogenic emissions, reduces dry deposition fluxes and increases atmospheric humidity. Overall, this leads to moderate increases in the occurrence of local ozone extremes, but with some remarkable regional differences and a negligible impact on the sizes of ozone episodes when averaged over the whole continent. Moreover, as future ozone episodes become more common under ssp370SST, the associated circulation anomalies are expected to weaken in the future."

 Abrupt or intermittent emissions can significantly increase regional pollutants and dominate short-term variations, but previous simulations usually treated emissions through total amounts and allocation coefficients, making it difficult to effectively characterize their concentration variation features at the minute-scale. This study proposes a rapid simulation framework for minute-scale high-resolution emission modeling under such scenarios. Integrating multisource background emissions, it assessed Hefei Airport impacts (December 2023). Evaluations confirm accurate simulation of meteorological/air pollutant spatial distributions and effective capture of minute-scale emission characteristics.

MIROC4-ACTM and ATom profiles show mean differences of −0.1 ± 0.48 and 0.01 ± 0.3 ppm over land and ocean, respectively (p < 0.05), and those are −0.34 ± 1.07 and −0.2 ± 0.51 ppm for OCO-2 XCO2 sampled at ATom profile locations. Height-wise analysis shows that CO2 differences are concentrated in the lower troposphere (0–2 km), where model simulation are strongly influenced by surface fluxes. In Amazon, MIROC4-ACTM inversion does not have CO2 observation sites and limited vertical coverage of aircraft profiles right above the forest canopy (∼0.15 km) to 4.4 km, leading to poor ACTM–OCO-2 (−0.88 ± 1.02 ppm) and ACTM-aircraft (−0.105 ± 2.58 ppm) agreements mainly due to lower troposphere. Over the airports in Asian megacities (i.e., emission hotspots), the model shows a higher difference with CONTRAIL (−1.06 ± 0.58 ppm) than OCO-2 (−0.15 ± 0.53 ppm). The larger ACTM–CONTRAIL difference reflects ACTM's coarse resolution (approx. 2.8° × 2.8°), which limits its ability to resolve smaller scale urban fossil fuel emissions, while the smaller ACTM–OCO-2 difference likely also results from OCO-2's limited sensitivity below the boundary layer."

 Ozone (O3) pollution poses a critical air quality challenge in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), particularly under typhoon peripheral circulation. However, the vertical processes governing O3 persistence remain poorly understood. This study investigates a persistent O3 pollution episode in July 2023 using the WRF-Chem model, data assimilation, and the GBA O3 Lidar Network. Results reveal pronounced city-specific differences in O3 persistence mechanisms. In Macao, extended O3 exceedance was driven by persistent typhoon-induced subsidence, suppressed boundary-layer mixing, and convergence of transported O3-rich air masses, forming a regional O3 pool. Conversely, Shenzhen experienced rapid O3 dissipation due to the inflow of cleaner maritime masses. Lidar observations captured distinct O3 stratification within boundary layer under the influence of typhoon subsidence. These findings elucidate city-specific O3 responses under complex meteorological conditions, providing robust scientific guidance for tailored air quality strategies in coastal megacity clusters."
