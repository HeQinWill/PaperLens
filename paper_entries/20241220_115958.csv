10.5194/acp-24-14123-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了利用化学传输模型量化东南大西洋地区海洋气溶胶的影响，重点关注气溶胶-云相互作用。研究区域以持续存在的层积云为特征，其气溶胶辐射强迫的不确定性很高。该研究使用GEOS-Chem模型分析了海洋气溶胶源的季节性变化作用，并利用地面观测和飞机观测数据（如LASIC、ORACLES和CLARIFY）对模拟结果进行了评估。结果表明，在云层高度，生物质燃烧季节有机气溶胶占主导地位，而海洋排放驱动的硫酸盐气溶胶在初级生产高峰期占主导地位。模型低估了气溶胶光学厚度（AOD），尤其是在偏远地区。研究还发现，改进DMS排放和氧化化学反应可能增加由海洋来源产生的硫酸盐气溶胶，海洋一次有机气溶胶排放量也可能显著增加总有机气溶胶浓度。该研究强调了改进海洋排放及其化学转化过程的必要性，因为海洋来源的气溶胶是云层高度总气溶胶的主要组成部分，并可能影响东南大西洋地区气溶胶辐射强迫的不确定性。 这与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它涉及气溶胶成分分析、卫星观测（通过与AERONET等地面观测和飞机观测数据的比较来验证模型）、以及空气质量监测（评估气溶胶对气候和环境的影响）。,"['aerosol', 'cloud', 'marine aerosol', 'sulfate aerosol', 'organic aerosol', 'dimethylsulfide (DMS)', 'aerosol optical depth (AOD)', 'satellite observations', 'air quality monitoring', 'chemical transport model', 'climate prediction', 'aerosol radiative forcing']",Mashiat Hossain;Rebecca M. Garland;Hannah M. Horowitz,Quantifying the impacts of marine aerosols over the southeast Atlantic Ocean using a chemical transport model: implications for aerosol–cloud interactions,"Our research examines aerosol dynamics over the southeast Atlantic, a region with significant uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcings. Using the GEOS-Chem model, we find that at cloud altitudes, organic aerosols dominate during the biomass burning season, while sulfate aerosols, driven by marine emissions, prevail during peak primary production. These findings highlight the need for accurate representation of marine aerosols in models to improve climate predictions and reduce uncertainties. 
 The southeast Atlantic region, characterized by persistent stratocumulus clouds, has one of the highest uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing and significant variability across climate models. In this study, we analyze the seasonally varying role of marine aerosol sources and identify key uncertainties in aerosol composition at cloud-relevant altitudes over the southeast Atlantic using the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model. We evaluate simulated aerosol optical depth (AOD) and speciated aerosol concentrations against those collected from ground observations and aircraft campaigns such as LASIC, ORACLES, and CLARIFY, conducted during 2017. The model consistently underestimates AOD relative to AERONET, particularly at remote locations like Ascension Island. However, when compared with aerosol mass concentrations from aircraft campaigns during the biomass burning period, it performs adequately at cloud-relevant altitudes, with a normalized mean bias (NMB) between −3.5 % (CLARIFY) and −7.5 % (ORACLES). At these altitudes, in the model, organic aerosols (63 %) dominate during the biomass burning period, while sulfate (41 %) prevails during austral summer, when dimethylsulfide (DMS) emissions peak in the model. Our findings indicate that marine sulfate can account for up to 69 % of total sulfate during the high-DMS period. Sensitivity analyses indicate that refining DMS emissions and oxidation chemistry may increase sulfate aerosol produced from marine sources, highlighting that there remains large uncertainty as to the role of DMS emissions in the marine boundary layer. Additionally, we find marine primary organic aerosol emissions may substantially increase total organic aerosol concentrations, particularly during austral summer. This study underscores the imperative need to refine marine emissions and their chemical transformations, as aerosols from marine sources are a major component of total aerosols at cloud-relevant altitudes and may impact uncertainties in aerosol radiative forcing over the southeast Atlantic."
10.5194/acp-24-14177-2024,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了丙酮光化学反应中二次有机气溶胶（SOAs）的非均相形成和光吸收特性，尤其关注了氨气富集条件下不同成核物（硫酸铵、硫酸氢铵和硫酸钠）的影响。研究发现，丙酮生成的SOA产量显著高于甲基乙二醛，并且在存在预先存在的成核物，特别是含盐矿物颗粒的情况下，其产量会大幅提高。这主要是因为有机酸、醇和羰基等物质溶解到成核物的液相中，并在酸性气溶胶上发生酯化和/或低聚反应，形成更大的分子。此外，在硫酸铵气溶胶上形成的丙酮衍生SOA的光吸收能力强于在硫酸钠矿物颗粒上形成的，尤其是在氨气存在的情况下，这归因于含氮有机物的形成。研究结果表明，仅考虑甲基乙二醛作为丙酮衍生SOA的前体可能会低估丙酮在全球SOA生成中的作用。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它直接研究了影响空气质量的关键组分——二次有机气溶胶的形成机制、光学特性及其与大气成分（氨气、各种气溶胶）之间的相互作用，这些信息可用于改进大气成分分析模型和卫星观测数据的反演，从而提高空气质量监测的精度。,"['Secondary Organic Aerosols (SOAs)', 'Acetone photooxidation', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition', 'Satellite observations', 'Aerosol light absorption', 'Multiphase chemistry']",Si Zhang;Yining Gao;Xinbei Xu;Luyao Chen;Can Wu;Zheng Li;Rongjie Li;Binyu Xiao;Xiaodi Liu;Rui Li;Fan Zhang;Gehui Wang,Heterogeneous formation and light absorption of secondary organic aerosols from acetone photochemical reactions: remarkably enhancing effects of seeds and ammonia,"Secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) from acetone photooxidation in the presence of various seeds were studied to illustrate SOA formation kinetics under ammonia-rich conditions. The oxidation mechanism of acetone was investigated using an observation-based model incorporating a Master Chemical Mechanism model. A higher SOA yield of acetone was observed compared to methylglyoxal due to an enhanced uptake of the small photooxidation products of acetone. 
 Secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) from highly volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are currently not well represented in numerical models as their heterogeneous formation mechanisms in the atmosphere remain unclear. Based on the smog chamber experiments, here we investigated the yield and formation pathway of SOA from acetone photochemical reactions under low-NOx conditions in the presence of preexisting haze particles ((NH4)2SO4 and NH4HSO4) and saline mineral particles (Na2SO4) under ammonia-rich conditions. Our results showed that the yield of acetone-derived SOA is remarkably enhanced via multiphase reactions in the presence of these preexisting seeds, especially for the saline mineral particles. We found that aerosol acidity is a key factor controlling the formation pathways of acetone-derived SOA, in which organic acids, alcohol, and carbonyls produced from acetone photochemical reactions dissolve into the aqueous phase of the preexisting seeds and subsequently esterify and/or oligomerize into SOAs that consist of larger molecules on the acidic aerosols but smaller molecules on the neutral mineral aerosols. Moreover, the light absorption ability of the acetone-derived SOA formed on (NH4)2SO4 aerosols is stronger than that formed on Na2SO4 mineral particles, especially in the presence of ammonia, due to a formation of N-containing organics. Through comparison with that from methylglyoxal (MGly), we found that the total SOA from acetone in the chamber is 2.8–8.2 times that from the irreversible uptake of MGly, suggesting that only considering MGly as the precursor of acetone-derived SOA will probably underestimate the role of acetone in global SOA production since acetone abundantly exists in the troposphere."

We focused on the model's ability to simulate mid-level clouds in summer and winter. By combining observational data from two different field campaigns, we show that an increase in the horizontal resolution and a more advanced cloud microphysics scheme is strongly beneficial for cloud representation. 
 The rise in computational power in recent years has enabled research and national weather services to conduct high-resolution simulations down to the kilometric (Δx=𝒪(1 km)) and even to hectometric (Δx=𝒪(100 m)) scales for both weather and climate applications. We investigate with the state-of-the-art numerical weather prediction model ICON how mid-level clouds are represented on a mesh size of 1 km and 65 m, respectively, and for two bulk microphysics schemes, namely one-moment and two-moment cloud microphysics. For this analysis, we leverage the abundant observational data from two independent field campaigns in Switzerland (CLOUDLAB; hilly terrain) and Austria (CROSSINN; complex terrain). With four case studies, we show that while the temperature fields around the campaign sites are well represented in both mesh sizes, the 65 m resolution simulates a more realistic vertical velocity structure that is beneficial for cloud formation. Therefore, the largest differences for the representation of clouds lie in the two mesh sizes. The 1 km simulation in hilly terrain does not capture the observed clouds in both cloud microphysics schemes. Here, the higher resolution of the vertical velocities in the 65 m proves to be crucial for representing the investigated cloud types, and the two-moment microphysics scheme in general performs better with respect to the cloud characteristics because it considers variations in cloud droplet and ice crystal number concentrations. In complex terrain, the differences between the mesh sizes and the cloud microphysics schemes are surprisingly small, but the 65 m simulations with two-moment cloud microphysics show the most realistic cloud representation."
10.5194/amt-17-7109-2024,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文介绍了一种名为IceDetectNet的新型旋转目标检测算法，用于对聚集冰晶的各个组成部分进行多标签分类。该算法利用来自北极地区的全息相机拍摄的冰晶图像进行训练，能够识别冰晶的基本形状和物理过程，例如降水、聚集和冰水含量。其准确率超过92%，能够更详细地了解聚集冰晶的组成，从而改进对微物理特性（例如，凇附速率、聚集速率和冰水含量）的估计。这些信息对于改进云光学特性和降水形成的模拟至关重要，最终有助于提高降水预报和气候预测的准确性。研究中使用了全息成像技术进行遥感观测，这是一种大气环境遥感技术。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。,"['ice crystals', 'cloud properties', 'precipitation', 'holographic camera', 'remote sensing', 'climate modeling', 'atmospheric composition', 'ice water content', 'riming rate', 'aggregation rate']",Huiying Zhang;Xia Li;Fabiola Ramelli;Robert O. David;Julie Pasquier;Jan Henneberger,IceDetectNet: a rotated object detection algorithm for classifying components of aggregated ice crystals with a multi-label classification scheme,"Our innovative IceDetectNet algorithm classifies each part of aggregated ice crystals, considering both their basic shape and physical processes. Trained on ice crystal images from the Arctic taken by a holographic camera, it correctly classifies over 92 % of the ice crystals. These more detailed insights into the components of aggregated ice crystals have the potential to improve our estimates of microphysical properties such as riming rate, aggregation rate, and ice water content. 
 The shape of ice crystals affects their radiative properties, growth rate, fall speed, and collision efficiency; thus, it plays a significant role in cloud optical properties and precipitation formation. Ambient conditions, like temperature and humidity, determine the basic habit of ice crystals, while microphysical processes, such as riming and aggregation, further shape them, resulting in a diverse set of ice crystal shapes and effective densities. Current classification algorithms face two major challenges: (1) ice crystals are often classified as a whole (at the image scale), necessitating identification of the dominant component of aggregated ice crystals, and (2) single-label classifications lead to information loss because of the compromise between basic habit and microphysical process information. To address these limitations, we present a two-pronged solution here: (1) a rotated object detection algorithm (IceDetectNet) that classifies each component of an aggregated ice crystal individually and (2) a multi-label classification scheme that considers both basic habits and physical processes simultaneously. IceDetectNet was trained and tested on two independent datasets obtained by a holographic imager during the NASCENT campaign in Ny-Ålesund, Svalbard, in November 2019 and April 2020. The algorithm correctly classified 92 % of the ice crystals as either aggregate or non-aggregate and achieved an overall accuracy of 86 % for basic habits and 82 % for microphysical process classification. At the component scale, IceDetectNet demonstrated high detection and classification accuracy across all sizes, indicating its ability to effectively classify individual components of aggregated ice crystals. Furthermore, the algorithm demonstrated a good generalization ability by classifying ice crystals from an independent generalization dataset with overall accuracies above 70 %. IceDetectNet can provide a deeper understanding of ice crystal shapes, leading to better estimates of ice crystal mass, fall velocity, and radiative properties; therefore, it has the potential to improve precipitation forecasts and climate projections."

Wein;Lars E. Kalnajs;Darin W. Toohey,An economical tunable diode laser spectrometer for fast-response measurements of water vapor in the atmospheric boundary layer,"We describe a low-cost and small research-grade spectrometer for measurements of water vapor in the boundary layer. The instrument uses small Arduino microcontrollers and inexpensive laser diodes to reduce cost while maintaining high performance comparable to more expensive instruments. Performance was assessed with intercomparisons between commercially available instruments outdoors. The design's simplicity, performance, and price point allow it to be accessible to a variety of users. 
 Water vapor in the atmospheric boundary layer poses a significant measurement challenge, with abundances varying by an order of magnitude over short spatial and temporal scales. Herein, we describe the design and characterization of an economical and flexible open-path, fast-response instrument for measurements of water vapor. The in situ method of tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy in the shortwave infrared was chosen based on a heritage with previous instruments developed in our laboratory and flown on research aircraft. The instrument is constructed from readily available components and based on low-cost distributed feedback laser diodes that enjoy widespread use for high-speed fiber-optic telecommunications. A pair of versatile, high-speed Advanced RISC Machine-based microcontrollers drive the laser and acquire and store data. High precision and reproducibility are obtained by tight temperature regulation of the laser with a miniature commercial proportional-integral controller. The instrument is powered by two rechargeable 3.6 V lithium-ion batteries, consumes 2 W of power, weighs under 1 kg, and is constructed from hardware costing less than USD 3000. The new tunable diode laser spectrometer (TDLS) agreed to within 2 % compared to a laboratory standard and displayed a precision of 10 ppm at a sample rate of 10 Hz. The new instrument is robust and simple to use, allowing users with little previous experience in laser spectroscopy to acquire high-quality, fast-response observations of water vapor for a variety of applications. These include frequent horizontal and vertical profiling by uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs); long-term eddy covariance measurements from fixed and portable flux towers; and routine measurements of humidity from weather stations in remote locations such as the polar ice caps, mountains, and glaciers."

It is publicly available for further research. 
 Permafrost landscapes in the Arctic are highly vulnerable to warming, with rapid changes underway. High-resolution remote sensing, especially aerial datasets, offers valuable insights into current permafrost characteristics and thaw dynamics. Here, we present a new dataset of very high resolution orthomosaics, point clouds, and digital surface models that we acquired over permafrost landscapes in northwestern Canada and northern and northwestern Alaska for the purpose of better understanding the impacts of climate change on permafrost landscapes. The imagery was collected with the Modular Aerial Camera System (MACS) during aerial campaigns conducted by the Alfred Wegener Institute in the summers of 2018, 2019, and 2021. The MACS was specifically developed by the German Aerospace Center (DLR) for operation under challenging light conditions in polar environments. It features cameras in the optical and the near-infrared wavelengths with up to a 16 MP resolution. We processed the images to four-band (blue–green–red–near-infrared) orthomosaics and digital surface models with spatial resolutions of 7 to 20 cm as well as 3D point clouds with point densities of up to 41 points m−2. The dataset collection features 102 subprojects from 35 target regions (1.4–161.1 km2 in size). Project sizes range from 4.8 to 336 GB. In total, 3.17 TB were published. The horizontal precision of the datasets is in the range of 1–2 px and vertical precision is better than 0.10 m. The datasets are not radiometrically calibrated. Overall, these very high resolution images and point clouds provide significant opportunities for mapping permafrost landforms and generating detailed training datasets for machine learning, can serve as a baseline for change detection for thermokarst and thermo-erosion processes, and help with upscaling of field measurements to lower-resolution satellite observations. The dataset is available on the PANGAEA repository at https://doi.org/10.1594/PANGAEA.961577 (Rettelbach et al., 2024)."

By sampling both open ocean and island areas, these data can show how plankton size, diversity and abundance change with different environments. We also highlight the usefulness of high-speed plankton sampling when it is not possible to slow the boat during sailing, and its value in extending sampling coverage and frequency. 
 This paper presents the quantitative imaging datasets collected during the Tara Pacific Expedition (2016–2018) on the schooner Tara. The datasets cover a wide range of plankton sizes, from micro-phytoplankton > 20 μm to meso-zooplankton of a few cm, as well as non-living particles such as plastic and detrital particles. It consists of surface samples collected across the North and South Pacific Ocean from open ocean stations (a total of 357 samples) and from stations located in coastal waters, lagoons or reefs of 32 Pacific islands (a total of 228 samples). As this expedition involved long distances and long sailing times, we designed two sampling systems to collect plankton while sailing at speeds up to 9 knots. To sample microplankton, surface water was pumped onboard using a customised pumping system and filtered through a 20 µm mesh size plankton net (here after Deck-Net (DN). A High Speed Net (HSN; 330 μm mesh size) was developed to sample the mesoplankton. In addition, a Manta net (330 µm) was also used when possible, to collect mesoplankton and plastics simultaneously. We could not deploy these nets in reef and lagoon stations of islands. Instead, two Bongo nets (20 µm) attached to an underwater scooter were used to sample microplankton. Microplankton (20–200 μm) from the DN and Bongo nets was imaged directly on-board Tara using the FlowCam (Fluid imaging, Inc.) while the mesoplankton (> 200 μm) from the HSN and Manta nets was analyzed in the laboratory with the ZooScan system. Organisms and other particles were taxonomically and morphologically classified using the web application EcoTaxa automatic sorting tools, followed by taxonomic expert validation or correction. More than 300 different taxonomic and morphological groups were identified. The datasets include the metadata with the raw data from which morphological traits such as size (ESD) and biovolume have been calculated for each particle, as well as a number of quantitative descriptors of the surface plankton communities. These include abundance, biovolumes, Shannon diversity index and normalised biovolume size spectra, allowing the study of their structures (e.g. taxonomic, functional, size structure, trophic structure, etc.) according to a wide range of environmental parameters at the basin scale. In addition to describing and presenting the datasets, the complementary aim of this paper is to investigate and quantify the potential sampling biases associated with the two high speed sampling systems and the different net types, in order to improve further ecological interpretations."

The correction can then be extended backwards and forwards in time for periods when better-quality maps are not available. The method is fast and gives good results. It is then applied to obtain a climatology of the snow cover in Switzerland over the past 60 years at a resolution of 1 d and 1 km. This is the first time that such a dataset has been produced. 
 Snow plays a crucial role in regional climate systems worldwide. It is a key variable in the context of climate change because of its direct feedback to the climate system, while at the same time being very sensitive to climate change. Long-term spatial data on snow cover and snow water equivalent are scarce, due to the lack of satellite data or forcing data to run land surface models back in time. This study presents an R package, SnowQM, designed to correct for the bias in long-term spatial snow water equivalent data compared to a shorter-term and more accurate dataset, using the more accurate data to calibrate the correction. The bias-correction is based on the widely applied quantile mapping approach. A new method of spatial and temporal grouping of the data points is used to calculate the quantile distributions for each pixel. The main functions of the package are written in C++ to achieve high performance. Parallel computing is implemented in the C++ part of the code. In a case study over Switzerland, where a 60-year snow water equivalent climatology is produced at a resolution of 1 d and 1 km, SnowQM reduces the bias in snow water equivalent from −9 to −2 mm in winter and from −41 to −2 mm in spring. We show that the C++ implementation notably outperforms simple R implementation. The limitations of the quantile mapping approach for snow, such as snow creation, are discussed. The proposed spatial data grouping improves the correction in homogeneous terrain, which opens the way for further use with other variables."

Based on the HDF5 compression filter architecture, enstools-compression is easily used in Python scripts or via command line, enhancing its accessibility for the scientific community. A series of examples, drawn from current atmospheric science research, shows how lossy compression can efficiently manage large meteorological datasets while maintaining a balance between reducing data size and preserving scientific accuracy.

 Organic matter (OM) composition plays a central role in microbial respiration of dissolved organic matter and subsequent biogeochemical reactions. Here, a direct connection of organic matter chemistry and thermodynamics to reactive transport simulators has been achieved through the newly developed Lambda-PFLOTRAN workflow tool that succinctly incorporates carbon chemistry data generated from Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FTICR-MS) into reaction networks to simulate organic matter degradation and the resulting biogeochemistry. Lambda-PFLOTRAN is a Python-based workflow, executed through a Jupyter notebook interface, that digests raw FTICR-MS data, develops a representative reaction network based on substrate-explicit thermodynamic modeling (also termed lambda modeling due to its key thermodynamic parameter λ used therein), and completes a biogeochemical simulation with the open source, reactive flow and transport code PFLOTRAN. The workflow consists of the following five steps: configuration, thermodynamic (lambda) analysis, sensitivity analysis, parameter estimation, and simulation output and visualization. Two test cases are provided to demonstrate the functionality of the Lambda-PFLOTRAN workflow. The first test case uses laboratory incubation data of temporal oxygen depletion to fit lambda parameters (i.e., maximum utilization rate and microbial carrying capacity).

The configuration is validated for the period 2000–2020 and improves significant errors in a low-resolution model. Oceanic properties are well represented. Patterns of freshwater associated with the Amazon River are well captured, and the mean flows of ocean waters across multiple passages in the Caribbean Sea agree with observations. 
 A new Community Earth System Model/Modular Ocean Model 6 (CESM/MOM6) ocean-only regional 1/12° configuration of the Caribbean Sea is presented and validated. The model configuration was developed as a response to the rising need for high-resolution models for climate impact applications. The configuration is validated for the period covering 2000–2020 against ocean reanalysis and a suite of observation-based datasets. Particular emphasis is paid to the configuration's ability to represent the dynamical regime and properties of the region across sub-seasonal, seasonal, and inter-annual timescales. Near-surface fields of temperature, salinity, and sea surface height are well represented. In particular, the seasonal cycle of sea surface salinity and the spatial pattern of the low salinity associated with the Amazon and Orinoco river plumes is well captured. Surface speeds compare favorably against reanalysis and show that the mean flows within the Caribbean Sea (CS) are well represented. The model reproduces known pathways and timing for river plume waters intruding the region. The seasonal cycle of the mixed-layer depth is also well represented, with biases of <3 m when comparing to ocean reanalysis. The vertical structure and stratification across the water column is represented favorably against ship-based observations, with the largest simulated biases in the near-surface water mass and the sub-surface salinity maximum associated with the sub-tropical underwater mass. The temperature and salinity variability in the vertical structure is well represented in the model solution. We show that mean ocean mass transport across the multiple passages in the eastern Caribbean Sea compares favorably to observation-based estimates, but the model exhibits smaller variability and underestimates the mean Yucatán Channel transport when compared to observations and ocean reanalysis estimates. Furthermore, a brief comparison against a 1° CESM global ocean configuration shows that the higher-resolution regional model better represents the extent and seasonality of the Amazon River plume and hence better represents near-surface salinity and mixed-layer depth in the CS. Overall, the regional model reproduces the processes within the Caribbean Sea to a good degree and opens the possibility of regional ocean climate studies in support of decision-making within CESM."

It uniquely considers snow grain shape flexibly, based on recent insights showing that snow does not behave as a collection of ice spheres but instead as a random medium. TARTES is user-friendly yet performs comparably to more complex models. 
 The Two-streAm Radiative TransfEr in Snow (TARTES) model computes the spectral albedo and the profiles of spectral absorption, irradiance, and actinic fluxes for a multi-layer plane-parallel snowpack. Each snow layer is characterized by its specific surface area, density, and impurity content, in addition to shape parameters. In the landscape of snow optical numerical models, TARTES distinguishes itself by taking into account different shapes of the particles through two shape parameters, namely the absorption enhancement parameter B and the asymmetry factor g. This is of primary importance as recent studies working at the microstructure level have demonstrated that snow does not behave as a collection of equivalent ice spheres, a representation widely used in other models. Instead, B and g take specific values that do not correspond to any simple geometrical shape, which leads to the concept of the “optical shape of snow”. Apart from this specificity, TARTES combines well-established radiative transfer principles to compute the scattering and absorption coefficients of pure or polluted snow, as well as the δ-Eddington two-stream approximation to solve the multi-layer radiative transfer equation. The model is implemented in Python, but conducting TARTES simulations is also possible without any programming through the SnowTARTES web application, making it very accessible to non-experts and for teaching purposes. Here, after describing the theoretical and technical details of the model, we illustrate its main capabilities and present some comparisons with other common snow radiative transfer models (AART, DISORT-Mie, SNICAR-ADv3) as a validation procedure. Overall the agreement on the spectral albedo, when in compatible conditions (i.e., with spheres), is usually within 0.02 and is better in the visible and near-infrared range compared to longer wavelengths."

We coupled a recently validated boundary layer model with a building effect model within an NWP. Validation has been performed under idealized atmospheric conditions by benchmarking the coupled model with a fine-scale numerical model. Subsequently, the improvements and limitations are investigated aided by observations in real case simulations. 
 Understanding and modeling the turbulent transport of surface layer fluxes plays a critical role in a numerical weather forecasting model. The presence of heterogeneous surface obstacles (buildings) that have dimensions comparable to the model vertical resolution requires further complexity and design in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) scheme. In this study, we develop the numerical method to couple one of the recently validated PBL schemes, TKE-ACM2, with the multi-layer Building Effect Parameterization (BEP) model in WRF. Subsequently, the performance of TKE-ACM2+BEP has been examined under idealized convective atmospheric conditions with a simplified building layout. Furthermore, its reproducibility is benchmarked with one of the state-of-the-art large-eddy simulation models, PALM, which can explicitly resolve the building aerodynamics. The result indicates that TKE-ACM2+BEP outperforms the other operational PBL scheme (Boulac) coupled with BEP by reducing the bias in both the potential temperature (θ) and wind speed (u). Following this, real case simulations are conducted for a highly urbanized domain, i.e., the Pearl River Delta (PRD) region in China. The high-resolution wind speed LiDAR observations suggest that TKE-ACM2+BEP can mitigate the overestimation in the lower part of the boundary layer compared to the Bulk method at a LiDAR site located in a densely built environment. In addition, the surface temperature and relative humidity can be improved in TKE-ACM2+BEP at surface stations in urbanized areas compared to TKE-ACM2 without BEP. However, it is revealed that BEP may not always imply a better reproduction of surface wind speed as it could exert excessive aerodynamic drag."

The framework provides a valuable tool for irrigation optimization to deliver co-benefits of ensuring food production, reducing water use and greenhouse gas emissions. 
 Rice cultivation faces multiple challenges of rising food demand while increasing water scarcity and greenhouse gas emissions, intensifying the tension of the food-water-climate nexus. Process-based modeling of the nexus is pivotal for developing effective measures to address these challenges. However, current models struggle to simulate their complex relationships under different water management schemes, primarily due to inadequate representation of critical physiological effects and the absence of efficient spatially explicit modeling strategies. Here, we propose an advancing framework that addresses these problems by integrating a process-based soil-crop model with vital physiological effects, a novel method for model upscaling, and the NSGA-II multi-objective optimization algorithm at a parallel computing platform. Applying the framework accounted for 52 %, 60 %, 37 %, and 94 % of the experimentally observed variations in rice yield, irrigation water use, and methane and nitrous oxide emissions in response to irrigation schemes. Compared with the origin model using traditional parameter upscaling methods, the advancing framework significantly reduced simulation errors by 35 %−85 %. Moreover, it well reproduced the multivariable synergies and tradeoffs observed in China’s rice fields and identified additional 18 % areas feasible for irrigation optimization, along with an additional 11 % and 14 % reduction potentials of water use and methane emissions, without compromising production. Over 90 % of the potentials could be realized at the cost of 4 % less yield increase and 25 % higher nitrous oxide emissions under multiple objectives. Overall, this study provides a valuable tool for multi-objective optimization of rice irrigation schemes. The advancing framework also has implications for other process-based modelling improvements efforts."

Processing flexibility is enabled through the combination of modular processing steps in module chains. Modifications are possible by individually arranging modules, adding calculation modules or adjusting processing parameters. The documentation of the processing steps in the result’s metadata ensures the traceability of the results.

Results of these simulations are overall consistent with previous studies evaluating the global cost of water supply and adaptation to global changes.

Nearshore regions of the North Sea, particularly the eastern and northwestern areas, have the lowest CO2-eq per MWh of electricity produced due to favorable wind resources. Developing an OWF in the central North Sea requires more copper and aluminum due to large distances to shore and thus incurs higher embodied CO2-eq per MWh. These areas also overlap with several protected areas and thus remain the least favorable for OWE development. The future emergent OWE technological developments for 2040 such as the installation of larger turbines with an extended lifetime alone could, on average, lead to reductions of ∼0.06 kg in steel demand (∼35%), ∼ 0.15 g in copper demand (∼31%), and ∼10.97 kg of CO2-eq (∼41%) per MWh produced.

Demand for oilseed-based biofuels is associated with particularly complex market and supply chain dynamics, which must be considered. Using the global partial equilibrium model GLOBIOM, this study explores the uncertainty in market-mediated impacts and ILUC-related emissions from increasing demand for soybean biodiesel in the United States in the period 2020–2050. A one-at-a-time (OAT) analysis and a Monte Carlo (MC) analysis are performed to assess the sensitivity of modeled ILUC-GHG emissions intensities (gCO2e/MJ) to varying key economic and biophysical model parameters. Additionally, the influence of the approach on the simulation of future ILUC effects is explored using two alternative ILUC-GHG metrics: a comparative-static approach for 2030 and a recursive-dynamic approach using model outputs through 2050. We find that projected ILUC-GHG values largely vary based on which vegetable oils replace diverted soybean oil, market responses to coproducts, and the carbon content of land converted for agricultural use. These are all, in turn, subject to decision uncertainty through the choice of the modeling approach and the time horizon considered for each ILUC-GHG metric. Given the longer simulation period, ILUC-GHG emission uncertainty ranges increase under the recursive-dynamic approach (42.4 ± 25.9 gCO2e/MJ) compared to the comparative-static approach (40.8 ± 20.5 gCO2e/MJ). The combination of MC analysis with other techniques such as Bayesian Additive Regression Trees (BART) is powerful for understanding model behavior and clarifying the sensitivity of market responses, ILUC, and associated GHG emissions to specific model parameters when simulated with global economic models. The BART reveals that biophysical parameters generate more linear ILUC-GHG responses to changes in assumed parameter values while changes in economic parameters lead to more nonlinear ILUC-GHG results as multiple effects at the interplay of food, feed, and fuel uses overlap. The choice of the recursive-dynamic metric allows capturing the longer-term evolution of ILUC while generating additional uncertainties derived from the baseline definition."

However, in the eastern US, where smoke levels were much lower in 2020, CTMs show modestly better agreement with surface measurements. We develop a calibration framework that integrates CTM- and ML-based approaches to yield estimates of smoke PM2.5 concentrations that outperform individual approach.

However, the kinetics of this process and the impact of environmental factors remain unclear. Herein, we investigated U(VI) reduction by chemically reduced nontronite (rNAu-2) in the presence of EDTA and bicarbonate. U(VI) was completely reduced within 192 h by rNAu-2 alone, and higher Fe(II) in rNAu-2 resulted in a higher U(VI) reduction rate. However, the presence of EDTA and NaHCO3 initially inhibited U(VI) reduction by forming stable U(VI)–EDTA/carbonato complexes and thus preventing U(VI) from adsorbing onto the rNAu-2 surface. However, over time, EDTA facilitated the dissolution of rNAu-2, releasing Fe(II) into solution. Released Fe(II) competed with U(VI) to form Fe(II)–EDTA complexes, thus freeing U(VI) from negatively charged U(VI)–EDTA complexes to form positively charged U(VI)–OH complexes, which ultimately promoted U(VI) adsorption and triggered its reduction. In the NaHCO3 system, U(VI) complexed with carbonate to form U(VI)–carbonato complexes, which partially inhibited adsorption to the rNAu-2 surface and subsequent reduction. The reduced U(IV) largely formed uraninite nanoparticles, with a fraction present in the rNAu-2 interlayer. Our results demonstrate the important impacts of clay minerals, organic matter, and bicarbonate on U(VI) reduction, providing crucial insights into the uranium biogeochemistry in the subsurface environment and remediation strategies for uranium-contaminated environments."

While the surface warming has accelerated recently, UTLS temperatures, however, have declined since 2001, as demonstrated by multiple reanalysis data sets. This shift in trends provides a unique opportunity to understand the factors influencing Arctic UTLS temperature changes. Further analysis indicates that the descending component of the Brewer‐Dobson (BD) circulation over the Arctic was strengthened before 2000 but weakened thereafter. Simultaneously, Arctic lower stratospheric water vapor showed a decreasing trend before 2000, followed by an increasing trend. The weakening of the BD circulation led to reduced dynamical heating, and the increased water vapor resulted in enhanced radiative cooling, which together contributed to the cooling of the Arctic UTLS after 2000."

How these features will change with a warming climate is just starting to be addressed due to global climate model limitations in resolving convection. We employ a novel regional setup for an atmospheric convection‐permitting model alongside the pseudo‐global warming (PGW) approach to address climate change impacts on the weather‐climate system of Africa during a short period of high‐impact weather. Our findings indicate that the AEJ and WAM may intensify in a future warming climate scenario. Precipitation is shown to increase over Guinea Highlands and Cameroon Mountains and shift southward due to a latitudinal expansion and increase of deep convection closer to the equator.

Current O3 uptake predictions are limited by the simplistic big‐leaf schemes commonly used in chemical transport models (CTMs) to parameterize deposition. Such schemes fail to reproduce observed O3 fluxes over terrestrial ecosystems, highlighting the need for more realistic treatment of surface‐atmosphere exchange in CTMs. We address this need by linking a resolved canopy model (1D Multi‐Layer Canopy CHemistry and Exchange Model, MLC‐CHEM) to the GEOS‐Chem CTM and use this new framework to simulate O3 fluxes over three north temperate forests. We compare results with in situ measurements from four field studies and with standalone, observationally constrained MLC‐CHEM runs to test current knowledge of O3 deposition and its drivers. We show that GEOS‐Chem overpredicts observed O3 fluxes across all four studies by up to 2×, whereas the resolved‐canopy models capture observed diel profiles of O3 deposition and in‐canopy concentrations to within 10%. Relative humidity and solar irradiance are strong O3 flux drivers over these forests, and uncertainties in those fields provide the largest remaining source of model deposition biases. Flux partitioning analysis shows that: (a) nonstomatal loss accounts for 60% of O3 deposition on average; (b) in‐canopy chemistry makes only a small contribution to total O3 fluxes; and (c) the CTM big‐leaf treatment overestimates O3‐driven stomatal loss and plant phytotoxicity in these temperate forests by up to 7×. Results motivate the application of fully online vertically explicit canopy schemes in CTMs for improved O3 predictions."

Gas‐particle partitioning on dust not only modifies species' chemical evolutions but also influences their deposition velocity. However, how does dust heterogeneous chemistry impacts acid deposition remains unexplored. In this research, we integrated dust photocatalytic mechanism into GEOS‐Chem to assess its impact on sulfur removal across various regions and time spans in China. We find the photocatalytic mechanism enhances simulation performances of acid deposition. Observational validation demonstrates significant reductions in modeling bias for sulfur dioxide (SO2) dry deposition and sulfate (SO4) total deposition. Additionally, the improved model captures the declining trend of SO4 deposition over 2006–2020. We further identified two key impacts of photocatalytic chemistry: firstly, our findings indicate it enhances sulfur removal more efficiently in near‐desert areas like North China Plain (NCP) than in downwind areas like Yunnan‐Guizhou‐Chongqing region (YGY). Lifetimes of total sulfur reduced from 3.29 to 2.46 days in NCP, and from 2.46 to 1.95 days in YGY. This discrepancy results from faster conversion of SO2 to dust‐phase SO4 and larger proportions of coarse‐mode particles in NCP, resulting in accelerated SO4 deposition velocity. Secondly, our results indicate that because dust photocatalytic chemistry amplifies removal of sulfur through SO4 formation and deposition, decreased dust emission resulted in enhanced sulfur lifetimes over 2006–2014. Sensitivity experiments further show higher dust concentrations accelerate pollutants' removal. These findings underscore the importance of dust heterogeneous chemistry in influencing sulfur deposition, providing scientific insights for mitigating acid deposition in China."

 Recently, the bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 has been discovered as a new superconductor with transition temperature Tc near 80 K under high pressure1–3. Despite extensive theoretical and experimental work to understand the nature of its superconductivity4–29, the requirement of extreme pressure restricts the use of many experimental probes and limits its application potential. Here, we present signatures of superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 thin films at ambient pressure, facilitated by the application of epitaxial compressive strain. The onset Tc varies approximately from 26 K to 42 K, with higher Tc values correlating with smaller in-plane lattice constants. We observed the co-existence of other Ruddlesden-Popper phases within the films and dependence of transport behavior with ozone annealing, suggesting that the observed low zero resistance Tc of around 2 K can be attributed to stacking defects, grain boundaries, and oxygen stoichiometry. This finding initiates numerous opportunities to stabilize and study superconductivity in bilayer nickelates at ambient pressure, and to facilitate the broad understanding of the ever-growing number of high temperature and unconventional superconductors in the transition metal oxides."

 The evolution of the lunar dynamo is essential for deciphering the deep interior structure, thermal history, and surface environment of the Moon1-4. Previous palaeomagnetic investigations on samples returned from the nearside of the Moon have established the general variation of the lunar magnetic field5-7. However, limited spatial and temporal palaeomagnetic constraints leave the evolution of the lunar dynamo ambiguous. The Chang'e-6 mission returned the first farside basalts dated at ca. 2.8 billion years ago (Ga)8,9, offering a unique opportunity to investigate a critical spatiotemporal gap in the evolution of the global lunar dynamo. Here we report palaeointensities (~5–21 μT) recovered from the Chang’e-6 basalts, providing the first constraint on the magnetic field from the lunar farside and a critical anchor within the large gap between 3 and 2 Ga. The new results record a rebound of the field strength after its prior sharp decline around 3.1 Ga, which attests to an active lunar dynamo at ca. 2.8 Ga in the mid-early stage and argues against the suggestion that the lunar dynamo may have remained in a low-energy state after 3 Ga until its demise. The result suggests the lunar dynamo was most likely driven by either a basal magma ocean and/or precession, probably supplemented by other mechanisms such as core crystallisation."

 Discrete protein assemblies ranging from hundreds of kilodaltons to hundreds of megadaltons in size are a ubiquitous feature of biological systems and perform highly specialized functions1,2. Despite remarkable recent progress in accurately designing new self-assembling proteins, the size and complexity of these assemblies has been limited by a reliance on strict symmetry3. Here, inspired by the pseudosymmetry observed in bacterial microcompartments and viral capsids, we developed a hierarchical computational method for designing large pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials. We computationally designed pseudosymmetric heterooligomeric components and used them to create discrete, cage-like protein assemblies with icosahedral symmetry containing 240, 540 and 960 subunits. At 49, 71 and 96 nm diameter, these nanocages are the largest bounded computationally designed protein assemblies generated to date. More broadly, by moving beyond strict symmetry, our work substantially broadens the variety of self-assembling protein architectures that are accessible through design. A new computational method for design of pseudosymmetric self-assembling protein nanomaterials has resulted in purification of cage-like protein assemblies containing 960 subunits with a diameter of 96 nm."

Here, the authors describe a simple and reliable approach for constructing strongly inducible synthetic yeast promoters, which are validated for use in large-scale protein production. 
 Inducible promoters are essential for precise control of target gene expression in synthetic biological systems. However, engineering eukaryotic promoters is often more challenging than engineering prokaryotic promoters due to their greater mechanistic complexity. In this study, we describe a simple and reliable approach for constructing strongly inducible synthetic promoters with minimum leakiness in yeasts. The results indicate that the leakiness of yeast-inducible synthetic promoters is primarily the result of cryptic transcriptional activation of heterologous sequences that may be avoided by appropriate insulation and operator mutagenesis. Our promoter design approach has successfully generated robust, inducible promoters that achieve a > 103-fold induction in reporter gene expression. The utility of these promoters is demonstrated by using them to produce various biologics with titers up to 2 g/L, including antigens designed to raise specific antibodies against a SARS-CoV-2 omicron variant through chicken immunization. Inducible promoters that control gene expression in response to small molecules are essential in synthetic biology.

 Bats are presumed reservoirs of diverse coronaviruses (CoVs) including progenitors of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)-CoV and SARS-CoV-2, the causative agent of COVID-19. However, the evolution and diversification of these coronaviruses remains poorly understood. Here we use a Bayesian statistical framework and a large sequence data set from bat-CoVs (including 589 novel CoV sequences) in China to study their macroevolution, cross-species transmission and dispersal. We find that host-switching occurs more frequently and across more distantly related host taxa in alpha- than beta-CoVs, and is more highly constrained by phylogenetic distance for beta-CoVs. We show that inter-family and -genus switching is most common in Rhinolophidae and the genus Rhinolophus. Our analyses identify the host taxa and geographic regions that define hotspots of CoV evolutionary diversity in China that could help target bat-CoV discovery for proactive zoonotic disease surveillance. Finally, we present a phylogenetic analysis suggesting a likely origin for SARS-CoV-2 in Rhinolophus spp. bats. Bats are a likely reservoir of zoonotic coronaviruses (CoVs).

Forecast skill diminishes as lead time increases in both DYN and STAT forecasts, with peak accuracy occurring post-northern hemisphere spring predictability barrier and preceding seasons. The DYN forecasts outperform STAT forecasts with a pronounced advantage in forecasts initiated from late boreal winter through spring. The analysis uncovers an asymmetry in predicting the onset of cold and warm ENSO episodes, with warm episode onsets being better forecasted than cold onsets in both DYN and STAT models. The DYN forecasts are found to be valuable for predicting warm and cold ENSO episode onsets at least several months in advance, while STAT forecasts are less informative about ENSO phase transitions.

 Comprehending the resilience of regional hydroclimate in response to CO2 removal is essential for guiding future mitigation and adaptation strategies. Using an ensemble of model simulations forced by idealized CO2 ramp-up followed by ramp-down, here we show that the winter precipitation over the Northeastern Pacific and Western North America (NPWNA) is irreversible even if global warming is reversed back to 2 °C level. This asymmetric change features a tripolar pattern and is tied to Aleutian Low intensification, which is driven by both zonal and meridional gradients of sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the tropical central-eastern Pacific. Distinct from the zonal SST gradient—explained by different timescales of surface and subsurface warming and ocean dynamical processes, amplified through the Bjerknes feedback—the meridional SST gradient originates from the southward shift of the intertropical convergence zone, maintained by the wind-evaporation-SST feedback. Our findings suggest that the regional hydrological risks over the NPWNA induced by CO2 ramp-up cannot be fully eliminated by CO2 removal even if the global warming level is restored back."

 This study investigates the critical role of meteorological variability, particularly polar vortex dynamics, in shaping PM2.5 anomaly patterns across sub-regions in East Asia. Following sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) in winter, East Asia experienced significant tropospheric transitions, including cooling-to-warming shifts. The strengthening of the Mongolian high, combined with tropospheric warming, altered lower tropospheric dynamics. Contrasting warming in Mongolia and cooling to the north intensified baroclinic instability, creating anomalous Mongolian cyclones for increased dust storm activity and higher PM2.5 levels. Elevated PM2.5 concentrations in eastern China, driven by substantial anthropogenic emissions, were dispersed by the divergent flow under the Mongolian high.

 This study investigates the response of Indian summer monsoon (ISM) precipitation to CO2 removal, with a specific focus on regional and subseasonal variations. Following CO2 removal, monsoon circulation weakens throughout the summer owing to the reduced large-scale meridional temperature gradient around India. Weakened monsoon circulation decreases the local-scale thermodynamic stability within India, following monsoon-onset periods. While the frequency of synoptic-scale ISM low-pressure systems (LPSs) decreases overall, the lower thermodynamic stability causes the LPSs to form and resultantly shift west and south from their typical paths, last longer and move more quickly zonally during August and September. Changes in these rain-producing processes induce distinct regional (Western Ghats, south-central-east India, and Tamil Nadu) and subseasonal precipitation responses. Also, extreme precipitation exhibits similar patterns, but is more strongly affected by changes in LPS. Our results suggest that reliable future projections of regional hydroclimate change require a more accurate understanding of multi-scale precipitation processes."

 Change of zonal thermal contrast in the upper troposphere (ZTUT) between Asia and the North Pacific is a highly concerned issue, as it profoundly influences the Northern hemispheric climate. However, the physical reasons, particularly the anthropogenic influences on the ZTUT change are not well understood. Here, we show that increased aerosols and greenhouse gases tend to weaken the summer Asian-Pacific ZTUT, through affecting radiation processes over the Tibetan Plateau and altering moist enthalpy advections over the North Pacific, respectively. Under the present climate, aerosol variations play a leading role in the trend change of summer ZTUT from a deceasing to an increasing pattern in the mid-1980s. These decreasing and increasing trends are, respectively, enhanced and attenuated by greenhouse gas emissions. Toward the end of this century under the SSP2–4.5 scenario, continuous increases in greenhouse gases are expected to become the dominant contributor for projected weakening of summer ZTUT, with the rate offset by decreases in aerosols."

 The seasonal cycle of vertical mixing is crucial for lake ecosystems, yet its future under climate change remains uncertain. While lake stratification shifts have been widely studied, the annual overturning duration changes are less clear. Using sub-daily simulations from a fully coupled numerical Earth system model, we assess phenological changes in stratification and overturning in Northern Hemisphere ice-covered lakes. We find the total stratification duration (comprising both summer and winter phases) is projected to decrease by 0.7, 4.6, and 6.9 days in 2029, 2067, and 2096, respectively, under global temperature increases of 1.5 °C, 3 °C, and 4.5 °C.

 Critical minerals are essential for advancing the energy transition. However, the public’s perception of these minerals and their application is still not well understood. Here, we investigate public awareness and perceptions of critical minerals in the United States, based on a nationally representative survey of 1200 online respondents. While only 38% of respondents stated familiarity with critical minerals, over 80% recognized the importance of minerals in the energy transition. Participants were most supportive of strategies focused on mineral research and improving the environmental impacts of mining, while domestic mining received less support. Regression analysis shows that individuals who perceive mineral criticality based on their importance to clean energy support multiple mineral policies, whereas those concerned about import dependency or shortages prefer domestic mining. Individuals who believe environmental impacts should govern criticality designation oppose domestic mining and support mineral recycling and improving mining’s environmental impacts. These findings highlight the role of differing perceptions of mineral criticality in shaping policy preferences, emphasizing the need for public awareness to foster sustainable mineral strategies for the energy transition.

 El Niño-Southern Oscillation-induced tropical Pacific precipitation anomalies have global impacts and will intensify under greenhouse warming, but the potential for mitigating these changes is less understood. Here, we identify distinct hysteresis features in the precipitation-sea surface temperature sensitivity between strong El Niño and La Niña phases using a large ensemble carbon removal numerical simulation. The strong El Niño precipitation sensitivity exhibits a century-scale hysteretic enhancement and eastward shift, mainly due to modulated deep convection anomalies by the Intertropical Convergence Zone via cloud-longwave feedback. Instead, the strong La Niña counterpart is concentrated toward the equator, mostly in the central-western Pacific, with a shorter hysteresis period of a few decades. This primarily involves changes in shallow convection and surface thermal structures during La Niña, shaped by global warming-induced upper-ocean circulation changes. The distinct climate change regimes of strong El Niño and La Niña precipitation sensitivity hold important implications for assessing mitigation consequences.

 Deep decarbonization is essential for achieving the Paris Agreement goals, and carbon dioxide removal is required to address residual emissions and achieve net-zero targets. However, the implications of delaying the deployment of removal technologies remain unclear. We quantify how different carbon removal methods and their deployment timing affect achieving net zero emissions by 2050 in the United States. Our findings show that postponing novel technologies until mid-century forces accelerated decarbonization of energy-intensive sectors, reducing residual emissions by at least 12% compared with near-term deployment of carbon dioxide removal. This delay increases transition costs, requiring carbon prices 59–79% higher than with near-term deployment. It also heightens the risk of premature fossil fuel retirement in the electricity sector, leading to 128–220 billion USD losses compared to gradual scale up starting now.

Accelerated aridification has occurred in already dry regions, such as South-west North-America, North-Brazil, the European-Basin, North-Africa, the Middle-East, the Sahel, and central-Asia, with central-Africa as a new hotspot.

 Perennial grasses are an option to mitigate global warming, increase energy security, and alleviate environmental pressures within agricultural landscapes. Their cultivation alters near-surface temperature in ways that are still largely unclear. Here, a regional climate model with an enhanced representation of perennial grasses shows that converting today’s cropland areas in Europe induces annual mean temperature reductions in summer and autumn (up to –1 °C), which are primarily driven by a later harvest of perennial grasses relative to annual crops. Cultivation of perennial grasses where they deliver stronger biogeophysical cooling can achieve a similar annual mean temperature reduction on half of the land. This cooling can counteract up to 50% of the projected future warming and it is three times larger than what is achieved via carbon emission reductions.

 Ocean images collected by astronauts onboard the Apollo spacecraft more than 50 years ago revealed a large number of ocean eddies, with a size between 1 and 20 km. Since then, satellite infrared, ocean color, sun glitter and synthetic aperture radar images, with high spatial resolution, have confirmed the ubiquitous presence of these small eddies in all oceans. However, observing the dynamical characteristics and evolution of these eddies has remained challenging. An experiment was recently carried out in the California Current system using the new airborne Doppler Scatterometer (National Aeronautics and Space Administration-Jet Propulsion Laboratory DopplerScatt) instrument that observes surface velocities. Here, with DopplerScatt, we mapped a 30 × 100 km domain over multiple days to unveil numerous 1–20 km ocean eddies, called submesoscale eddies, that evolve over a period of a few hours. The strong interactions between eddies generate horizontal velocity divergence, implying vertical velocities reaching 250 m day−1 at 40 m depth. The velocity field also produces horizontal dispersion of particles over a distance of 50 km within 12 h, which rapidly fills the turbulent eddy field. These observations suggest that submesoscale ocean turbulence may profoundly affect the vertical transport of heat, carbon, and important climatic gases between the atmosphere and the ocean interior, as well as the horizontal dispersion of tracers and particles. As such, submesoscale ocean eddies are a critical element of Earth’s climate system.

 Accurately predicting truck origin–destination (OD) flows is essential for optimizing logistics systems and promoting coordinated regional development. Existing methods typically assume a monotonic decrease in truck OD flows with increasing geospatial distance, which oversimplifies the complex non-monotonic distribution patterns observed in practice. Moreover, these methods overlook interregional socioeconomic distances and their interaction with geospatial distances, thereby limiting the prediction accuracy and reliability. This study introduces a gravity-inspired model that integrates both geospatial and socioeconomic distances (GSD-DG) to explicitly represent their combined influence on truck OD flows. Specifically, we 1) develop a geospatial distance relation graph using the Weibull function to model the complex spatial distribution patterns of truck OD flows with varying geospatial distances; 2) propose a gravity-inspired representation learning method based on graph attention mechanism to quantify the influence of socioeconomic distance on truck OD flows; and 3) construct a deep gravity model that integrates these distances and their interactions to capture their non-linear relationship with truck OD flows. Extensive experiments on four datasets with varying spatial scale and economic development levels demonstrate that the GSD-DG model improves the robustness and prediction accuracy across diverse spatial distribution patterns, reducing RMSE by 14.2%–85.8% and MSE by 23.5%–92.5% compared to the six baseline models. Incorporating socioeconomic distance and its interaction with geospatial distance further reduces RMSE by 8.5%–36.0%.

 The indoor map is an indispensable component to visualize human users’ real-time locations and guided routes to find their destinations in large and complex buildings efficiently. The map design in existing mobile indoor navigation systems mostly considers either the user locations or the route segments but seldom considers the adaptation of the base map scale. Due to uneven densities of spatial elements, the complexity of routes, and the diversity of spatial distribution of navigation decision points, the base map information of indoor navigation maps varies greatly. Hence, it is inevitable to cause an inappropriate amount of map information at different locations and routes. Additionally, existing multi-scale representations of indoor maps are limited to certain scales but not adapted to building locations. Users have to adjust the map scales frequently through multiple interactions with the navigation system. In this study, we propose a method that considers the dynamic elements of indoor maps to quantify the map information for scale adaptation. The indoor navigation map information calculation includes both geometry information and spatial distribution information of static base map elements (area elements, POIs) and dynamic route elements (segments, decision points). The total map information is quantified by setting the weights of the two types of elements. An empirical study on indoor navigation map selection was conducted. Results show that the quantified map information using the proposed method can reflect a user-desired map better than the traditionally used scales."

Protein complex function can be modulated by RNA molecules that provide allosteric regulation or act as molecular guides or scaffolds.

We found that MAVS, through its central intrinsically disordered domain, directly interacted with the 3′ untranslated regions of cellular messenger RNAs. Elimination of RNA by ribonuclease treatment disrupted the MAVS signalosome, including RNA-modulated MAVS interactors that regulate RLR signaling and viral restriction, and inhibited phosphorylation of transcription factors that induce interferons.

This involves a cytoplasmic role for ALAS1, previously considered inactive outside of mitochondria.

We cocultured a hydrogenotrophic methanogen with an H2-producing bacterium under conditions (55°C, 10 megapascals) simulating a methane-bearing subsurface. This resulted in near-complete reversibility of methanogenesis, leading to equilibria for both hydrogen and carbon isotopes. The methanogen not only equilibrated kinetic isotope signals of initially produced methane but also modified the isotope signals of amended thermogenic methane.

However, most individuals exhibit a more robust response to one of these strains and thus are vulnerable to infection by others. By studying a monozygotic twin cohort, we found that although prior exposure is a factor, host genetics are a stronger driver of subtype bias to influenza viral strains. We found that covalent coupling of heterologous hemagglutinin (HA) from different viral strains could largely eliminate subtype bias in an animal model and in a human tonsil organoid system.

Despite remarkable progress, it remains challenging to combine the attributes of excellent maneuverability, low power consumption, and high robustness in a single multimodal microrobot. We propose an architected design of a passively morphing wheel that can be stabilized at distinct geometric configurations, relying on asymmetric bending stiffness of bioinspired tentacle structures. By integrating such wheels with electromagnetic motors and a flexible body, we develop a highly compact, lightweight, multimodal microrobot (length ~32 mm and mass ~4.74 g) with three locomotion gaits. It has high motion speed (~21.2 BL/s), excellent agility (relative centripetal acceleration, ~206.9 BL/s2), low power consumption (cost of transport, ~89), high robustness, and strong terrain adaptabilities. Integration of batteries and a wireless control module enables developments of an untethered microrobot that maintains high motion speed and excellent agility, with capabilities of traveling in hybrid terrains."

The realization of top-performing radiation detectors typically relies on careful crystal selection from broad candidate groups, as residual strain remains unavoidable during the SC growth process, which often leads to the formation of ferroelastic domains with varied orientations. Here, we introduce an in-line tempering strategy to alleviate microstrain and homogenize the domain orientation across methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI3) perovskite SCs. The progressive strain relief during the phase transition in situ, demonstrated by the removal of ferroelastic domain walls, substantially enhances the crystallinity and the optoelectronic properties of the MAPbI3SCs. As a result, the gamma-ray energy spectrum detector leveraging these strain-relaxed SCs achieves an energy resolution of 7.2% at 59.5 keV for a241Am gamma-ray source, and the 25-pixel device performs highly uniformly with concentrated current distribution, which paves the way for its implementation in high-resolution radiation spectroscopy."
