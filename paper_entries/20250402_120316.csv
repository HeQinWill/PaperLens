10.1088/1748-9326/adb2a9,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注欧洲地区冬季风能干旱的归因和预测。论文探讨了在不同全球变暖情景下，欧洲地区风能干旱发生的频率变化，并分析了其对风力发电的影响。研究结果表明，在温室气体排放不加控制的情况下，欧洲冬季风能干旱的概率将增加，尤其是在全球变暖达到一定程度时。虽然该研究涉及大气现象，但其重点在于风能资源评估和气候变化对能源的影响，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['wind energy', 'wind speed', 'climate change', 'global warming', 'wind droughts', 'wind power production']",Shuang Yu;Robert Vautard,Attribution and projection of regional winter wind energy drought in Europe,"The decline of surface wind speed in many regions of the world is an important phenomenon as it is potentially expected to decrease wind power production. It is not clear, however, whether this decline takes the form of a gradual wind speed decrease or an increase in ‘wind energy droughts’ (WED), long periods with weak wind speeds. Both types of wind speed reductions contribute to a decline in wind power production. Prolonged and more frequent WED, in particular, may reduce revenue and jeopardize wind farm projects. Past and future changes in WED, as well as their underlying drivers, remain poorly understood. Here we show that winter WED will become more probable in Europe and the return period of 10.3 yr events during 1971–2000 have been shortened to about 10 yrs in the whole Europe, and it would be shortened to about 6.6 yrs during 2041–2070, under uncurbed greenhouse gases emission (scenario RCP8.5). In the current period, low wind energy winter has become more probable in most European countries, especially in the northern countries, showing a higher probability ratio of wind droughts. In the future, for some southern countries, the frequency of wind energy winter droughts is projected to decrease compared with the current period, which is helpful for the development of wind power generation in these countries. In addition, the changes in WED are sensitive to the global warming level. With global warming at 1.5 °C, 2 °C, 3 °C, 4 °C levels, low wind energy winter in Europe will occur more frequently as the probability is more than 1.13, 1.46, 1.53, 1.60 times as much as that in the current climate, respectively. The regional difference of attribution is meaningful for the optimization of wind energy transmission networks in Europe, which may be considered by large-scale wind energy producers."

Both of these technologies rely on the use of chemical solvents or sorbents in order to capture CO2. Lately, concerns have surfaced about the cost and energy implications of producing solvents and sorbents at scale. Here, we show that the production of chemical sorbents could have significant implications on system cost, energy use and material use depending on how much they are consumed. Among the three chemical sorbents investigated, namely monoethanolamine (MEA) for post-combustion carbon capture, potassium hydroxide (KOH) for liquid DAC and polyethylenimine-silica (PEI) for solid sorbent DAC, we found that solid sorbent production for DAC represents the highest uncertainties for the system. At the high range of solid sorbent consumption, total energy system cost increased by up to 6.5%, while effects for other options were small to negligible. Scale-up of material production capacities was also substantial for MEA and PEI. While PEI has the advantage of requiring a lower sorbent regeneration temperature than KOH, the potential production cost may outweigh these benefits. There is thus a trade-off between the advantages and the additional cost uncertainty regarding sorbents. Implications of sorbent consumption for carbon capture technologies should be considered more thoroughly in scenarios relying on solid sorbent DAC."

Incorporating the relative global attractor radius as the saturation threshold into the nonlinear local Lyapunov exponent method to address SCSP’s oscillatory error growth after saturation reveals that its PL peaks in winter (3.72 months) and drops to its lowest during the autumn (3.12 months). ENSO is identified as the primary source of SCSP predictability, with its PLs generally extending longer and exhibiting distinct inter-seasonal variability compared to those of SCSP. As a crucial system linking ENSO and SCSP, WNPAC mirrors with SCSP in both PLs’ values and inter-seasonal variability. Physical analysis shows that seasonal shift in the WNPAC-ENSO relationship exerts a strong influence on SCSP predictability."

However, current restoration strategies remain predominantly limited to zoning modes of restoration, lacking a systematic integration of restoration priority assessments and configurations of technology at the watershed scale. To enhance the effectiveness of restoration in the LP, we propose a framework for selecting restoration modes by identifying watershed restoration priorities. Our methodology integrates three key components: (1) ecological network analysis to identify critical conservation areas, (2) a multi-criteria assessment to evaluate ecological importance, problem severity, and restoration potential for priority ranking, and (3) a watershed classification that synthesizes ecosystem status conditions and restoration priorities for selecting the corresponding restoration mode. The results reveal significant spatial heterogeneity in the status conditions and ecological problems of watershed ecosystems, with high-priority restoration watersheds concentrated in the western and central regions. In addition, the watershed ecosystems are categorized into eight classes, with corresponding combinations of technologies that match both the ecological problems and restoration priorities. This study selects restoration modes based on priority identification, offering methodological improvements for watershed restoration in ecologically fragile regions."

WWTPs are also significant sources of CO2 due to organic matter oxidation, and integrating alkalinity addition into treatment processes may both reduce in-plant CO2 emissions and increase downstream CO2 uptake. This study presents a modeling framework that combines a modern activated sludge model-based WWTP simulator with an integrated hydrodynamic-biogeochemical-carbonate chemistry model of coastal oceans. We evaluate the effects of adding alkalinity either upstream (UpAdd) of the biological treatment stage or downstream at the discharge location (DnAdd) on WWTP carbon emission reduction and marine CO2 removal. The carbon emission from WWTPs decreases with increasing alkalinity dosage in UpAdd and can be eliminated at a dosage level that is feasible to implement. However, carbon uptake in the surrounding oceanic water is much reduced due to elevated dissolved inorganic carbon in the discharge water. DnAdd does not affect CO2 emissions from WWTPs but enhances carbon uptake in the ocean, with the net oceanic uptake of atmospheric CO2 increasing with increasing dosage level. Across all tested dosage levels, total CO2 removal, including emission reduction at the WWTPs and enhanced carbon uptake in the ocean, is 30% greater in UpAdd than in DnAdd. WWTP treatment tanks have much higher pCO2 than in the ocean, and aeration of process tanks enhances the gas transfer. The upstream alkalinity addition leads to sharp declines in pCO2 in the treatment tanks and large reductions in carbon emission from the WWTPs. These results have implications for developing strategies to reduce global carbon emission and enhance oceanic carbon burial using WWTPs as a delivery mechanism."
10.1088/1748-9326/adc28e,True,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文分析了20世纪末以来东亚地区对流层顶-低层平流层（UTLS）臭氧的月度变化，重点关注大气定常波的影响。通过经验正交函数（EOF）分析，确定了东亚UTLS臭氧变化的主要模式，并将其与极地-欧亚遥相关、西太平洋遥相关和英-贝加尔走廊遥相关联系起来。研究发现，大气定常波的槽区臭氧浓度增加，脊区臭氧浓度降低，这可能为平流层臭氧向对流层中部的入侵创造有利条件。此外，平流层臭氧通过吸收太阳辐射调节位势高度，从而维持这些大气定常波。这项研究强调了动力-化学相互作用在理解UTLS系统中的关键作用。,"['ozone', 'UTLS ozone', 'atmospheric stationary waves', 'reanalysis datasets', 'stratospheric ozone intrusion', 'dynamic-chemical interactions']",Jae-Heung Park;Su-Jung Lee;Taegyung Lee;Sang Seo Park;Kyung-Hwan Kwak;Joowan Kim;Uju Shin;Jun-Hyeok Son;Sang-Wook Yeh;Jong-Seong Kug;Ja-Ho Koo,Variability of upper troposphere–lower stratosphere ozone over East Asia from a perspective of atmospheric stationary waves,"By analyzing observational reanalysis datasets since the late 20th century, in this study we investigated the monthly variability of East Asian ozone at the upper troposphere–lower stratosphere (UTLS, 250 hPa), from a perspective of atmospheric stationary waves. To identify the primary modes of East Asian UTLS ozone variability, an empirical orthogonal function (EOF) analysis was conducted, revealing that the first three EOF modes account for approximately two-thirds of the total variability. The first EOF mode, characterized by a monopole pattern, is associated with the Polar–Eurasian-like teleconnection. Additionally, the second and third EOF modes, featuring meridional and zonal dipole patterns, are linked to the West Pacific-like teleconnection and the British–Baikal Corridor-like teleconnection, respectively. It was found that UTLS ozone concentrations increase over troughs and decrease over ridges of these atmospheric stationary waves in the mid-latitudes. The increase in UTLS ozone concentration caused by these stationary atmospheric waves is expected to create favorable background conditions for a stronger intrusion of stratospheric ozone into the mid-troposphere. Additionally, our results indicate that stratospheric ozone can sustain these stationary atmospheric waves by modulating geopotential height through solar radiation absorption. These findings highlight the crucial role of dynamic-chemical interactions in advancing our understanding of the UTLS system."

Despite criticisms of unclear carbon outcomes, long-term durability of projects, and impacts on local communities, there are few systematic studies that assess their ecological and social outcomes based on ground-level data and robust counterfactuals. This study synthesizes data from the carbon market registry, on-ground surveys, and satellite data to inform VCM standards and policies for land-use related carbon market projects in India. We analyzed satellite imagery to assess changes in tree cover in more than 20 000 plots participating in all VCM afforestation projects registered in the country as of 2022 and surveyed project developers to assess the implementation process and local households to and evaluate economic impacts for 366 households in two of the ongoing projects. We compare these results with comparable plots and households using statistical and machine learning approaches. We find robust evidence of increases in tree cover in both participating and comparable non-participating plots—however there are significantly higher increases in the former (average increase 48 compared to 26%). We also find increases in incomes and asset ownership in both participating and non-participating households in two projects, with significantly higher increases in income in one project and in assets in the other. However, half of the projects are no longer operational, which calls into question the durability of these projects despite positive outcomes for tree cover. Results suggest that VCM standards and policies that foster economic well-being of local stakeholders are more likely to deliver sustained carbon benefits. Successful, long-lasting projects provide examples that evaluation of project implementation plans for continuous engagement, economic incentives, and security of land tenure for local stakeholders at the outset could lead to more viable, long-term VCM projects. Robust counterfactual data on changes in tree cover and economic outcomes are critical for improving the integrity of the VCM."

Shaw;Fabian Hoffmann;Pei Hou;Aaron Wang;Mikhail Ovchinnikov,Microphysics regimes due to haze–cloud interactions: cloud oscillation and cloud collapse,"Large-eddy simulations of a convection cloud chamber show two new microphysics regimes, cloud oscillation and cloud collapse, due to haze–cloud interactions. Our results suggest that haze particles and their interactions with cloud droplets should be considered especially in polluted conditions. To properly simulate haze–cloud interactions, we need to resolve droplet activation and deactivation processes, instead of using Twomey-type activation parameterization. 
 It is known that aqueous haze particles can be activated into cloud droplets in a supersaturated environment. However, haze–cloud interactions have not been fully explored, partly because haze particles are not represented in most cloud-resolving models. Here, we conduct a series of large-eddy simulations (LESs) of a cloud in a convection chamber using a haze-capable Eulerian-based bin microphysics scheme to explore haze–cloud interactions over a wide range of aerosol injection rates. Results show that the cloud is in a slow microphysics regime at low aerosol injection rates, where the cloud responds slowly to an environmental change and droplet deactivation is negligible. The cloud is in a fast microphysics regime at moderate aerosol injection rates, where the cloud responds quickly to an environmental change and haze–cloud interactions are important. More interestingly, two more microphysics regimes are observed at high aerosol injection rates due to haze–cloud interactions. Cloud oscillation is driven by the oscillation of the mean supersaturation around the critical supersaturation of aerosol due to haze–cloud interactions. Cloud collapse happens under weaker forcing of supersaturation where the chamber transfers cloud droplets to haze particles efficiently, leading to a significant decrease (collapse) in cloud droplet number concentration. One special case of cloud collapse is the haze-only regime. It occurs at extremely high aerosol injection rates, where droplet activation is inhibited, and the sedimentation of haze particles is balanced by the aerosol injection rate. Our results suggest that haze particles and their interactions with cloud droplets should be considered, especially in polluted conditions."

Prévôt,Measurement report: Sources and meteorology influencing highly time-resolved PM2.5 trace elements at three urban sites in the extremely polluted Indo-Gangetic Plain in India,"Our study delves into the elemental composition of aerosols at three sites across the Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), revealing distinct patterns during pollution episodes. We found significant increases in chlorine (Cl)-rich and solid fuel combustion (SFC) sources, indicating dynamic emission sources, agricultural burning impacts, and meteorological influences. Surges in Cl-rich particles during cold periods highlight their role in particle growth under high-relative-humidity conditions. 
 High-time-resolution aerosol measurements across various Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) regions are critical due to these regions' dense populations, intense industrial activities, recurring pollution episodes, and agricultural practices, as well as the associated health impacts and broader climate implications of aerosol. However, studies (mostly offline) have been predominantly concentrated in the upper IGP (U-IGP), with limited spatial coverage across the central IGP (C-IGP). This study aims to bridge the gap by examining both U-IGP and C-IGP regions, offering an in-depth analysis of elemental concentrations, source apportionment, inter-regional comparisons, seasonal variations, meteorological influences, and health risks through high-resolution Xact measurements conducted at three urban locations. During the colder seasons, elements such as sulfur (S), chlorine (Cl), and potassium (K) were found to dominate elemental PM2.5 concentrations, while the warm seasons showed notable changes in aluminum (Al), silica (Si), strontium (Sr), and barium (Ba) concentrations. These variations underscore the influence of meteorological conditions and different emission sources on pollution levels. From a health perspective, average levels of carcinogenic elements (lead (Pb), nickel (Ni), arsenic (As), and chromium (Cr)) were usually kept below reference levels. However, Pb concentrations exceeded these thresholds by 40 %–50 % during both periods in the U-IGP, largely attributed to coal combustion and lead smelting activities. Using the Multilinear Engine 2 (ME-2) solver, positive matrix factorization (PMF) deconvolved Cl-rich, coal combustion, Cu-rich, dust, solid fuel combustion 1 (SFC1), SFC2, and S-rich components. In both IGP regions, Cl-rich sources, S-rich sources, and SFC1 dominated the elemental sources, with differences observed in their relative contributions, indicating the influence of regional emissions. The role of meteorology in elemental PM2.5 variations during both clean and polluted episodes in the IGP regions was observed. During pollution episodes, the relative contribution of Cl-rich sources increased when PM2.5 concentrations showed a sharp increase as compared to clean periods, especially during cold periods, indicating the role of emissions from trash burning (plastic and PVC) and steel industries along with favorable meteorological conditions in the formation and accumulation of pollutants. During the warm period, the relative contribution of Cl-rich sources in the C-IGP is less, but during the cold period, both the U-IGP and the C-IGP have significant Cl-rich source contributions (44 %), indicating the role of chlorine in extreme haze air pollution in the whole IGP region. During warm periods, high-pollution events occurred across the IGP with major contributions from SFC1 (crop residue burning), indicating that severe pollution events also depend on seasonal emission sources despite less favorable meteorological conditions. These findings provide valuable insights into the spatial and temporal dynamics of elemental pollution across the IGP, offering a robust foundation for devising targeted mitigation strategies and regulatory policies to safeguard public health in this densely populated region."
10.5194/acp-25-3807-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）的排放和转化对臭氧（O3）形成的影响，并通过计算排放浓度来识别关键VOC物种。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但它与大气环境监测密切相关，特别是空气质量监测和大气成分分析。通过更准确地识别对臭氧形成有重要贡献的VOCs，这项研究可以为空气质量管理和控制策略提供更科学的依据，间接支持遥感数据的应用和验证。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'volatile organic compounds (VOCs)', 'ozone formation', 'anthropogenic emissions', 'biogenic emissions']",Xudong Zheng;Shaodong Xie,Differences in the key volatile organic compound species between their emitted and ambient concentrations in ozone formation,"To reduce uncertainties in identifying the key volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in ozone (O3) formation from ambient concentrations, this study comprehensively calculates the emitted VOC concentrations during both nighttime and daytime using the nitrate radical, O3, and hydroxyl radical reaction rates and ambient VOC concentrations. Based on the emitted concentrations, isoprene is one of the top three species contributing to O3 formation, which may be overlooked in observed concentrations. 
 The emissions and secondary transformations of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) play a significant role in ozone (O3) formation. Previous studies have often relied on ambient VOC concentrations to identify key species. However, ambient concentrations represent the residual concentrations after the emitted VOCs have been consumed, which can introduce substantial uncertainties. To address this issue, this study proposes a novel method to identify the key VOC species in both anthropogenic and biogenic emissions. The emitted VOC concentrations are calculated during both nighttime and daytime in summer using the nitrate radical, O3, and hydroxyl radical reaction rates and ambient concentrations of 99 VOCs measured at Deyang, Chengdu, and Meishan, China.  The emitted concentrations of alkenes and aromatics are higher than the ambient concentrations. The largest differences between emitted and ambient concentrations are 1.04 ppbv for cis-2-butene at Deyang, 0.81 ppbv for isoprene at Chengdu, and 1.79 ppbv for isoprene at Meishan. In contrast, due to secondary production, the emitted concentrations of oxygenated VOCs are lower than the ambient concentrations. The largest differences are −0.54 ppbv for acetone at Deyang, −0.58 ppbv for acetaldehyde at Chengdu, and −0.5 ppbv for acetone at Meishan. Based on the emitted concentrations, isoprene is one of the top three species contributing to O3 formation at all three sites, which may be overlooked in observed concentrations.  Comprehensive calculation of the emitted VOC concentrations enables the key VOC species in O3 formation to be accurately identified."

We therefore compared the accuracy and sensitivity of Dräger Tubes in laboratory tests with more advanced analyzers. Dräger Tubes had a detection limit 3 to 4 times higher than expected. Since there are areas where the use of advanced analyzers is not feasible, the DTM should be improved, or simple and cost-effective measuring methods should be developed. 
 Regional estimates of ammonia (NH3) emissions are often missing data from heterogeneous or small fields. Areas with no experienced staff or in-field power supply also prevent the use of accurate and fully established micrometeorological measurement techniques. The Dräger Tube method (DTM) is a calibrated open and dynamic chamber method, which requires little training to use and is relatively inexpensive. It uses NH3 detector tubes (Dräger Tubes), an automatic pump, and a chamber system comprised of four stainless-steel chambers connected with PTFE tubing. Even though the DTM is often used in countries such as Germany and China, the detection accuracy, precision and sensitivity have not been tested yet. In order to quantify those for the DTM, we simultaneously measured defined NH3 mixing ratios with the Dräger Tubes, with quantum cascade laser spectroscopy (QCLS) (MGA7, MIRO Analytical AG, Switzerland) and with cavity ring-down spectroscopy (G2103, Picarro, Inc., USA). Second, we tested the effects of exchanging the tubing material and heating the tubing under laboratory conditions, as well as PTFE film attachments or wiping of the DTM chamber system with ethanol during outdoor measurements, on performance improvements. Results showed that the Dräger Tubes had a detection limit between 150 and 200 ppb, which is 3 to 4 times higher than originally assumed. Dräger Tube concentration measurements also underestimated NH3 concentrations by 43 % to 100 % for mixing ratios between 50 and 300 ppb and by 28 % to 46 % for mixing ratios between 500 and 1500 ppb. The PTFE tubing material showed similar performance to the polyester–polyurethane tubing material regarding response time, which was further improved by heating the tubing to 50 °C. The modifications to the chamber surface and cleaning in the outdoor experiment did not lead to any improvements to the NH3 concentration measurements. The results suggest that the DTM should only be used where alternatives are unfeasible and high NH3 emissions are to be expected. Further assessment of calibrated DTM using reference methods is required for a comprehensive evaluation, and alternative developments for a more appropriate method replacing the DTM in small-plot applications is encouraged."

 The HALO–(𝒜𝒞)3 aircraft campaign was carried out in March and April 2022 over the Norwegian and Greenland seas, the Fram Strait, and the central Arctic Ocean. Three research aircraft – the High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft (HALO), Polar 5, and Polar 6 – performed 54 partly coordinated research flights on 23 flight days over areas of open ocean, the marginal sea ice zone (MIZ), and the central Arctic sea ice. The general objective of the research flights was to quantify the evolution of air mass properties during moist and warm-air intrusions (WAIs) and cold-air outbreaks (CAOs). To obtain a comprehensive data set, the three aircraft operated following different strategies. HALO was equipped with active and passive remote sensing instruments and dropsondes to cover the regional evolution of cloud and thermodynamic processes. Polar 5 carried a similar remote sensing payload to HALO, and Polar 6 was instrumented with in situ cloud, aerosol, and trace gas instruments focusing on the initial air mass transformation close to the MIZ.

The water quality data for surface and groundwater was collected over 14 years and contains more than 1000 records. Despite missing values and different sampling methods and groups, the data provides a consistent overview of the hydrogeochemistry of the catchment. This dataset is valuable for global modelling studies as well as better understanding of local dryland salinity and water quality processes. 
 Dryland salinity remains a major global natural resource management concern, and which is amplified in Australia. However, limited detailed space-time data sets with observations of stream and groundwater salinity has constrained a deep understanding of the range of processes that can lead to dryland salinity problems in landscapes. The aim of this study is to report on the open dataset resulting from a 14-year data collection effort in a subcatchment of the Murrumbidgee catchment in New South Wales, Australia. Over a 14-year period a series of different sampling campaigns has resulted in a large dataset with hydrogeochemical data which includes both in-situ (field) data and post laboratory analysis of major anions and cations. This data is augmented with observed groundwater levels and publicly available streamflow and climate data. The data set covers 23 groundwater sample sites and 39 surface water sites. Because the data was collected by four distinct groups and over many years, we analyse to see if this has caused a bias in the dataset. In addition, we show the major spatial and temporal trends to provide an overview of the dataset. The dataset is made open access to encourage further research and the current paper shows the richness of the collected data and opportunities for further research."

A latent diffusion model to mimic kilometer-scale COSMO5.0_CLM9 simulations,"High-resolution weather data are crucial for many applications, typically generated via resource-intensive numerical models through dynamical downscaling. We developed an AI model using latent diffusion models (LDMs) to mimic this process, increasing weather data resolution over Italy from 25 to 2 km. LDM outperforms other methods, accurately capturing local patterns and extreme events. This approach offers a cost-effective alternative, with potential disruptive application in climate sciences. 
 Downscaling based on deep learning (DL) is a key application in Earth system modeling, enabling the generation of high-resolution fields from coarse numerical simulations at reduced computational costs compared to traditional regional models. Additionally, generative DL models can potentially provide uncertainty quantification through ensemble-like scenario generation, a task prohibitive for conventional numerical approaches. In this study, we apply a latent diffusion model (LDM) to demonstrate that recent advancements in generative modeling enable DL to deliver results comparable to those of numerical dynamical models, given the same input data, preserving the realism of fine-scale features and flow characteristics at reduced computational costs. We apply our LDM to downscale ERA5 data over Italy up to a resolution of 2 km. The high-resolution target data consist of 2 m temperature and 10 m horizontal wind components from a dynamical downscaling performed with COSMO-CLM. A selection of predictors from ERA5 is used as input, and a residual approach against a reference U-Net is leveraged in applying the LDM. The performance of the generative LDM is compared with reference baselines of increasing complexity: a quadratic interpolation of ERA5, a U-Net, and a generative adversarial network (GAN) built on the same reference U-Net. Results highlight the improvements introduced by the LDM architecture combined with the residual approach, outperforming all the baselines in terms of spatial error, frequency distributions, and power spectra. These findings point out the potential of LDMs as cost-effective, robust alternatives for downscaling applications (e.g., downscaling of climate projections), where computational resources are limited but high-resolution data are critical."

Here, we report our findings demonstrating the existence of an inverse relationship between ε and the spectral slope (S) in the absorption spectra of chromophoric DOM (CDOM). Specifically, ε values at 275 and 380 nm are directly proportional to the square of the root-mean-square width of the Gaussian peak (W2) located at 4.80 eV (258 nm) and 3.79 eV (327 nm), and W2 is inversely proportional to the values of S of the right half of log-transformed spectra of the Gaussian peak with respect to wavelength, corresponding to S at 275–295 and 380–443 nm in spectra, respectively. This finding expands the applicability and utility of the BLB Law to uniformly quantify DOC concentrations in inland, coastal, and pelagic waters (30–3000 μmol·L–1, n = 7745, R2 = 0.97). Furthermore, the relationship between ε and S aids in interpreting the absorbance spectra of DOM, providing valuable insights into its composition and properties.

Despite this, the mechanisms underlying the toxicity of CdS-NPs remain unclear. A key question is whether their toxicity arises from the nanoparticulate form of cadmium (Cd) or from the release of Cd2+. To explore this, we exposed freshwater clams (Corbicula fluminea) to environmentally relevant concentrations (0.01–1 mg/L) of CdS-NPs or Cd2+ for 10 days. Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining revealed significant damage to the digestive gland in both cases. Although CdS-NPs released some Cd2+ (≤10.4%), transcriptomic and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analyses indicated different toxicity mechanisms. CdS-NPs primarily induce ferroptosis, triggered by lysosomal dysfunction that releases Fe2+ into the cytoplasm, disrupting the cellular iron metabolism. In contrast, Cd2+ primarily induces an autophagic response, as evidenced by the upregulation of autophagy-related markers and activation of apoptosis pathways linked to mitochondrial membrane permeabilization. Overall, our findings suggest that the toxicity of CdS-NPs is not solely derived from Cd2+, highlighting the need to evaluate the risks posed by metal sulfide nanoparticles to benthic ecosystems."

Through application of a time-dependent kinetic model, the molecular growth factor (GF) associated with SOM formation is determined. GF is defined as the fraction of the oxidation products from a biogenic precursor that contribute to seed particle growth. Two seed particle compositions (ammonium sulfate and ammonium bisulfate) are studied under two phase states (effloresced and deliquesced at either 10% or 60% relative humidity) for growth by two different biogenic precursors (isoprene and α-pinene). The results show: (1) ammonium sulfate seed particles give higher GFs than ammonium bisulfate seed particles, (2) increasing the water content of the seed particle increases the GF, and (3) isoprene and α-pinene show the same dependencies of GF on seed particle composition and water content. These dependencies suggest that physicochemical processes in the aqueous layer at or near the air–particle interface enhance the growth rate of particles in the 40 to 80 nm size range, which is relevant to the formation of cloud condensation nuclei."

Schnitzler,Multiphase Processing of the Water-Soluble and Insoluble Phases of Biomass Burning Organic Aerosol,"Biomass burning is one of the most significant sources of organic aerosol in the atmosphere. Biomass burning organic aerosol (BBOA) has been observed to undergo liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) to give core–shell morphology with the hydrophobic phase encapsulating the hydrophilic phase, potentially impacting the evolution of light-absorbing components, i.e., brown carbon (BrC), through multiphase processes. Here, we demonstrate how multiphase processing differs between the water-soluble (i.e., hydrophilic) and insoluble (i.e., hydrophobic) phases of BBOA in terms of reactive uptake of ozone in a coated-wall flow tube. Effects of relative humidity (RH) and ultraviolet (UV) irradiation were investigated. Experimental timeseries were used to inform simulations using multilayer kinetic modeling. Among non-irradiated thin films, the uptake coefficient was greatest for the water-soluble phase at 75% RH (3 × 10–5, corresponding to a diffusion coefficient of BrC, DBrC, of 3 × 10–9 cm2 s–1) and least for the same phase at 0% RH (1 × 10–5, corresponding to DBrC of 1 × 10–10 cm2 s–1). The uptake coefficient for the water-insoluble phase fell between these two (about 1.5 × 10–5), regardless of RH, and the corresponding DBrC increased only slightly (8 × 10–10 cm2 s–1 at 0% RH to 9 × 10–10 cm2 s–1 at 75% RH). The uptake coefficients of both phases at 0% RH decreased significantly after UV irradiation, consistent with a transition from viscous liquid to solid and supported by qualitative microscopy observations. Modeling multiphase ozone oxidation of primary BrC components in the atmosphere demonstrated, first, that LLPS may extend the lifetime of water-soluble BBOA encapsulated by water-insoluble species by a factor of 1.5 at moderate to high RH and, also, that UV irradiation may extend the lifetime of both phases by more than a factor of 2.5."

10.1029/2024GL113301,False,Geophysical Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注欧亚大陆和北美之间冬季地表气温的季节内联系，探讨了两个地区主要温度模式之间的关联性以及潜在的动力学过程。研究结果表明，两个地区之间存在微弱但稳定的联系，北美地区的反相位温度异常出现在欧亚大陆温度异常之后约一周，这受到对流层和平流层中波传播的影响。相反，北美地区温度异常之后约一周，欧亚大陆中部出现同相位温度异常，这主要由对流层中类似斯堪的纳维亚的模式驱动。这些关系有时会重叠，形成中高纬度地区的一系列温度变化，与平流层-对流层耦合过程密切相关。该研究旨在更全面地理解冬季季节内温度变化。因此，该论文主要关注气象学和气候动力学，与大气环境遥感技术（如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析）没有直接关联。,"['Eurasia', 'North America', 'Winter Surface Air Temperature', 'Intraseasonal Variability', 'Troposphere', 'Stratosphere', 'Wave Propagation']",Xiaocen Shen;Lin Wang;Adam A. Scaife;Steven C. Hardiman,Intraseasonal Linkages of Winter Surface Air Temperature Between Eurasia and North America,"Wintertime temperature extremes sometimes show a continental linkage between Eurasia and North America (NA), but whether these connections are coincidental or dynamically robust remains unclear. This study investigates the linkages of the leading intraseasonal temperature patterns between Eurasia and NA, focusing on the underlying dynamic processes. Our findings reveal a weak but robust linkage between the dominant patterns in both regions. Specifically, an opposite‐phase temperature anomaly in NA occurs about 1 week after a Eurasian temperature anomaly, influenced by wave propagation in both the troposphere and stratosphere. Conversely, a same‐phase temperature anomaly appears over central Eurasia approximately 1 week after a North American temperature anomaly, primarily driven by a Scandinavian‐like pattern in the troposphere. These relationships sometimes overlap, forming a sequence of temperature changes across mid‐high latitudes, closely tied to the stratosphere‐troposphere coupling process. The findings provide new insights for a more comprehensive understanding of wintertime intraseasonal temperature variability."

This event caused the inner edge of the ring current to penetrate deeply into the inner magnetosphere during the main phase of the storm. We present observations of high‐frequency electromagnetic ion cyclotron (HF EMIC) wave activity during this intense geomagnetic storm using data from the Arase satellite. Arase observations showed that HF EMIC waves with frequencies of 5–36 Hz at L ∼ 2, occurred mainly during the main and early‐recovery phases. The minimum resonance energy of energetic protons and relativistic electrons associated with HF EMIC waves suggests their potential to cause the loss of relativistic electrons in the low L‐shell region. Our observations provide new insights into the generation of EMIC waves and the dynamics of energetic particles at low L‐shells in the inner magnetosphere."

Current ε parameterizations, which are based on droplet number concentration or simply set as constants, are inadequate to satisfy the demand. This study shows, utilizing in‐situ cloud and fog observations from five underlying surface regions (urban, suburban, mountainous, coastal and rainforest) of China, that ε uniformly and stably manifests as initially increasing then decreasing as volume‐mean diameter increases across these regions. Based on this relationship, a ε parameterization is established, which exhibits improved predictive capabilities in evaluating both cloud albedo effect and cloud lifetime effect. The parameterization is expected to enhance cloud simulation accuracy and minimize discrepancy between observed and simulated cloud radiation and precipitation, particularly for weather and climate models that commonly use the double‐moment cloud microphysical schemes."

Using data from previously published MCB simulations, we use the Community Earth System Model (CESM2) to simulate MCB deployments over regions which expand with time to limit global warming to 1.5°C in the SSP2‐4.5 scenario, and we design a feedback control algorithm to determine the scope of intervention each year. Our methodology is able to control global mean temperature in this way, but controlling global mean temperature does not by itself mitigate regional impacts common to tropical MCB; additionally, the algorithm takes longer than intended to converge, indicating room for future improvement."

Herein, we describe the use of catechol and boronic acid chemistry to design a self-crosslinkable hydrogel-based MN that stimulates the release of Z-GCN during hypoglycemia. In this design, the catechol groups bind to Z-GCN through metal-ligand complexation. At hyperglycemia, boronic acids react with glucose to generate cyclic boronate esters. As the glucose concentration decreases, the boronic acid groups dissociate and are favored over Z-GCN in binding with catechol, which promotes the release of Z-GCN. We fully characterize the fabricated MN in vitro. Moreover, we further evaluate the MN and demonstrate the in vivo glucose-responsive delivery of Z-GCN from the patch. We also show its effectiveness in preventing hypoglycemia for up to 6 h in type 1 diabetic male rats against two consecutive insulin overdose challenges. Since many proteins/peptides have a high binding affinity to metal ions, the introduced mechanism driven by the competitive binding of catechol-metal ions has great implications in drug delivery applications of various protein/peptide-based therapeutics. Hypoglycemia is a serious and potentially life-threatening condition for people with insulin dependent diabetes, but preventative hypoglycemia therapies are elusive. Here, the authors report the use of catechol and boronic acid chemistry to design a self-crosslinkable hydrogel-based microneedle patch that delivers Zinc-Glucagon at low glucose levels and prevents insulin-induced hypoglycemia."

 In murine models of visceral leishmaniasis (VL), the parasitization of resident Kupffer cells (resKCs) drives early Leishmania infantum growth in the liver, leading to granuloma formation and subsequent parasite control. Using the chronic VL model, we demonstrate that polyclonal resKCs redistributed to form granulomas outside the sinusoids, creating an open sinusoidal niche that was gradually repopulated by monocyte-derived KCs (moKCs) acquiring a tissue specific, homeostatic profile. Early-stage granulomas predominantly consisted of CLEC4F+KCs. In contrast, late-stage granulomas led to remodeling of the sinusoidal network and contained monocyte-derived macrophages (momacs) along with KCs that downregulated CLEC4F, with both populations expressing iNOS and pro-inflammatory chemokines. During late-stage infection, parasites were largely confined to CLEC4F-KCs. Reduced monocyte recruitment and increased resKCs proliferation in infected Ccr2−/− mice impaired parasite control. These findings show that the ontogenic heterogeneity of granuloma macrophages is closely linked to granuloma maturation and the development of hepatic immunity in VL.

 Governments worldwide have pledged to reduce antimicrobial use in the agri-food system. This study projects global livestock antibiotic use quantities through 2040 under various scenarios. This work indicates that under a business-as-usual scenario, global antibiotic use could reach ~143,481 tons by 2040, representing a 29.5% increase from the 2019 baseline of ~110,777 tons. However, alternative scenarios suggest that these projections could vary by +14.2% to -56.8%, depending on changes in livestock biomass and antibiotic use intensity. A key contribution of this research is the development of the Livestock Biomass Conversion method, a novel indicator offering improved accuracy in estimating livestock biomass. The findings have important policy implications, highlighting that meaningful reductions in antibiotic use quantity can only be achieved through coordinated efforts targeting both antibiotic use intensity and livestock biomass.

 The size and attribution of the regional net carbon flux from land-use change (LUC) activities (ELUC) are often highly debated, especially in regions such as China, which has experienced decades-long extensive reforestation activities. Here, using a LUC dataset incorporating remote-sensing and national forest inventory data with two modelling approaches, we show that ELUC in China shifted from a carbon source to a sink in the 1990s, contributing to a net cumulative CO2 removal of 2.0 Pg C during 1981–2020. From 2001 to 2020, the average ELUC was −0.14 Pg C yr−1, accounting for over one-third of the national land carbon sinks. Forest-related LUC activities contributed greatly to national carbon fluxes, while non-forest-related activities played a dominant role in certain areas. Our findings suggest that the carbon sinks from LUC activities in China may be largely underestimated in global assessments, underscoring the need to develop region-specific modelling for evaluation and potential regulation.

 Electrocatalytic two-electron oxygen reduction reaction (2e− ORR) in seawater offers a sustainable route for hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) production. However, due to the high concentration of Cl− ions and competitive 4e− ORR, there is a lack of efficient and long-term stable seawater electrocatalysts. Here we report a high-performance electrocatalyst design based on NiPS3 nanosheets enabling efficient H2O2 production from seawater. Specifically, the NiPS3 nanosheets deliver a 2e− ORR selectivity of ∼98%, a H2O2 yield of 6.0 mol gcat−1 h−1 and robust stability for over 1,000 h in simulated seawater. Underlying the exciting performance is the synergy of the S2−, Ni2+ and P4+ sites where the octahedral S2− skeleton repels Cl− ions, the Ni2+ sites enable the modest binding strength of *OOH intermediate, and the P4+ sites interact with H2O to trigger the protonation of proximal O atom of *OOH. The seawater electrocatalysis system also allows for scalable synthesis of solid H2O2, tandem oxidation reaction of biomass to organic acid and direct use of the produced H2O2 as a sterilizing agent. Once integrated with photovoltaics, the solar-powered electrolysis device can operate in real seawater. Our findings pave the way for sustainable conversion of seawater into value-added products.

Thackeray;Alex Hall,Uncertainty of 21st Century western U.S. snowfall loss derived from regional climate model large ensemble,"Uncertainty of 21st Century western U.S. snowfall loss derived from regional climate model large ensemble 
 The western United States is dependent on winter snowfall over its major mountain ranges, which gradually melts each year, serving as a natural reservoir for water resources. In a future warmer climate, much of this snowfall could be replaced by rain, making it more challenging to capture and store water. In this study, we utilize an ensemble of dynamically downscaled simulations forced by 14 global climate models (GCMs). These GCMs project wildly different futures, in terms of both temperature and precipitation change, producing significant uncertainty in snowfall projections. Here we exploit the robust statistics of the downscaled ensemble, and diagose the sensitivity of end-of-century snowfall loss across the region to both warming and regional wetting/drying in the driving GCM. The windward slopes of the Sierra Nevada and Cascades are particularly sensitive to warming (losing ~ 15% annual snowfall per degree warming), with little influence of precipitation. By contrast, snowfall loss in the inter-mountain west is less sensitive to warming (~ 5% K−1), but is significantly offset/exacerbated by precipitation changes (~ 0.5% snow per 1% precipitation). Combining such sensitivities with the warming and regional precipitation signals in the full CMIP6 ensemble, we can fully quantify likely snowfall loss and its uncertainty at any location, for any emissions scenario. We find that the western U.S. as a whole will lose 34 ± 8% of its total volumetric snowfall by end-of-century under the high-emissions SSP3-7.0 scenario, but 25 ± 6% and 17 ± 6% under the lower-emissions SSP2-4.5 and SSP1-2.6 scenarios."

 The 2023/24 El Niño commenced with an exceptionally large warm water volume in the equatorial western Pacific, comparable to the extreme 1997/98 and 2015/16 events, but did not develop into a super El Niño. This study highlights the critical role of contrasting Northern Pacific Meridional Mode (NPMM) conditions in this divergence. Warm NPMM conditions during the 1997/98 and 2015/16 events created a positive zonal sea surface temperature (SST) gradient in the equatorial western-central Pacific and enhanced Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO) propagation, driving sustained westerly wind bursts (WWBs) and downwelling Kelvin waves that intensified both events. In contrast, the cold NPMM during 2023/24 induced a negative SST gradient and suppressed MJO activity, resulting in weaker WWBs and limited eastward wave activity, preventing the event from reaching super El Niño intensity. A 2,200-year CESM1 pre-industrial simulation corroborates these observational findings, underscoring the importance of NPMM interference in improving El Niño intensity predictions."

 Warmer sea surface temperatures (SSTs) increase evaporation, convection, and latent heat release in the atmosphere, which favors tropical cyclone (TC) intensification and ultimately leads to stronger storms. However, in this study, we find that the intensity of TCs in the western North Pacific, called typhoons, is on average higher in the colder autumn season than during the warmer summer season. The primary reason for this is that despite the decrease in SSTs during autumn, the deepening of the ocean mixed layer increase the TC heat potential and reduces storm-induced SST cooling. Atmospheric thermodynamic conditions also become more favorable to TC intensification in autumn than in summer due to higher heat and sensible heat fluxes in autumn resulting from the increased air-sea temperature/moist differences at the interface. Lastly, during autumn, the TC’s track shifts towards the equator as a result the TCs in this season travel over more favourable ocean condition which also contribute in the TC intensification. This finding will enhance the understanding of the mechanisms causing seasonal differences in TC intensity, which will aid in TC seasonal forecasting and risk assessment."

 The spectral invariants theory (p-theory) has received much attention in the field of quantitative remote sensing over the past few decades and has been adopted for modeling of canopy solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF). However, the spectral invariant properties (SIP) in simple analytical formulae have not been applied for modeling canopy fluorescence anisotropy primarily because they are parameterized in terms of leaf total scattering, which precludes the differentiation between forward and backward leaf SIF emissions. In this study, we have developed the canopy-SIP SIF model by combining geometric-optical (GO) theory to account for asymmetric leaf SIF forward and backward emissions at the first-order scattering and by modeling multiple scattering based on the p-theory, thus avoiding the dependence on radiative transfer models. The applicability of the model simulations especially over 3D heterogeneous canopies was improved by incorporating canopy structure through multi-angular clumping index, and by modeling single scattering from the four components of the scene in view according to the GO approach. The results show good consistency with both the state-of-the-art SIF models and multi-angular field SIF observations over grass and chickpea canopies. The coefficient of determination (R2) between the simulated SIF and field measurements was 0.75 (red) and 0.74 (far-red) for chickpea, and 0.65 (both red and far-red) for grass. The average relative error was approximately 3 % for 1D homogeneous scenes when comparing the canopy-SIP SIF model simulations to the SCOPE model simulations, and around 4 % for the 3D heterogeneous scene when comparing to the LESS model simulations. The results indicate that the proposed approach for separating asymmetric leaf SIF emissions is a robust way to keep a balance between satisfactory simulation accuracy and efficiency. Model simulations suggest that neglecting the leaf SIF asymmetry can lead to an underestimation of canopy red SIF by 6.3 % to 42.6 % for various leaf biochemical and canopy structural parameters. This study presents a simple but efficient analytical approach for canopy fluorescence modeling, with potential for large-scale canopy fluorescence simulations."

 Mangrove canopy height (MCH) is a critical indicator used to evaluate blue carbon sequestration and biodiversity conservation. However, mapping MCH is challenging because of the dense tree canopy and fluctuating tide conditions. To solve the issue, this study developed a novel approach to retrieve MCH by training a robust XGBoost regression model using UAV-LiDAR, SDGSAT-1, and time series Sentinel-1 SAR and Sentinel-2 MultiSpectral Instrument imagery. The approach was applied to mangrove forests along China's coast. The study resulted in a 10 m resolution MCH map and so named China's mangrove canopy height (CMCH). The accuracy of CMCH was assessed using in-situ and UAV-LiDAR data, achieving an R2 of 0.84 and an RMSE of 1.19 m. Band 6 from SDGSAT-1, the only available 10 m resolution red edge spectral band of current available satellite data, was identified as the most crucial feature for predicting MCH. After analyzing the geographic characteristics of CMCH at species level, we had three innovative and quantitative discoveries. Firstly, the mean height of mangrove forests in China was 6.0 m, significantly lower than the global average of 12.7 m. Secondly, the height of mangrove forests in China was found to decrease with increasing latitude.

The resultant CMCH map and species-level findings provide essential information for managing mangrove ecosystems in China. The technical methodology employed has the potential to be expanded globally, thereby enhancing the execution of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals related to coastal and marine ecosystems.

 Accurately estimating snow water equivalent (SWE) in near-real-time is important for water resources management and water supply forecasting in snow-dominant regions. However, conventional SWE estimation approaches have large uncertainties in mountainous regions due to complex terrain, snow-vegetation interactions, and other challenging factors. This study develops a SWE bias correction framework (SWE-BCF) that utilizes the Airborne Snow Observatories (ASO) SWE data and machine learning (ML) algorithms to correct biases in a near-real-time SWE estimation linear regression model (LRM). The spatial distribution of LRM SWE residuals, which are estimated using the ASO SWE, is explicitly modeled using multiple ML algorithms and evaluated using a leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV) workflow. A wide range of commonly used ML algorithms is examined to model LRM SWE residuals, including Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Bayesian Regularized Neural Networks (BRNN), Random Forest (RF), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that all ML algorithms substantially improve LRM SWE estimation accuracy. While the Kruskal-Wallis test indicates no significant difference (p-value >0.05) among the bias correction models, the RF model outperforms others, with the highest median R2 (0.89), the lowest median RMSE (69 mm), MAE (41 mm), and NRMSE (37.4 %), as well as the second-best median PBIAS (−6.6 %) in the LOOCV for correcting SWE bias. Four performance metrics (R2, MAE, RMSE, NRMSE) show significant improvements (p-value <0.05) over the original LRM model, highlighting the effectiveness of SWE-BCF in correcting the spatial patterns of SWE. However, the correction in the basin-wide average SWE, as indicated by the PBIAS values, exhibits high variance and does not show significant improvement (p-value >0.05). Among the three land cover types in the Upper Tuolumne River Basin, the alpine area showed the most substantial SWE improvements with the SWE-BCF. The structural adaptability of the SWE-BCF enables its transferability to various geographic locations and SWE datasets, allowing for an extension of coverage and frequency of more accurate SWE estimates. This potential advancement may improve water management decisions which rely on accurate water supply forecasts."

 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has garnered attention due to its outstanding performance in multisource remote sensing (RS) image classification. However, classical CNN-based methods primarily concentrate on information within a fixed-size neighborhood and a standard square region, neglecting long-range and global information. As non-Euclidean data, the topological structure enables flexible construction of relationships between objects, which can be served as an effective carrier of global information. Graph Neural Network (GNN), capable of extracting features from the topological structure, is considered as a solution for capturing global information. Nevertheless, GNN faces challenges as the manually defined static graph structure might not accurately capture the complexity of the data. We propose a double dual dynamic graph neural network (D3GNN) with dynamic topological structure refinement for multisource RS data classification. D3GNN generates multiple topological structures to achieve a comprehensive perception of scene features by utilizing local spatial information and distinctive data from various sources. Given the characteristics of heterogeneous-structure data, D3GNN implements targeted topological structure remodeling and refinement to overcome the limitations imposed by static graph, thereby enabling the network to generate feature embeddings with enhanced discriminative power. The experimental results show that D3GNN achieves superior performance compared to other current methods."

The accuracy of the simulation model was validated, demonstrating its practical applicability under specific conditions. •The correlation between vessel wake temperature characteristics and sailing speed was validated using numerical simulation models and on-orbit data sets in this study. This creates the potential for inverting vessel speed information from thermal infrared images. 
 The movement of a vessel generates cold and warm wake patterns with temperature gradients on the sea surface, which provide detection possibilities for satellite-based infrared detection systems. This work analyzes the temporal characteristics of ship wake dissipation on the sea surface, based on multi-source data from low Earth orbit satellite thermal infrared imaging, Automatic Identification System (AIS) data, and numerical simulation results, revealing the dynamic information contained within the thermal wake. The temperature images of sea surface thermal wakes generated by vessels at different speeds were obtained using numerical simulation methods. The thermal infrared characteristics of the surface vessel wakes were verified using images from the thermal imaging spectrometer aboard the SDGSAT-1 satellite. The simulation results reveal the patterns of generation, diffusion, and attenuation of the infrared thermal wake produced by moving vessels in the ocean. By combining simulations with infrared images from the SDGSAT-1 satellite, the thermal infrared temperature characteristics of wakes on the sea surface are summarized. This method overcomes the limitations of traditional optical monitoring techniques at night, while capturing more information on sea surface temperature variations. By deeply exploring sea surface thermal signature data, this paper provides technical support for all-weather vessel speed inversion using single-satellite data."

 Accurate and effective coastal wetland classification using hyperspectral remote sensing technology is crucial for their conservation, restoration, and sustainable development. However, the large scale variance of land covers in complex wetland scenes poses challenges for existing methods and leads to misclassifications. Additionally, existing methods encounter difficulties in practical wetland classification tasks due to the high cost of hyperspectral wetland data labeling. This paper introduces SAM-CTMapper, a coastal wetland classification framework that incorporates a scale-aware mixed CNN-Transformer (CTMapper) to precisely identify wetland cover types using hyperspectral images, and the advanced segment anything model (SAM) to save labor costs in data labeling. Specifically, a novel scale-aware mixed CNN-Transformer layer is designed in CTMapper to effectively leverage local and long-range spectral–spatial features from the whole HSI to reduce misclassification. This layer comprises a multi-head scale-aware convolution layer to capture local land-cover details, a multi-head superpixel self-attention layer for extracting long-range contextual features, and a dynamic selective module to facilitate effective aggregation of local and long-range information. Additionally, we devise a SAM-based semi-automatic labeling strategy to construct two PRISMA hyperspectral wetland (PRISMA-HW) datasets over Liaoning Shuangtai and Shanghai Chongming for evaluation purposes. Experimental results on two PRISMA-HW datasets and two publicly available hyperspectral wetland datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of CTMapper method in terms of both accuracy metrics and visual quality. For the sake of reproducibility, the PRISMA-HW datasets and the related codes of SAM-CTMapper framework will be open-sourced at: https://github.com/immortal13."

 The sublimation of snow has a major impact on the global climate. We present a simple empirical formula that allows snow sublimation to be quantified on the interannual scale in the Altai Mountains. This empirical formula is based on the fitting of measured temperature and snow water equivalent (SWE) data for midwinter collected between 2011 and 2018 at the Koktokay snow station, located at the outlet of the Kayiertesi River Basin. The results suggest that there is a best-fitting linear relationship (r = −0.98; p < 0.001) between the temperature and snow sublimation rates. The low sublimation rate, which was only 0.2 mm day−1, corresponded to a low air temperature and high relative humidity, and the sublimation loss accounted for 2.6 % and 5.6 % of the annual precipitation and snowfall, respectively. Based on the proposed empirical formula and the hourly meteorological data from the ERA5 Land reanalysis, we calculated the sublimation rate in the Irtysh River Basin from 2011 to 2018. The results reveal that the cumulative snow sublimation loss was 14.3 mm y−1, comprising 8.2 % of the snowfall and 3.9 % of the annual precipitation. Due to the relative ease of collecting field observations of the temperature and SWE, this simple formula, which has a high level of goodness of fit, is more applicable to the study of issues related to snow mass balance over long time scales in the Altai Mountains, and it also provides support for local snowmelt flood warning and water resource management."
