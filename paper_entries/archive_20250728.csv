10.5194/essd-17-2985-2025,True,Earth System Science Data,该研究论文主要关注利用多卫星遥感数据构建全球湿地范围动态数据集，用于甲烷排放建模。虽然重点是地表水域和湿地，但甲烷是一种重要的温室气体，因此该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。通过卫星观测湿地范围，可以估算甲烷排放量，从而分析大气成分变化，并为气候变化研究提供数据支持。该研究使用了多种遥感数据和现有湿地数据库，创建了一个综合性的数据集，可用于改进大气甲烷排放模型的准确性。,"['methane emissions', 'wetlands', 'satellite data', 'global inundation extent', 'greenhouse gas', 'remote sensing', 'atmospheric composition']",Juliette Bernard;Catherine Prigent;Carlos Jimenez;Etienne Fluet-Chouinard;Bernhard Lehner;Elodie Salmon;Philippe Ciais;Zhen Zhang;Shushi Peng;Marielle Saunois,The GIEMS-MethaneCentric database: a dynamic and comprehensive global product of methane-emitting aquatic areas,"Wetlands are responsible for about a third of global emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. We have developed the Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites-MethaneCentric (GIEMS-MC) dataset to represent the dynamics of wetland extent on a global scale (0.25° × 0.25° resolution, monthly time step). This updated resource combines satellite data and existing wetland databases, covering 1992 to 2020. Consistent maps of other methane-emitting surface waters (lakes, rivers, reservoirs, rice paddies) are also provided. 
 The Global Inundation Extent from Multi-Satellites (GIEMS) database first published in 2001 was a key advance toward the accurate representation of wetlands globally by providing dynamic time series of global surface water based on passive microwave observations. This study supplements the second version of GIEMS (GIEMS-2) with other datasets to produce GIEMS-MethaneCentric (GIEMS-MC), a dynamically mapped dataset of methane-emitting waterlogged and inundated ecosystems. We separated open water from wetlands in GIEMS-MC by using the Global Lakes and Wetlands Database version 2 (GLWDv2) while adding unsaturated peatland areas undetected by GIEMS-2. Rice paddies are identified using the Monthly Irrigated and Rainfed Crop Areas (MIRCA2000) product. A specific coastal zone filtering is applied to avoid ocean artifacts while preserving coastal wetlands. GIEMS-MC covers the period 1992–2020 on a monthly scale at 0.25° × 0.25° spatial resolution. The GIEMS-MC product includes two layers of monthly wetland time series – one for flooded and saturated wetlands and another for all wetlands and peatlands – together with seven layers of compatible static maps of open water bodies (lakes, rivers, reservoirs) and seasonal rice paddy maps used in its production. The dominant vegetation and wetland types per pixel are also provided in GIEMS-MC variables. GIEMS-MC is compared to Wetland Area and Dynamics for Methane Modelling (WAD2M), a dataset providing dynamic wetland information. In terms of wetland extent, all wetlands and peatlands in  GIEMS-MC and WAD2M show similar results, with a mean annual maximum of 7.7 Mkm2 for GIEMS-MC and 6.8 Mkm2 for WAD2M, with similar spatial patterns in most regions. The GIEMS-MC seamless time series represents a significant advance in wetland representation for methane modelling, although limitations remain in the accurate identification of rice, coastal, and peatland areas.

Champion;Megan K. MacDonald;Brittany Thomas;Sarat Chandra Bantupalli;Eben D. Thoma,Methane Sensor Characterization Using Colocated Ambient Comparisons and Simulated Emission Challenges,"Methane sensing technologies have wide applications, including leak detection and repair in the energy sector and emissions monitoring from landfills and agriculture. Lower-cost units, as opposed to reference-grade instrumentation, may be deployed in many forms (e.g., sensor networks, unmanned aerial vehicles, and mobile monitoring) and allow vastly improved spatial and temporal data resolution owing to their scalability. Ultimately, early detection of unexpected emissions enabled by lower-cost sensing technologies provides industry with rapid operational feedback, allowing for emission reductions and improved process control. The expanded use of such technologies allows for consolidation and resolution of “bottom-up” emission inventories with results using emerging “top-down” techniques (e.g., satellite measurements), thereby improving emissions management on many scales. Here, we introduce a novel testing method to assess four leading commercial methane monitoring technologies that employ three distinct working principles: metal oxide (MOx) conductometry, tunable diode laser (TDL) spectrometry, and photoacoustic spectrometry (PAS). We assess both nominal baseline performance and sensor response using ambient measurements and controlled release experiments, respectively. We observe the PAS technology to provide the lowest baseline signal noise (and therefore the lowest detection limit), followed by TDL and MOx. We also observe PAS to have the highest agreement with reference instrumentation during simulated emission plume events (with TDL and MOx technologies generally trailing in accuracy). Outcomes of this work include guidance for researchers and practitioners seeking to better understand the best available commercial methane sensor technology. Analysis approaches employed here may also be applied to many other low-cost gas sensing technologies."
10.1038/s43247-025-02499-4,True,Communications Earth & Environment,该研究论文探讨了南极涡旋中氯过氧化物与氯化氢之间的异相反应，以及次氯酸的汇对氯化氢消耗的影响。通过改进化学机制，该模型能更好地模拟极地涡旋平流层中多种氯化合物的浓度，并提高了臭氧柱的消耗模拟结果。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术，但它关注大气成分（如氯化氢、臭氧）的变化，这些成分通常通过卫星观测等遥感手段进行监测。因此，该研究与大气环境遥感技术间接相关，尤其是在空气质量监测和大气成分分析方面。,"['Antarctic vortex', 'ozone depletion', 'hydrogen chloride', 'chlorine peroxide', 'hypochlorous acid', 'atmospheric composition', 'chemical mechanism', 'stratosphere', 'air quality monitoring (indirectly)']",Jens-Uwe Grooß;Rolf Müller;John N.

 It is well established that the drastic ozone loss in the Antarctic stratosphere, commonly known as the ozone hole, is primarily driven by gas-phase and heterogeneous chemical processes. While chemistry transport models generally reproduce observed ozone depletion well, they fail to capture the rapid early-winter decline of hydrogen chloride. We here examine the impact of the heterogeneous reaction between chlorine peroxide and hydrogen chloride forming HOOCl, followed by its photolysis. Incorporating this reaction and an additional hypochlorous acid loss pathway into a chemical mechanism significantly improves model agreement with observed levels of several chlorine compounds in the lower polar vortex stratosphere. This revised mechanism increases simulated ozone partial column depletion by over 15% between early July and mid-September 2011. Laboratory confirmation of these proposed reactions is needed to validate the mechanism. The heterogeneous reaction between chlorine peroxide and hydrogen chloride, along with a hypochlorous acid sink, can better reproduce hydrogen chloride depletion at the beginning of the polar winter, according to simulations of the Antarctic vortex."
10.1016/j.jag.2025.104687,True,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,该研究论文的标题和摘要明确表明其与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。该研究结合了InSAR相干性和卫星观测的空气质量数据，以研究战争对空气质量的影响。论文关注了多种空气质量指标（如PM2.5、NO2等）的变化，并利用遥感技术监测和分析了战争期间的空气污染情况。研究结果强调了在冲突地区实施环境政策和进行高分辨率卫星监测的必要性。,"['air quality monitoring', 'satellite observations', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'InSAR coherence', 'air pollution indicators (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3, HCHO, CH4, CO, UVAI)', 'remote sensing', 'war-related air pollution']",Bahaa Mohamadi;Mohamed O. Abu Ghazala;Huxiong Li;Tamer A. Al-Sabbagh;Ali Younes,Integrating InSAR coherence and air pollution detection satellites to study the impact of war on air quality,"•Integrating InSAR coherence with optical RS data to study wars impact on air quality. •We correlate coherence to eight air quality indicators during the war in Gaza. •Coherence timeseries benefits spatio-temporal war-related air pollution monitoring. •Different air quality impacts from air strikes and land invasions were correlated. 
 Wars profoundly affect air quality due to infrastructure loss, military activities, and population displacement; nevertheless, limited studies have thoroughly examined these impacts by remote sensing, with most offering broad evaluations lacking geographical correlation to particular damage. This study presents a novel method that combines Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) coherence change detection (CCD) with air quality data from satellites to examine the environmental effects of military actions. In this study, InSAR CCD was utilized to detect damaged areas during military operations. Focusing on the war in the Palestinian Gaza Strip following the 7 October 2023 attacks, the research investigates changes in key air quality indicators (PM2.5, NO2, SO2, O3, HCHO, CH4, CO, and UVAI) over the first six months of conflict. Air pollution levels during the war were compared to the same period in the previous year to identify wartime-related shifts. Information from InSAR coherence was collected during the six months of war and compared to the air quality data by segmenting the study time into 18 different periods. Results reveal distinct shifts in pollutant correlations with coherence, indicating war-induced environmental degradation. PM2.5 and CO exhibited a reversal from positive to negative correlations post-conflict onset (Pearson’s r: +0.122 to −0.195 and +0.089 to −0.118, respectively), linking destruction to increased particulate and carbon monoxide emissions. CH4 and HCHO correlations similarly inverted after Israel’s full-scale land invasion (Kendall’s τ: +0.125 to −0.096 and +0.062 to −0.080, respectively). Geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis, used for spatiotemporal analysis, pinpointed pollution hotspots that corresponded with the operational phases of the IDF. This study advances conflict-environment research by coupling InSAR coherence with air quality dynamics, offering a replicable framework for wartime pollution assessment. Findings emphasize the need to implement conflict-sensitive environmental policies and open-source high-resolution satellite monitoring in war zones."
10.1016/j.jag.2025.104699,True,International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation,该研究论文主要关注利用近红外和热红外遥感技术反演全天候可降水量（PWV），属于大气环境遥感技术领域。论文提出了一种新的算法，该算法结合了Sentinel-3B卫星上的OLCI和SLSTR仪器的数据，能够在晴空和多云条件下高精度地反演PWV。该研究对于提高卫星观测水汽数据的质量，以及更全面地了解大气成分和水循环过程具有重要意义。,"['precipitable water vapor', 'remote sensing', 'near-infrared', 'thermal infrared', 'satellite observations', 'Sentinel-3B', 'OLCI', 'SLSTR', 'all-weather retrieval', 'atmospheric composition']",Zheng Du;Bao Zhang;Yibin Yao;Qingzhi Zhao;Chaoqian Xu;Qi Zhang;Hongming Li;Quanyu Chen,Retrieving all-weather precipitable water vapor using near-infrared and thermal infrared observations,"•An all-weather PWV retrieval algorithm that synergizes near-infrared and thermal infrared observations is proposed. •The new algorithm is efficient as it only requires Sentinel-3B observations. •The first traceable, observation-based PWV data with a 300 m resolution is generated. •The new algorithm notably improves the accuracy and spatial continuity of Sentinel-3B water vapor data. 
 Near-infrared (NIR) and thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing are primary methods for monitoring large-scale, high-resolution precipitable water vapor (PWV); however, their application is limited to clear-sky conditions. To overcome this limitation and enable all-weather PWV retrieval, this study develops a new satellite-based PWV retrieval model to derive all-weather PWV at a spatial resolution of 300 m based on the synergistic use of NIR and TIR data from the Ocean and Land Colour Instrument (OLCI) and Sea and Land Surface Temperature Radiometer (SLSTR) instruments onboard the Sentinel-3B satellite. The proposed model consists of two sub-models for PWV derivation: one each for clear- and cloudy-sky conditions. The clear-sky PWV retrieval model integrates water vapor information from both NIR and TIR observations, whereas the cloudy-sky PWV retrieval model uses cloud-top properties derived from TIR data to correct the NIR water vapor within or above the clouds to the ground. Tested against the GNSS PWV, the new model has a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 1.01 mm and bias of 0.09 mm for clear-sky conditions, representing a 51 % improvement in accuracy over the operational OLCI NIR products. For cloudy-sky conditions, the RMSE and bias are 2.66 mm and 0.02 mm, respectively, thereby filling the gap in high-quality PWV retrieval products under cloudy-sky conditions. The combined all-weather PWV product demonstrates robust spatiotemporal performance, with an RMSE and Bias of 1.92 mm and 0.16 mm, respectively. Given that the GNSS PWV has an accuracy of 1.37 mm, the accuracy achieved in this study is satisfactory."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121371,True,Atmospheric Environment,该研究论文主要关注使用深度学习模型预测大气中的元素碳（EC）和有机碳（OC）的浓度，这两种物质是PM2.5的重要组成部分。该模型结合了气象因素和其它污染物，以提高预测精度，并应用于实时空气质量预测。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究对象（大气成分）和应用方向（空气质量监测）与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为遥感数据可以用于验证和改进此类预测模型。,"['air quality monitoring', 'atmospheric composition analysis', 'PM2.5', 'elemental carbon (EC)', 'organic carbon (OC)', 'meteorological factors', 'co-pollutants', 'deep learning model', 'real-time air quality forecasting']",Tatenda Makoni;Shu-Qing Ding;Hong-Di He;Chun-Xia Lu;Wei-guo Wu,Prediction of elemental carbon and organic carbon using a hybrid deep learning model integrated temporal dependencies and meteorological features,"•Deep learning models improved R2by 24 % for OC, 23 % for EC with meteorological factors. •BiLSTM with attention mechanisms improves accuracy by integrating temporal dependencies. •Local emissions dominate OC and EC in winter, driven by traffic and industrial activities. •Enables real-time air quality forecasting, targeting pollution sources to improve public health. 
 Elemental Carbon (EC) and Organic Carbon (OC) are critical components of PM2.5, with significant implications for air quality and public health. Traditional prediction models often fail to capture the non-linear dynamics of EC and OC, particularly in urban environments with high traffic and industrial emissions. This study addresses this gap by proposing a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks with attention mechanisms to account for temporal dependencies, meteorological factors, and co-pollutants (PM2.5, O3). Using comprehensive air quality and meteorological data from Changshu City, we identify distinct diurnal and seasonal patterns of EC and OC, driven by traffic emissions, weather conditions, and secondary aerosol formation. The proposed model significantly outperforms traditional methods, achieving high prediction accuracy for both EC and OC concentrations. Key innovations include the integration of attention mechanisms to prioritize critical time steps and the incorporation of meteorological features and co-pollutants, which enhance the model's ability to capture complex pollutant interactions. The results demonstrate the model's robustness in real-time air quality forecasting, providing actionable insights for urban planning and pollution mitigation strategies. This research contributes to the field by offering a scalable and accurate tool for predicting EC and OC in dynamic urban environments, ultimately supporting efforts to improve public health and sustainable urban development."
10.1016/j.atmosenv.2025.121368,True,Atmospheric Environment,该研究论文主要关注化学工业园区中不同类型挥发性有机物（VOCs）对臭氧（O3）形成的实时贡献。它通过结合耦合去趋势波动分析（CDFA）和臭氧生成潜势（OFP）模型，分析了工业园区内VOCs的成分数据，旨在提高VOCs对臭氧贡献评估的时间分辨率和准确性。虽然论文没有直接提及遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究内容与大气环境监测、空气质量分析以及大气成分分析密切相关，因为这些技术常用于VOCs和臭氧的监测，从而为空气污染控制提供数据支持。,"['VOCs', 'Ozone formation', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition analysis', 'Chemical industrial park', 'Ozone pollution']",Haijun Zhang;Mengmeng Zhao;Chih-Rung Chen;Hongbin Jiang;Chunqiong Liu;Kai Shi,Real-time contributions of different types of VOCs to O<sub>3</sub> formation in a typical industrial park: capturing features at hourly resolution,"•Revealed the time-dependent characteristics of various VOCs contributing to O3formation in chemical industrial parks. •Aromatic hydrocarbons exhibit the highest contribution to O3formation on pollution and non-pollution days. •Compared with the OFP model, the CDFA method provides superior temporal resolution and accuracy. •Multifractal methods enable simultaneous real-time analysis of the relative contributions of various VOCs to O3formation. 
 Owing to a high nonlinear dynamic relationship between the precursors of NOx-VOCs and O3 formation in actual atmospheric conditions, traditional approaches—such as empirical kinetic models and air quality models—struggle to accurately quantify the hour-scale relative contributions of VOCs to O3 production. Chemical industrial parks have become a critical challenge for ozone pollution control due to their high variability in emission intensities and types. This study aims to elucidate the real-time, hourly-scale relative contributions of alkanes, alkenes, aromatic hydrocarbons, and OVOCs to O3 formation. By integrating Coupled Detrended Fluctuation Analysis (CDFA) with the Ozone Formation Potential (OFP) model, this research analyzes 12 months of VOC composition data collected in 2023 from a chemical industrial park. OFP analysis reveals that the contributions to O3 formation followed an order of aromatics > OVOCs > alkanes > alkenes during non-O3 pollution periods, which was consistent with the results from O3 pollution days. A different trend was found from the results of CDFA analysis, with an order of aromatics > OVOCs > alkenes > alkanes. Importantly, evidence from the OFP not only verified the high effectiveness of the CDFA method, but also successfully revealed the spatial and temporal evolution characteristics of VOC contributions with different types. This study pioneers a novel application of CDFA, enabling precise quantification of the real-time contributions of various VOC species to O3 formation. By significantly enhancing the resolution of VOCs relative contributions to O3, this research offers an effective strategy for mitigating complex air pollution. The findings provide a robust framework for improving pollution control measures."

 As an important indicator of pollution in environment, the distribution of PM2.5 (Particulate Matter) concentration provide an important basis for management and protection of the environment. In April 2022, the first Chinese atmospheric environment monitoring satellite DQ-1 was successfully launched, with an Aerosol and Carbon Detection Lidar (ACDL) as its main payload. The ACDL is a High Spectral Resolution Lidar, which can provide full-time, high-precision global cloud and aerosol optical properties vertical profiles of aerosol and cloud data. This study developed a retrieval algorithm for near-surface PM2.5 concentration in China by using the ACDL aerosol optical properties products, reanalysis model data, and near-surface meteorological auxiliary data. A modified multiple linear regression (MMLR) model was developed, with considering the nonlinear effect of relative humidity on the AOD-PM2.5 relationship. Taking into account the variability of PM2.5 sources and the domination of aerosol types over different regions of China, a sub-regional analysis was conducted which delineated the aggregation area into region I to VI. The data from June to December 2022 was selected, while three distinct time periods (period-JJ, period-ASO and period-ND) were defined. The regional retrieval model formulas were obtained by fitting iterations and then were cross-validated. The averaged Pearson correlation coefficient (R) in the period-JJ, period-ASO and period-ND are 0.65, 0.64, 0.80, respectively; the root mean square error (RMSE) are 5.61 μg/m3, 5.46 μg/m3, 16.56 μg/m3, and the mean absolute error (MAE) are 4.66 μg/m3, 4.43 μg/m3, 13.78 μg/m3, respectively. The value of R is higher than 0.70 in most sub-regions. Consequently, the findings indicate that the estimation of PM2.5 concentration is reliable based on the ACDL data products. Finally, the spatial-temporal distribution characteristics of PM2.5 from June to December 2022 in China were analyzed. The ACDL is a valuable data source for the future observations of pollutant concentration."

While the EPA’s high-cost Federal Reference Methods and Federal Equivalent Methods provide reliable data, they are often sparsely distributed, limiting community-scale assessments. Low-cost sensors like PurpleAir (PA) offer a promising alternative but require careful location-specific calibration and correction for environmental influences. Although several correction factors have been developed for use across regions and nationwide, these models often exhibit bias due to the predominance of data from temperate and warmer climates. This study was conducted to evaluate the performance of PA sensors in measuring PM2.5 in extremely cold environments, specifically North Pole, Alaska. Data from PA sensors and a Beta Attenuation Monitoring (BAM) reference sensor were used to develop correction models. The study found that temperature and relative humidity significantly influenced PA sensor accuracy in the region. By comparing various regression models, including Ordinary Least Squares, Lasso, Ridge, and Elastic Net, an optimal model was identified that substantially reduced errors and aligned PA sensor data with BAM measurements. This research highlights the importance of localized calibration models to enhance the reliability of low-cost air quality sensors in diverse environmental conditions, particularly in cold regions."

Báez,Digital Holographic Microscopy and Machine Learning for Quantitative 3D Analysis and Automatic Classification of Volcanic Ash Particles,"Determining the shapes, sizes and optical properties of volcanic ash presents a significant challenge in volcanology, the aviation industry and atmospheric models involving transport and dispersion of particles. Eruptive dynamics, including fragmentation mechanisms, magma viscosity and particle transport processes, among others, are encoded in the intricate shapes and sizes of these particles. Traditionally, the analysis of ash particles' morphology has relied on quantitative non‐dimensional parameters, primarily derived from their 2D silhouette projected area, using conventional microscopy or particle analyzers. However, these fail to capture the 3D structure of their morphology. Additionally, atmospheric dispersion models often assume spherical particles with uniform refractive indices, introducing uncertainties in particle size estimations and dispersion calculations. In this study, we introduce a novel 3D characterization method for volcanic ash using digital holographic microscopy (DHM) combined with machine learning (ML). We implemented an off‐axis interferometer to register holograms of volcanic ash samples. We show that segmented phase maps from the reconstructed holograms can be used to derive both 2D and 3D phase‐based morphological parameters for individual ash particles or to estimate their refractive index. To illustrate the potential of this technique, we analyzed morphological differences between ashes acccording to their transport mechanism: fallout and flow. A ML algorithm based on support vector machine (SVM) was trained to classify particles into one of these two categories, achieving an average accuracy of 76%. These results show that the proposed approach serves as a valuable tool for monitoring volcanic eruptions providing insights on their characteristics and associated environmental impact."

 Photolysis and gas-phase reaction schemes (PHS and GRS, respectively) are two modules that significantly influence the modeling performance of tropospheric ozone in chemical transport models (CTMs). Quantifying the impacts of updating both PHS and GRS on simulated ozone has significant implications for effectively improving the modeling performance of CTMs, which has not been previously studied. In this study, based on the architecture of multi-option scientific modules in the Emission and atmospheric Processes Integrated and Coupled Community (EPICC)-Model, two PHSs (a highly parameterized approach (EXPR) and a streamlined version of the TUV model (STUV)) and two GRSs (CBMZ and CB6r5) were developed to assess their impacts on simulated tropospheric ozone concentrations in the North China Plain during winter and summer. Compared to the cbmzEXPR scheme, the cb6r5STUV scheme showed a significant improvement in ozone simulation performance in both winter and summer, with the normalized mean bias of the maximum daily 8-h average ozone improving from −0.24 to −0.10 in winter and from 0.11 to −0.01 in summer. These improvements were attributed to better representation of photolysis rates by STUV, along with a more detailed description of gas-phase reactions by CB6r5 with distinct seasonal effects. In winter, updates of the GRS dominated the total improvement, with a contribution of 2.29 ppb (91 %) to daytime ozone changes.

 Accurately profiling the vertical distribution of particulate matter (PM) remains challenging. This study presents a novel approach for retrieving vertical PM concentrations using a single coherent Doppler lidar (CDL) combined with machine learning (ML) models. The models were trained using in-situ PM2.5 and PM10 data as true values, along with input features including the particle extinction coefficient at 1550 nm, signal-to-noise ratio, wind speed, wind direction from CDL observations, as well as temperature and relative humidity from ERA5 reanalysis data. Observations from Qingdao, China, during winter and spring (2020–2024) were used for model development and evaluation. The models show good performance that the R2, RMSE, MAE of the PM2.5 test set comparison are 0.787, 18.11 μg/m3, 11.23 μg/m3, and those of the PM10 test set are 0.803 and 29.98 μg/m3, 18.93 μg/m3, respectively. Case studies of haze and dust events demonstrated the capability of this method in capturing and characterizing vertical PM distribution. From the statistical results, the PM layers of the typical haze and dust events in Qingdao were primarily concentrated within 1 km and 1.2 km in altitude, respectively. With the atmospheric dynamics information including wind speed and vertical velocity provided by CDL, the evidence can be found that the enhancement of wind speed and negative vertical velocity in the later phase of the PM events may result in the dissipation and deposition of the PM. Combining the PM backward trajectory simulation, the results show that the haze event during the Chinese Spring Festival in Qingdao was influenced by both local emissions and regional transport, while the dust event in the spring exhibited multi-phase structures driven by long-range transport. This CDL-based approach provides a promising pathway for three-dimensional PM observation with atmospheric dynamics information, offering the potential to enhance air quality monitoring through expanded CDL networks and ML applications."

The UAS can reach hazardous environments to sample volcanic particles and measure in situ key parameters, such as the atmospheric concentration of volcanic aerosols and gases. Acquired data bridge the gap between the existing approaches of ground sampling and remote sensing, thereby contributing to the understanding of volcanic cloud dispersion and impact. 
 Volcanic degassing and explosive eruptions inject significant amounts of gas and ash into the atmosphere, impacting the local environment and atmospheric dynamics from local to global scales. While ground- and satellite-based remote-sensing systems are key to describing explosive volcanism and assessing associated hazards, direct in situ measurements inside volcanic clouds are not possible with these methods. This study presents an innovative approach using an unoccupied aircraft system (UAS) for (i) airborne ash sampling and (ii) measurements of aerosol and gas concentrations (AeroVolc system). Commercial instruments (DJI™ Matrice 30 UAV, Alphasense™ N3 optical particle counter, and Soarability™ Sniffer4D Mini2 multigas hardware) were combined with custom-built ash collectors and particle counters to enable a more detailed analysis of volcanic clouds. Here, we showcase the deployment of our UAS on Sakurajima (Japan) and Etna (Italy), two volcanoes known for their frequent explosive eruptions and persistent degassing activity, to demonstrate how this approach enables in situ, high-resolution sample and data collection within challenging environments. Results provide grain size distributions (GSDs), information on the occurrence of particle aggregation, and solid aerosol (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10, corresponding to solid aerosol particles with a diameter of less than 1, 2.5, and 10 µm, respectively) and gas (SO2 and CO2) concentrations. Depending on whether the UAS was operated within or below ash- and/or gas-rich clouds, different insights were gained that open up new perspectives for volcanological research. These insights include the composition, concentration, generation, dispersion, and sedimentation patterns of volcanic clouds."

 Aerosols strongly influence Earth's climate as they scatter and absorb radiation and serve as nuclei for cloud droplets and ice crystals. New Earth system models that run at kilometer resolutions allow us to examine long-standing questions related to these interactions. To perform kilometer-scale simulations with the Earth system model ICON-MPIM, we developed the one-moment aerosol module HAM-lite. HAM-lite was derived from the two-moment module HAM. Like in HAM, aerosols are represented as an ensemble of lognormal modes. Unlike in HAM, aerosol sizes and compositions are prescribed, which reduces the computational costs significantly. Here, we present a first global simulation with four aerosol modes at a resolution of 5 km over a period of 1 year.

 Black carbon (BC) aerosols play an important role in air pollution, environment, and climate. Emission inventories of BC are key inputs for atmospheric models that assess the impact of BC emissions on health and the environment. However, estimated BC emission fluxes are highly uncertain. In this study, we evaluated three emission inventories — the Community Emission Data System (CEDS), the Evaluating the Climate and Air Quality Impacts of Short-Lived Pollutants (ECLIPSE) and Global Fire Emission Database (GFED) — using the Lagrangian dispersion model FLEXPART, along with BC observations from two locations in India viz. Ahmedabad (urban) and Gadanki (rural). The modeled BC concentrations using ECLIPSE and CEDS were comparable to each other; however, the modeled BC concentrations were underestimated by a factor of 2 using these emission inventories. The annual mean biases between model and observation (observation-model) are approximately 3 μg/m3 and 1 μg/m3 at Ahmedabad (urban) and Gadanki (rural), respectively. Adding the contribution of biomass-burning sources from the GFED inventory (less than 0.01 μg/m3) did not significantly improve the bias. Open biomass burning (OBB) emissions, resulting from large-scale burning of biomass in agricultural fields, forests, and wastelands, is the largest contributor to BC concentrations globally and are highly uncertain. To investigate the underestimation of BC by the model and the role of OBB emissions in this discrepancy, a novel rank-based statistical framework is developed. This framework integrates satellite-detected fire hotspots, FLEXPART model, and ground-based observations to evaluate relative contribution of OBB emissions to BC concentrations. We find that OBB emissions are not a significant source of BC concentrations over Ahmedabad (23.03°N, 72.55°E). In contrast, BC emissions from OBB are underestimated at Gadanki (13.48°N, 79.18°E). The framework used to evaluate cause-effect relation between OBB and BC can help constrain better the sources of BC. This framework can be readily extended globally to evaluate other sectors where emission activity data can be observed using satellites."

Anthropogenic aerosol emissions impact heat extremes more strongly per unit of mean warming than do greenhouse gases, but the influence of aerosols’ evolving spatial pattern on time-varying heatwave hazard and resulting population exposure has been largely ignored. Aerosols’ spatially heterogeneous forcing is often co-located with population centers due to aerosols’ industrial sources and short atmospheric lifetime, potentially resulting in amplified exposure to aerosol-driven climate effects. Here, we quantify the influence of historical and projected future changes in aerosol emissions through 2100 on global patterns of heatwave hazard (i.e. the frequency of heatwave days) and exposure (i.e. population-weighted hazard) using the NCAR Community Earth System Model v1 single forcing large ensemble (LE). Our results show that increased aerosol emissions since 1920 have suppressed heatwave frequency (HWF) over populated regions by roughly half through present-day—a trend that is now reversing with shifting emission patterns and net global declining emissions. This may already be leading to an aerosol-driven acceleration in HWF, a signal that is amplified in populated regions. Aerosols’ influence on heatwaves is strongly co-located with population, creating out-sized exposure, which evolves through time with aerosols’ evolving emissions pattern within this LE. Our results suggest that near-term changes in aerosol emissions will be a disproportionate driver of trends in heatwave exposure, meriting dedicated future study, and that aerosols’ evolving spatial pattern should be considered in attempts to attribute recent heatwave trends to human activity."

While previous studies have examined ETS and provincial reduction targets separately, the impacts of the potential integration of these approaches on welfare and the spatial distribution of air quality-related health remain underexplored. In this study, we employ an integrated modeling framework to compare the economic impacts and health outcomes associated with PM2.5 and ozone under three provincial control mechanisms with the same target for national total carbon emissions in 2035. Our findings indicate that ETS improves national welfare by at least US$18.9 billion (0.12%) compared to the conventional provincial control mechanism (PRO_CAP). The partitioned carbon regulation mechanism (PART_REG), which applies the national ETS to power and energy-intensive industry sectors while assigning reduction targets to other sectors at the provincial level, achieves 85% of the welfare improvement observed under full ETS coverage (FULL_ETS). ETS redistributes CO2 and co-emitted air pollutant emissions from northern to southern China, improving air quality in northern provinces but worsening it in central and southern provinces. The national premature deaths increase by 32 700 (95% CI: 23 200–41 600) under PART_REG compared to PRO_CAP. When comparing the changes in welfare and monetized health damages, ETS remains cost-effective nationally, with a median net benefit of US$6.6 billion under PART_REG—20% higher than that under FULL_ETS.

We perform a high-resolution simulation of the boundary-layer cloud field and introduce statistical and numerical techniques, including machine-learning models, to study the evolution of the cloud field, which shows a periodic behaviour. We aim to use the numerical techniques to identify the underlying behaviour within noisy observations. 
 Average properties of the cloud field, such as cloud size distribution and cloud fraction, have previously been observed to evolve periodically. Identifying this behaviour, however, remains difficult due to the intrinsic variability within the boundary-layer cloud field. We apply a Gaussian process (GP) machine-learning model to the regression of the oscillatory behaviour in the statistical distributions of individual cloud properties. Individual cloud samples are retrieved from high-resolution large-eddy simulation, and the cloud size distribution is modelled based on a power-law fit. We construct the time series for the slope of the cloud size distribution b, a slope that is consistent with satellite observations of marine boundary-layer clouds, by observing the changes in the slope of the modelled cloud size distribution. Then, we build a GP model based on prior assumptions about the cloud field following observational studies: a boundary-layer cloud field goes through a phase of relatively strong convection where large clouds dominate, followed by a phase of relatively weak convection where precipitation leads to formation of cold pools and suppression of convective growth. The GP model successfully identifies the oscillatory behaviour from the noisy time series, within a period of 95±3.2 min. Furthermore, we examine the time series of cloud fraction fc and average vertical mass flux M‾, whose periods were 93±2.5 and 93±3.7 min, respectively. The oscillations reveal the role of precipitation in governing convective activities through recharge–discharge cycles."

However, the increased electrical capacity provided by these offshore wind projects could result in some reduction in onshore electrical generating (EGU) facilities. Here, multiple air quality models (a reduced complexity tool and a more sophisticated photochemical grid model) were applied to predict annual average PM2.5 and seasonal average maximum daily 8 h average O3 impacts from offshore wind projects and resulting reductions in onshore EGUs. The reduced complexity tool reasonably replicated the magnitudes and spatial gradients of impacts predicted by the photochemical transport model. Air pollution impacts from the offshore wind energy projects tended to be highest nearest the projects. Air pollution impacts were much higher from the construction phase compared to postconstruction (operation and maintenance). Predicted reductions to onshore EGUs due to increased offshore energy capacity resulted in regional decreases in PM2.5 and O3 that outpaced increases related to offshore wind projects. This effect was more pronounced for population influenced PM2.5 compared to that for O3. This is likely due to offshore wind energy capacity being highest in the winter, which results in more onshore EGU emissions reductions outside of the summer season when precursor emissions would be most impactful on O3 production. Reductions in onshore EGU emissions were based on assumptions that the increased energy capacity would not simply meet increased demand over present-day levels or be balanced by non-fossil-fuel-based energy sources such as nuclear, solar, or onshore wind farms."

Whether these radiative heating anomalies can affect SAM persistence is also investigated in CMIP6 models. If observed sea surface temperatures are prescribed, models that simulate low cloud responses more realistically show less SAM persistence, aligning more closely with observations.

In this study, we observed a significant increase in the concentrations of ClNO2, Cl2, and HOCl driven by pollution under the influence of continental air masses. By integrating field observations with model simulations, we revealed that unknown sources of these chlorine species are associated with nitrate photolysis and aerosol iron-mediated photochemical processes. The elevated levels of chlorine species promoted the increase in ROx radical concentrations, considerably intensifying the chemical formation of O3 and PAN and changing their sensitivity. These findings highlight the importance of anthropogenic pollutants in driving chlorine chemistry and provide scientific insights into its significance in regulating photochemical pollution."

 Fine particle (PM2.5) controls in China have achieved great success these years, but heavy haze pollution still occurs occasionally. The sources and evolution of the complex organic mixtures remain poorly resolved. We collected 46 PM2.5 samples during a 12-day severe haze episode in Wuhan, a megacity in central China. We analyzed the molecular-level organic composition and functional groups with high-performance liquid chromatography-orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-Orbitrap MS/MS). The methanol-soluble nitrogenous organics (ONs) contributed 87.6% and 52.5% of total signal intensity in positive electrospray ionization (ESI + ) mode and negative electrospray ionization (ESI-) mode, respectively. Through source apportionment and backward trajectory analysis, we found great contribution of biomass burning (~21.2% of ONs in ESI+ mode and 78.2% in ESI- mode) and significant aqueous/heterogenous products (~71.2% of ONs in ESI+ mode and 18.7% in ESI- mode) during the prolonged, highly-humid evolution (relative humidity ~86.8% lasting for 7 days). We identified C6–C12 amines and C6-C9 nitrophenols as possible molecular markers for biomass burning emissions, while C17-C19 amine oligomers and dicarboxylic acids as secondary markers from heterogeneous/aqueous reactions. The evolution may include three pathways: (1) polymerization of amines with an oxygenated molecule to form long-chain oxygenated amine oligomers; (2) ring-opening fragmentation of nitrophenols to form dicarboxylic acids; (3) ring-retaining functionalization of nitroaromatics to form nitroaromatic carboxylic acids. Pathway 3 has rarely been observed in ambient air, which is possibly related with the extremely high humidity during the periods and deserves further studies. Lastly, we found that ~39.3% of ON compounds had isomers, and ~43.7% of these isomers had distinct timeseries and originated from different sources, strengthening the necessity of measuring isomers. With the help of tandem high-resolution mass spectrometry, this study provides valuable datasets for the molecular and structural information on sources and evolutions of ONs under the highly-humid urban atmospheres."

 Climate responses to external forcings involve processes across a wide range of scales. While the ability of climate models to accurately simulate these responses remains uncertain, the computational cost of high-resolution models limits their use for long-term simulations. However, key atmospheric processes are initiated within days of a perturbation, suggesting that initial responses may offer valuable insight into resolution-dependent differences. Here we investigate initial climate responses to increased carbon dioxide and black carbon using a regional climate model at five resolutions, from 62.5 km to 100 m. Despite large differences in grid spacing, responses in radiative fluxes and temperature are remarkably consistent. Cloud responses are generally similar, though summer differences emerge, while precipitation shows stronger resolution dependence. These results suggest that even coarse-resolution models can capture key elements of the initial climate response, supporting their use in estimating climate impacts and informing confidence in their representation of atmospheric processes.

 The weak linkage between heavy rainfall and strong convection hampers predictability of extreme precipitation and hinders efforts to address challenges related to global warming, especially given unclear microphysical differences between convective clouds generating disparate rain rates. Using multi-year records from spaceborne precipitation radars and cloud-permitting ensemble simulations, here we reveal microphysical distinctions between “heavier” and “lighter” rainfall in convective precipitation events worldwide, as well as their differences in environmental conditions. Results suggest that the near-surface rain rates are dictated mainly by liquid-phase processes, but the more extreme rainfall is mostly produced by vigorous mixed-phase processes combined with a rough balance between breakup and coalescence of liquid drops. With comparable convective intensity, “heavier” rainfall-producing events possess substantially higher raindrop concentration with enhanced coalescence, supported by increased environmental moisture and thicker warm-cloud layers due to enhanced water vapor channels from oceans. The “heavier” rainfall-producing weak convection is formed in the most humid environment, which compensates for the lack of vigorous mixed-phase processes leading to a maritime-like characteristic. These novel insights, along with future projections of larger-scale circulation changes by the state-of-the-art climate models, highlight the increased risk of more frequent and extreme rainfall in southern Asia and the maritime continent islands.

 China is a major hotspot of black carbon (BC) emissions, contributing to climate warming and risk to public health. Here, our dual-isotope-constrained observations indicate stringent air pollution controls have drastically reduced coal-burning in North China over the past decade, marking a transition to a “post-coal” era compared to earlier 2012–2014. However, biomass-burning fraction (fbb) for north/central/east winter hazes has doubled from earlier (north/east) ~20%, with significantly higher fbb during polluted winters. Comparisons between observation and transport modelling show good alignment in BC concentrations but substantial discrepancies in source attribution (i.e., fbb). Leveraging radiocarbon measurements, advanced atmospheric modelling, and a Bayesian approach, our study identifies biases stemming from misallocated residential fuel types in emission inventories. These findings underscore the untapped potential to mitigate BC emissions by targeting rural biomass burning, while providing critical insights into BC source evolution to refine emission inventories and formulate effective air quality policies for China and other nations facing severe air pollution.

 This study investigated the behavior of aerosols influenced by a precipitating extratropical cyclone (ETC) passing over the Korean Peninsula during 11–13 November 2022 using WRF-Chem. The cold front associated with the ETC facilitated the convergence of pollutants along the front, forming a narrow PM2.5 band over China. During this process, the surface PM2.5 concentration in the core increased by 20 %. The converged PM2.5 was uplifted by a strong lifting airstream ahead of the front. The eastward-moving ETC transported PM2.5 from China to Korea through both the upper and lower atmosphere. Sulfate was a major component of transboundary PM2.5, while nitrate was a key contributor to locally elevated PM2.5. The Korean Peninsula benefited from clean and warm air supplied by the warm conveyor belt of the ETC from the East China Sea, which diluted local PM2.5 and volatilized nitrate into its gaseous form based on equilibrium partitioning. Wet scavenging during the cold front passage further reduced PM2.5 concentrations, particularly at altitudes above the boundary layer, by up to −26.1 μg m−3, resulting in very low PM2.5 levels over the Korean Peninsula when the cold front arrived. Additionally, clouds in the ETC provided an environment conducive to sulfate formation via in-cloud phase reactions, with cloud-phase sulfate accounting for 1 %–10 % of the total sulfate. This study emphasizes the critical role of ETCs in regulating air quality in East Asia by influencing the horizontal and vertical distribution, transport, removal, and formation of aerosols through a comprehensive analysis of ETC-aerosol interactions."

However, we have limited knowledge about the carbon sink capacity of coastal wetlands, whereby developing advanced skills for predicting CO2 fluxes of coastal wetlands is critical. Here, by employing recent cutting-edge achievements in artificial intelligence, we evaluated three automated machine learning (AutoML) platforms, including Lazy Predict, H2O AutoML and fast and lightweight automated machine learning, for predicting monthly gross primary production (GPP), ecosystem respiration (RE), and net ecosystem exchange (NEE) in China’s of mangrove and saltmarsh coastal wetlands with multi-source satellite observations. Our results indicate that these AutoML platforms effectively predicted GPP, RE, and NEE, with superior performance for GPP and RE compared to NEE. For individual predictions across 14 sites, the testing set yielded average determination coefficient (R2) values of 0.74, 0.79, and 0.63, and root mean square error values of 0.83, 0.45, and 0.76 gC m−2s−1 for GPP, RE, and NEE, respectively. Cross-site predictions performed better for saltmarsh (average R2: 0.86, 0.84, and 0.76 for GPP, RE, and NEE) than mangrove ecosystems (average R2: 0.72, 0.76, and 0.59). In addition, ensemble ML models, particularly on the Lazy Predict platform, significantly outperformed individual models. Feature important analyses revealed that vegetation variables (leaf area index and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation) play pronouncedly important roles in mangrove ecosystems, followed by climate variables (air temperature (Ta) and precipitation) with considerably important roles, while Ta dominated in saltmarsh ecosystems, with vegetation variables but playing a lesser role. Our study offers valuable insights for utilizing AutoML techniques to enhance CO2 flux predictions and regional budget estimations for coastal wetlands, potentially advancing strategies for monitoring large-scale coastal ‘blue carbon’ dynamics."

This time-series ecological study evaluated the association between annual ambient PM2.5 and NO2 exposure and school-level National Assessment Program—Literacy and Numeracy (NAPLAN) scores between 2008 and 2018 in Australia. Annual concentrations of PM2.5 and NO2 were estimated with satellite-based land use regression models. Weighted multipollutant mixed effects models, adjusted for available confounders, were used to evaluate the association between air pollutants and school-level NAPLAN scores. A total of 9268 schools were included in the study. We found that increasing exposure to PM2.5 within a 10 km radius around the school was associated with poorer school-level scores in Reading, Numeracy, Spelling, and Grammar and Punctuation NAPLAN domains for certain grades. Unexpectedly, we found that increasing exposure to NO2 was associated with higher school-level scores in all domains. Our findings for PM2.5 are consistent with previous literature and suggest that associations between PM2.5 and adverse educational outcomes could occur in lower pollution settings. Our findings for NO2 were in the opposite direction to what was expected from prior studies. We posit that these findings may be driven by uncontrolled confounders, such as individual socio-economic factors or exposure misclassification for NO2 which has high spatial variability not captured by our models given NO2 concentrations rapidly decrease away from major high traffic roads. Further exploration of these results is required to understand the association between air pollution and academic performance in this context."

Using A-LIFE data, we studied the change in mineral dust optical properties due to mixing with anthropogenic aerosols. We found that increasing pollution affects dust optical properties, which has implications for identifying dust events and understanding their climate effects. We also show that optical properties of Saharan and Arabian dust are similar when comparing cases with equal pollution content. 
 Uncertainties in the direct radiative effect of mineral dust result from the variability in its optical properties but are also influenced by mixing with anthropogenic aerosols (“pollution”), e.g., black carbon or sulfates. This study investigates the effect of mixing pollution with mineral dust from different source regions on the intensive optical properties. The Ångström exponents of scattering and absorption, the single-scattering albedo, and the asymmetry parameter are determined from in situ measurements during the A-LIFE aircraft field experiment over the eastern Mediterranean, where Arabian and Saharan dust mixed with pollution. Our results show that all intensive dust optical properties change significantly with increasing pollution content, while differences between Arabian and Saharan dust are not statistically significant. We discuss the implications of these results for the identification of mineral dust events and for their direct radiative effects. The pollution masks the mineral dust signal, which calls for caution when using Ångström exponents to identify mineral dust events. Furthermore, the asymmetry parameter and single-scattering albedo change from pure to polluted mineral dust layers (e.g., at 525 nm, median values decrease from 0.67 to 0.56 and from 0.96 to 0.89, respectively). These changes have opposing effects on the shortwave direct radiative effect efficiency (i.e., the direct radiative effect per unit of aerosol optical depth), potentially canceling each other out. Still, the effect can be significant depending on surface albedo. In conclusion, quantifying pollution content in mineral dust layers is essential for accurately assessing their local direct radiative effect."

 Understanding the spatial and temporal characteristics of both long- and short-term exposure to ground-level ozone is crucial for refining environmental management and improving health studies. However, such studies have been constrained by the availability of high-resolution spatiotemporal data. To address this gap, we characterized ground-level ozone variations and exposure risks across multiple spatial (pixel, county, region, and national) and temporal (daily, monthly, seasonal, and annual) scales using daily 1 km ozone data from 2000 to 2020, derived from satellite-sourced land surface temperature data via a machine-learning hindcast method. The model provided reliable estimates, validated through rigorous cross-validation and direct comparison with external ground-level ozone measurements. Our long-term estimates revealed seasonal shifts in high-exposure ozone centers: spring in eastern China, summer in the North China Plain (NCP), and autumn in the Pearl River Delta (PRD). A non-monotonic trend was observed, with ozone levels rising from 2001–2007 at a rate of 0.47 µgm-3yr-1, declining after 2008 (−0.58 µgm-3yr-1), and increasing significantly from 2016–2020 (1.16 µgm-3yr-1), accompanied by regional and seasonal fluctuations. Notably, ozone levels increased by 0.63 µgm-3yr-1 in summer in the NCP during the second phase and by 6.38 µgm-3yr-1 in autumn in the PRD during the third phase. Exposure levels over 100 µg m−3 have shifted from June to May, and levels exceeding 160 µg m−3 were primarily seen in the NCP, showing an expanding trend. Our day-to-day analysis highlights the influence of meteorological factors on extreme events. These findings emphasize the need for increased public health awareness and stronger mitigation efforts."

 This study presents an exhaustive assessment of the Sentinel-6A Michael Freilich radio occultation (RO) data, focusing on the evaluation of bending angle products derived from the EUMETSAT-provided RO non-time-critical (RO-NTC) data collected between September and December 2021.

 The Tibetan Plateau (TP), known as the “Asian Water Tower”, plays a critical role in the regulation of the water cycle in the region. Obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution, and all-weather total precipitable water (TPW) data is essential for understanding water vapor transport mechanisms, improving precipitation forecasting, and managing regional water resources over the TP. However, existing single-sensor remote sensing techniques cannot provide high spatiotemporal resolution TPW data under cloudy conditions. Multi-source fusion approaches often produce anomalous distributions in the fused TPW data due to inter-sensor biases, particularly over the complex terrain of the TP. This study proposed a multi-source remote sensing TPW fusion framework that integrates TPW products from eight microwave satellites and the Himawari-8/9 (H8/9) geostationary satellite to produce an all-weather TPW data with the highest spatiotemporal resolution at present. Methodologically, two correction strategies were developed. First, a bias correction approach was proposed using H8/9 TPW data as a reference to calibrate multi-source microwave remote sensing TPW and reduce inter-sensor discrepancies. Second, an adaptive correction method was created to improve the accuracy and spatial continuity of the fused TPW data under cloudy conditions. Based on the newly developed fusion framework, an all-weather TPW dataset with hourly temporal and 0.02° spatial resolution covering the TP from 2016 to 2022 was produced for the first time. The new dataset has been published by the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center and is available at: https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.301518. Taking the 2017 product as an example, it was verified against GNSS TPW. The RMSE of the fused TPW product at the hourly scale was 3.79 mm, which was 10.82 % and 6.19 % lower than MIMIC-TPW2 and ERA5, respectively. Compared to ERA5 with a spatial resolution of 0.25°, the fused product achieves a 12.5-fold improvement in spatial resolution, which make it possible to significantly grasp the transportation of water vapor in the valley of Yarlung Zsangbo River. It also demonstrates higher reliability in station-sparse regions, providing high-quality, high-resolution vapor data to support vapor flux estimation and forecasting of extreme weather events over the TP."

Keenan,CEDAR-GPP: spatiotemporally upscaled estimates of gross primary productivity incorporating CO2 fertilization,"CEDAR-GPP provides spatiotemporally upscaled estimates of gross primary productivity (GPP) globally, uniquely incorporating the direct effect of elevated atmospheric CO2 on photosynthesis. This dataset was produced by upscaling eddy covariance data with machine learning and a broad range of satellite and climate variables. Available at monthly and 0.05° resolution from 1982 to 2020, CEDAR-GPP offers critical insights into ecosystem–climate interactions and the global carbon cycle. 
 Gross primary productivity (GPP) is the largest carbon flux in the Earth system, playing a crucial role in removing atmospheric carbon dioxide and providing carbohydrates needed for ecosystem metabolism. Despite the importance of GPP, however, existing estimates present significant uncertainties and discrepancies. A key issue is the underrepresentation of the CO2 fertilization effect, a major factor contributing to the increased terrestrial carbon sink over recent decades. This omission could potentially bias our understanding of ecosystem responses to climate change.Here, we introduce CEDAR-GPP, the first global machine-learning-upscaled GPP product that incorporates the direct CO2 fertilization effect on photosynthesis. Our product is comprised of monthly GPP estimates and their uncertainty at 0.05° resolution from 1982 to 2020, generated using a comprehensive set of eddy covariance measurements, multi-source satellite observations, climate variables, and machine learning models. Importantly, we used both theoretical and data-driven approaches to incorporate the direct CO2 effects. Our machine learning models effectively predict monthly GPP (R2 ∼ 0.72), the mean seasonal cycles (R2 ∼ 0.77), and spatial variabilities (R2 ∼ 0.63) based on cross-validation at flux sites. After incorporating the direct CO2 effects, the predicted long-term GPP trend across global flux towers substantially increases from 3.1 to 4.5–5.4 gC m−2 yr−1, which aligns more closely with the 7.7 gC m−2 yr−1 trend detected from eddy covariance data. While the global patterns of annual mean GPP, seasonality, and interannual variability generally align with existing satellite-based products, CEDAR-GPP demonstrates higher long-term trends globally after incorporating CO2 fertilization and reflected a strong temperature control on direct CO2 effects. The estimated global GPP trend is 0.57–0.76 PgC yr−1 from 2001 to 2018 and 0.32–0.34 PgC yr−1 from 1982 to 2018. Estimating and validating GPP trends in data-scarce regions, such as the tropics, remains challenging, underscoring the importance of ongoing ground-based monitoring and advancements in modeling techniques. CEDAR-GPP offers a comprehensive representation of GPP temporal and spatial dynamics, providing valuable insights into ecosystem–climate interactions.

We developed a new submodel, Explosive Volcanic ERuptions (EVER), that seamlessly includes stratospheric volcanic SO2 emissions in global numerical simulations based on a novel standard historical model setup, successfully evaluated with satellite observations. Sensitivity studies on the Nabro eruption in 2011 evaluate different emission methods. 
 This work documents the operation of a new submodel for tracer emissions from Explosive Volcanic ERuptions (EVER v1.1), developed within the Modular Earth Submodel System (MESSy, version 2.55.1). EVER calculates additional tendencies of gaseous and aerosol tracers based on emission source parameters, aligned to specific sequences of volcanic eruptions or other atmospheric emission sources and allowing various vertical emission profiles. We show that volcanic SO2 plumes can be reasonably reproduced through EVER emissions in numerical simulations with the ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry Model (EMAC), using satellite observations of SO2 columns and mixing ratios following the explosive eruption of the Nabro volcano (Eritrea) in 2011 and a degassing event of the Kilauea volcano (2018) in Hawaii. Previous volcanic studies have shown large variability in stratospheric SO2 burdens depending on the chosen volcanic emission databases and parameters. Sensitivity studies on SO2 emissions from the Nabro volcano explore perturbations of the emission source parameters, revealing that emission altitude and the emitted mass above the tropopause are most important for the mid- to long-term evolution of stratospheric SO2 plumes and the resulting stratospheric aerosol, while the correct timing and geographical location of the stratospheric entrance are crucial for the short-term plume evolution. We integrate information from a volcanic SO2 emission inventory, additional satellite observations, and our findings from the sensitivity studies to establish a historical standard setup for volcanic eruptions impacting stratospheric SO2 from 1990 to 2023. This setup was successfully evaluated with satellite observations of stratospheric SO2 burden and aerosol optical properties. We advocate for this to be a standardized setup in all simulations within the MESSy framework concentrating on the upper troposphere and stratosphere in this period. Further potential applications of EVER involve studies on volcanic ash, wildfires, solar radiation modification, and atmospheric transport processes."

Here, focusing on Shenzhen Bao'an International Airport, the third largest airport in China in terms of passenger capacity, we utilized automatic dependent surveillance‐broadcast data to establish high‐resolution emission inventories for aircraft landing‐takeoff cycles and climb, cruise, and descent (CCD) cycles and employed four‐level nested regional air quality modeling setup to assess the aircraft emission impacts on air quality in the surrounding area at a 1‐km horizontal resolution. Among conventional pollutants, the most substantial impacts were observed for NO2 and O3 concentrations where aircraft emissions contributed 1.6–4.2 μg·m−3 to surface‐level NO2 concentrations and −1.1–−3.7 μg·m−3 to O3 within 10‐km with maximum contributions reaching 45 μg·m−3 for NO2 and −37 μg·m−3 for O3. Airport emissions exacerbate NOX saturation leading to a decrease in surrounding O3 concentrations. These results underscore the critical need for strategies to mitigate negative impacts of large point sources on air quality within urban settings."

The impacts of aromatics and their oxidation products vary. While the chemistry and major pathways of the precursor aromatics are relatively well understood, the same is not true for their phenolic oxidation products. Here, we use new observations of aromatic oxidation products collected during the Korea‐United States Air Quality aircraft campaign to evaluate the aromatic chemical mechanism in the GEOS‐Chem v13.4.0 chemical transport model. Based on these results, we implement changes to emissions, add ethylbenzene chemistry, and introduce phenol production from ethylbenzene and toluene oxidation. These changes improve simulation of benzene (reducing normalized mean bias from 24% to −9%) and phenol (−71% to −42%). Model biases increase for toluene, xylene, and cresol, but simulated mixing ratios remain within measurement uncertainties and observed interquartile ranges. We identify potential toluene emission overestimates from petrochemical complexes in Ulsan and Daesan and underestimates from the Daegu dyeing industrial complex, and underestimates of benzene emissions from China. Using the updated model, we find benzene and toluene contribute equally to phenol production in the boundary layer (accounting for 40% of phenol production each), and that toluene and ethylbenzene are atmospherically relevant precursors of phenol. Phenol and cresol loss is found to be dominated by OH oxidation (73% for both phenol and cresol). We find that benzaldehyde is the dominant source of nitrophenol production (67%), although phenol dominates nitrophenol production at night."

In this study, we introduce an iterative joint mass balance inversion framework that synthesizes multiconstituent satellite observations, with a particular focus on CrIS isoprene and OMPS formaldehyde (CH2O) column measurements. Our analysis targets East Asia during May–June 2016, using the GEOS‐Chem model. Our joint inversion improves the model performance for both species compared to the satellite observations, as evident from increases in correlation coefficient (R) from 0.37 to 0.70 for isoprene and from 0.90 to 0.92 for CH2O, and reductions of normalized mean bias from −79% to −64% for isoprene and from −23% to −16% for CH2O. In contrast, single‐species inversions of CH2O‐ and isoprene‐alone lead to minor reductions in R for the unobserved species. Cross‐validation with airborne observations highlights the downside of single‐species inversions, showing that the CH2O‐only inversion tends to overfit CH2O and degrade the isoprene simulation, which is mitigated by simultaneously using satellite isoprene observations in the joint inversion. However, uncertainties in satellite isoprene observations limit the benefits of the joint inversion in regions with low concentrations, such as South Korea, due to the detection limits of CrIS isoprene retrievals. Despite this limitation, our joint inversion framework efficiently leverages information from multiple data sets to provide a more comprehensive understanding of VOC emissions, enabling future work to incorporate satellite measurements of additional species such as nitrogen oxides and potentially glyoxal."

 Secondary organic aerosol (SOA), as a major component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5), significantly impacts air quality, climate, and human health. Although the aqueous chemistry of oxygenated organic compounds (OOCs) is acknowledged as an important contributor to the global SOA budget, the mechanisms by which this process yields SOA-forming oligomers remain unclear. Therefore, we clarify the aqueous-phase reactions of monocarbonyl OOCs (MOOCs, e.g., octanal and 2,4-hexadienal) in sulfuric acid aerosols using quantum chemistry and kinetic calculations. We identified all intermediates and products for established reaction pathways and explored a newly alcohol-governed mechanism for MOOC oligomerization, independent of prior atmospheric knowledge. Oligomers are yielded by the repetition of simple organic reactions, including protonation/deprotonation, hydration/dehydration, and nucleophilic addition, leading to rapid SOA formation. Our results unveil that an alcohol-governed aqueous-phase reaction mechanism of MOOC is likely prevalent across other OOCs in the atmosphere and helps to explain the explosive growth of PM2.5."

 PM2.5 pollution is particularly severe in Xinjiang, China. However, the key influencing factors of heavy pollution events in this region remain unclear. In this study, we employ explainable machine learning to investigate the drivers of PM2.5 pollution from pre- to post-COVID-19 (February and March 2019-2021) in the Urumqi-Changji-Shihezi (UCS) region. Our results indicate that PM2.5 concentrations are 33% and 25% lower during the COVID-19 compared to pre- and post-COVID-19, respectively. Nevertheless, even during the COVID-19, PM2.5 pollution in the UCS region remain concerning, averaging 65.47 ± 67.37 μg/m3. Extreme PM2.5 pollution events (exceeding 150 μg/m3) are primarily attributed to unfavorable meteorological conditions. From 2019 to 2021, the meteorological factors exacerbating PM2.5 concentrations were recorded at 38.72 μg/m3 (42.5%), 21.31 μg/m3 (43.5%), and 34.04 μg/m3 (45%), respectively. Surface pressure (SP) and Ox (NO2 + O3) account for more than 70% of the variation in meteorological contributions. Over the period from 2019 to 2021, the contribution of meteorological conditions shifted from SP dominance to Ox dominance. Regarding emissions, CO contributes more significantly to the increase in PM2.5 levels compared to SO2, NO2, and O3, with a contribution of up to 79.43%. Furthermore, the greater the contribution of emissions, the more pronounced the impact of meteorological conditions on PM2.5 concentration. Therefore, regional emission standards may need to be adjusted based on varying levels of SP and Ox. Our findings underscore the necessity of considering the effects of SP and Ox on PM2.5 in the context of air pollution control in the UCS region."

Numeric simulations and real data applications revealed the importance of considering depolarization measurements and the superiority of the irregular–hexahedral model in the retrieval of dust aerosols from lidar measurements. 
 Mineral dust is a key atmospheric aerosol agent that impacts the radiation budget and plays a significant role in cloud formation. However, studies on retrieving height-resolved microphysical properties of dust aerosols, which are crucial for understanding dust evolution, transport processes, and radiative effects, from lidar measurements are still insufficient. Here, we retrieve dust aerosol microphysical properties, including the volume size distribution (VSD), total volume concentration (Vt), effective radius (reff), complex refractive index (CRI), and single-scattering albedo (SSA), from spectral extinction (α), backscattering (β), and depolarization (δ) lidar measurements. We evaluate the performance of three particle scattering models, namely the spherical, spheroidal, and irregular–hexahedral (IH) models, in terms of mimicking dust optical properties and deriving retrieval results when different measurement combinations are inverted. Both simulations and inversions of real lidar measurements confirm the superiority of the IH model and the significance of spectral depolarization measurements to improve the retrieval accuracy. An increase in discrepancy in depolarization ratio produced by the IH and spheroid models is observed for reff>0.5 µm, resulting in larger retrieval difference between the two non-spherical models after the inclusion of 3δ. Comparisons of the real case retrievals with Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) retrievals and previous in situ results indicate relatively smaller reff and larger SSA derived from the lidar retrievals.

Overall, power plant CO2 emissions were largely consistent with local electricity consumption patterns, with most plants emitting less at night than during the day and with higher emissions in winter compared to spring and autumn. 
 Coal-fired power plants are a major source of global carbon emissions, and accurately accounting for these significant emission sources is crucial in addressing global warming. Many previous studies have used Gaussian plume models to estimate power plant emissions, but there is a gap in observation capabilities for high-latitude regions and nighttime emissions. However, large emitting power plants exist in high-latitude areas. The DQ-1 satellite is equipped with the world's first active remote sensing lidar for detecting CO2 column concentrations, which, compared to passive remote sensing satellites, enables observations in these regions. This paper applies a two-dimensional Gaussian plume model to the XCO2 results from the DQ-1 satellite and analyses the instantaneous CO2 emissions of 10 power plants globally. Among these, 15 cases of data are from nighttime observations, and 3 cases are from power plants located above 60° N latitude. The estimation results show good consistency when compared with emission inventories such as Climate TRACE and Carbon Brief, with a correlation coefficient R = 0.97. The correlation coefficient between the model fits and satellite observations ranges from 0.49 to 0.88, and the overall relative random error in the estimates is 15.11 %. This paper also analyses the diurnal differences in CO2 emissions from power plants and finds emission fluctuations directly correlated with regional electricity demand dynamics. This method is very effective for monitoring emissions from strong point sources such as power plants."

Environmentally persistent free radicals (EPFRs) are abundant on BC surfaces, yet their reactivity and structural characteristics remain poorly understood. This study demonstrates that EPFRs on BC surfaces drive the rapid decay of coexisting phenolic acids, leading to the formation of more toxic products. Novel integrated approaches, including temperature-programmed desorption mass spectrometry and electrochemical capacitance measurements, indicate that these EPFRs are predominantly composed of oxygen-containing functional groups with superior electron storage and transfer capabilities. Statistically significant linear correlations are observed between phenolic acid decay rates and EPFR concentrations, oxygen-containing group abundances, and electron transfer capabilities. Furthermore, the presence of nitrate ions is found to accelerate phenolic acid degradation. Human body clearance and human-related organ toxicity predictions suggest that transformation products are less readily cleared by the human body than the parent compounds and are more likely to cause liver toxicity. These findings highlight the critical role of EPFRs in BC chemistry, emphasizing their potentially underestimated environmental and health impacts."

Comprehensive characterization of organic mixtures, however, has been a long-standing challenge. Here, we investigate the speciation, properties, and evolution of ROC in a holistic view based on comprehensive field observations using four advanced mass spectrometers at an urban site in Guangzhou, a megacity in southern China. The summed concentration of over 1000 organic species detected in the gas phase averaged 124.7 μgC/m3, with oxygenated organics accounting for the largest fraction (44% by carbon mass, the same below), whereas the concentration of organic aerosol was 8.1 μgC/m3 on average. The observed ROC was dominated by volatile species (84%), while semi- and intermediate-volatile species that were not routinely measured contributed 10%. C1–C8 compounds constituted the major fraction of ROC (85%), most of which were long-lived oxidation products, along with anthropogenic alkanes and aromatics. Over 16 h of photochemical aging, the observed ROC mass decreased by 14%, which was much lower than in previous attempts in urban air, highlighting a better carbon closure with the advancement of mass spectrometry techniques. Our work provides insights into the evolution of the speciation and properties of ROC during oxidation processing."

In stark contrast to conventional irradiance retrieval algorithms that are confined to individual pixel information, this work proposes the STARNet (Spatio‐Temporal Association‐based Retrieval Network), which is a deep‐learning algorithm that exploits the information embedded in the spatio‐temporal neighbors of a target pixel. The algorithm holds three technical innovations: (a) a data preprocessing method that highlights the correlation‐ and causality‐type climatology associations in the original reflectance and brightness temperature observations; (b) a graph network cascade that extracts topological spatio‐temporal features, and (c) a multi‐scale convolution network that extracts regular spatio‐temporal features. The empirical part of this work showcases irradiance retrieval from Fengyun‐4A over China.

Detailed radiocarbon dating of loess in central Europe reveals concurrent increases in dust activity in dust‐emitting regions. However, the causes of these changes in dust emission and the role of dust in rapid climate change remain unclear. We address this uncertainty through multi‐proxy analysis of loess sources in Hungary. Our results demonstrate that loess particles were dominantly produced by subglacial grinding processes in the eastern Alps. These particles were released along with stadial Alpine Ice Sheet‐driven meltwater pulses, turning major river systems into efficient dust sources for loess deposition in Europe. Concurrent strengthened anticyclonic circulation over northern Europe would have caused wider dispersal of Alpine Ice Sheet‐derived dust as far as Greenland. Resultant continental‐hemispheric scale changes in atmospheric dust loading likely amplified concomitant North Atlantic climate cooling and ice sheet decay during Greenland stadials."

This study examined diurnal characteristics in North Atlantic TCs (2019–2023) based on retrieved cloud properties from GOES infrared measurements using ResUnet—a machine learning framework (ResUnet‐GOES). Results revealed distinct diurnal cycles: while average cloud top heights (CTHs) within the TC inner region (0–200 km) exhibited dual peaks at 05 and 14 local standard time (LST), cloud optical thickness (COT) and cloud water path (CWP) maximized singularly at 05 LST, contrasting with maxima in cloud effective radius (CER) at 16 LST. Notably, regarding deep convective clouds (DCCs) within the TC inner region, the average CTH, CWP, and coverage increased synchronously at night and peaked in early morning, providing the micro‐physical evidence for the early morning peak in TC precipitation. These diurnal signatures may serve as reliable indicators for diagnosing TC convective variability."

Saltzman;Fabien Paulot,Emerging Constraints on the H2 Budget From Polar Firn Air Reconstructions,"Comparison of modeled atmospheric hydrogen (H2) levels with observations is an important way of testing the scientific understanding of H2 biogeochemistry. But the instrumental record is short and provides a limited dynamic range with which to test assumptions about H2 cycling. Here, we compare twentieth century H2 levels reconstructed from polar firn air to the output from a historical run of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Atmospheric Model 4.1 (GFDL‐AM4.1). Simulated H2 exhibits reasonable agreement with the reconstruction. The twentieth century increase in H2 levels is consistent with rising atmospheric methane levels and changing emissions from fossil fuel combustion. However, the model fails to capture the reconstructed reversal in the interpolar H2 gradient between 1960 and 1990. We invert an 8‐box model of the atmosphere to show that the reversal in the interpolar difference requires a large increase (decrease) in the simulated NH (SH) net source of H2 peaking circa 1980. Revisions to our estimates of historical biomass burning emissions, photochemical production, and/or anthropogenic emissions could help resolve the discrepancy. Our optimization also implies a 15% increase in the strength of the soil sink in the NH mid to high‐latitudes from 1970 to 2000, which is qualitatively consistent with expectations based on changing soil moisture and temperature. We also show that smaller adjustments to the H2 budget would be needed to explain the reversal in the interpolar gradient if the H2 deposition lifetime were shorter than commonly accepted. A shorter lifetime may be supported by recently identified geological sources of H2."

The new model effectively corrected overestimation and underestimation of ozone levels by WRF‐CMAQ and global climate models, respectively. Anthropogenic efforts will overcome the adverse effect of climate and reduce future ozone concentration especially in eastern China and warm season with greater ozone pollution. From a long‐term perspective, energy structure transition was estimated to play a more important role than end‐of‐pipe emission controls with a former to latter ratio of ozone reduction during 2017–2060 at 2.7. With observational information incorporated, our model was demonstrated to better capture the ozone response to precursor emission change than WRF‐CMAQ and corrected the underestimation of ozone reduction for developed urban areas."

 The Sichuan Basin is one of the regions in China with severe PM2.5 pollution issues. However, the extensive cloud cover in the area makes it difficult for traditional satellite remote sensing methods to achieve spatiotemporally continuous PM2.5 monitoring. To accurately obtain spatiotemporally continuous PM2.5 monitoring results in the Sichuan Basin, this study proposes two machine learning models: the ERA5-driven Long Short-Term Memory model (ERA5-LSTM) and the WRF-driven Long Short-Term Memory model (WRF-LSTM). By combining high spatial resolution remote sensing emission factors (including satellite-derived aerosol, nighttime light data, vegetation index, land-use types, and impervious surface fraction) with meteorological model data, hourly PM2.5 mass concentration estimates at 1 km spatial resolution over the Sichuan Basin were obtained while maintaining the same level of accuracy as ChinaHighAirPollutants (CHAP) daily scale data. Validation against ground observations indicated that: (1) The WRF-LSTM model (R2 = 0.82, RMSE = 15.75 μg/m3) outperformed the ERA5-LSTM model (R2 = 0.81, RMSE = 16.51 μg/m3). (2) The resolution of meteorological data significantly influenced the model's feature extraction capability. The WRF-LSTM model, compared to the ERA5-LSTM model, can exhibit more details of PM2.5 spatial distribution. (3) For monitoring PM2.5 pollution events, the WRF-LSTM model also exhibits superior performance compared to the ERA5-LSTM model, with R2 values of 0.90 versus 0.85 between the estimated results and ground observations."

 The distribution of water droplets in clouds determines solar radiation and microphysical properties, thereby influencing the global energy balance and water cycle processes. Accurate retrieval of cloud water droplet distribution is of significant scientific value for improving the accuracy of weather forecasts, understanding feedback mechanisms in the climate system, and optimizing climate model predictions. This study employs multi-angle data from the second-generation Directional Polarization Camera on board the Chinese Gaofen-5 02 satellite (GF-5B DPC). By performing a detailed analysis of the polarization characteristics of water clouds and integrating the UNL-VRTM vector radiative transfer model, a lookup table for retrieving the water cloud droplet distribution. Using this approach, the effective particle radius and effective particle variance of water clouds over three surface types: forest, desert/semi-desert, and ocean, were successfully retrieved from the lookup table and polarization reflectance data. The retrieval results under various surface conditions were compared with the MOD06 cloud products. The correlation coefficient between the two sets of water cloud droplet distribution products ranged from 0.74 to 0.82, indicating strong consistency and validating the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed retrieval algorithm. By utilizing GF-5B-DPC multi-angle polarization data in conjunction with the UNL-VRTM model, we analyzed the spatial distribution of water cloud droplets.

Stubenrauch;Giulio Mandorli,Relationship between latent and radiative heating fields of tropical cloud systems using synergistic satellite observations,"Strongly precipitating mesoscale convective systems produce a large amount of diabatic heating of the atmosphere, influencing atmospheric circulation. Their complete 3D description, attained by machine learning techniques in combination with satellite observations, has enabled a detailed study of the relationship between latent and radiative heating in these cloud systems. Convective organization increases both the average and the vertical gradient of radiative effects of the mesoscale convective systems. 
 In order to investigate the relationship between latent heating (LH) and radiative heating (Qrad), in particular the heating released by mesoscale convective systems (MCSs), we used synergistic satellite-derived data from active instruments. Given the sparse sampling of these observations, we expanded the spectral LH profiles derived from the Tropical Rain Measurement Mission (TRMM-SLH) by applying artificial neural network regressions to the Clouds from InfraRed Sounders (CIRS) data and meteorological reanalyses, following a similar approach as for the expansion of the Qrad profiles. A direct comparison with the collocated TRMM-SLH data shows excellent agreement of the average profiles, but the prediction range is underestimated, in particular between 550 and 900 hPa. Noise related to discrepancies in rain fraction between TRMM and CIRS-ML (machine learning), as well as an underestimation of extremes, can be reduced by averaging over larger areas. The zonal averages of vertically integrated LH (LP) at 01:30 and 13:30 LT align well with those from the full diurnal sampling of TRMM-SLH over the ocean. For upper-tropospheric (UT) clouds with a large amount of latent heat release, the surface temperature has a larger impact on the atmospheric cloud radiative effect (ACRE) in dry environments than in humid ones, while humidity plays a large role in cool rather than in warm environments. In all situations, the cloud height is mostly responsible for the value of ACRE. The distribution of UT clouds in the LP–ACRE plane shows a very large spread in the ACRE for small values of LP, which is gradually reduced towards larger values of LP. The mean ACRE of mature MCSs increases with LP, up to about 115 W m−2. As expected, the shapes of the LH profiles of mature MCSs show that larger, more organized MCSs have a larger contribution of stratiform rain than the smaller MCSs do. Furthermore, convective organization enhances the mean ACRE of mature MCSs on average by about 10 W m−2 over the whole LP range."

The rising influx in recent years is likely linked to the rapid increase in CO concentrations from South Asia. 
 The Tibetan Plateau significantly impacts regional and global climate systems due to its unique geographical location and complex environmental processes. This study investigates the variability and driving force of transboundary transport flux of carbon monoxide (CO) over the Tibetan Plateau from May 2018–April 2024. The CO fluxes were calculated with a closed-loop integral method using the TROPOMI, ERA5, and GEOS-CF data products. The results show that the external influx and internal efflux of CO over the Tibetan Plateau in each year are relatively close and have similar seasonal characteristics. High levels of CO flux occur in late autumn to winter, and low levels occur in summer. In most cases, CO flux maximizes in November, December, or January and minimizes in July or August.  The month-to-month variability during late autumn to winter is greater than that in summer. The Tibetan Plateau has experienced an increase of 2.86 Tg CO yr−1 in external influx, while the internal efflux has slightly decreased by -1.70TgCOyr-1. The magnitude of the increase in external influx in the southwestern segment is greater than in the northeastern segment. Conversely, the magnitude of the decrease in internal efflux in the northeastern segment is greater than in the southwestern segment. The source attribution results reveal that the external input of CO into the Tibetan Plateau mainly comes from South Asia.  The increase in external influx of CO in recent years over the Tibetan Plateau is potentially linked to the rapid rise in CO concentrations from South Asia."

 The lack of aerosol optical depth (AOD) data at night can be partially addressed through Moon photometer measurements or fully covered with star photometer observations. However, the limited availability and complexity of star photometers have motivated this study to use all-sky cameras to extract starlight signals and derive AOD at night using star photometry. For this purpose, eight all-sky cameras were configured and deployed in nine different locations to capture raw images with varying exposure times every 2 min during the night. This work proposes a novel methodology to extract the starlight signal from the raw data from all-sky cameras and convert it into AOD values. This process consists of the following steps: removing the background image, selecting the pixels, and extracting the signal for each star from a predefined list of 56 stars; performing in situ Langley calibration of the instruments and retrieving the total optical depth (TOD); calculating the effective wavelength for each camera channel; deriving the AOD by subtracting the gas contribution to TOD; and averaging, cloud-screening, and quality-assuring the AOD time series. The AOD time series obtained through this methodology are compared with independent AOD measurements from collocated Moon photometers in the nine locations. The obtained results show that the AOD values derived with the proposed method generally correlate with reference values, often achieving correlation coefficients (r) above 0.90. The AOD values retrieved using the cameras tend to overestimate the reference values by approximately 0.02 and exhibit a precision of around 0.03–0.04. The agreement between the two datasets varies with wavelength and decreases at high-latitude locations, likely due to the poorer performance of Langley calibration in these regions. AOD values align well with day-to-night transitions obtained by solar photometers, demonstrating their reliability. Despite the slight overestimation, the AOD values derived by this new method approximate the real values and provide coverage throughout the entire night, without requiring the presence of the Moon. Therefore, they serve to study and monitor the nocturnal evolution of AOD."

This aims to promote a comprehensive understanding of cloud dynamics and cloud–climate feedback. Closed mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) clouds occur more frequently at night, while suppressed cumulus clouds exhibit remarkable decreases. Solid stratus and MCC cloud types show clear seasonal variations. 
 Marine low clouds tend to organize into larger mesoscale patterns with distinct morphological appearances over the ocean, referred to as mesoscale morphology. While previous studies have mainly examined the fundamental characteristics and shortwave radiative effects of these mesoscale morphologies, their behaviour in the nighttime marine boundary layer (MBL) remains underexplored due to limited observations. To address this, we established a global classification dataset of daytime and nighttime marine low-cloud morphology using a deep residual network model and infrared radiance data of 1° × 1° resolution from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), with machine-learning-retrieved all-day cloud optical thickness aiding in model training. We analysed day–night contrasts in climatology, seasonal cycles, and cloud properties of different cloud morphology types in this study. Results show that the relative frequency of occurrence of closed mesoscale cellular convection (MCC) increases significantly at night, while that of suppressed cumulus (Cu) shows a remarkable decrease. Disorganized MCC and clustered Cu display a slight frequency increase at night. In addition, solid stratus and three MCC types exhibit distinct seasonal variations, whereas two cumuliform types show no clear seasonal cycle. Our dataset extends the study of mesoscale cloud morphologies from daytime to nighttime, and the 1° × 1° resolution makes it a better match with other climate datasets. It will provide an important foundation for further research on the interactions between cloud morphology and climate processes. The final cloud classification dataset and the model development datasets are open-access and available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13801408 (Wu et al., 2024)."

Most gas levels increased and were higher than at two other Antarctic stations. Their sources were linked to industrial activities such as refrigeration and electronics. Although limited to one year, the data provide important background information for detecting future changes in the Antarctic atmosphere. 
 As potent greenhouse gases with high global warming potentials, fluorinated gases (F-gases) have emerged as significant contributors to global radiative forcing. Owing to minimal anthropogenic influences, Antarctica provides an exceptional natural environment for investigating background atmospheric F-gas concentrations. This study presents the first comprehensive report of temporal variations in 11 F-gas species at the Zhongshan National Atmospheric Background Station (ZOS; 69.4° S, 76.4° E) throughout 2021. This study is the first to provide concentration changes of 11 F-gases at ZOS in Antarctica in 2021. The datasets are publicly available at the National Tibetan Plateau Data Center at https://doi.org/10.11888/Atmos.tpdc.302283 (Tian et al., 2025). The concentrations of most F-gases significantly increased throughout 2021 at ZOS. The concentrations of F-gases in East Antarctica were greater than those in the Antarctic Peninsula and the interior on the basis of data comparisons with three other Antarctic stations. Back trajectory and clustering analyses using the HYSPLIT model revealed that the contributions of different trajectory clusters were nearly identical at each station. Source apportionment analysis via the PMF model identified industrial processes, refrigeration, fire suppression, and electronics as key contributors to F-gas concentrations in the Antarctic atmosphere. While the one-year observation period precludes long-term trend assessment, these high-frequency measurements capture the baseline variability critical for detecting future anomalies. Continuous multiyear monitoring at ZOS is necessary to establish statistically robust growth rates."

Here, we conducted long-term field measurements in Beijing during the winter, including Phase I (2015–2017) and Phase II (2018–2021). Our results showed that HMS concentrations decreased significantly in Phase I, consistent with changes in PM2.5, organic matter (OM), and sulfate, and showed an increasing trend in Phase II in contrast to the decreasing trend of PM2.5, OM, and sulfate. In addition, HMS contributions to PM2.5, OM, and particulate sulfur increased significantly during Phase II. HMS contributed up to 6% of PM2.5 and 24% of OM during heavy pollution periods in 2019. Despite the continuous reduction in gaseous precursors, the changes in aerosol water content driven by relative humidity and total chemical composition concentrations were the main factors influencing the interannual changes in HMS concentrations from 2015 to 2021 winter. Our findings highlight the importance of HMS during clean air actions and indicate that adverse meteorological conditions may somewhat offset the impact of precursor emission reductions on secondary aerosol formation."

While significant progress has been made in reducing anthropogenic emissions in China, surface ozone levels continue to rise, emphasizing the growing importance of biogenic emissions in air quality management. Despite the availability of various biogenic emission models, including MEGAN v3.2 and BEIS v3.6 for BVOCs and YL95 and BDSNP for soil NO, discrepancies in their estimates introduce uncertainties in understanding their combined impacts on ozone formation. Existing studies largely focus on individual contributions of BVOCs or soil NOx, leaving their synergistic effects underexplored in China. Here, we evaluate the individual and combined impacts of BVOC and soil NOx emissions on ozone formation in China using the MEGAN and BEIS models integrated with the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model. Nine sensitivity scenarios were simulated to examine spatial and temporal variations in emissions and their contributions to ozone. Results indicate that MEGAN estimates 1.27 times higher BVOC emissions than BEIS, particularly for isoprene and monoterpenes, while the BDSNP scheme predicts higher soil NO emissions compared to YL95. Combined emissions result in ozone and SOA increases of 10.11%–28.40% and 15.03%–62% across China, with significant regional variability. Synergistic effects amplify ozone formation beyond the additive impacts of individual emission sources, particularly in regions like the North China Plain. Our findings underscore the critical need to incorporate detailed biogenic emissions in air quality models to accurately capture ozone dynamics in China. By identifying the significant contributions of BVOCs and soil NOx, this study provides a robust basis for developing refined emission control strategies. The insights gained advance the broader understanding of natural and anthropogenic interactions in atmospheric chemistry, guiding policy interventions to mitigate ozone pollution effectively."

Oxidation flow reactors (OFRs) have been widely used in recent years to simulate the formation of SOA due to their ability to achieve high oxidation levels, thus becoming a promising complement to traditional smog chambers. This review comprehensively overviews existing OFRs and compares their structural differences. It also discusses the research progress on the formation of SOA in OFRs from various biogenic and anthropogenic organic gas precursors in laboratories. We evaluate the limitations and advancements of various OFRs by comparing the SOA yield and chemical characteristics obtained from different OFRs. Overall, OFR is crucial for understanding the formation mechanism of SOA and quantifying the contribution of different precursors to atmospheric particulate matter formation. Nevertheless, due to the complexity of SOA formation mechanisms in the troposphere, further research is still needed in the design of OFR, and the atmospheric oxidation mechanism under the composite system, to provide more accurate data for atmospheric models."

Long‐term data sets from Photochemical Assessment Monitoring Stations and Air Quality Monitoring Stations were used to develop a photochemical metric based on volatile organic compounds ratios. We analyzed the ratio of ln(n‐butane/ethane) versus ln(n‐pentane/ethane) based on which we derived the δ value to assess the degree of regional air mass aging from a chemical reactivity perspective. In summer, extreme ozone events with low δ values are primarily driven by local photochemical activity. However, in fall and spring, the slightly higher δ values in some episodes signify the involvement of long‐range transport (LRT) bringing in continental ozone and cooler air masses while local photochemistry remains active. The interaction between transported and locally produced ozone is pronounced during milder ozone episodes (100–120 ppbv). We further examined the m,p‐xylene/ethylbenzene ratio as a complementary chemical indicator for characterizing ozone events with mild LRT. Slightly lower temperatures (below 28.8°C) are often accompanied by elevated nocturnal ozone levels (40–80 ppbv) and a less defined m,p‐xylene/ethylbenzene ratio. Overall, high‐ozone episodes (≥100 ppbv) are primarily driven by local photochemical processes. However, LRT can elevate the ozone baseline, particularly during spring and fall, when aged air masses bring in residual ozone leading to increased daytime ozone levels. These findings highlight how local photochemistry and regional transport shape high‐ozone episodes emphasizing the value of chemical indicators for understanding air mass aging and ozone formation."

Apart from photochemical reactions, stratospheric intrusion (SI) also contributes to tropospheric O3 pollution. In this study, a strong SI event that greatly influenced the near‐surface O3 pollution was identified in May 2023. To quantitatively analyze the contribution to surface O3 over the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), meteorological reanalysis data, in situ observations, and a regional meteorology‐chemistry coupled model were integrated. Our findings reveal that the severe O3 pollution observed over the YRD region cannot be solely attributed to photochemical processes. Noteworthily, a distinct signal of stratospheric air masses injecting into the troposphere was observed, indicating a more complex interplay between atmospheric chemical and physical processes. The clustering analysis of the backward trajectories shows that the O3‐rich air masses injected into the lower troposphere are primarily driven by westerly jets and downwelling behind the troughs accompanying the low‐pressure weather system at 46°N–60°N. The stratospheric O3‐rich air masses can be transported to the YRD region driven by the strong downwelling occurring with a high‐altitude wind field toward the south. Using the regional meteorology‐chemistry model Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF‐Chem) with real‐time input of the upper chemical boundary conditions, it is estimated that such regionally transported SI O3 contributed more than 12 ppb to surface O3 pollution over the YRD region."

Yet the apparent relationship between low‐cloud fraction and shallow convective mixing differs substantially among general circulation models (GCMs), large eddy simulations, and both remote sensing and in situ observations. Here, we consider how changes in GCMs' representations of subgrid‐scale vertical moist fluxes can alter the cloud‐mixing relationship. Using vertical profiles of water vapor isotope ratios (δD) to characterize the strength of shallow convective mixing in a manner that can be compared directly to satellite observations, we evaluate the cloud‐mixing relationship produced in tiered experiments with the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM). From versions 5 to 6 of CAM, the most notable physics change is CLUBB, a scheme that unifies the representation of shallow convection and boundary layer turbulence through a joint probability density function (PDF) for subgrid velocity and moisture. CLUBB reduces the covariance between low‐cloud fraction and shallow convective mixing, producing a bivariate distribution that is more similar in character to monthly averaged satellite observations. Using parameter sensitivity experiments, we argue that CLUBB's ability to simulate skewness in the distribution of vertical velocity produces more isolated but stronger moist updrafts, which reduce the grid‐mean low‐cloud fraction while maintaining efficient hydrological connectivity between the boundary layer and the free troposphere. These results suggest that mixing is not an effective predictor of low‐cloud feedback in GCMs with PDF closure schemes."

 Solar-induced fluorescence (SIF) emitted by plants as a byproduct of photosynthesis provides critical insights into vegetation health and climate regulation. However, detecting the weak SIF signal from small telluric oxygen absorption features remains challenging. ESA’s upcoming Fluorescence Explorer (FLEX) mission will retrieve full-spectrum SIF data at 300 m spatial resolution. In the meantime, we propose an alternative approach to reconstruct full-spectrum SIF from O2A and O2B bands using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and the Soil Canopy Observation, Photochemistry, and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) model. Based on 100,000 SCOPE simulations (640–850 nm at 1 nm resolution), the SIF signals in the O2A (760 nm) and O2B (687 nm) bands showed high correlations with adjacent spectral regions and the full spectrum (R2>0.89). From this data, we derived linear regression functions linking SIF at the O2A (760 nm) and O2B (687 nm) bands to the first two principal components (PCs), enabling inverse PCA transformation to reconstruct full-spectrum SIF with R2>0.98 and RMSE <0.12mW m−2nm−1sr−1. Applying the functions to HyPlant airborne SIF maps (1.7 m resolution) in northeastern Spain, and subsequent PC transformation, successfully reconstructed full-spectrum SIF including peaks and total emitted flux (SIFTot) with propagated uncertainties. To transfer this airborne full-spectrum SIF data to the satellite scale, we then trained an emulator with PRecursore IperSpectrale de la Missione Applicativa (PRISMA) Bottom of Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance spectra as input to produce spaceborne synthetic full-spectral SIF maps at 30 m resolution, and resampled to the nominal 300 m FLEX resolution. Despite PRISMA’s lower spectral resolution for SIF retrieval, the emulator reliably produced full-spectrum SIF with R2 of 0.69 and 0.52 for SIF760 and SIF687 bands, enabling FLEX-like SIF products (e.g., peaks, SIFTot). This reconstruction and upscaling approach demonstrates its utility for generating FLEX-compatible SIF datasets, supporting FLEX’ mission preparation and cal/val activities."

 Accurate and dynamic estimates of anthropogenic emissions are crucial for developing and evaluating emission reduction measures. In this study, an improved superposition column model based on TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical column density is used to estimate the chemical lifetime of nitrogen oxides (NOx) and daily NOx and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions in typical megacities of China. The average NOx lifetimes are: Beijing 5.02 ± 1.71 h, Zhengzhou 3.89 ± 1.4 h, Wuhan 2.09 ± 0.69 h, Shanghai 2.45 ± 0.83 h. The estimated NOx and CO2 emissions agree well with these of bottom-up emission inventories. Despite a steady decline in NOx emissions of all the four megacities owing to emission control measures during 2019–2021, CO2 emissions increase in Beijing and Zhengzhou. The daily variations of NOx and CO2 emissions can clearly capture the sudden decline of NOx and CO2 emissions during COVID-19 lockdowns. Furthermore, the main sources of NOx and CO2 shifted from industry to transportation and from industry to power respectively with the rapid emission reduction of different sectors. The distinct CO2-to-NOx ratios across sectors in the four megacities impact the speed of NOx and CO2 emission reduction and emphasize the necessity of coordinated emission reduction of NOx and CO2 emissions. In addition, emission amounts between weekdays and weekends exhibit very different variations in these megacities. Considering the dramatic changes of the NOx and CO2 emissions, it's necessary to conduct a regular estimation of anthropogenic emissions from the major sources."
10.1029/2024JD043303,True,Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres,该研究论文主要探讨了野火烟雾遮蔽效应对边界层混合和热力驱动烟雾传输的影响。研究利用移动卡车搭载的多普勒激光雷达观测数据，分析了烟雾遮蔽区域内外边界层动力学特征，包括水平和垂直风场以及烟雾后向散射情况。研究发现烟雾遮蔽会显著降低地表温度和边界层混合，并导致热力驱动的流动现象。虽然论文没有直接涉及卫星观测或大气成分分析，但其研究结果对理解野火烟雾对大气环境的影响，以及提高空气质量模型预测精度具有重要意义，因此与大气环境遥感技术有较强的关联性。,"['wildfire smoke', 'boundary layer mixing', 'thermally driven transport', 'Doppler lidar', 'air quality', 'temperature gradients', 'vertical velocity variance']",Brian J.

Alan Brewer,Wildfire Smoke Shading Observations: Impacts on Boundary Layer Mixing and Thermally Driven Smoke Transport,"Smoke shading from wildfire smoke cools the surface and atmosphere below the smoke by absorbing and scattering sunlight. This has the potential to create meteorological feedback and large air quality impacts, but observations of smoke shading and induced local flows are rare. Mobile truck‐based Doppler lidar observations during the California Fire Dynamics Experiment (CalFiDE) in August and September 2022 provide a novel data set of smoke shading events. The truck‐based lidar conducted measurements of horizontal and vertical winds while underway, along with qualitative smoke backscatter, allowing a study of boundary layer (BL) dynamics in and out of the smoke shaded areas. An in situ temperature sensor on the truck recorded air temperature. Smoke shaded versus clear‐sky temperature differences of up to 8°C were observed over 12 km along a valley floor in complex terrain. Using vertical velocity variance as a measure of turbulent mixing, smoke shading reduced BL mixing by up to two orders of magnitude, preventing the development of an afternoon convective BL in some cases. Temperature gradients also resulted in thermally driven flows wherein the cold smoky air mass undercut warmer ambient air. One density current case was observed with a strong opposing flow resulting in a convergent updraft and shear‐induced vortices atop the smoke‐filled density current. In another case, the flow was impeded by complex terrain resulting in a slower‐moving smoke front and a temperature gradient that lagged behind the front."

While greenhouse gas influences on temperature extremes are well established, the impacts of other anthropogenic forcings, particularly aerosols, remain inadequately characterized. Here, we quantify the distinct contributions of greenhouse gases, anthropogenic aerosols, and natural forcings to extreme heatwave metrics from the pre‐industrial period. Globally, changes in the duration of heatwave events and cumulative heat are +2.77 ± 0.85 days and +1.76 ± 0.31°C2 attributed to greenhouse gases, and −1.10 ± 0.34 days and −0.85 ± 0.14°C2 due to anthropogenic aerosols, respectively, over the past 3 decades relative to pre‐industrial levels. This indicates that aerosols substantially masked greenhouse gas effects until the 1990s. Under current mitigation policies, declining aerosol emissions have exacerbated heatwave intensification at rates of +1.07 ± 0.32 days decade−1 and +0.47 ± 0.09°C2 decade−1 for duration and cumulative heat respectively, exceeding the intensification attributable to greenhouse gases alone. Heatwave intensification has been driven primarily by reduced cloud cover and increased shortwave radiation resulting from weakening aerosol forcing, especially in Central North America and Europe. However, the regional climate changes driven by greenhouse gases and aerosols exhibit spatial heterogeneity, highlighting the necessity for geographically targeted mitigation strategies."

 Isoprene is the dominant nonmethane volatile organic compound (VOC) emitted into the atmosphere globally, with important atmospheric chemistry impacts on air quality and climate. One crucial intermediate in its gas-phase oxidation is isoprene epoxydiol (IEPOX), which contributes significantly to the formation of secondary organic aerosols (SOA). It is generally accepted that IEPOX is efficiently formed in remote forested regions with a sufficiently low NO/HO2 ratio. Here, we show that the oxidation of isoprene hydroxynitrates (IHN) can be an alternative, efficient, NO-driven pathway leading to the formation of IEPOX in urban areas where moderate to high NO concentrations exist. Field measurements from the megacity of Beijing show that this pathway contributes to more than 50% of IEPOX production during the morning and early afternoon. The results improve our understanding of the NOx dependence of SOA formation in polluted areas, where anthropogenic emissions can significantly enhance biogenic SOA formation."

 Low-cost particulate matter (PM) sensors enable high-resolution urban air quality monitoring but face challenges from offsets, scaling mismatches, and drift. We propose an adaptive trust-based calibration framework that first corrects systematic errors and then dynamically adjusts model complexity based on sensor reliability. Extensive simulations and real-world deployment in Zurich, Switzerland validate the approach. Each sensor’s trust score integrates four indicators: accuracy, stability, responsiveness, and consensus alignment. High-trust sensors receive minimal correction, preserving baseline accuracy, while low-trust sensors leverage expanded wavelet-based features and deeper models. Results show mean absolute error (MAE) reductions of up to 68% for poorly performing sensors and 35–38% for reliable ones, outperforming conventional calibration methods. By using trust-weighted consensus, the framework reduces dependence on large training datasets and frequent re-calibrations, ensuring scalability. These findings demonstrate that dynamic, trust-driven calibration can substantially enhance low-cost sensor network accuracy across both controlled scenarios and complex real-world environments."

 Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) are ozone-depleting substances with high radiative efficiencies; however, uncertainties in their atmospheric lifetimes hinder top-down emission monitoring efforts. Here, we compute the loss, emission, and lifetime of CFC-11, CFC-12, and CCl4 using their mass balance in the stratosphere. We first infer the strength of the stratospheric overturning circulation using satellite measurements of nitrous oxide; the mass flux at about 18 km is then used to compute the loss of CFC-11, CFC-12, and CCl4. We confirm that anomalous surface measurements of CFC-11 from 2013 to 2018 cannot be attributed to variability in stratospheric transport alone, and we infer near-steady CCl4 emissions since 2013. Atmospheric lifetimes (50, 86, and 41 yr) independent of previous work are also computed using loss rates. These estimates add confidence to emission inversions and projections of the compounds’ ozone and climate impacts, and may help detect breaches of the Montreal Protocol.

Yela,Vertical resolved heterogeneity up to 3100 m of in-situ aerosol properties by an unmanned aerial vehicle based system at El Arenosillo (South-Western Europe),"•The usefulness of the UAV research platform is demonstrated. •Cold and warm seasons shows vertical heterogeneity differences on aerosol properties. •Influence of mineral dust on PBL height is studied in terms of vertical profiles of aerosol properties. •Vertical inhomogeneous new particle formation is analyzed. 
 Characterizing vertical profiles of in-situ particle properties is relevant because being only based on the surface or column-integrated measurements cannot unambiguously conclude the radiative impact on aerosol. Vertical profiles of in-situ aerosol properties on-board an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) were measured above El Arenosillo (37.1 N, −6.7 W) in the southwest of Spain during four flight missions. Measured properties included particle number size distribution, total particle concentration and multiwavelength absorption coefficient up to 3100 m during cold season (February 4, 2022 and December 11, 2023) and warm season (September 20, 2023 and April 2, 2024). The heterogeneity of particle properties has been shown around two types of events: a mineral particle event of desert origin during cold season and a new particle formation event during warm season. During cold season, a comparison between the flight missions with and without desert dust episodes shows that mineral particles decrease the planetary boundary layer (PBL) height. This behavior is probably related to absorber particles aloft atmosphere, which traps solar radiation and heat up the upper layer of the atmosphere and deteriorates the vertical dispersion. In the literature, this effect is called as ‘dome effect’. During warm season, new particle formation was observed above PBL. This event could be related to the presence of precursor gases in the residual layer, and enhanced by a low concentration of pre-existing particles. The characteristic parameter during the observed event was the fine-to-total particle volume concentration ratio close to zero. These observations highlight the necessity to establish a long-term multi-temporal monitoring of vertical profiles for atmospheric parameters onboard UAV systems and to integrate in Earth observations networks. For example, radiative forcing is usually estimated from surface data, but the heterogeneity in the vertical profiles of atmospheric particles properties, which are used to the forcing quantification, is a result of inaccuracies."

A Bayesian inverse modeling methodology is used to update a 1‐km emission inventory in each of the three cities. This method is able to correctly identify the critical temperature of home heating even when this information is withheld from the prior inventory, as verified by natural gas distribution data. Variance in regional heating practices has not been previously demonstrated with ground‐based networks of CO2 observations.

Observation‐based forcing estimates have been typically given more weight as they do not rely on assumptions and parameterizations in models. Traditional estimation of direct aerosol radiative forcing (DARF) based on observation is realized by regressing the observed radiative fluxes against aerosol optical depth (AOD). Here we improve this procedure by considering more aerosol parameters such as single scattering albedo (SSA) and adopting a machine learning‐based method (eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)) to establish the relationship between top‐of‐atmosphere (TOA) radiative fluxes and aerosol properties. Our approach gives a global mean DARF of −0.80 ± 0.73 W/m2 under clear sky, which largely agrees with previously reported results.

Despite extensive research on the formation of OSs, the origins of over 50% of OSs mass in ambient aerosols remain unknown. Here, we demonstrate that thiophenes, emitted from multiple anthropogenic sources (e.g., coke fuel production) and contributing ∼44 Gg of sulfur emissions annually, are previously unrecognized potential OSs precursors in the urban atmosphere. For instance, C5H8O5S and C4H6O5S were previously detected in the urban atmosphere but their origins were unknown. Our study identified these two OSs as products of the nighttime oxidation of 2‐methylthiophene, suggesting that 2‐methylthiophene may act as a potential precursor for C5H8O5S and C4H6O5S in ambient aerosols. Both 2‐methylthiophene and benzothiophene can lead to the formation of OSs that were solely attributed to the photooxidation of isoprene and naphthalenes in prior field studies (e.g., C5H8O7S and C7H6O4S). We highlight that the nighttime oxidation of thiophenes can directly produce gaseous oxygenated organosulfur compounds without external sulfur (e.g., sulfate), which is a previously unrecognized pathway that could contribute to the OSs formation in urban atmospheric aerosols."

But, emissions from urban areas are poorly characterized except in the few cities with robust measurement infrastructure. Satellite measurements offer a means for monitoring urban emissions. We use colocated measurements of methane (CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$) and carbon monoxide (CO) from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) and carbon dioxide (CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$) from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 and Orbiting Carbon Observatory 3 (OCO‐2/3) to calculate CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$:CO2 ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$, CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$:CO, and CO:CO2 ${\mathrm{C}\mathrm{O}}_{2}$ enhancement ratios over 103 cities. We compare our enhancement ratios to those derived from ground‐based instruments in Los Angeles and find good agreement. Then, we combine our enhancement ratios with CO and CO2 ${\text{CO}}_{2}$ inventories to calculate CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ emissions and find good agreement with estimates from past studies. Finally, we compare our satellite‐based enhancement ratios to those computed from the bottom‐up globally gridded emission inventories, and we find significant differences between them. Combining results from the three enhancement ratios, we find EDGARv8 to best represent CH4 ${\text{CH}}_{4}$ emissions in urban areas with mean errors of 34% compared to CAMS‐GLOB‐ANTv6.2 (based on EDGARv6.1), and CEDSv2021 with mean errors of 43% and 49%, respectively. These differences are largely driven by EDGARv8 changes in South‐Central and East Asia. We also find that EDGARv8 and HTAPv3 underestimate CO emissions by a factor of 2–5 for cities in Iran, Turkmenistan, and Argentina. Finally, we find that CO emissions are overestimated in some cities in Europe by a factor of ∼ ${\sim} $2."

 Isoprene, primarily emitted by terrestrial plants, is the most abundant non-methane volatile organic compound (NMVOC) in the atmosphere, playing a critical role in regulating tropospheric ozone levels and contributing to the formation of secondary organic aerosols. However, ground-based observations that capture large-scale spatial patterns of forest isoprene emissions across extensive regions remain limited. Here using the Vocus mobile laboratory, we conducted mobile measurements of isoprene along a east-west transect (∼2000 km) across the subtropical forest region of China. The results show significant spatial heterogeneity in isoprene concentrations, with an average concentration of 209.4 ± 66.7 pptv. In particular, the isoprene concentration in the Guizhou forests (primarily coniferous) was 155.6 ± 51.0 pptv, approximately 24.7 % lower than the 206.7 ± 37.7 pptv observed in the Jiangnan forests (dominated by subtropical evergreen broadleaf forests with widespread bamboo). This suggests that vegetation type significantly influences the intensity of forest isoprene emissions. Interestingly, in the highly industrialized Zhejiang region, the isoprene concentration (289.7 ± 51.0 pptv) was 46.3 % and 28.7 % higher than those in the Guizhou and Jiangnan forests, respectively. This indicates that anthropogenic emissions are likely a significant contributor to the elevated isoprene concentrations in the region. Therefore, in regions with significant human activities, it is essential to consider the influence of anthropogenic emissions on isoprene in addition to natural sources."

The methane is the second most important greenhouse gas, and its emissions reduction is urgently required to mitigate global warming. Numerical modeling-based estimates with three different sets of atmospheric observations consistently suggested large contributions of biogenic emissions from South Asia and Southeast Asia to the surge of atmospheric methane. 
 Atmospheric methane (CH4) growth rates reached unprecedented values in the years 2020–2022. To identify the main drivers of this increase, an inverse modeling study estimated regional and sectoral emission changes for 2016–2022. Three inverse estimates based on different sets of atmospheric CH4 observations (surface observations only, surface and aircraft observations, and GOSAT observations) consistently suggest notable emission increases from 2016–2019 to 2020–2022 in the tropics (15° S–10° N) (10–18 Tg CH4 yr−1) and in northern low latitudes (10–35° N) (ca. 20 Tg CH4 yr−1), the latter of which likely contributed to the growth rate surge from 2020. The emission increase in the northern low latitudes is attributed to emissions in South Asia and northern Southeast Asia, which abruptly increased from 2019 to 2020, and elevated emissions continued until 2022. Meanwhile, the tropical emission increase is dominated by Tropical South America and Central Africa, but emissions were continuously increasing before 2019. Agreement was found in the sectoral estimates of the three inversions in the tropics and northern low latitudes, suggesting the largest contribution of biogenic emissions. Uncertainty reductions demonstrate that the flux estimates in Asia are well constrained by surface and aircraft observations. Furthermore, a sensitivity test with the probable reduction of OH radicals showed smaller emissions by up to 2–3 Tg CH4 yr−1 in each Asian region for 2020, still suggesting notable emission contributions. These results highlight the importance of biogenic emissions in Asian regions for the persistent high growth rate observed during 2020–2022."
10.5194/amt-18-2899-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇研究论文主要关注如何最大化利用潘多拉光谱仪的观测数据，用于大气环境遥感应用。潘多拉光谱仪是一种地面遥感仪器，用于监测大气中的痕量气体，特别是甲醛（HCHO）和二氧化氮（NO2）。该研究提出了一种新的数据过滤方法，旨在利用更多被现有质量控制标志排除的数据，从而提高数据利用率。该方法通过比较独立观测模式的数据，并结合地面和机载观测结果进行验证。研究结果表明，通过使用独立不确定性作为过滤标准，可以有效利用更多的数据，从而改进卫星观测的验证，并支持空气质量研究。总的来说，该研究旨在优化潘多拉光谱仪的数据处理，使其在空气质量监测、卫星数据验证和大气成分分析等领域发挥更大的作用。,"['air quality monitoring', 'satellite validation', 'atmospheric composition (HCHO, NO2)', 'ground-based remote sensing (Pandora)', 'direct-sun observations', 'sky-scan observations', 'trace gas column density']",Prajjwal Rawat;James H. Crawford;Katherine R. Travis;Laura M. Judd;Mary Angelique G. Demetillo;Lukas C. Valin;James J. Szykman;Andrew Whitehill;Eric Baumann;Thomas F. Hanisco,Maximizing the scientific application of Pandora column observations of HCHO and NO2,"The Pandonia Global Network (PGN) consists of Pandora spectrometers that observe trace gases at a high time resolution to validate satellite observations and understand local air quality. To aid users, PGN assigns quality flags that assure scientifically valid data but eliminate large amounts of data appropriate for scientific applications. A new method based on contemporaneous data in two independent observation modes is proven using complementary ground-based and airborne observations. 
 As part of the Pandonia Global Network (PGN), Pandora spectrometers are widely deployed around the world. These ground-based remote-sensing instruments are federated such that they employ a common algorithm and data protocol for reporting on trace gas column densities and lower-atmospheric profiles using two modes based on direct-sun and sky-scan observations. To aid users in the analysis of Pandora observations, the PGN standard quality flagging procedure assigns flags to the data indicating high, medium, and low quality. This work assesses the suitability of these data quality flags for filtering data in the scientific analysis of formaldehyde (HCHO) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2), two critical precursors controlling tropospheric ozone production. Pandora data flagged as high quality assure scientifically valid data and are often more abundant for direct-sun NO2 columns. For direct-sun HCHO and for sky-scan observations of both molecules, large amounts of data flagged as low quality also appear to be valid. Upon closer inspection of the data, independent uncertainty is shown to be a better indicator of data quality than the standard quality flags. After applying a filter to independent uncertainty, Pandora data flagged as medium or low quality in both modes can be demonstrated to be scientifically useful. The utility of this filtering method is demonstrated by correlating contemporaneous but independent direct-sun and sky-scan observations. When evaluated across 15 Pandora sites in North America, this new filtering method can recover as much as 90 % of data that would have previously been discarded. This method suggests that standard PGN criteria for atmospheric variability and the normalized root mean squared error are too stringent, as they are responsible for downgrading most of the recovered data. A method is also developed for combining the direct-sun and sky-scan observations into a single dataset by accounting for biases between the two observing modes and differences in measurement integration times. These combined data provide a more continuous record that is useful for interpreting Pandora observations against other independent variables such as hourly observations of surface ozone. When Pandora HCHO columns are correlated with surface ozone measurements, data filtered by independent uncertainty exhibit similarly strong and more robust relationships than high-quality data alone. These results suggest that Pandora data users should carefully assess data across all quality flags and consider their potential for useful application to scientific analysis. The present study provides a method for maximizing use of Pandora data with the expectation of more robust satellite validation and comparisons with ground-based observations in support of air quality studies."

 We assess and illustrate the benefits of high-altitude attainment of balloon-borne radiosonde soundings, up to and beyond 10 hPa level compared to, for example, 30 hPa, at operational stations and at sites of the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) Reference Upper Air Network (GRUAN).

These ions modulate the dust’s radiative properties and its contribution to the deposition of bioavailable nutrients, thereby shaping regional and global climate processes as well as marine ecosystem dynamics. This review synthesizes current research on the variations of major WSIs in dust particles transported from desert regions to downstream marine areas over East Asia. In source regions and adjacent areas, WSIs typically account for 4% to 14% of dust mass, dominated by mineral salts including SO42–, Cl–, Na+, and Ca2+. As dust moves into the populated areas of northern China, the WSIs is still dominated by mineral sources, while substantial secondary SO42–, NO3– and NH4+ can be observed particularly in reversely transported dust plumes. In the coastal areas of eastern China, similar trends are observed, with additional sea salt contributions under marine air influence. When dust plumes reach Korea and Japan, dust particles often have higher proportions of SO42– and NO3–, mixed with sea salt, with WSIs in fine particles sometimes exceeding 30% of the mass. These changes of WSIs in Asian dust particles during their long-distance transport highlight the dynamic physicochemical properties of dust aerosols, their climatic and environmental effects, as well as the accompanying health risks. The review concludes with a discussion of key research challenges in quantifying WSIs in long-distance transporting Asian dust and understanding their implications."

Hughes,Influence of Biomass Burning on Fluorescent Aerosol Particles in Subarctic Winter Conditions,"Fluorescent aerosol particles (FAPs) are airborne particles that emit fluorescence when exposed to specific wavelengths of light, typically ultraviolet or visible light. In recent times, real-time measurements of aerosol autofluorescence have been widely used to study primary biological aerosol particles (PBAPs) or bioaerosol. Although autofluorescence techniques provide improved temporal resolution for PBAP detection, interference from nonbiological fluorescent particles complicates measurements, particularly in polluted environments. This study investigates the fluorescence properties of airborne particles influenced by biomass burning. Real-time measurements of FAPs were conducted in the North Pole, Alaska, using a wideband integrated bioaerosol sensor. Concurrent filter measurements and data from other real-time instruments were used to analyze FAP composition and size to assess the influence of biomass burning. Results indicate a moderate correlation between biomass burning and specific FAP types below 0.75 μm, evidenced by their association with levoglucosan, a biomass burning tracer. Findings further demonstrate that biomass burning emissions increased FAP concentrations, resulting in statistically significant shifts in particle size and fluorescence intensity. Notably, biomass burning appears to drive increases in specific PBAP concentrations, including potential bacterial and fungal spores, raising concerns over health impacts for local populations exposed to both anthropogenic pollutants and elevated PBAP levels. These findings provide valuable data on PBAPs in subarctic winter conditions, underscoring the environmental and public health implications of biomass burning in cold climates."

Meanwhile, climate change in Antarctica has exhibited a zonally asymmetric pattern. However, few studies have linked the two.

Increased Asian AAs induce a tri‐polar anomaly pattern in Antarctica via a poleward propagating Rossby wave train. This pattern is characterized by warmer temperature and less sea ice in the Amundsen‐Bellingshausen Seas, and cooler temperature and more sea ice in regions on its both flanks.

Restoration and rewetting can help prevent these emissions, while continuous monitoring is critical for evaluating their success. Using satellite-derived observations of essential climate variables, we conducted the first large-scale assessment of how peatland restoration influences land surface temperature (LST), albedo, and vegetation across 72 sites in North America and Europe. Our findings indicated that before restoration, degraded peatlands had a commonly lower daytime LST and albedo but higher nighttime LST, leaf area index (LAI), and fraction of absorbed photosynthetically active radiation (FPAR) compared to intact sites. The largest restoration-induced absolute values of monthly changes reached +3.18 °C (daytime LST), −1.22 °C (nighttime LST), −2.54 (LAI), −0.29 (FPAR), and −0.16 (albedo). While restored peatlands tended to align more closely with intact sites a decade after restoration began, the probability of this alignment varied depending on the climate variables. Restored peatlands became more similar than different to intact sites in nighttime LST and albedo after a post-restoration decade, with high similarity projected within five decades. Peatland restoration modifies local and regional climate and should be included in future climate projections."

 This study investigates the impact of ship emissions on clouds over a shipping corridor in the southeastern Atlantic, employing geostationary-based observations, which have not been previously used in studies of this kind. Based on CLAAS-3, the 20-year (2004–2023) CLoud property dAtA set using SEVIRI (the geostationary Spinning Enhanced Visible and InfraRed Imager), the diurnal, seasonal and long-term corridor effects on clouds are examined. Results show a significant impact of ship emissions on cloud microphysics, consistent with the Twomey effect: an increase in cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) and a decrease in effective radius (re). Additionally, cloud liquid water path (W) decreases, though changes in cloud fraction are more subtle. No clear impact on cloud optical thickness is found, implying an overall minor radiative effect of the ship emissions, although methodological limitations to detect changes in the corridor cannot be excluded. Seasonal and diurnal variations of the impact are evident, influenced by regional conditions and by the cloud thinning during the day, respectively. The long-term analysis reveals a weakening of the shipping corridor effect on Nd and re, presumably following the International Maritime Organization's 2020 stricter regulations on sulfur emissions, and broader regional changes in W and cloud fraction, associated with sea surface temperature variations. Focusing on a climatically important cloud regime, and including novel aspects, namely the diurnal and full seasonal cycle analyses, this study highlights the advantages and potential of geostationary satellite-based cloud observations for studying aerosol–cloud interactions."

 Air pollution adversely affects health, ecosystems, and infrastructure. In the Western Balkans (Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo1, Montenegro, the Republic of North Macedonia, and Serbia), the air pollution situation is more adverse than in the European Union in general. Understanding the air quality situation requires high-quality emission data with a high-resolution spatial distribution, especially for enabling remediation efforts, which is lacking in the Western Balkan region.In this work, we have calculated air pollution emissions from the heating of individual housing units in the Western Balkan region. The basis for the dataset is a geographical dataset of buildings detected from satellite imagery by artificial intelligence (AI) methods. The building data have been combined with geospatial land-use datasets and statistical data for heating needs for residential buildings in the countries included and finally with emission factors to calculate the heating emissions.Using this novel approach, the resulting datasets provide high-resolution heating emission data for common pollutants and are published as open data (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.13906810, Asker, 2024).

The thermodynamic equilibrium between the ammonia in the gas phase and the ammonium ion in the condensed phase complicates the understanding of its ambient concentrations. In this study, long‐term historical data of ammonia concentrations and particle composition at 10 sites from Canada's National Air Pollution Surveillance program was used to show that the simultaneous analysis of both measurements is crucial for properly understanding ammonia's atmospheric budget. Over the multiyear observation period, the ammonia concentration displayed a positive slope or no trend in all sites, while the NHx (sum of ammonia and ammonium) concentration remained almost constant in most sites, and the fraction of NHx in the gas phase increased; that is, the apparent trend in ammonia depends not only on source and sink processes but on the atmospheric conditions that control the gas‐particle equilibrium. Under these circumstances, generalizations about the trends may be incorrect if either the ammonia or ammonium is analyzed in isolation due to their different deposition rates. The comparison of measurements with the output from the GEOS‐Chem High Performance model shows that the seasonality of the ammonia emission inventories and, consequently, the ammonia budget in the model needs to be revised. This work underscores the need for more sites monitoring ammonia concentrations simultaneously with particle composition to understand the temporal and spatial variability and effects of ammonia."

 Industrial agglomeration areas have emerged as an important form of intensive production; however, the environmental pollution or odor complaint caused by volatile organic compounds has elicited widespread concerned due to the agglomeration of chemical companies. In order to trace source of disturbing odor pollutants or higher reactive pollutants for ozone formation, many industrial areas have conducted study and application of pollution tracing at different levels within and around the boundaries of enterprises and industrial areas, but many problems remain unaddressed. Given the demonstrated capability of artificial intelligence to classify problems, based on Bayesian optimization, a multimodel algorithm was developed to accurately identify and classify the sources of volatile organic compounds. Comparing the models of different algorithms, the convolutional neural network-long short-term memory model demonstrated the best predictive performance (accuracy of 0.886). Furthermore, comparison of two feature importance analysis tools (Out-Of-Bag and SHapley Additive exPlanations) indicated that benzene, toluene, and isobutane have the greatest impacts on tracing results, reflecting the interaction mechanisms among them. This paper demonstrates that the application of machine learning and neural networks can achieve efficient and accurate source identification of volatile organic compounds. The intelligent approach developed here serves as a successful precursor for establishing advanced identification and classification systems and holds broad application prospects in pollutant tracing for chemical industrial park to improve the scientific and accurate management."

 Much effort is spent by the air pollution and atmospheric science communities on quantifying pollutant emissions as they are used as inputs in air quality models and assist in the interpretation of atmospheric measurements at field sites. Nitrogen oxides (“NOx”, defined as the sum of nitric oxide NO and nitrogen dioxide NO2), nitrous acid (HONO), and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) are all byproducts of combustion processes. While NOx emissions from on-road vehicles have been extensively studied, vehicle emissions of HONO and especially HCN are not as well quantified. Enhancing our knowledge of direct HCN and HONO emissions is essential because HONO is an important precursor to the hydroxyl radical (OH), thereby playing a critical role in atmospheric oxidation, and HCN is toxic, long-lived in the atmosphere, and used as a tracer for biomass burning. In this manuscript, we present measurements of HCN and HONO made using an iodide-adduct chemical ionization mass spectrometer (CIMS) during August of 2019 near a highway in Meridian, Idaho. Vehicle emission ratios of HCN and HONO with respect to NOx (i.e., ΔHCN/ΔNOx and ΔHONO/ΔNOx) are reported as well as emission ratios of HCN and NOx with respect to carbon monoxide (CO) (i.e., ΔHCN/ΔCO and ΔNOx/ΔCO). Observed emission ratios were quite variable and determined for select highway influenced periods during the nighttime and early morning (prior to sunrise) located typically 200–500 s downwind of the major interstate highway. We report average values of 5.3 and 1.13 ppbv ppmv−1 for ΔHCN/ΔNOx and ΔHCN/ΔCO, respectively.

 This study analyzes the aerosol and precipitable water vapor (PWV) properties at six sites in the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP), a densely populated and highly polluted region. The main objective is to explore how the columnar PWV is related to the attenuation of shortwave solar radiation (SWR), as well as the combined role of aerosol properties and PWV on radiative forcing based on AERONET data and model (SBDART) simulations. The analysis revealed high aerosol optical depth (AOD) values (0.4–0.6) throughout the year in all the sites, associated with increased PWV (4–5 cm) during the summer monsoon. Comprehensive investigation shows that changes in PWV levels also affect aerosols' size distribution, optical properties and radiation balance in a similar way - but in different magnitudes - between the examined sites. The water vapor radiative effect (WVRE) is highly dependent on aerosol presence, with its magnitude for both surface (−130 to −140 Wm−2) and atmospheric forcing becoming higher under clean atmospheres (without aerosols). Aerosol presence is also considered in the computations of the WVRE. In that case, the WVRE becomes more pronounced at the top of the atmosphere (TOA) (30 to 35 Wm−2) but exhibits a lower forcing impact on the surface (about −45 Wm−2) and within the atmosphere (70–80 Wm−2), suggesting important aerosol-PWV interrelations. The atmospheric heating rate due to PWV is more than double (3.5–4.5 K Day−1) that of aerosols (1–1.9 K Day−1), highlighting its essential role in radiative effects and climate implications over the IGP region. The radiative impacts of PWV and aerosols are further examined as a function of the single scattering albedo, solar zenith angle, and absorbing AOD at the different sites, revealing dependence on both astronomical and atmospheric variables related to aerosol absorption, thus unravelling the combined role of aerosols and PWV in climate implications."

Simulations of the high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with chemistry (WRF-Chem) were evaluated using in situ Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and satellite measurements. This work highlights gaps in current models, like missing sources of key organic compounds and inaccuracies in emission inventories, emphasizing the importance of improving chemical and dynamical processes in atmospheric modelling for budget estimates in tropical regions. 
 Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) act as precursors to ozone and secondary organic aerosols, which have significant health and environmental impacts. They can also reduce the atmospheric oxidative capacity. However, their budget remains poorly quantified, especially over remote areas such as the tropical oceans. Here, we present high-resolution simulations of atmospheric composition over Réunion Island, located in the Indian Ocean, using the Weather Research and Forecasting model coupled with Chemistry (WRF-Chem). The coexistence and spatial heterogeneity of anthropogenic and biogenic emission sources in this region present a valuable but challenging test of the model performance. The WRF-Chem model is evaluated against several observational datasets, including proton transfer reaction mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) measurements of VOCs and oxygenated VOCs (OVOCs) at the Maïdo Observatory, Réunion Island (2160 m above sea level), in January and July 2019, representing austral summer and winter, respectively, and capturing the seasonal extremes for the region. While the primary goal of our study is to gain a better understanding of the (O)VOC budget at remote tropical latitudes, important model refinements have been made to improve the model performance, including the implementation of high-resolution anthropogenic and biogenic isoprene emissions, updates to the chemical mechanism, and adjustments to the boundary conditions. These refinements are supported by comparisons with PTR-MS data as well as with meteorological measurements at Maïdo; in situ NOx and O3 measurements from the air quality Atmo-Réunion network; Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) measurements of O3, CO, ethane, and several OVOCs, also at Maïdo; and satellite retrievals from the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI).TROPOMI NO2 data suggest that anthropogenic emissions, particularly from power plants near Le Port, dominate NOx levels over the island. Both TROPOMI and in situ surface NO2 comparisons are used to adjust the power plant emissions at Le Port. Surface ozone concentrations are overestimated by ∼6 ppbv on average, likely due to the neglect of halogen chemistry in the model, though other factors may also contribute. While modelled NO2 over oceans is too low in summer when the lightning source is excluded, including this source results in model overestimations, as corroborated by comparisons with upper tropospheric NO2 mixing ratios derived from TROPOMI using the cloud-slicing technique (Marais et al., 2021). The model generally succeeds in reproducing the PTR-MS isoprene and its oxidation products (Iox), except for a moderate underestimation (∼30 %) of noontime isoprene concentrations, and modelled concentration peaks near dawn and dusk, which are not seen in the observations. The ratio of Iox to isoprene (0.8 at noon in January) is fairly well reproduced by the model. The methanol and monoterpenes observations both suggest overestimations of their biogenic emissions, by factors of about 2 and 5, respectively. Acetaldehyde anthropogenic emissions are likely strongly overestimated, due to the lumping of higher aldehydes into this compound. Without this lumping, the modelled acetaldehyde would be underestimated by almost one order of magnitude, suggesting the existence of a large missing source, likely photochemical. The comparisons suggest the existence of a biogenic source of methyl ethyl ketone (MEK), equivalent to about 3 % of isoprene emissions, likely associated with the dry deposition and conversion of key isoprene oxidation products to MEK. A strong model underestimation of the PTR-MS signal at mass 61 is also found, by a factor of 3–5 during daytime, consistent with previously reported missing sources of acetic and peracetic acid."

Using observations and air tracking, we found that, in winter, air ascends and cold temperatures freeze water out, drying it before it enters the stratosphere. In summer, air tends to sink after cloud formation. This process affects water vapor amounts in the stratosphere, influencing the greenhouse effect and climate. 
 Understanding air mass sources and transport pathways in the tropical western Pacific (TWP) is crucial for determining the origins of atmospheric constituents in the stratosphere. This study uses lidar and balloon observations in Koror, Palau, and trajectory simulations to study the upward transport pathway over the TWP in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS). During Northern Hemisphere winter, the region experiences the highest relative humidity and the lowest temperatures (<185 K) at 16–18 km, and is called the “cold trap.”  These conditions lead to water vapor condensation, forming thin cirrus clouds, which can be measured as an indicator of the ascent of air masses. A representative example from December 2018 shows a subvisible cirrus cloud layer (optical depth, <0.03) measured by lidar coinciding with high supersaturation observed by radiosonde. Trajectories initiated from the cloud layers confirm that air masses primarily ascend slowly from the troposphere into the stratosphere  during Northern Hemisphere winter. In contrast, lidar measurements show similar cloud layers during a summer case (August 2022) with warmer temperatures and drier conditions, where air descends after cloud formation, as indicated by the trajectory results. For all cirrus clouds observed in December and August, 46 % of air masses rise above 380 K after cloud formation in December, compared with only 5 % in August, possibly influenced by the Asian summer monsoon. These findings underscore the importance of the cold trap in driving air mass transport and water vapor transformations in the UTLS."

Thomason;Terry Deshler,Producing aerosol size distributions consistent with optical particle counter measurements using space-based measurements of aerosol extinction coefficient,"We use balloon-borne measurements of aerosol size distribution (ASD) made by the University of Wyoming (UW) to derive distributions which are representative of the ASDs that underlie measurements made by the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment II (SAGE II). A simple single-mode log-normal distribution has in the past been used to derive ASD from SAGE II data; here we derive bimodal log-normal distributions, reproducing median aerosol properties measured by UW. 
 Stratospheric aerosol has been observed by several long-lived observational systems. These include the University of Wyoming series of balloon-borne optical particle counters (OPCs) (1971–2020) and the Stratospheric Aerosol and Gas Experiment (SAGE) series of instruments, particularly SAGE II (1984–2005). Inferences of aerosol surface area density (SAD) and volume density are straightforward using data from OPCs. Conversely, many numerical methods to infer size distributions and SAD have been applied to SAGE II observations, but all are limited by the restricted number of independent wavelengths of the SAGE optical measurements. We have developed a new method that uses OPC observations to constrain SAGE II inferences of aerosol properties. We start by noting that, whatever the details of the underlying size distribution, the SAGE II-measured aerosol extinction coefficient ratio (525–1020 nm) must reflect the shape of the underlying aerosol size distribution for particles that dominate the extinction coefficient values (roughly radii from 0.1 to 0.5 µm). Since this extinction ratio can be easily calculated from OPC measurements, we use the OPC size distribution measurements, across a broad range of aerosol levels from background to highly volcanic, to compute the associated 525–1020 nm extinction coefficient ratios for each measurement. We then sort the OPC measurements by these ratios (across a range of roughly 1–6) into discrete ratio bins and derive mean bimodal log-normal size distributions for each bin using a particle swarm optimization. These fits can be applied to SAGE II observations without the need for further retrieval calculations, effectively producing an OPC-like product consisting of the six bimodal parameters for all SAGE II observations. This method successfully captures the median behavior of the OPC inferences of bulk parameters like aerosol surface area and volume densities, although we also observe a significant altitude dependence particularly in the lower stratosphere. In addition, there are occasional deviations of SAD from the fit behavior by as large as a factor of 10 for individual OPC measurements of SAD, primarily due to variations in small-radii particle number density (roughly smaller than about 0.15 µm). The presence of such particles is effectively invisible to extinction coefficient measurements such as those by SAGE II."

Traditionally, OSs have been primarily linked to the particle phase with their presence in the gas phase remaining largely undetected. This study provides compelling observational evidence of a continuously present gas-phase OS, glycolic acid sulfate (GAS), in an urban atmosphere using advanced mass spectrometry techniques. GAS concentrations exhibited distinct seasonal and diurnal patterns, peaking in summer with maximum levels of 4.6 × 104 cm–3 observed around midday, indicating a photochemical origin. Thermal desorption profile analysis revealed GAS as an extremely low-volatility organic compound, suggesting preferential aerosol partitioning. Remarkably, the observed gas-phase fraction of GAS exceeded predictions based on gas-particle equilibrium theory by 5–7 orders of magnitude, strongly suggesting the existence of a distinct source from gas-phase chemistry. We propose a potential formation mechanism involving the reaction between the SO3 radical and glycolic acid (GA), which correlates nearly linearly with GAS production rates, suggesting a near-collision-limited rate constant (kfield ≈ 2.2 × 10–10 cm3 s–1). This study fundamentally reshapes our understanding of OS sources and underscores the potential involvement of SO3 in the formation of low-volatility organic compounds in the atmosphere."

Duggan;Anna Hodshire;Prajay Vora;Daniel Zimmerle,Using Measurement-Informed Inventory to Assess Emissions in the Denver-Julesburg Basin,"Site-level aerial surveys, while effective in detecting CH4 emissions from upset conditions, face challenges to provide comprehensive long-term emission estimates due to their snapshot measurements, emissions variability, and minimum detection limits. Conversely, annual inventories submitted by operators often exclude emissions from failure events and unregulated sources, leading to incomplete emission estimates. This study introduces a novel methodology that utilizes the Mechanistic Air Emissions Simulator (MAES) to integrate two highly variable estimation methods: inventory and aerial methods. The proposed methodology identifies and characterizes failure events with site-specific information, thereby enhancing the accuracy of inventory programs through the so-called measurement-informed inventories (MIIs). Furthermore, it emphasizes the importance of carefully comparing instantaneous emission measurements from aerial surveys with annual average emissions reported in inventories, as they have distinct timeframes. Colorado State University (CSU) collaborated with the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment (CDPHE) to utilize this approach to enhance reported emissions from the upstream sector in Colorado Denver-Julesburg (DJ) basin. This initiative is part of Colorado's Upstream greenhouse gas (GHG) Intensity Program, a regulatory initiative that requires oil and gas (O&G) operators to monitor, report, and reduce GHG emissions. The goal was to incorporate measured emissions from failure events conducted by Carbon Mapper (CM) in the simulations to derive a multiplier that rectifies for potential omissions of emissions from abnormal conditions within the O&G sector. To simplify the simulation process, prototypical sites were defined in conjunction with operators and are used to represent groups of O&G facilities in the basin with similar configuration. The outcomes of this work indicate that inventories are likely underestimating total emissions, as an additional 16.4% of total emissions from abnormal events is estimated for the basin. This estimate may represent a lower bound, as the survey technologys detection limit may exclude most CH4 emission events below 50 kg/h."

Previous studies have suggested associations of prenatal ambient ozone (O3) exposure with impaired lung function, but the causal relationships remain unclear. In this cross-sectional cohort study, pulmonary function tests were conducted on recruited participants. Prenatal exposure to the maximum daily 8 h average of daily O3 (MDA8 O3) and other environmental factors were estimated. Generalized linear model, generalized propensity score, and inverse probability weighting were used to investigate the causal relationship between MDA8 O3 and impaired lung function. Finally, a total of 1058 children were included. Each 10 μg/m3 increase in MDA8 O3 during the entire pregnancy, the first trimester, and the third trimester was positively associated with the risk of impaired lung function in childhood, with odd ratios and 95% confidence intervals of 1.52 (95%CI: 1.06–2.18), 1.22 (95%CI: 1.06–1.41), and 1.47 (95%CI: 1.19–1.83), respectively. The associations for participants exposed to a high ambient temperature (TM), low relative humidity (RH), and low residential greenness during the pregnancy were higher. Prenatal exposure to higher MDA8 O3 concentrations may cause impaired lung function in childhood.

Using Microwave Limb Sounder and Sounding of the Atmosphere using Broadband Emission Radiometry observations, we demonstrate the interannual variability of UMLT climate during spring and autumn months is controlled by bottom‐up processes: tropical upwelling drives the transport of H2O, increasing atomic hydrogen (H) which destroys O3; the interannual variability of atomic oxygen (O) coincides with that of O3 due to the ozone photochemical equilibrium; radiative and chemical heating of Ox (O and O3) influences temperatures above 90 km (T90). This “upwelling—H2O—Ox—T90” link propagates upward and poleward via dynamic transports. Temperatures at ∼20°S/N near 80 km (T80), dominated by adiabatic cooling, serve as an indicator of tropical upwelling. Notably, mid‐to‐high‐latitude T90 is positively correlated with low‐latitude T80 in both hemispheres, and the interannual variability of H2O, O3, and T90 exhibits remarkable interhemispheric symmetry.

 Recent advancements in satellites, such as the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) have improved the spatial resolution of atmospheric chemical products, enabling more accurate estimation of atmospheric chemical concentrations. However, these satellites still face coverage limitations, posing challenges for monitoring atmospheric chemistry over large spatiotemporal scales. We propose a novel deep-learning model, GM-ESR-ResNet, which uses advanced super-resolution reconstruction for the coarse-resolution OMI data, supported by geo-meteorological covariates, to enhance the spatiotemporal coverage of high-resolution NO₂ columns from the original TROPOMI product. The results indicate that GM-ESR-ResNet significantly outperforms interpolation methods and traditional machine-learning models (which did not incorporate OMI NO₂ columns in prior studies) for spatiotemporal imputation of TROPOMI NO₂ data. The model enhances spatial coverage (imputation ratio = 30 %, correlation r = 0.82 vs. r = 0.42) with superior temporal transferability (MAPE of historical application 0.28 vs. 0.29). Additionally, the enhanced high-resolution NO₂ columns lead to more accurate surface NO₂ estimates than TROPOMI-based results, showing an increase in R2 (0.856 vs. 0.871) and a 6 % reduction in RMSE. Furthermore, GM-ESR-ResNet, using OMI satellite data, successfully generates high-resolution NO₂ columns from 2015 to 2022, even in the absence of TROPOMI data. This enhancement improves the capture of strong spatial gradients in surface NO₂ concentrations and effectively addresses grid-to-point mismatch issues that previously led to substantial overestimations (by 11–30 %) in downwind and rural areas in the original coarse-resolution retrievals. Our study demonstrates the significant potential of super-resolution models in satellite retrievals, which is essential for aligning high-resolution column data with ground-based measurements."

 Residential wood combustion is a major contributor to wintertime air pollution, releasing high concentrations of fine particulate matter and altering aerosol optical properties. Understanding the optical characteristics of wood-burning aerosols is crucial for improving air quality monitoring and refining atmospheric models. In this study, we examined the aerosol optical characteristics in Tirana, Albania, using Polly lidar observations at 532 nm during 2022–2023. For the first time, a lidar campaign was conducted in Albania, enabling long-term profiling of aerosol optical properties up to the tropopause. Our results indicate a dominant contribution of residential wood burning to winter air pollution by measuring exceptionally high extinction-to-backscatter ratios (lidar ratios) within the planetary boundary layer. Significant contributions from controlled biomass burning were identified in winter, with lidar ratios around 100 ± 20 sr measured predominantly in December and January. We analyzed lidar ratios during winter and spring and retrieved intensive and extensive optical properties for selected cases. Lidar-derived particle mass concentration of the emissions ranged from 20–80 μg m−3 in the lowermost heavily polluted smoke layer with a vertical depth of usually 200 to 300 m. The smoke-related AOD, measured with Polly at 532 nm, was typically between 0.05 and 0.1 in the 1200–1700 m deep boundary layer during the main winter months. To provide a regional perspective, lidar ratios and aerosol optical depth (AOD) data from the AERONET (AErosol RObotic NETwork) and 1 km MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer) were included in the analyses. HYSPLIT back-trajectory analysis of three contrasting cases revealed diverse air mass pathways and aerosol transport mechanisms affecting Tirana. These results enhance understanding of aerosol dynamics in urban and regional environments."

Substantial increases in surface ozone have occurred over this period, resulting in an increased risk to human health, driven mainly by increases in anthropogenic NOx emissions and global CH4 concentrations. Fixing anthropogenic NOx emissions at 1850 values in the near-present-day period can eliminate the risk to human health associated with exposure to surface ozone. 
 Elevated concentrations of ozone at the surface can lead to poor air quality and increased risks to human health. There have been large increases in surface ozone over the historical period associated with socio-economic development. Here, the change in peak-season ozone (OSDMA8) is estimated for the first time using hourly surface ozone output from three CMIP6 models over the 1850 to 2014 period. Additional results are obtained from one model to quantify the impact from different drivers of ozone formation, including anthropogenic emissions of ozone and aerosol precursors, stratospheric ozone, and climate change. The peak-season ozone concentrations are used to calculate the risk to human health, in terms of the attributable fraction metric (the percentage of deaths from COPD – chronic obstructive pulmonary disease – associated with long-term exposure to elevated ozone concentrations). OSDMA8 concentrations are simulated to increase by more than 50 % across northern mid-latitude regions over the historical period, mainly driven by increases in anthropogenic emissions of NOx and global CH4 concentrations. Small contributions are made from changes in other anthropogenic precursor emissions (CO and non-CH4 volatile organic compounds; VOCs), aerosols, stratospheric ozone and climate change. The proportion of the global population exposed to OSDMA8 concentrations above the theoretical minimum risk exposure level (32.4 ppb) increased from <20 % in 1855 to >90 % in 2010. This has also increased the risk to human health mortality due to COPD from long-term ozone exposure by up to 20 % across Northern Hemisphere regions in the present day. Like for OSDMA8 concentrations, the drivers of the increase in the ozone health risks are attributed mainly to changes in NOx and global CH4. Fixing anthropogenic NOx emissions at 1850 values can eliminate the risk to human health from long-term ozone exposure in the near-present-day period. Understanding the historical drivers of ozone concentrations and their risk to human health can help to inform the development of future pathways that reduce this risk."

This endeavor is challenging in understudied regions. In this work we analyze how reducing levels of precursor chemicals would affect ozone formation in Quito, Ecuador, and Santiago, Chile. 
 Amid the current climate and environmental crises, cities are being called to reduce levels of atmospheric pollutants that also act as short-lived climate forcers, such as ozone and PM2.5. This endeavor presents new challenges, especially in understudied regions. Here, we use a chemical box model to investigate ozone production sensitivity to NOx and VOCs in Quito, Ecuador, and Santiago, Chile. We present ozone production rates (P(O3)) calculated using VOC measurements taken in Santiago, along with VOC vs. CO linear regressions (LRs), and complement the analysis with Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. In Quito, VOC measurements are unavailable. We therefore simulated a range of VOC concentrations using LRs and MC simulations. We modeled P(O3) in March 2021 and for typical conditions per season in 2022. We calculated a range of P(O3) in Quito of 15–50 ppbv h−1 year-round. In Santiago, we found that P(O3) is 23–50 ppbv h−1 in the ozone season (austral summer). Although the P(O3) magnitudes were found to be comparable, Santiago has a well-established ozone season, unlike Quito where concentrations are lower. From sensitivity experiments, alkenes and aromatics contribute 50 % to P(O3) in Santiago and could reach 70 %–90 % in Quito (noon and afternoon). Aldehydes and ketones contribute 30 %–40 % in Santiago and about 20 % in Quito (noon and afternoon). We estimate the isoprene contribution to be 20 % in Santiago and 10 % in Quito. VOC reduction experiments generally lowered P(O3) in both cities. In Santiago, NOx reductions increased the morning P(O3)."

The posterior emissions, calculated by integrating the anthropogenic inventory and satellite observations, showed significant improvement over the prior. Validation against various measurements supports our results. The study offers a deep understanding of ammonia emissions for policymakers and researchers aiming to develop air quality management and mitigation strategies for South Asia. 
 Ammonia has attracted significant attention due to its pivotal role in the ecosystem and its contribution to the formation of secondary aerosols. Developing an accurate ammonia emission inventory is crucial for simulating atmospheric ammonia levels and quantifying its impacts. However, current inventories are typically constructed via the bottom-up approach and are associated with substantial uncertainties. To address this issue, assimilating observations from satellite instruments for top-down emission inversion has emerged as an effective strategy for optimizing emission inventories. Despite the severity of ammonia pollution in South Asia, research in this context remains very limited. This study aims to estimate ammonia emissions in this region by integrating the prior emission inventory from the Community Emissions Data System (CEDS) and the columned ammonia concentration retrievals from the Infrared Atmospheric Sounder Interferometer (IASI). We employ a newly developed four-dimensional ensemble variational (4DEnVar)-based emission inversion system to conduct the calculations, resulting in monthly ammonia emissions for 2019 at a resolution of 0.5° × 0.625°. The annual total estimate for the posterior emission inventory is 12.61 Tg, compared to the prior inventory's 13.32 Tg. Our simulations, driven by the posterior emission inventory, demonstrate superior performance compared to those driven by the prior emission inventory. This performance is validated through comparisons against the IASI observations, the independent column concentration measurements from the advanced satellite instrument Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS), and the ground concentration observations of ammonia and PM2.5. Additionally, the spatial and temporal characteristics of ammonia emissions in South Asia based on the posterior inventory are analyzed. Notably, emissions there exhibit a “double-peak” seasonal profile, with the maximum in July and the secondary peak in May. This observation differs from the “double-peak” trend suggested by the CEDS prior inventory, which identifies the maximum column concentration in May and a second peak in September. The differences may be attributed to a more accurate representation of regional agricultural practices, such as the timing of fertilizer application and meteorological influences like precipitation and temperature."

Box model results show that non-HCHO OVOCs, particularly multifunctional carbonyl compounds, significantly contribute to radical production, with alkene and aromatic oxidation products playing key roles. 
 Oxygenated volatile organic compounds (OVOCs) play a crucial role in atmospheric chemistry, significantly influencing radical production and VOC degradation through photolysis. However, current research on OVOC photolysis is limited by insufficient species coverage in the mechanisms and incomplete understanding from a species-specific perspective. In this study, the photolysis frequencies of 109 OVOCs were compiled into a comprehensive photolysis dataset. Based on their molecular structures, a parameterization for the photolysis frequencies of carbon- and nitrogen-containing OVOCs was developed. By establishing a relationship between species structure and photolysis frequency, this approach avoids the limitation of insufficient quantum yield data, enabling the estimation of photolysis rate constants for compounds lacking experimental measurements. Photolysis frequencies for the dataset species were successfully reproduced with 21 reference values and 10 adjustment coefficients. Using an automated program based on this method, photolysis rate constants for 3039 OVOCs were predicted, and the Master Chemical Mechanism (MCM) v3.3.1 chemical mechanism was updated and expanded to include photolysis for 714 additional species. The introduction of the new photolysis mechanism has altered both the concentrations of photodegradable OVOCs and the relative proportions of their removal pathways. Non-HCHO OVOCs, particularly multifunctional species with carbonyl groups, contribute significantly to ROx radical production. At three different sites, non-HCHO OVOC photolysis accounts for 25 %–45 % of ROx production, surpassing HCHO photolysis. The importance of oxidation products from aromatics and alkenes is highlighted, offering new insights into OVOC photolysis from a species-specific perspective."

 Orphaned wells, meaning unplugged and non-producing wells lacking responsible owners, pose a significant and undersampled environmental challenge due to their vast number and unknown associated emissions. We propose, develop and test an alternative method for estimating emissions from orphaned wells using a forced advection sampling technique (FAST) that can overcome many of the limitations in current methods (cost, accuracy, safety). In contrast to existing ambient Gaussian plume methods, our approach uses a fan-generated flow to force advection between the emission source and a point methane (CH4) sensor. The fan flow field is characterized using a colocated sonic anemometer to measure the 3D wind profile generated by the fan. Using time-series measurements of CH4 concentration and wind, a simple estimate of the CH4 emission rate of the source can be inferred. The method was calibrated using outdoor controlled-release experiments and then tested on four orphaned wells in Lufkin, TX, and Osage County, OK. Our results suggest that the FAST method can provide a low-cost, portable, fast and safe alternative to existing methods with reasonable estimates of orphaned well emissions over a range of leak rates below 40 g h−1 and within certain geometric and atmospheric constraints."

However, clouds are transparent and often have tenuous boundaries. We evaluate the effect of this on stereoscopy using numerical simulations. Stereoscopic techniques retrieve a cloud boundary that is ~100 m interior to the true boundary and is smoother, depending on the cloud shape and resolution of the instrument. This error is similar across views, demonstrating the strength of stereoscopy for detecting changes in cloud geometry. 
 Multi-angle stereoscopic methods are a promising means for retrieving high-resolution cloud volumes and their temporal evolution. Stereoscopic retrievals assume that light emerges from localized points on a surface. We assess the errors introduced by this assumption using synthetic measurements at various wavelengths, solar-viewing geometries, and spatial resolutions generated by applying a 3D radiative transfer model to an ensemble of 841 cloud fields in (8 km × 8 km) domains of varying fractional cover, cloud top bumpiness, microphysics, and optical depth. We show that stereoscopic retrievals of cloud top height (CTH) have biases that vary from −175 to +20 m as the cloud edge extinction profile becomes sharper and absorption increases, all when mean visible cloud optical depth is greater than 5 and with little dependence on instrument resolution between 50 and 250 m. Stereo CTH fields are smoother than the ground truth when CTH variability is concentrated at small spatial scales, viewing angles are oblique, and absorption is weak. We attribute this effect to both the smoothing effect of multiple scattering, which is stronger at wavelengths with weak absorption, and the ill-posed nature of the retrieval in the presence of non-uniform CTH over the stereo-matching window. The standard deviation of stereo CTH errors increases from 25 to 200 m as the standard deviation of CTH increases to 200 m over the 8 km × 8 km domain. More than 50 % of stereo retrievals from two different 50 m resolution stereo viewing pairs of (0°, +38°) and (−38°, 0°) are consistent to within 30 m over 500 m × 500 m regions for clouds with a standard deviation of CTH of less than 200 m. We analyzed airborne lidar observations and found that 75 % of shallow cumulus clouds and all stratocumulus clouds have standard deviations of CTH of less than 200 m over 8 km transects. These results support the application of time-differenced stereoscopic cloud top height retrievals for the remote sensing of high-resolution cloud dynamics as well as macrophysics."

 We present top-down global gridded emissions of NOx for the year 2022. This dataset is constructed from retrievals of tropospheric vertical column densities (VCDs) of NO2 by the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) spaceborne instrument associated with winds and atmospheric composition data from ECMWF reanalyses, using an improved version of a mass-balance atmospheric inversion. The dataset has a spatial resolution of 0.0625° × 0.0625°, and delivers a detailed overview of the distribution of emissions. It allows the identification of intense area sources, such as cities, and isolated emitters, such as power plants or cement kilns, but does not correctly represent biomass burning. At global level, the emissions obtained are consistent with the EDGARv6.1 bottom-up inventory, although there are differences at regional level, particularly in emerging countries and countries with low observation densities. The emissions of the three largest emitting countries, China, the United States and India, are 6 %, 14 %, and 4% lower than EDGAR estimates, respectively. Uncertainties remain high, and a quantitative analysis of emissions over several averaging periods indicates that averaging emissions uniformly across the year may be sufficient to obtain estimates consistent with annual averages, in regions of the world with high retrieval densities.

Using the FESOM2.1–REcoM3 model, concentrations of key organic biomolecules were estimated and integrated into the ECHAM6.3–HAM2.3 aerosol–climate model. Results highlight the influence of marine biological activity and surface winds on PMOA emissions, with reasonably good agreement with observations improving aerosol representation in the southern oceans. 
 Primary marine organic aerosol (PMOA) contributes significantly to the aerosol loading over remote oceanic regions, where sea spray dominates aerosol production in the lower troposphere, and plays an important role in aerosol–cloud–climate interactions. The sea–atmosphere transfer of organic components depends on their abundance at the ocean surface and their physicochemical characteristics. We introduce a novel approach for representing the ocean concentration of the most abundant organic groups in seawater that are relevant for aerosols. By apportioning the phytoplankton-exuded dissolved organic carbon, modelled in the biogeochemistry model FESOM2.1–REcoM3, three biomolecule groups are computed (dissolved carboxylic acidic containing polysaccharides (PCHO), dissolved combined amino acids (DCAA), and polar lipids (PL)). The transfer of these marine groups to the atmosphere is represented by the OCEANFILMS (Organic Compounds from Ecosystems to Aerosols: Natural Films and Interfaces via Langmuir Molecular Surfactants) parameterization which is implemented in the aerosol–climate model ECHAM6.3–HAM2.3 to represent the emission and transport processes in the atmosphere. The concentration of biomolecules in the ocean serves as the bottom boundary condition for the PMOA simulation within the aerosol model. Among the simulated organic groups in seawater, modelled PCHO is the most prevalent, followed by DCAA and PL. Conversely, PL contributes the most to the organic matter in aerosols, given the high air–seawater affinity of lipids compared to the other groups. Biomolecules exhibit minor variations in equatorial waters, whereas strong seasonal patterns are observed towards the polar regions. The global aerosol model simulations indicate that PMOA emission fluxes are primarily influenced by marine biological activity and surface wind conditions. Based on the most comprehensive evaluation to date, the computed levels of biomolecules in the ocean and species-resolved PMOA concentrations are compared with ground-based measurements across the globe. The comparison shows a reasonably good agreement, given the uncertainties in model assumptions and measurements. Model biases in the representation of the marine organic aerosol groups are caused by uncertainties in the aerosol-process representation and the simulated sea salt concentrations. A comparison with a set of long-range in situ aircraft measurements indicates that by including PMOA in the model, the representation of organic aerosols in the southern oceans is significantly improved."

A particular focus was to examine the ultimate fate of HOMs in suspended particles after the completion of gas phase chemistry. The observed dynamics of HOMs, therefore, provides direct insights into the role of condensed-phase chemistry, if any, in modifying their molecular composition. Individual SOA-bound HOMs exhibited remarkably diverse behaviors, and even certain isomers of identical elemental composition appeared to undergo different transformations. A small group of C8–10 and C20 HOMs decayed rapidly in hydrated particles, on a time scale akin to those of organic hydroperoxides. On the other hand, a subset of C12–20 dimers was found to continuously grow in abundance, and the presence of water substantially enhanced their growth rates. This rising trend was well captured by box model simulations that incorporate the kinetics of condensed-phase chemistry, specifically the peroxyhemiacetal formation pathway. The majority of HOMs remained structurally stable across all hydrous and photolytic conditions investigated in this study.

Despite limited spatial sampling, the approach yields robust emission estimates consistent with other studies. To explore drivers of variability, the analysis examines correlations between inferred emissions and urban characteristics including population, residential gas usage, and infrastructure. Results show that residential building volume outperforms population as a predictor in some regions, highlighting the importance of infrastructure-specific factors. By demonstrating a scalable observation-based approach using minimal sites, this work addresses key gaps in urban CH4 monitoring and emphasizes the value of robust measurements and tailored proxies for improving emission estimates in diverse urban settings."

The observed characteristics of seasonally achieved regional radiative convective equilibrium (RCE) state over the eastern edge of the northwest Pacific region are investigated. The target region exhibits a sharp transition of energy balance from a strong energy‐losing state before summer to a near‐balance state in late summer with a west‐to‐east dry static energy transport. We then define the non‐RCE and RCE periods to derive and contrast the statistics of convective cloud from CloudSat and precipitation events from IMERG data. During the RCE period, upward mass flux and cloud frequency (CF) increase in moist conditions, while downward flux strengthens with the top‐heavy structure and CF at nearly all altitudes decreases in dry conditions. The longwave cloud radiative effect shows a similar change as the CF. The precipitation event of all sizes tends to be suppressed in dry conditions, while only the development of the large‐sized event is more active than during the non‐RCE period in moist conditions. We also found that over 20% of the large‐sized events are associated with tropical cyclones during the RCE period, while the ratio drops to 1.6% during the non‐RCE period. We propose a diagnostic framework by combining the series of analyses to evaluate convection‐circulation coupling under the constraint of regional RCE in global models with various resolution scales."

Arblaster,Recent southwestern US drought exacerbated by anthropogenic aerosols and tropical ocean warming,"Climate model simulations suggest that both anthropogenic aerosols and tropical ocean warming have contributed to reduced precipitation over the southwestern United States in recent decades, thus making the current drought more likely than previously thought. 
 The southwestern United States is currently in a multi-decade drought that has developed since a precipitation maximum in the 1980s. While anthropogenic warming has made the drought more severe, it is the decline in winter–spring precipitation that has had a more profound effect on water resources and ecosystems. This precipitation decline is not well understood beyond its attribution to the post-1980 La Niña-like cooling trend in tropical sea surface temperatures, which caused a North Pacific anti-cyclonic atmospheric circulation trend conducive to declining precipitation in the southwestern United States. Using a hierarchy of model simulations, we show that, even under El Niño-like sea surface temperature trends, there is a tendency towards a North Pacific anti-cyclonic circulation trend and declining precipitation in the southwestern United States, counter to the canonical El Niño teleconnection. This unintuitive yet robust circulation change arises from non-additive responses to tropical mean sea surface temperature warming and radiative effects from anthropogenic aerosols. The post-1980 period exhibits the fastest southwestern US soil moisture drying among past and future periods of similar length due to the combination of this forced precipitation decline and anthropogenic warming. While the precipitation trend might reverse due to future projected El Niño-like warming and aerosol emissions reduction, it is unlikely to substantially alleviate the currently projected future drought risk. Climate model simulations suggest that both anthropogenic aerosols and tropical ocean warming have contributed to reduced precipitation over the southwestern United States in recent decades, thus making the current drought more likely than previously thought."

 High-altitude platforms offer a low-cost and high-quality alternative to satellites and piloted aircraft for applications from remote sensing to communications. Unlike satellites, balloons can change altitude on demand to navigate or remain stationary by leveraging natural wind variability at different altitudes. While wind variability is known to exist across the upper stratosphere, real-world platforms are operationally constrained to a subset of altitude ranges. Therefore, it is crucial to find which altitude bands contain the most diversity to maximize navigability while minimizing system size and complexity. Here, we introduce an intuitive, effective method to quantify diversity in a wind column and apply it to 338 distinct altitude bands, each evaluated using over 250 million wind profiles from 2020 to 2024. Our results reveal a pronounced ‘Goldilocks’ zone achieved by altitude floors below 16 km and altitude ceilings above 21 km. Operating in this range is essential for having predictable steering winds. This analysis provides a quantitative framework to optimize operating altitudes to maximize navigational potential for the design and operating paradigms of any high-altitude platform. The altitude bands between 16 km and 21 km are critical for steering and navigating high-altitude balloons across seasons and latitudes, according to an analysis of wind diversity metric and climate reanalysis data over 2020-2024 period."

Deep learning (DL) has recently emerged as a promising technique to improve traditional forecasts based on chemistry-transport models (CTMs). However, challenges remain in (1) representing the complex physics of the PM2.5 pollution processes including the emission, transport, and chemical conversion of the pollutants, and (2) probing the interpretability of DL models for trustworthy forecasts and mitigations. Here we learn U-Net deep networks from a reanalysis dataset—the data fusion information by blending available pollutant observations and CTM simulations in China—to represent the best available physics of PM2.5 pollution in this region, and then assess this representation using interpretability methods. This hybridization between CTM and U-Net results in robust improvements by over 30% against the baseline CTM forecasts in root mean square error over 1391 stations of the China National Environmental Monitoring Centre network. Interpretability analysis demonstrates physical consistency, manifesting the roles of wind fields and precursor pollutants in modulating PM2.5 concentration variations through dispersion and chemical processes. A decline in the emission importance from 2013 to 2020 suggests the potential of the deep networks to capture the evolving PM2.5 pollution processes and growing emission uncertainties under China’s continuous significant emission reduction in this period. Such a combination of learning of physics and interpretability analysis is valuable for PM2.5 forecasts that are accurate yet trustworthy for effective pollution mitigation."

Satheesh;Krishnaswamy Krishna Moorthy,Australian bushfire emissions result in enhanced polar stratospheric clouds,"We study the impact of the 2019–2020 Australian bushfires on stratospheric chemistry and polar stratospheric cloud (PSC) dynamics. Our results show that the stratospheric intrusion of bushfire aerosols significantly increases nitric acid in the lower stratosphere, thereby increasing the PSC volume during the Austral winter. Notably, rapid ice PSC nucleation on nitric acid trihydrate particles leads to unusually high ice PSC volumes, highlighting the response of PSCs to an enhanced stratospheric aerosol scenario. 
 Extreme bushfire events amplify climate change by emitting greenhouse gases and destroying carbon sinks. They also cause economic damage, through property destruction, and even fatalities. One such bushfire occurred in Australia in 2019–2020, and this event injected large amounts of aerosols and gases into the stratosphere and depleted the ozone layer. While previous studies have focused on the drivers behind ozone depletion, the bushfire impact on polar stratospheric clouds (PSCs), a paramount factor in ozone depletion, has not been extensively investigated so far. Therefore, this study focuses on the effects of bushfire aerosols on the dynamics and stratospheric chemistry related to PSC formation and its pathways. An analysis from Aura's Microwave Limb Sounder revealed that the enhanced hydrolysis of dinitrogen pentoxide significantly increased nitric acid (HNO3) in the high-latitude lower stratosphere in early 2020. This resulted in an anomalously high areal coverage of PSCs with ice, exceeding 3 standard deviations with respect to background period. Based on Lagrangian backward-trajectory analysis, we find that a predominant fraction (79 %) of the liquid–nitric acid trihydrate (NAT) mixture formed via the ice-free nucleation pathway. These NAT particles subsequently acted as nuclei for ice formation, accounting for 95 % of the observed ice PSCs. This rapid conversion from NAT to ice likely contributed to the strong positive anomaly in ice PSC. This highlights the primary formation pathways of ice and liquid–NAT mixtures and possibly helps us to simulate PSC formation and denitrification process better in climate models. These findings will contribute significantly to a deeper understanding of the impacts of extreme wildfire events on stratospheric chemistry and PSC dynamics."

The time variability of tropospheric ozone is mainly driven by anthropogenic emissions. In this paper, we study the distribution and time variability of ozone from harmonized ground-based observations from five different measurement techniques. Our findings provide clear standard references for atmospheric models and evolving tropospheric ozone satellite data for the 2000–2022 period. 
 Tropospheric ozone trends from models and satellites are found to diverge. Ground-based (GB) observations are used to reference models and satellites, but GB data themselves might display station biases and discontinuities. Reprocessing with uniform procedures, the TOAR-II working group Harmonization and Evaluation of Ground-based Instruments for Free-Tropospheric Ozone Measurements (HEGIFTOM) homogenized public data from five networks: ozonesondes, In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) profiles, solar absorption Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectrometer measurements, lidar observations, and Dobson Umkehr data. Amounts and uncertainties for total tropospheric ozone (TrOC; surface to 300 hPa), as well as free- and lower-tropospheric ozone, are calculated for each network. We report trends (2000 to 2022) for these segments using quantile regression (QR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) for 55 datasets, including six multi-instrument stations. The findings are that (1) median TrOC trends computed with QR and MLR trends are essentially the same; (2) pole-to-pole, across all longitudes, TrOC trends fall within +3 to −3 ppbv per decade, equivalent to (−4 % to +8 %) per decade depending on site; (3) the greatest fractional increases occur over most tropical and subtropical sites, with decreases at northern high latitudes, but these patterns are not uniform; (4) post-COVID trends are smaller than pre-COVID trends for Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude sites. In summary, this analysis conducted in the frame of TOAR-II/HEGIFTOM shows that high-quality, multi-instrument, harmonized data over a wide range of ground sites provide clear standard references for TOAR-II models and evolving tropospheric ozone satellite products for 2000–2022."

However, commonly used aerosol monitoring equipment cannot distinguish inorganic from organic forms of nitrate, which may have different consequences for the environment. We describe a method to differentiate types of nitrates that can be applied to ambient monitoring to improve understanding of its formation and impact. 
 Particulate nitrate is a major component of ambient aerosol around the world, present in inorganic form, mainly as ammonium nitrate, and also as organic nitrate. It is of increasing importance to monitor ambient particulate nitrate, a reservoir of urban nitrogen oxides that can be transported downwind and harm ecosystems. The unit-mass-resolution time-of-flight aerosol chemical speciation monitor equipped with capture vaporizer (CV-UMR-ToF-ACSM) is designed to quantitatively monitor ambient PM2.5 composition. In this paper, we describe a method for separating the organic and ammonium nitrate components measured by CV-UMR-ToF-ACSM based on evaluating the NO2+/NO+ ratio (NOx+ ratio). This method includes modifying the ACSM fragmentation table, time averaging, and data filtering. By using the measured NOx+ ratio of NH4NO3 and a plausible range of NOx+ ratio for organic nitrate aerosol, the measured particulate nitrate can be split into inorganic and organic fractions. Data pre-treatment filters concentrations of particulate nitrate below 0.6–2.0 µg m−3, depending on the time averaging. The method detection limit, when considering ±10 % absolute uncertainty of organic nitrate fraction, is found to be 2 µg m−3 (120 min averaging) to 10 µg m−3 (10 min averaging) for total particulate nitrate concentration and 10 % (120 min) to 20 % (10 min) for organic nitrate fraction. We show that this method is able to distinguish periods with inorganic or organic nitrate as major components at a rural site in the Netherlands. A comparison to a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer equipped with a standard vaporizer (SV-HR-ToF-AMS) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) method shows similar response of increasing particulate organic nitrate fraction with uncertainties mainly from sensitivity to fragmentation table correction when obtaining the NO2+ signal. We propose that researchers use this NOx+ ratio method for CV-UMR-ToF-ACSM (adapting the appropriate fragmentation table and data pre-treatment for each specific application) to quantify the particulate organic nitrate fraction at existing monitoring sites in order to improve understanding of nitrate formation and speciation."

 A novel reference absorption instrument based on photothermal interferometry – the dual-wavelength photothermal aerosol absorption monitor PTAAM-2λ – and scattering measurements are used to characterize filter photometer artifacts in measurements of absorption coefficients of soot- and dust-dominated aerosol samples within laboratory and ambient campaigns. We provide, for different aerosol types, reference values of the multiple-scattering parameter, quantifying the artifact introduced by the interaction between the light, the particles, and the filter.The Aethalometer AE33 and the Continuous Light Absorption Photometer (CLAP) were characterized during a laboratory campaign where different soot and mineral dust samples were measured. Furthermore, ambient measurements during a campaign in Granada, Spain, were used to characterize the AE33 and MAAP (Multiangle Absorption Photometer), a pseudo-reference absorption instrument.The laboratory campaign showed significant wavelength dependence of the calibration parameter, the multiple-scattering parameter C. The C of the AE33 at 450 and 808 nm was 4.08 and 3.95 and 6.25 and 5.27 for propane soot and diesel soot, respectively. For the CLAP, the C was 5.10 and 4.26 and 6.79 and 5.80 for propane and diesel soot, respectively. For the different mineral dust samples analyzed in the laboratory, the C at 450 nm ranged between 2.74 and 3.03 for the AE33 and between 2.50 and 2.80 for the CLAP. The ambient measurements at Granada showed an overall C of 4.72 at 450 nm and of 3.90 at 808 nm for the AE33. The results for both the AE33 and the CLAP show a dependence with the particle size, with fine particles having the highest C values and with the C being reduced and leveling off for larger particles. Both the laboratory and the ambient measurements of the AE33 showed overlapping results.The cross-sensitivity to scattering was smaller for the CLAP than for the AE33. The values of the cross-sensitivity parameter ms at 450 and 808 nm were 3.0 % and 1.5 % for the AE33 and 2.4 % and 0.9 % for the CLAP.The intercomparison of the MAAP with the PTAAM-2λ during the ambient campaign in Granada showed that the MAAP overestimates the absorption coefficients for 47 % at 637 nm and features a  cross-sensitivity to scattering of 2.4 %."

 The Geostationary Interferometric Infrared Sounder (GIIRS) onboard the FY-4B satellite is the world's first and currently the only operational hyperspectral thermal infrared sounder in geostationary orbit, with the unique advantage of continuously scanning the atmosphere over East Asia on an hourly basis during both daytime and nighttime. Compared to previously established low-Earth orbit satellite sounders, developing and applying Level 2 atmospheric products from FY-4B/GIIRS are still in the exploratory stage. In this study, we present an optimal sequential physical retrieval system (OSPRS) for retrieving high-accuracy atmospheric strong absorbers, including water (H2O), ozone (O3) and carbon monoxide (CO) from FY-4B/GIIRS. OSPRS first selects a subset of sensitive spectral channels for each variable based on column- and pressure-related sensitivity. It then determines the optimal retrieval sequence consisting of multiple retrieval steps, aiming to reduce the nonlinearity of each inversion problem and the influence of interfering variables on the primary retrieval targets. Finally, OSPRS employs the optimal estimation method as the retrieval operator to perform the retrieval at each step, outputting the profiles of the primary retrieval targets and critical scientific diagnostic information. We confirm the improved accuracy of OSPRS through Observing System Simulation Experiments (OSSE). We compare OSPRS with existing products and evaluate them based on high-quality in situ data from the Integrated Global Radiosonde Archive H2O, the ground-based Pandonia Global Network O3, and solar absorption Fourier transform infrared CO measurements. The results show that the mean absolute error, linear fitting slope, and correlation coefficient between OSPRS's H2O, O3 and CO and in-situ or ground-based measurements are superior to those of existing products.

 Chromium (Cr) in fine particulate matter (PM2.5) poses a significant environmental health risk. However, current exposure assessments are constrained by insufficient spatial resolution and the neglect of bioaccessible fractions (Bio-Cr). In this study, we developed an advanced method to evaluate high-spatial resolution population-weighted exposure of PM2.5-bound Cr and its bioaccessible fraction (Bio-Cr). By integrating the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model and Land Use Regression (LUR) model through an uncertainty-weighted approach, the coupled model overcomes the limitations of individual models. The method was applied to a Chinese megacity. It captured distinct spatial heterogeneity in Cr and Bio-Cr distributions, with hotspots aligning with industrial and high-traffic areas. The coupled model revealed a pronounced belt-like distribution of Cr concentrations in central urban areas, with a peak value of 0.016 μg/m3, and Bio-Cr concentrations were generally lower, reaching up to 0.011 μg/m3. The population-weighted exposure assessment indicated that high-exposure areas for both Cr and Bio-Cr were primarily located in densely populated urban districts, with exposure risks significantly exceeding the citywide average, highlighting the necessity of targeted pollution control strategies. Additionally, this study introduced a bioavailability species allocation coefficient for Bio-Cr simulation in CMAQ, providing a new perspective for simulating bioaccessible metal concentrations in chemical transport models. To our knowledge, this is the first study to integrate CMAQ and LUR models for high-resolution simulation of bioaccessible metal concentrations.

 We studied the seasonal characteristics of individual particle chemical composition and mixing states in Hefei, China, using micro-Raman spectroscopy to analyze atmospheric particles sampled in May, July, and August 2023 and January 2024. Both inorganics and carbonaceous matter were found within individual particles, with the majority of chemical substances in individual particles being inorganics (54.7 %). Overall, 39.4 % of particles contained two or more chemical substances compared to 25.2 % containing only one chemical substance, implying that chemical species in individual particles were ordinarily in a state of internal mixing. Particles containing nitrate were the major component of individual atmospheric particles in both summer and winter. In addition, particles containing sulfate and particles containing soot were more abundant in winter than in summer. Among particles containing soot, 78.4 % also contained inorganics in summer, and 67.5 % also contained inorganics in winter. Thus, in both summer and winter, soot mixed mainly with inorganics. These findings highlight the seasonal variations in the chemical composition and mixing states of individual atmospheric particles, as well as the mutual influences among the chemicals. This study will contribute to elucidating the chemical evolution of atmospheric particles."

 This study comprehensively investigates nighttime aerosol characteristics across East Asia, addressing a critical gap in current research, as most existing studies focus exclusively on daytime conditions. It systematically examines variations in column-integrated optical properties, vertically resolved extinction profiles, and aerosol-type distributions in six representative regions of East Asia, including Mongolia (MG), Beijing (BJ), Korea (KR), Japan (JP), Hong Kong (HK), and Taiwan (TW). Significant regional differences were identified, with northern regions (MG, BJ, KR, and JP) displaying consistent day-night aerosol optical depth (AOD) and Ångström exponent values. In contrast, southern regions (HK and TW) exhibit pronounced discrepancies. All regions exhibit smoother nighttime extinction profiles than during the daytime. However, northern regions showed sharper vertical decay, while southern regions exhibited secondary peaks attributed to transported smoke aerosols. Additionally, CALIPSO revealed peaks of vertical aerosol distribution at nighttime compared to daytime. Such abnormal phenomenon was then proved to be the more sensitivity of nighttime Lidar signal to upper thin aerosol layers. After removing this bias, the vertical distribution of aerosol types at nighttime is found to be generally consistent with that during the daytime. Meteorological analysis in BJ suggests consistency in AOD-PM relationships between day and night, highlighting temperature as the dominant factor driving seasonal variations in AOD–PM2.5 correlations, followed by relative humidity. The findings provide valuable insights into nighttime aerosol characteristics, supporting future research on diurnal aerosol radiative forcing."

However, its susceptibility to oxidation-induced degradation under ambient conditions prevents its incorporation into devices. In this work, we enhance the stability of MXene-based devices through encapsulation. We developed a sensor based on a heterojunction of Ti3C2TxMXene and silver nanoparticles for formaldehyde detection. This sensor is then encapsulated in poly(1,3,5,7-tetravinyl-1,3,5,7-tetramethylcyclotetrasiloxane) deposited via initiated chemical vapor deposition. Encapsulation substantially improved sensor stability, extending the half life span by more than 200%. These findings were reinforced by molecular dynamic simulations. Furthermore, upon hydration, siloxane in the encapsulant forms silanol which reacts with formaldehyde and boosts sensitivity by 1.7 times. We also demonstrate a rapid, low-energy regeneration process that enables the sensor to attain up to 90% of its previous response after degradation. These enhancements position this sensor as a reliable solution for real-time formaldehyde detection, in applications ranging from indoor air quality monitoring to industrial safety."

Prisle,Impact of Bulk-Phase Self-Assembly on Growth and Activation of Aqueous Surfactant Aerosol,"Surface active compounds (surfactants) have been found in atmospheric aerosols from many environments. In microscopic aqueous droplets, their presence may cause a variety of effects that are challenging to model comprehensively. In this work, we investigate the solute effects of atmospheric surfactant self-assembly to form micelles and small clusters in aqueous droplets. Several water activity models are employed in combination with Köhler theory to represent self-assembly phenomena within the droplet bulk while also accounting for surfactant bulk–surface partitioning. Our results show that surfactant self-assembly has only minor effects at the critical point of cloud droplet activation; however, very significant effects are observed during earlier stages of droplet growth at subsaturated ambient humidities. A major driver is the binding of free sodium counterions to the surfactant aggregates, strongly limiting the effect of dissolved sodium ions on droplet water activity. Variations in droplet equilibrium size at a given subsaturated humidity due to the presence of surfactant aggregates lead to different estimates of droplet water uptake and aerosol liquid water content. As a result, predictions of atmospheric processes involving surfactant aerosol could be highly sensitive to how surfactant self-assembly and related phenomena are taken into account."

How this will change with rising CO2 concentrations in the atmosphere will strongly determine future climate change. An increase in the seasonal variations of atmospheric CO2 in recent decades indicates a positive trend in photosynthetic carbon uptake. We combined data‐driven seasonal cycles of plant productivity with carbon sinks across the range predicted by current biospheric process models to explain the seasonal variations of CO2 at high and low northern latitudes over the past 40 years. We find that increases in seasonal variations can only be explained by a larger gross primary productivity (GPP) of northern ecosystems than most current estimates and by an increase of GPP about proportional to the increase in atmospheric CO2, also larger than most current estimates.

Sellegri,Sensitivity Study of Atmospheric DMS Simulated in WRF‐Chem to Various Oceanic DMS Fields Over the South West Pacific,"Marine emission of the volatile gas dimethyl sulfide (DMS) is the most substantial source of natural sulfur in the global atmosphere. DMS is believed to play a significant role in the Earth's climate system as a precursor to new particle formation and cloud condensation nuclei in the pristine marine atmosphere. To simulate the global distribution of seawater DMS, atmospheric models use DMS climatologies. In this study, we tested the sensitivity of atmospheric DMS concentrations over the Southwest Pacific Ocean, simulated with the WRF‐Chem regional model, to five seawater DMS climatologies developed over the last two decades together with seawater DMS inferred from a recently developed relationship from nanophytoplankton satellite retrievals. Comparisons with in situ observations recently obtained in the Southwest Pacific and the Southern Ocean revealed that oceanic DMS climatologies are less accurate for latitudes south of 65°S than between 40°S and 65°S. In addition, in our study area, the spatial distribution of marine DMS is more accurately reproduced in the 40–65°S latitudes when deduced from a surface ocean biological variable, particularly when using a recently derived relationship from nanophytoplankton satellite retrievals, rather than from observation‐based climatologies. Simulated atmospheric DMS levels were sensitive to the oceanic DMS climatology used but the atmospheric DMS concentration variability was mostly dependent on the atmospheric dynamics. Atmospheric DMS concentrations and variability measured off the New‐Zealand coast are fairly well reproduced in WRF‐Chem using accurate phytoplanktonic assemblages and the nanophytoplankton‐related seawater DMS concentration."

Photochemical assessment monitoring stations (PAMS) routinely measure a key group of ROG, that is, hydrocarbons, which have been used for source apportionment in past decades. This study took Shanghai megacity as an example to investigate the differences in chemical characteristics and source apportionment between PAMS species and a more comprehensive set of ROG, including high‐carbon alkanes, terpenoids, N‐containing and oxygenated species. We found PAMS species accounted for only 44.1% and 24.7% of ROG, respectively, in carbon concentration and OH reactivity. Comprehensive ROG characterization especially advances in source attribution: (a) source apportionment based on ROG species (ROG method) resolved nine sources compared to PAMS method, which resolved six sources with two of them remained as mixed sources, and among the newly identified sources by ROG method, three were attributed to combustion activities, specifically, diesel, coal, and biomass combustion; (b) improved temporal correlations between resolved sources and the corresponding tracers, such as gasoline exhaust, fuel evaporation, and solvent usage further confirming the source origin; (c) increased fractional contributions from industrial and combustion sources. To summarize, we found fugitive sources (solvent usage, fuel evaporation, and industrial process) dominated with PAMS method, but combustion sources outweighed fugitive sources with ROG method. These distinct results indicate PAMS method may underestimate combustion‐related ROG emissions. Although current clean air policies focus on the abatement of fugitive sources, combustion emission reductions require greater future attention."

 Gas–particle partitioning (GPP) of oxygenated semi–volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) is crucial for atmospheric organic aerosol formation, yet large uncertainties persist in its simulation due to challenges in obtaining accurate parameters. This study focuses on nitro–phenolic species (NPs), representative oxygenated SVOCs impacting solar radiative balance and atmospheric chemistry. Concurrent measurements of gaseous and particulate NPs at a subtropical coastal site showed particulate fractions ranging from 8.6% to 53%, which deviated from traditional theoretical estimates by factors of 0.26 to 104. To address these discrepancies, a field-based activity coefficient (ζ) was derived by integrating measured parameters and theoretical considerations. Incorporating ζ into a box model significantly improved simulations for mono–NPs and uncovered a more complex GPP process for di–NPs than previously recognized. The successful application of ζ in a regional model highlights its broader applicability and calls for more quantitative studies for various SVOCs."

 The contrasting responses of surface ozone to high-temperature conditions were investigated at El Arenosillo coastal observatory (southwestern Europe) using 24 years of data (2000–2023). Two event types were defined: high-ozone/high-temperature (HOHT) and low-ozone/high-temperature (LOHT) events. A total of 52 HOHT and 291 LOHT events were identified, with a fourfold decline in HOHT frequency during the later decade (2012−2023) compared to 2000–2011. On average, HOHT days recorded 15.4 ± 7.9 ppb more ozone than LOHT days, with differences peaking at 30 ppb. Temperature increases during LOHT events reached up to 7.1 °C. Two representative cases were analysed, both exceeding 30 °C and dominated by coastal breeze circulation, yet displaying opposite ozone behaviours. HOHT events were associated with anticyclonic ridging over central Europe, northerly flow from southern Portugal, and easterly winds through the Strait of Gibraltar, facilitating ozone transport from Portugal and the western Mediterranean, which was subsequently trapped inland by sea breezes. In contrast, LOHT events coincided with a weakened anticyclone and a deeper Icelandic Low, blocking Mediterranean ventilation and inducing westerly flow in the Strait, which diverted ozone transport eastward and inhibited accumulation locally. These contrasting circulation patterns may shift in frequency under global warming, potentially reducing ozone pollution in this coastal area while enhancing it elsewhere in the western Mediterranean. Understanding the evolving role of large-scale dynamics is critical to anticipate future ozone variability and heat extremes in this transitional region between marine and continental influences."

By applying machine learning to a combination of satellite and reanalysis data, cirrus clouds are classified into different formation regimes. Depending on the regime, increasing dust aerosol concentrations can either decrease or increase the number of ice crystals. This challenges the idea of using cloud seeding to cool the planet, as it may unintentionally lead to warming instead. 
 The microphysical and radiative properties of cirrus clouds are strongly dependent on the ice nucleation mechanism and origin of the ice crystals. Due to sparse temporal coverage of satellite data and limited observations of ice-nucleating particles (INPs) at cirrus levels, it is notoriously hard to determine the origin of the ice and the nucleation mechanism of cirrus clouds in satellite observations. In this work we combine 3 years of satellite observations of cirrus clouds from the DARDAR-Nice retrieval product with Lagrangian trajectories of reanalysis data of meteorological and aerosol variables calculated 12 h backward in time for each observed cirrus cloud. In a first step, we identify typical cirrus cloud formation regimes by clustering the Lagrangian trajectories and characterize observed microphysical properties for in situ and liquid origin cirrus clouds in mid-latitudes and the tropics. On average, in situ cirrus clouds have smaller ice water content (IWC) and lower ice crystal number concentration (Nice) and a strong negative temperature dependence of Nice, while liquid origin cirrus have a larger IWC, higher Nice and a strong positive temperature dependence of IWC. In a second step, we use MERRA2 reanalysis data to quantify the sensitivity of cirrus cloud microphysical properties to a change in the concentration of dust particles that may act as INPs. By identifying similar cirrus cloud formation pathways, we can condition on ice origin, region, and meteorological dependencies, and quantify the impact of dust particles for different formation regimes. We find that at cloud-top median Nice decreases with increasing dust concentrations for liquid origin cirrus. Specifically, the sensitivities are between 6 % and 7 % per order of magnitude increase in dust in the tropics and between 15 % in the mid-latitudes. The decrease in Nice can be explained by increased heterogeneous ice nucleation in the mixed-phase regime, leading to fewer cloud droplets freezing homogeneously once the cloud enters the cirrus temperatures and glaciates. The resulting fewer, but larger, ice crystals are more likely to sediment, leading to reduced IWC, as for example observed for liquid origin cirrus in the mid-latitudes. In contrast, for high-altitude in situ cirrus in the tropics, we find an increase of Nice median values of 11 % and IWC median values of 17 % per unit increase of dust aerosol in logarithmic space. We assume that this is caused by heterogeneous nucleation of ice initiated by dust INPs in INP-limited conditions with supersaturations between the heterogeneous and homogeneous freezing thresholds. Such conditions frequently occur at high altitudes, especially in tropical regions at temperatures below 200 K.Our results provide an observational line of evidence that the climate intervention method of seeding cirrus clouds with potent INPs may potentially result in an undesired positive cloud radiative effect (CRE), i.e., a warming effect. Instead of producing fewer but larger ice crystals, we show that additional INPs can lead to an increase in Nice and IWC, an effect called overseeding."

Suresh Babu,Energy‐Balance Decomposition of the Aerosol‐Induced Changes on Surface Temperature Over South Asia,"Aerosol‐radiation interactions decrease the solar radiation reaching the surface, which cools the surface and influences land‐atmosphere interactions and affects the regional climate through various pathways. To estimate the change in radiative and nonradiative fluxes due to aerosol‐radiation interactions, regional climate model simulations were carried out over the South Asian region. Using the energy balance equation, aerosol‐induced changes in surface temperature are decomposed into its radiative (shortwave (SW) and longwave) and nonradiative (sensible heat flux (SHF), latent heat flux (LHF), and ground flux) components for different seasons. This study showed that the surface cooling due to the decrease in SW radiation is mainly compensated by the decrease in SHF in all seasons. The decrease in SHF is more than 50% of the decrease in SW radiation due to aerosols over the Indo‐Gangetic Plain (IGP). Aerosol‐induced changes in incoming longwave radiation have a cooling effect over the Indian region except over the western part of South Asia. The aerosol‐induced changes in LHF are highly heterogeneous and insignificant except for monsoon season. Over IGP, the decrease in LHF compensates nearly 15% of the SW cooling due to aerosols during monsoon season. Over the Indian region, approximately 40%–50% of the SW cooling due to aerosols is translated to net change in surface temperature, whereas the remaining is adjusted by the decrease of SHF and LHF. Notably, the impact of aerosol‐induced weakening of SHF remains unexplored but holds profound implications for the hydroclimate and air quality of the Indian subcontinent."

Due to diverse source regions and changes during long‐range transport, dust aerosols exhibit varying mineralogical compositions, leading to distinct regional optical and microphysical properties. However, the impact of mineralogical composition on satellite‐based dust property retrievals is far from being well understood. This study develops a physics‐based synergistic retrieval system to infer two fundamental properties, dust aerosol optical thickness (DAOT) and effective radius, leveraging observations from the Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) and Infrared Imaging Radiometer (IIR) onboard the Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) satellite. This algorithm relies on the TAMUdust2020 aerosol single‐scattering database with a region‐ and mineralogy‐dependent refractive index data set and does not depend on an empirical assumption about the lidar ratio. Through simulations and retrievals utilizing a region‐specific dust optical property model, this study demonstrates that the measurements made by CALIOP and IIR, as well as the retrievals of DAOT and effective particle radius, are significantly influenced by the mineralogical composition of dust aerosols, exhibiting distinct behavior that varies depending on their source regions. This influence is particularly pronounced for dust aerosols originating from Taklamakan, Namib, Niger, and Australia, which underscores the importance of incorporating regional mineralogical variations into the retrieval process."

Although the background total particle concentrations averaged 2,500 cm−3, the air mass was also influenced by frequent but irregular periods of ship emission with significantly higher aerosol concentrations at times exceeding 34,000 cm−3. Ship emission influenced periods, typically lasting <10 min, contained smaller, less hygroscopic particles resulting in a 69% relative decline in cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) activated fraction at 1% supersaturation compared to background periods. Measurements in continental air masses northwest of Houston revealed an average aerosol concentration of 5,208 cm−3 with a κ value near 0.1 reasonably describing the CCN population, independent of particle size. In continental air masses, substantial differences in particle size and CCN activation over small distances (<42 miles between sites) suggest considerable site‐to‐site variability in addition to the expected day‐to‐day differences. This small‐scale variability makes it difficult to generalize continental air mass aerosol properties. Both coastal and inland locations had effective ice nucleating particles, but inland deployments observed the warmest nucleation temperature at −15.6°C compared to −17.8°C close to the coast. These measurements can reduce uncertainties in regional convection allowing models to improve understanding of aerosol‐cloud interactions."

 Anthropogenic CO2 emissions, particularly from strong point sources like power plants, play a crucial role in the increase of atmospheric CO2 through a complex interaction with the natural carbon sinks. China successfully launched the Atmospheric Environment Monitoring Satellite (AEMS) loaded with integrated path differential absorption (IPDA) lidar and high-spectral-resolution lidar (HSRL) on April 16, 2022. This satellite is capable of simultaneously detecting atmospheric CO2 and aerosols. Using AEMS data, we developed a point-source emission retrieval algorithm based on a modified three-dimensional Gaussian plume model and applied it to 12 satellite overpasses of major power plants. Compared with emissions reported by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), our retrievals exhibit an average relative deviation of 6.23 % in the validation cases, which represents a 31.63 % reduction in error compared to the traditional two-dimensional model-based method. In all cases, the estimated emissions exhibit strong agreement with EPA data (R = 0.84) and a low mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.1 kt/day. The analysis indicates that the uncertainty of the emission inversion results ranges from about 12 % to 21 %, with an average of 17.1 %. These results demonstrate the ability of the IPDA–HSRL synergy to accurately quantify point source CO2 emissions, and can supplement and verify existing bottom-up inventory methods."

 This study systematically investigates the vertical structure characteristics and driving mechanisms of tropospheric aerosols over the North China Plain (NCP) based on Cloud-Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization (CALIOP) aerosol profiles from 2007 to 2022, combining K-means clustering, regression analysis, and Weather Research and Forecasting with Chemistry model (WRF-Chem) simulations. Seasonal cluster analysis identified four typical vertical structures during daytime, with the Elevated Aerosol Layer (EAL) in summer being the most prominent. Significant aerosol accumulation occurs within the 500–1500 m height range during this season, contributing nearly 50 % of the tropospheric Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD). Analysis of long-term CALIOP data further revealed a significant decreasing trend in AOD over the study region between 2013 and 2020, a change closely linked to emission reduction policies implemented during the same period. To delve deeper into the causes of the aerosol accumulation phenomenon at 500–1500 m and the influencing factors and vertical distribution characteristics of the AOD decline, we designed WRF-Chem sensitivity experiments combined with regression analysis. The results indicate that both emission factors and meteorological factors influence AOD, but their dominance varies with height: emissions primarily affect near-surface aerosols below 500 m, while meteorology dominates the variations at heights of 500–1500 m. Specifically, hygroscopic growth, thermal convection, bounce and resuspension of coarse particles, and long-range transport collectively enhance aerosol accumulation at 500–1500 m. Consequently, policy-driven emission reductions significantly lowered near-surface aerosol concentrations, which is crucial for mitigating population exposure risks. However, the aerosol accumulation phenomenon at 500–1500 m persists regardless of emission changes, as it is primarily driven by meteorological factors."

Soden;Ryan J. Kramer;Tristan S. L'Ecuyer;Haozhe He,Observational constraints suggest a smaller effective radiative forcing from aerosol–cloud interactions,"This study addresses the long-standing challenge of quantifying the impact of aerosol–cloud interactions. Using satellite observations, reanalysis data, and a ""perfect-model"" cross-validation, we show that explicitly accounting for aerosol–cloud droplet activation rates is key to accurately estimating ERFaci (effective radiative forcing due to aerosol–cloud interactions). Our results indicate a smaller and less uncertain ERFaci than previously assessed, implying the reduced role of aerosol–cloud interactions in shaping climate sensitivity. 
 The effective radiative forcing due to aerosol–cloud interactions (ERFaci) is difficult to quantify, leading to large uncertainties in model projections of historical forcing and climate sensitivity. In this study, satellite observations and reanalysis data are used to examine the low-level cloud radiative responses to aerosols. While some studies assume that the activation rate of cloud droplet number concentration (Nd) in response to variations in sulfate mass concentration (SO42-) has a one-to-one relationship, we find this assumption to be incorrect. Our analysis estimates a global mean activation rate of 0.35 ± 0.17 (90 % confidence) and demonstrates that explicitly accounting for the activation rate is crucial for accurate ERFaci estimation. This is corroborated through a “perfect-model” cross-validation using state-of-the-art climate models. Our results suggest a smaller and less uncertain value of the global ERFaci (−0.32 ± 0.21 W m−2 for SO42-, 90 % confidence) than recent climate assessments (e.g., −0.93 ± 0.7 W m−2, 90 % confidence), indicating that ERFaci may be less impactful than previously thought. Our results are also consistent with observationally constrained estimates of total cloud feedback and recent estimates that models with weaker ERFaci better match the observed hemispheric warming asymmetry over the historical period."

Fu;Neng-Huei Lin;Guey-Rong Sheu;Wei-Syun Huang,Modeling CMAQ dry deposition treatment over the western Pacific: a distinct characteristic of mineral dust and anthropogenic aerosols,"The accuracy of the chemical transport model, a key focus of our research, is strongly dependent on the dry deposition parameterization. Our findings show that the refined CMAQ dust model correlated well with ground-based and high-altitude in situ measurements by implementing the suggested dry deposition schemes. Furthermore, we reveal the mixing state of two types of aerosols at the upper level, a finding supported by both the optimized model and measurements. 
 Dry deposition plays a vital role in the aerosol removal process from the atmosphere. However, the chemical transport model (CTM) is sensitive to the dry deposition parameterization but remains uncertain due to limited measurements of particle deposition. By utilizing the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) version 5.4 with the refined dust emission treatment, the East Asian dust (EAD) simulation during January 2023 and spring 2021 was constructed to evaluate the performance of dry deposition parameterizations, namely S22, E20, and P22. The results showed that the dry deposition parameterization could significantly impact the CMAQ dust concentration in the air. By implementing the E20 dry deposition scheme, the CMAQ simulation performance of the surface PM10 has been considerably improved, with a normalized mean bias (NMB) of −41.9 %, as compared to that from S22 (−47.01 %) and P22 (−53.90 %). The modeled PM10 pattern by E20 at the upper level (700 hPa) was mostly consistent with the observed PM10 at the Lulin Atmospheric Background Station (LABS; 23.47° N, 120.87° E; 2862 m a.s.l.), which is a typical background site in the western Pacific, particularly in capturing the peak value. The correlations (R) at high altitudes were well represented for E20 by 0.55, as compared to S22 (0.54) and P22 (0.46). Moreover, E20 improved the simulated PM10 concentrations and aerosol optical depth (AOD) values over the Asian continent during the multiple dust episodes in spring 2021, by an NMB of −25.43 % and −26.19 %, respectively. The noticeable reduction of the coarse-mode particle deposition velocity (Vd) was responsible for reducing the PM10 simulation underestimation. On 22–31 January 2023, the in situ measurement of the upper level observed the possibility of natural dust and anthropogenic aerosol. This is consistent with the CMAQ, which shows that both aerosol types displayed a clear “long dust–black carbon belt” along 15° N. It is revealed that an increase in surface resistivity (Rb) leads to a significant increase in dust mass concentration but a minor increase in black carbon (BC). We propose implementing the E20 dry deposition approach, particularly in PM10 simulation, to narrow the uncertainty of the CMAQ dust emission treatment."

Elevated temperatures and weak winds contributed to the increase in ozone precursors, resulting in enhanced ozone production. Large amounts of ozone aloft also contributed to the increase in surface ozone via vertical transport. Notably, ozone from Southeast Asia contributed through this mechanism. 
 Severe ozone pollution may occur in the Great Bay Area (GBA) when typhoons approach South China. However, numerical models often fail to capture the high ozone concentrations during the episodes, leading to uncertainties in understanding their formation mechanisms. This study conducted an ensemble simulation with 30 members (EMs) using the WRF-Chem model, coupled with a self-developed ozone source apportionment method, to analyze an extremely high ozone episode associated with Typhoon Nida in the summer of 2016. The newly proposed index effectively distinguished between well-performing (good) and poorly performing (bad) EMs. Compared to the bad EMs, the good EMs accurately reproduced surface ozone variations, particularly capturing the extremely high concentrations observed in the afternoon of 31 July. The formation of such high ozone levels was attributed to the retention of ozone in the residual layer at night and the enhanced photochemistry during the daytime. As Typhoon Nida approached, weak winds confined large amounts of ozone in the residual layer at night. The development of the planetary boundary layer (PBL) facilitated the downward transport of ozone aloft, contributing to the rapid increase in surface ozone in the following morning. The enhanced photochemistry was primarily driven by increased ozone precursors resulting from favorable accumulation conditions and enhanced biogenic emissions. During the period of high ozone concentrations, contributions from local and surrounding regions increased. Additionally, ozone from southeastern Asia could transport to the GBA at high altitudes and then contribute to surface ozone when the PBL developed."

Tardito Chaudhri;David S. Stevenson,Soil deposition of atmospheric hydrogen constrained using planetary-scale observations,"There remains a large uncertainty in the global warming potential of atmospheric hydrogen due to poor constraints on its soil deposition and, therefore, its lifetime. A new analysis of the latitudinal variation in the observed seasonality of hydrogen is used to constrain its surface fluxes. This is complemented with a simple latitude–height model where surface fluxes are adjusted from a prototype deposition scheme. 
 Quantifying soil deposition fluxes remains the greatest source of uncertainty in the atmospheric H2 budget.  A new method is presented to constrain H2 deposition schemes in global models using observations of the zonal mean H2 distribution and seasonality.  A “best-fit” scheme that reproduces the observed zonal-mean seasonality of atmospheric H2 at the planetary scale is found by perturbing a prototype deposition scheme based on soil temperature and moisture dynamics.  Comparing the best-fit and prototype schemes provides insight into how the prototype scheme may be improved to better reproduce observed seasonality.  The H2 signal driven by the prototype scheme is accurate compared to observations in the Northern Hemisphere extratropics but shows discrepancies in the Southern Hemisphere, with surface mixing ratios that are too high and seasonality that is too weak.  A best-fit scheme indicates that the function capturing the soil microbial consumption of H2 requires a shift of +2 to +3 months in the seasonality in the tropics, with peak uptake shifting from February to April in the southern tropics and from August to October in the northern tropics, compared with a prototype scheme sensitive to seasonal soil moisture driven by the shifting of the Intertropical Convergence Zone.  New constraints on the H2 surface flux at low latitudes are key to accurately modelling the H2 cycle in the Southern Hemisphere."

The performance and consistency of satellite algorithms in observing Aralkum-generated saline dust remain unknown. This study compares multisensor UVAI (ultraviolet aerosol index), AOD (aerosol optical depth), and ALH (aerosol layer height) products and reveals inconsistencies and potential biases over the Aral Sea basin. 
 The Aralkum Desert presents a challenging environment for satellite aerosol observations due to its very bright, heterogeneous, and dynamic surfaces and the lack of in situ constraints on region-specific aerosol properties. We survey current global satellite algorithms capable of detecting the presence, column burden, and elevation of airborne dust over the Aral Sea basin. Discrepancies and potential biases in retrieved UV aerosol index (UVAI), mid-visible and thermal infrared optical depth (AOD), and layer height due to different assumptions on surface and aerosol properties are assessed. The results indicate that (1) UVAI products consistently delineate dust plume extent but show large positive values over turbid waters and salt flats due to enhanced surface absorption. (2) MODIS and VIIRS total and coarse-mode AOD retrievals show strong agreement over the Caspian Sea despite using different aerosol optical models. Over desert surfaces, all operational AOD products misclassify fresh dust plumes as clouds and exhibit strong nonlinear relationships. The NOAA EPS algorithm retrieves significantly lower AOD than others, although the agreement improves when a dust optical model is used. The MISR research algorithm produces higher, more consistent AOD and improved particle property retrievals compared to the MISR operational product. (3) Among four IASI infrared products, the LMD algorithm performs best in detecting dust plume features over both desert and water surfaces. (4) The EPIC aerosol optical centroid height (AOCH) product overestimates dust layer altitude under low aerosol loadings but exhibits good agreement with CALIOP in detecting the elevated dust characterized by well-defined upper boundaries. MISR height retrievals also align well with CALIOP and EPIC. IASI infrared retrievals are about 0.4 km higher than EPIC over dust-laden scenes. This study underscores the value of a synergistic, multisensor approach leveraging the complementary strengths of satellite aerosol products and calls for their appropriate application and careful interpretation when characterizing saline dust from the Aralkum Desert."

By integrating FLEXPART dispersion model outputs with ground-based ACTRIS lidar observations, the approach estimates Etna's volcanic particle emissions and highlights a significant enhancement in the forecast accuracy. 
 Modeling the dispersion of volcanic particles following explosive eruptions is critical for aviation safety. To constrain the dispersion of volcanic plumes and assess hazards, calculations rely on the accurate characterization of the eruption's source term, e.g., variation in emission rate and column height with time and the prevailing wind fields. This study introduces an inverse modeling framework that integrates a Lagrangian dispersion model with lidar observations to estimate emission rates of volcanic particles released during an Etna eruption. The methodology consists of using the FLEXPART model to generate source–receptor relationships (SRRs) between the volcano and the lidar system that observed the volcanic plume. These SRRs are then used to derive the emission rates based on observational data, including volcanic ash plume heights from the INGV-EO observatory and PollyXT lidar retrievals. We leverage data from the ACTRIS PollyXT lidar that operates at the PANhellenic GEophysical observatory of Antikythera of the National Observatory of Athens (PANGEA-NOA). The inversion algorithm utilizes lidar observations and an empirical a priori emission profile to estimate the volcanic particle source strength, accounting for altitude and time of the plume's evolution. Additionally, to study the impact that the wind fields have on volcanic ash forecasting, the experiment is repeated using fields that assimilate Aeolus wind lidar data. Our approach applied to the 12 March 2021 Etna eruption and accurately captures a dense aerosol layer between 8 and 12 km above the PANGEA-NOA station. Results show a minimal difference of the order of 2 % between the observed and the simulated ash concentrations. Furthermore, the structure of the a posteriori ash plume closely resembles the ash cloud image captured by the SEVIRI satellite above Antikythera island, highlighting the novelty of the inversion results. The presented inversion algorithm, coupled with Aeolus data, optimizes both the vertical emission distribution and Etna emission rates, advancing our understanding and preparedness for volcanic events."

 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), such as isoprene, impact aerosols, ozone and methane, adding uncertainty to assessments  of the climate impacts of land cover change. Recent United Kingdom Earth System Model (UKESM) developments allow us to study how various processes impact biosphere–atmosphere interactions and their implications for atmospheric chemistry, while advances in remote sensing provide new opportunities for assessing biases in isoprene alongside formaldehyde and aerosol optical depth (AOD).The standard setup of UKESM1.1 underestimates the regional formaldehyde column by up to 80 %, despite positive isoprene biases of over 500 %. Seasonal average AOD values are underestimated by over 60 % in parts of the Northern Hemisphere but overestimated (> 180 %) in the Congo.The effects of several processes are studied to understand their impacts on satellite–model biases. Of these, changing from the default to a more detailed chemistry mechanism has the greatest impact on the simulated trace gases. Here, the isoprene lifetime decreases by 50 %, the formaldehyde column increases by > 20 %, whilst reductions in upper-tropospheric oxidant mixing ratios decrease sulfate nucleation (−32 %). Organically mediated boundary layer nucleation and contributions to aerosol mass from isoprene oxidation decrease AOD values in the Northern Hemisphere, while revised BVOC emission factors and land cover representation affect the emissions of BVOCs and dust.The combination of processes substantially affects regional model–satellite biases, typically decreasing isoprene and AOD and increasing formaldehyde. We find significant differences in the aerosol direct radiative effects (+0.17 W m−2), highlighting that these processes may have substantial ramifications for impact assessments of land use change."

A radiative closure assessment of these retrievals is performed by the ACMB-DF processor. Radiative transfer models acting on retrieved information produce broadband radiances commensurate with measurements made by EarthCARE’s broadband radiometer. Measured and modelled radiances for small domains are compared, and the likelihood of them differing by 10 W m2 defines the closure. 
 Measurements made by three instruments aboard the EarthCARE satellite, plus data  from auxiliary sources, will be used synergistically to retrieve estimates of cloud and aerosol properties. The ACMB-DF processor consists of a continuous radiative closure assessment of these retrievals and is both described and demonstrated in this study. The closure procedure begins with 3D radiative transfer models (RTMs) acting on retrieved and auxiliary data. These models yield upwelling shortwave and longwave broadband radiances commensurate with measurements made by EarthCARE's multi-angle broadband radiometer (BBR). Measured and modelled radiances are averaged up to “assessment domains” that measure ∼ 21 km along-track by no more than 5 km across-track, centred on the retrieved cross-section of ∼ 1 km profiles, and are then combined, by angular distributions models (ADMs), to produce “effective” upwelling fluxes at top-of-atmosphere, denoted as FBBR and FRTM, respectively. Last, the probability pΔF^ of |FRTM−FBBR| being less than ΔF^ W m−2 is estimated recognizing as many sources of, assumed normally distributed, uncertainties as possible. For historical/programmatic reasons, ΔF^ is set to 10 W m−2, but that might change during EarthCARE's commissioning phase and with Sun angle. The closure process is demonstrated up to calculation of pΔF^ using four 400 km long portions of one of EarthCARE's test frames for which simulated passive measurements were computed by 3D RTMs. Note that this study, like the ACMB-DF process with real EarthCARE observations, does not comment explicitly on performance of retrieval algorithms."

Furthermore, the observed mole fractions are compared against the mean marine boundary layer product for the Northern Hemisphere. The comparisons of all the systems show good agreement in relation to the World Meteorological Organization/Global Atmosphere Watch network compatibility goal limits for CO2 and CH4. 
 Accurate and precise observations of atmospheric greenhouse gas mole fractions are crucial for understanding the carbon cycle. However, challenges can arise when comparing data between different observation sites owing to the different measurement routines and data formats used. To combat these challenges, different research infrastructures have been established in order to harmonize measurement routines and data processing and to make the data from different stations readily available. One of the few stations in the boreal region that observes atmospheric greenhouse gas mole fractions is the Pallas station, located atop Sammaltunturi fell in Finnish Lapland. The station's location above the arctic circle, far away from large settlements, makes it ideal for the measurement of background mole fractions. The station hosts instrumentation for two different research infrastructures – Integrated Carbon Observation System (ICOS) and Global Atmosphere Watch (GAW) – with completely independent measurement instruments, calibration standards, and sampling systems. We present the long-term time series of the mole fractions of CO2 and CH4 and their evolution, measured at the Pallas station, as well as a long-term comparison of the two instruments during the period when both have been installed. We find that the average difference in the hourly values for CO2 is < 0.01 ppm and for CH4 is 0.47 ppb. The trends and growth rated calculated for both instruments agree well. For a more detailed comparison, the ICOS and GAW systems were simultaneously audited by the ICOS Mobile Laboratory and the World Calibration Centre (WCC-Empa) of GAW, respectively. The audit results show good agreement between the different systems, with the differences ranging from −0.06 to 0.02 ppm for CO2 and from −0.24 to 0.30 ppb for CH4. No significant dependence on mole fraction values is found for the differences between the systems. However, for one of the instruments, we find a clear influence of sample drying, especially for CH4. We also compare the long time series with the marine boundary layer (MBL) reference values, derived by NOAA based on weekly air sample measurements in the Northern Hemisphere. For CO2, the values measured at Pallas are on average 1.9 ppm higher than the MBL for the Northern Hemisphere, and for CH4, they are 54 ppb higher. The difference is larger during summer for CO2 but not significantly for CH4."

Nonfossil sources dominated organic carbon (OC) with an average contribution of 58 ± 9%. Biogenic emissions dominated nonfossil OC during spring (68 ± 29%) and summer (86 ± 6%), while biomass burning emissions dominated in winter (87 ± 15%) and autumn (51 ± 8%). More than half of the biogenic‐derived OC in spring (58 ± 23%) and summer (64 ± 21%) originated from secondary formation, with monoterpene (35 ± 16%) and isoprene (49 ± 25%) as main secondary organic aerosol (SOA) precursors, respectively. The SOC contributed the most anthropogenic‐derived (i.e., fossil and biomass burning sources) OC with an average contribution of 71 ± 9%. In addition, anthropogenic OC was notably high during winter (93 ± 7%) and autumn (74 ± 5%), underscoring the significant impact of regional pollution transport on background aerosol. Correlations between anthropogenic pollutants and biogenic‐derived SOC indicated that mixed contributions from anthropogenic and biogenic emissions promoted SOA formation. This interaction may partially explain the relatively higher fractions of SOC in nonfossil (>60%) and fossil OC (>70%) at the background site of the YRD region compared to other global background sites."

 Global surface warming has accelerated since around 2010, relative to the preceding half century1–3. This has coincided with East Asian efforts to reduce air pollution through restricted atmospheric aerosol and precursor emissions4,5. A direct link between the two has, however, not yet been established. Here we show, using a large set of simulations from eight Earth System Models, how a time-evolving 75% reduction in East Asian sulfate emissions partially unmasks greenhouse gas-driven warming and influences the spatial pattern of surface temperature change. We find a rapidly evolving global, annual mean warming of 0.07 ± 0.05 °C, sufficient to be a main driver of the uptick in global warming rate since 2010. We also find North-Pacific warming and a top-of-atmosphere radiative imbalance that are qualitatively consistent with recent observations. East Asian aerosol cleanup is thus likely a key contributor to recent global warming acceleration and to Pacific warming trends. Restrictions of atmospheric aerosol and precursor emissions in East Asia have contributed to the observed global surface warming acceleration since 2010, according to Earth System Model simulations isolating regional changes."

Based on the simulation results, we successfully employed neural networks to predict particle charge states and estimate ion-induced nucleation rates. This study provides new insights into the dynamics of particle charging and introduces advanced methods for evaluating ion-induced nucleation in atmospheric research. 
 The charge state of atmospheric new particles is controlled by both their initial charge state upon formation and subsequent interaction with atmospheric ions. By measuring the charge state of growing particles, the fraction of ion-induced nucleation (FIIN) within total new particle formation (NPF) can be inferred, which is critical for understanding NPF mechanisms. However, existing theoretical approaches for predicting particle charge states suffer from inaccuracies due to simplifying assumptions; hence their ability to infer FIIN is sometimes limited. Here we develop a numerical model to explicitly simulate the charging dynamics of new particles. Our simulations demonstrate that both particle growth rate and ion concentration substantially influence the particle charge state, while ion–ion recombination becomes important when the charged particle concentrations are high. Leveraging a large set of simulations, we constructed two regression models using residual neural networks. The first model (ResFWD) predicts the charge state of growing particles with known FIIN values, while the second model (ResBWD) operates in reverse to estimate FIIN based on the charge fraction of particles at prescribed sizes. Good agreement between the regression models and benchmark simulations demonstrates the potential of our approach for analyzing ion-induced nucleation events. Sensitivity analysis further reveals that ResFWD and the benchmark simulations exhibit similar sensitivity to noises in the input parameters, but the robustness of the ResBWD simulations depends on retention of initial particle charge state at the prescribed sizes. Our study provides insights into charging dynamics of atmospheric new particles and introduces a new method for assessing ion-induced nucleation rates."

Patra;Sachiko Hayashida,Impact of post-monsoon crop residue burning on PM2.5 over northern India: optimizing emissions using a high-density in situ surface observation network,"Air pollution in Delhi during the post-monsoon period is severe, and association with intensive crop residue burning (CRB) over Punjab state has attracted attention. However, the relationship has been unclear as the CRB emissions conventionally derived from satellites were underestimated due to clouds or thick smoke/haze over the region. We evaluated the impact of CRB on PM2.5 to be about 50 %, based on a combination of numerical modeling and an observation network using low-cost sensors we installed. 
 The impact of post-monsoon crop residue burning (CRB) on surface PM2.5 concentrations over the Punjab–Haryana–Delhi (PHD) region in northern India was investigated using a regional meteorology–chemistry model, NHM(WRF)-Chem, and a high-density in situ surface observation network comprising Compact and Useful PM2.5 Instrument with Gas Sensors (CUPI-G) stations. We optimized CRB emissions from 1 to 15 November 2022 using the model and surface PM2.5 observational data. The CUPI-G data from Punjab were found to be crucial for CRB emission optimization, as the CRB emissions in northern India in October and November are predominantly originating from Punjab, accounting for 80 % of the CRB emissions. The new emission inventory is referred to as OFEv1.0, with 12 h time resolution, in daytime (05:30–17:30 IST) and nighttime (17:30–05:30 IST). The total emissions in OFEv1.0, such as PM2.5, CO, organic carbon, and black carbon, were consistent with previous studies. OFEv1.0 substantially increased emissions relative to those calculated from satellite fire observation data (prior emissions). We showed that the prior PM2.5 emissions were underestimated by approximately 8.6 times in the period 1–15 November 2022 and sometimes obscured completely due to clouds or thick smoke/haze on 8 and 10 November 2022. Large differences in optimized daytime and nighttime emissions indicated the importance of diurnal variations. Daytime emissions were larger than nighttime emissions on some days but not on others, indicating that diurnal variation shape may have differed each day. The mean contribution of CRB to surface PM2.5 over PHD was 30 %–34 %, which increased to 50 %–56 % during plume events that transported pollutants from Punjab to Haryana and to Delhi. Due to insufficient performance of the meteorological model simulation on 8 and 9 November 2022 and the lack of measurement sites on the southern side of Punjab, emission optimization was not successful in the case of increased PM2.5 concentrations observed in Haryana on these days."

Operations in different campaigns have confirmed the reliability of the system and the quality of data. 
 A new modular multi-sensor aerological dropsonde system for high and fast-flying research aircraft has been developed for studying atmospheric processes. This new system allows us to drop release containers with up to four sondes inside,  and data from up to 30 sondes can be transmitted simultaneously. After separation from the release container, the sondes enable high-resolution spatio-temporal profiling of temperature, humidity, and pressure with a time resolution of 1.12 s and wind of 1 s, corresponding to approximately 10 m vertical resolution. The modular design ensures simple integration of additional sensors without extensive flight tests and recertification for e.g. particle measurements and radioactivity.The standard meteorological sonde comprises sensor elements of a commercial Graw DFM-17 radiosonde, a 400 to 406 MHz band communication link to the aircraft, and an optional satellite communication module. By means of the satellite link, the data can be made available worldwide in near-real time, and data loss is avoided when the dropping aircraft leaves the telemetry range.The main feature of the new system is the release container, which allows for dropping through standard dropsonde dispensers of both mid-size turbo-prop aircraft (e.g. Dornier Do 128-6) and jet aircraft (e.g. the Gulfstream 550 “High Altitude and Long Range Research Aircraft” HALO). The release container ensures safe separation from the aircraft and protects its payload during deceleration from aircraft speed to fall speed before the sondes are released by an electro-mechanical mechanism. Operations in different campaigns have confirmed the reliability of the entire system and the quality of acquired data. Feasibility of the technical and operational approach for targeted observations of a mesoscale convective system in Argentina was demonstrated by HALO measurements during the SouthTRAC (TRAnsport and Composition of the southern hemisphere UTLS (upper troposphere–lower stratosphere) campaign) campaign. Moreover, a configuration consisting of a meteorological sonde coupled with an optical counter for particle sizing was tested during a Saharan dust episode over Germany using a Dornier Do 128-6 aircraft. Secondly, a meteorological sonde together with a radioactivity sensor was successfully dropped from a Learjet 35A."

Sica,Retrieval of bulk hygroscopicity from PurpleAir PM2.5 sensor measurements,"PurpleAir sensors provide a low-cost way to monitor air quality, with over 30 000 sensors available worldwide. However, their measurements require calibration with trusted data for accuracy. Our new technique builds on previous calibration methods by also enabling the measurement of a quantity related to how pollutants grow with humidity. Mapping this new quantity will improve air quality forecasting. 
 PurpleAir sensors offer a unique opportunity for a large-scale and densely populated array of sensors to study surface air quality. While  PurpleAir sensors are inexpensive and abundant, they must be corrected to better agree with validated coincident measurements from more sophisticated instrumentation. Traditionally, this  correction is performed using statistical methods. We propose a method to both correct  PurpleAir PM2.5 measurements and allow for an estimate of the hygroscopic growth of aerosols, using a novel correction approach based on the optimal estimation method (OEM). The hygroscopic growth of  aerosols can be retrieved using the sensitivity of the correction to water activity, which influences the measured size distribution of the aerosols. By employing the physically based  correction using calibrated measurements from the nearby Ontario Ministry of the Environment, Conservation and Parks air quality site, the average daily mean absolute error (MAE) of the PurpleAir PM2.5 measurements is decreased from 5.58 to 1.68 µg m−3, and the average daily bias decreases from 4.75 to −0.23 µg m−3. This improvement in the correction is comparable to that seen using conventional statistical methodologies. Our OEM retrieval also allowed us to estimate seasonal bulk hygroscopicity values ranging from 0.33 to 0.40. These values are consistent with the accepted ranges of bulk hygroscopicity for atmospheric particulate matter (0.1 to 0.9) determined in previous studies using calibrated air quality measurement instruments, which suggests that our method allows a new aerosol product to be determined from a large sensor network."

Here, we detail a novel approach involving data weighting to improve quantification of these peak values. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we applied data weighting to carbon monoxide, methane, and volatile organic compound sensor data. This work broadens our ability to use air sensors in contexts where accurate quantification of peak concentrations is essential. 
 Traditional calibration models for low-cost air quality sensors have demonstrated a tendency to underpredict peak concentrations. We assessed the utility of adding data weights to low-cost sensor colocation data to improve the quantification of peak concentrations when the majority of colocation data is at a baseline concentration and varies due to intermittent, transient events. Specifically, we explore the effects of data weighting on three different pollutant colocation datasets: total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carbon monoxide (CO), and methane (CH4). Leveraging two different weighting functions, a sigmoidal and a piecewise weighting regime, we explored the impacts of the base model choice (multilinear regression, MLR, vs. random forest, RF, models), the sensitivity of weighting functions, and the ability of data weighting to improve high-concentration pollution measurements. When compared to unweighted colocation data, we demonstrate significant reductions in both error (root mean square error, RMSE) and bias (mean bias error, MBE) for pollutant peaks across all three datasets when data weighting is employed. For the top percentile of data, we observe an average of 23 % reduction in RMSE and a 35 % reduction in MBE when optimal weights are employed. More significant reductions occurred in the 95th–99th percentile of data, where MBE was reduced by an average of 70 %. RMSE in the 95th-99th percentile was reduced by an average of 26 %. However, data weighting can also generate larger errors at baseline pollutant concentrations. Data weighting regimes were sensitive to input parameters, and input weighting functions may be tuned to better predict peak concentration data without significant reductions in the fidelity of baseline pollutant predictions."

Three representative sites present the different seasonal characteristics, indicating the geographic and height influences on the RH vertical distribution. 
 Precise continuous measurements of relative humidity (RH) vertical profiles in the troposphere have emerged as a considerable scientific issue. In recent years, a combination of diverse ground-based remote sensing devices has effectively facilitated RH vertical profiling.  This work introduces a newly developed approach for obtaining continuous RH profiles by integrating data from a Raman lidar, a microwave radiometer (MWR), and satellite sources. RH profiles obtained using synergistic approaches are subsequently compared with radiosonde data throughout a 5-month observational study in China. Our suggested method for RH profiling demonstrates optimal concordance with the best correction coefficients R of 0.94 in Huhehaote (HHHT), 0.92 in Yibin (YB), and 0.93 in Qingyuan (QY). The mean value of RH decreased with height and presented seasonal characteristics in QY. Finally, the RH height–time evolution was used to distinguish hail and heavy precipitation.

 In this study, we assess the relevance and utility of several performance indicators (model quality (bias) and model performance (temporal and spatial) indicators), developed within the FAIRMODE framework by evaluating eight Copernicus Atmospheric Monitoring Service (CAMS) models and their ensemble in calculating concentrations of key air pollutants, specifically NO2, PM2.5, PM10 and O3. The models' outputs were compared with observations that were not assimilated into the models. For NO2, the results highlight difficulties in accurately modelling concentrations at traffic stations, with improved performance when these stations are excluded. While all models meet the established criteria for PM2.5, indicators such as bias and winter–summer gradients reveal underlying issues in air quality modelling, questioning the stringency of the current criteria for PM2.5. For PM10, the combination of model quality indicators, bias, and spatial-temporal gradient indicators prove most effective in identifying model weaknesses, suggesting possible areas of improvement.

However, existing methods rely heavily on continuous emission monitoring systems (CEMS), which are often limited in data availability, coverage and data quality. This study introduces a novel approach that integrates multisatellite fire radiative power (FRP) observations with a base-year emission inventory (BY-EI) to improve source identification and emission estimation. Compared to previous methods, our multisatellite strategy increased the number of identified industrial point sources by 38%. Fire radiative energy (FRE)-emission response models were developed by linking satellite-derived FRE with emission data from identified sources. These models enabled daily emission estimates with strong performance, especially for SO2 (R2 = 0.895) and NOx (R2 = 0.855). For sources without direct FRP detection, sectoral FRE-based temporal profiles captured emission variability effectively (Pearson’s r > 0.6, mean square errors (MSE) at 10–5 level). This approach successfully identified high-emission industrial sectors, including cement, ceramics, and steel industries, expanding the scope of detectable sources while reducing reliance on CEMS data. The findings provide a new framework for NRT industrial emission characterization, supporting the timely updating of industrial emissions and refined pollution control strategies and decision-making."

We evaluate the regional air quality impacts of the fires through publicly available fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and nitrogen dioxide (NO2) observations from regulatory monitoring stations, PurpleAir low-cost sensors, the TEMPO and TROPOMI satellite sensors, and Hazard Mapping System (HMS) Smoke Plumes during this multifire event. The most extreme air quality impacts were observed on January 8–9, particularly in the southern half of LA county, where daily average PM2.5 concentrations at the downtown LA regulatory monitor reached 101.7 μg/m3 and 52.3 μg/m3 in Compton. On January 8th, 12 PurpleAir sensors located closer to burn areas exceeded daily PM2.5 concentrations of 225 μg/m3. While smoke impacts were largely consistent across all data sources, differences in the spatiotemporal, including vertical, resolution of each product may affect interpretability for end users.

Particle-resolved models are the only models able to capture this diversity in particle physiochemical properties, and these models are computationally expensive. As a strategy for accelerating particle-resolved microphysics models, we introduce Graph-based Learning of Aerosol Dynamics (GLAD) and use this model to train a surrogate of the particle-resolved model PartMC-MOSAIC. GLAD implements a graph-network-based simulator (GNS), a machine learning framework that has been used to emulate particle-based fluid dynamics simulations. In GLAD, each particle is represented as a node in a graph, and the evolution of the particle population over time is simulated through learned message passing. We demonstrate our GNS approach on a simple aerosol system that includes the condensation of sulfuric acid onto particles composed of sulfate, black carbon, organic carbon, and water. A graph with particles as nodes is constructed, and a graph neural network (GNN) is then trained by using the model output from PartMC-MOSAIC. The trained GNN can then be used for simulating and predicting aerosol dynamics over time. Results demonstrate the framework’s ability to accurately learn chemical dynamics and generalize across different scenarios, achieving efficient training and prediction times. We evaluate the performance across three scenarios, highlighting the framework’s robustness and adaptability in modeling aerosol microphysics and chemistry."

We interpret these observations using the GEOS-Chem global model of atmospheric composition in its high-performance configuration (GCHP) at fine resolution of C180 (∼50 km). The base simulation overestimates the PM2.5 accumulation overnight, leading to excessive diurnal amplitude and earlier PM2.5 morning peaks than observations. These biases are reduced by applying sector- and species-wise diurnal scaling factors on anthropogenic emissions, by resolving the aerosol subgrid vertical gradient within the surface model layer, by applying revised wet deposition, and by revising the mixing coefficient in the boundary layer. Budget analyses indicate that the morning peak of PM2.5 is likely driven by changes in the aerosol subgrid vertical gradient with fumigation after sunrise, that the concentration decrease until late afternoon is driven by boundary layer mixing and thermodynamic partitioning of a semivolatile aerosol to the gas phase, that the concentration increase during evening is driven by enhanced secondary chemical production and persistent primary anthropogenic emissions, and that the consistently high concentration overnight is driven by the balance between emissions, chemical production, and boundary layer mixing and deposition."

 The Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR) series onboard the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the EUMETSAT Meteorological Operational Satellite (Metop) polar-orbiting satellites have provided continuous Earth observation data since 1979, which facilitates the development of long-term global climate data records. In this paper, a new version of the algorithm for the retrieval of the Aerosol Optical Depth (AOD) over Land (ADL v2.0) using AVHRR data is proposed with improved accuracy, in particular for high AOD values. The surface reflectance estimation scheme is based on a regression model established using simulated AVHRR reflectances spectrally transferred from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) MOD09/MYD09 product. To address limitations in retrieving high AOD, the surface reflectance is determined using the maximum Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) during a certain period of time. To this end, a dynamic NDVI search window is proposed to identify the NDVI that is least affected by aerosols. ADL v2.0 has been applied to provide an AOD dataset covering Mainland China (70o-140°E, 15o-60oN) for the years from 1981 to 2000. This dataset has been evaluated by comparing with AOD data available from the application of the broadband extinction method (BEM) to ground-based solar radiation measurements and from the AVHRR Deep Blue (DB) AOD dataset. The AOD variations retrieved using the BEM data at seven stations (two in North China, two in Northeast China, one in East China, one in Central China, and one in the southwest mountainous region) are well reproduced by the ADL v2.0 algorithm. The comparison with the AVHRR DB AOD dataset shows good agreement with ADL v2.0 retrieval results even though with less valid retrievals for high AOD in Eastern China, Sichuan, and the Guanzhong Basin, as well as over North India."

 Lack of knowledge still remains on many processes leading to carbonyl sulfide (COS) atmospheric fluxes, either natural, such as the oceanic sources or the vegetation and soil uptakes, or anthropogenic, with emissions from industrial activities and power generation. Moreover, COS atmospheric mixing ratio data are still too sparse to evaluate the estimations of these sources and sinks at the regional scale; in this context, regional estimates are very challenging.  This study assesses the anthropogenic emissions and biogenic COS uptakes at the regional scale, in the footprint of a measurement site in western Europe, at a seasonal to diurnal time resolution over half a decade.  The continuous time series of COS mixing ratios obtained at the monitoring site of Gif-sur-Yvette (GIF; in the Paris region) from August 2014 to December 2019 are compared to simulations with the Lagrangian model FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle), transporting oceanic sources, biogenic land fluxes from the land surface models ORCHIDEE and SiB4 (Simple Biosphere Model), and anthropogenic emissions by two different inventories.  At GIF, the seasonal variations in COS mixing ratios are dominated by the contributions of the background and ocean, the weekly to daily variations are driven by the biogenic land contribution and anthropogenic emissions may dominate for short episodes of high concentrations.  The anthropogenic emission inventory based on reported industrial emissions and the characteristics of coal power plants in Europe is consistent with the observations.  The main limitation of this inventory is the flat temporal variability applied to anthropogenic fluxes due to the lack of information on industrial and power-generation activities in viscose factories and in coal power plants. As a consequence, there are potential mismatches in the simulated plumes emitted from these hot spots.  We find that the net ecosystem COS uptake simulated by both ORCHIDEE and SiB4 is underestimated in winter at night, which suggests improvements in the parameterization of the nighttime uptake by plants for COS.  In spring, SiB4 simulates persistent nighttime uptake by vegetation, which is different than ORCHIDEE, which leads to more realistic simulations with SiB4 than with ORCHIDEE. In summer, both models represent fluxes sufficiently well, with better agreement from ORCHIDEE in terms of magnitudes."

For GPS, the best performance is obtained with 5 s clock products. These findings result from the short-timescale behavior of the onboard atomic clocks and are important given the impact of radio occultation measurements on numerical weather predictions and climate studies. 
 Radio occultation (RO) measurements require the tracking of signals from a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) by a low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite as the signals travel through different layers of the atmosphere. The orbit and clock solutions for the GNSS constellations affect these measurements in two ways: they are needed to obtain a zero-differencing GNSS-based orbit and clock solution for the LEO, and they directly enter the processing of each single RO profile, where the orbit and clock information for the transmitter (GNSS) and receiver (LEO) satellites is required. In this work, we investigate how different GLONASS and GPS orbit and clock solutions affect the statistical properties of RO profiles by comparing our results with forward-modeled bending-angle profiles based on data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) short-range forecasts. Given that GNSS orbits are relatively smooth, this study focused on the effect of different transmitter clock data rates, and we tested the range from 1 to 30 s (specifically, the rates of 1, 2, 5, 10 and 30 s). The analysis is based on the reprocessing of Sentinel-6A data (4 months in 2021, September to December, or about 110 000 occultations) and of a smaller sample of recent COSMIC-2/FORMOSAT-7 data (5–7 August 2023, or about 9000 occultations). We find that at impact heights above about 35 km, GLONASS bending-angle statistics markedly improve with the use of higher-rate clock information. For GPS, the statistics are better for more recent GPS blocks, and a rate of 5 s provides a marginal improvement over the 30 s rate for all blocks. In the same impact height range, higher-rate GLONASS clocks also significantly reduce the vertical error correlation. These results are likely the manifestation of the different kinds of short-timescale behavior of the atomic clocks on board the GPS and GLONASS constellations."

For utility-scale solar PV facilities, we estimate an SEYG of 33.6 TWh/yr due to the production of goods and services across NEA in 2015. In contrast, the SEYG linked to the consumption of goods and services is lower at 24.6 TWh/yr, with the 9 TWh/yr difference accounting for the net exports outside NEA. Imports have only avoided an SEYG of 1.4 TWh/yr across NEA. Addressing regional SEYGs requires a coordinated response from the producers and consumers of goods and services."

 Wildfires in the Arctic are accelerating ecosystem damage and increasing global carbon emissions. Siberia, a major Arctic wildfire hotspot, is shaped by both local weather and distant climate influences. Here we use climate reanalysis data and numerical model experiments to show that summer wildfires in Siberia are strongly influenced by rainfall patterns over the Tibetan Plateau, one of the Northern Hemisphere’s largest summer heat sources. A dipole in Tibetan Plateau rainfall—wetter in the west, drier in the east—coincides with more fires in central Siberia and fewer in the east. This pattern alters high-altitude winds, shifting the jet stream northward and generating air flow changes that create favorable fire conditions across Siberia. Model experiments support a causal link. The resulting carbon dioxide emissions can match annual emissions from all Nordic countries. These findings highlight an overlooked driver of Arctic wildfires and improve our understanding of their role in the global carbon cycle.

Ziemke;Mark Weber,Intercomparison of tropospheric ozone column datasets from combined nadir and limb satellite observations,"Tropospheric ozone affects air quality and climate, being a pollutant and a greenhouse gas. We analyze satellite data of tropospheric ozone columns obtained by combining two types of observations: one providing stratospheric and the other total ozone. We compare common climatological features and study the influence of the tropopause (troposphere to stratosphere boundary) on the results. We also examine trends over the last 20 years and compare satellite data with ozonesondes to identify drifts. 
 This paper presents an intercomparison between existing tropospheric ozone column (TrOC) datasets obtained using combined limb and nadir observations, i.e., exploiting collocated stratospheric profile and total column information retrieved from limb and nadir satellite observations, respectively. In particular, seven datasets have been considered, covering the past 2 decades and consisting of monthly-averaged time series with nearly global coverage. We perform a comparison in terms of climatology and seasonality, investigate the tropopause height used for the construction of each dataset and the related biases, and finally discuss long-term TrOC drifts and trends. The overall goal of the study is to assess the consistency between the datasets and explore possible strategies to reconcile the differences between them. Despite uncertainties associated with the limb–nadir residual methodology and large biases between the mean values of the considered datasets, we identify an overall agreement of TrOC distribution patterns. The different tropopause height definitions used to construct the datasets did not show a relevant role in explaining the biases between them. We demonstrate that a thorough investigation of the drifts with respect to ground-based observations is needed to evaluate TrOC trends from satellite data and that long-term trends in specific regions can be consistently detected, e.g., a positive trend of up to 1.5 DU per decade over China for the 2005–2021 period."

The optimal COP for liquid water cloud is parameterized in terms of effective diameter (Deff) and the COP for ice cloud developed by the Space Science and Engineering Center, with Deff for ice cloud parameterized in terms of ice water content and temperature. The findings will benefit the remote sensing and data assimilation community. 
 Radiative Transfer for TOVS (RTTOV) is a commonly used forward-operator software package for the data assimilation (DA) of satellite visible  reflectance data. However, the wide choice of cloud optical parameterizations (COPs) in RTTOV poses challenges in discerning the optimal configuration. In this study, the performance of different COPs was evaluated by comparing the observed and synthetic visible satellite images. Observed images (O) were provided by Fengyun-4B (FY-4B) and Himawari-9, two operational geostationary meteorological satellites covering East Asia. Synthetic images (B) were generated by RTTOV (v12.3) with the discrete ordinate method (DOM) and the Method for FAst Satellite Image Simulation (MFASIS). The inputs to RTTOV were provided by the 3 h forecasts of the China Meteorological Administration Mesoscale (CMA-MESO) model and the fifth-generation European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts reanalysis (ERA5) data. On average for the domain, B was smaller than O, especially in cloudy situations. The minimum O−B bias was revealed for the COP of liquid water clouds in terms of effective diameter (Deff) in combination with the COP of ice clouds developed by the Space Science and Engineering Center (SSEC), with the Deff for ice clouds parameterized in terms of ice water content and temperature. Compared with the O−B biases, the standard deviations of the O−B departure were less sensitive to COPs. In addition, histogram analysis of reflectance indicated that the synthetic images with the minimum O−B bias resembled the observed images best. Therefore, the optimal cloud optical parameterization was proposed to be the “Deff + SSEC” suite."

However, the understanding of its long-term compositional changes and responses to natural and anthropogenic factors remains limited, and few atmospheric radiative modeling studies have specifically examined the distinct contributions of char-BC and soot-BC components. In this study, we trace the compositional changes of BC over the past ∼500 years using sediments from Huguangyan Maar Lake, China and separately quantify the impacts of char-BC and soot-BC on the RF of atmospheric BC. Our findings reveal that the proportion of soot-BC in BC has increased by 2.5 times since 1950 CE. In earlier periods, wildfires driven by the East Asian summer monsoon were the primary contributors to the dominance of char-BC in BC. However, the contribution of human activities to the rise in soot-BC has progressively increased from approximately 10% around 1950 CE to 80% by around 2010 CE, significantly altering BC composition and leading to a 5-fold increase in atmospheric BC RF. These results suggest that ongoing human activities will likely continue to alter BC composition and the atmospheric radiative balance, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing BC components in atmospheric models."

While activity‐based (“bottom up”) emission estimates are widely used for global cities, they often lack independent verification. In this study, we use remotely‐sensed CO2 observations from the Orbiting Carbon Observatory‐3 (OCO‐3) to “top‐down” estimate CO2 emissions for 54 global cities. This global‐scale analysis is enabled by a computationally efficient cross‐sectional flux approach, which uses NO2 observations from TROPOMI and trajectory simulations from HYSPLIT to identify OCO‐3 pixels influenced by urban plumes. Our satellite‐based emission estimates for 54 global cities agree within 7% to two widely used bottom‐up data sets but reveal regional discrepancies. Bottom‐up estimates tend to overestimate emissions for cities in Central East Asia and South and West Asia, while underestimating emissions in Africa, East and Southeast Asia & Oceania, Europe, and North America. Additionally, our satellite‐based socioeconomic analysis shows that (a) high‐income cities tend to have less carbon‐intensive economies: North American cities emit 0.1 kg CO2 per USD of economic output, while African cities emit 0.5 kg CO2 per USD, and (b) per capita emissions decrease with increasing population size, from 7.7 tCO2/person for cities under 5 million residents to 1.8 tCO2/person for cities over 20 million residents. This study highlights the potential of satellite data to bridge gaps between top‐down and bottom‐up emission estimates, enhancing the robustness and transparency of emissions monitoring. Our findings emphasize the growing role of satellite data in verifying urban CO2 emissions and supporting efforts to mitigate emissions for global cities."

The sensitivity of ΔΦ to different habits is assessed comparing actual observations with simulations performed using the weather research forecast model.

While Tibetan Plateau snow cover (TPSC) has been linked to Arctic sea‐ice variability, the spatiotemporal stability of this relationship remains unclear. In this study, combing satellite observations and snow experiments, we identified a shift in connections between TPSC and Barents‐Kara Seas sea‐ice around 1990. Before 1990, a positive dipole TPSC pattern (eastern enhanced/western reduced snow cover) induces Arctic anticyclonic anomalies through a circumglobal wave train. These anomalies facilitate polar vortex splitting, enhancing moisture transport and solar radiation over the northern Kara Sea, which accelerates sea‐ice reduction. Conversely, post‐1990, a positive monopole TPSC pattern (positive snow anomalies on the entire Tibetan Plateau) strengthens the polar vortex, suppressing Barents Sea (BS) moisture and solar radiation, thereby promoting sea‐ice growth. This regime shifts underscore TPSC's capacity to modulate Arctic sea‐ice dynamics through polar vortex system."

However, delivering these materials to the stratosphere at the required altitudes (18–25 km) poses practical challenges. Here, we evaluate a novel delivery method called solar‐powered lofting (SPL), inspired by self‐lofting during extreme wildfires. SPL coinjects a small amount of black carbon (BC) with SO2 at lower altitudes accessible to commercial aircraft (∼13 km), allowing the SO2 to self‐loft into the stratosphere. Using the Community Earth System Model, we compare SPL simulations with traditional SAI simulation that injects equivalent SO2 mass at 20 km at the same locations, but without BC. SPL and SAI scenarios generate similar global aerosol optical depths and effective radiative forcing. BC induces an additional 1.5 K annual mean warming in the tropical stratosphere, raising stratospheric water vapor by 0.42 ppm. The coinjected BC accounts for 20% of the annual mean temperature and water vapor anomalies. Furthermore, the BC strengthens the polar vortex and enhances the Brewer‐Dobson circulation. As a result of the changes in dynamics and chemistry, the coinjected BC results in a 5% increase in Antarctic ozone depletion in October. The SPL method at aircraft‐accessible altitudes offers comparable cooling efficiency but requires careful evaluation of additional BC impacts."

 Atmospheric aerosols are an important component of the Earth’s climate system and contribute substantial uncertainties to predictions of future climate change. In the southeast Atlantic, where expansive light-absorbing smoke aerosol plumes overlie semi-permanent stratocumulus clouds, the direct aerosol radiative effect (DARE) induces warming, but the magnitude of this effect varies widely among climate models. Thus, it is essential to improve estimates based on observations to help constrain model uncertainties. However, the impact of the observed cloud diurnal cycle on DARE remains unclear. Here we quantify DARE using radiative transfer modelling based on hourly satellite observations of clouds focusing on the region 20° S–0° and 10° W–15° E. We find that accounting for the observed cloud diurnal cycle over the southeast Atlantic, rather than assuming a constant early-afternoon cloud field throughout the entire day, results in a more than twofold increase (+1.7 ± 0.4 W m−2) in the regional mean aerosol radiative warming. The increase in DARE results from morning hours when cloud fractions and optical depths are higher. Neglect of the cloud diurnal cycle adds to the underestimated radiative warming in the southeast Atlantic associated with underestimated aerosol absorption among climate models. Future observations-based estimates of aerosol climatic effects need to account for the cloud diurnal cycle. Accounting for the diurnal cycle in low clouds more than doubles estimated aerosol radiative warming in the southeast Atlantic, according to radiative transfer modelling and satellite observations."

In particular, we used a machine learning approach to identify a list of key BrC species, which can be a good reference for future studies. Our findings extend understanding of BrC properties and are valuable to the assessment of BrC's impact on air quality and radiative forcing. 
 The light-absorbing organics, namely brown carbon (BrC), can significantly affect atmospheric visibility and radiative forcing, yet current knowledge of the chemical composition of BrC is largely limited to a number of certain classes of compounds; the chemical and optical properties, and particularly linkage between the two, remain poorly understood. To address this, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on the particulate matter (PM2.5) samples collected in Nanjing, China, during 2022–2023, with a focus on the identification of key BrC molecules. Several important clues related to BrC were found. First, the water-soluble organic aerosol (WSOA) was more oxygenated during the cold season (CS) due to a highly oxidized secondary OA (SOA) factor that was strongly associated with aqueous and heterogenous reactions, especially during the nighttime, while the WSOA during the summer season (SS) was less oxygenated and the SOA was mainly from photochemical reactions. Fossil fuel combustion hydrocarbon-like OA was the largest and dominant contributor to the light absorption during CS (55.6 %–63.7 %). Secondly, our observations reveal that aqueous oxidation can lead to notable photo-enhancement during CS, while photochemical oxidation on the contrary caused photo-bleaching during SS. Both water-soluble and methanol-soluble organics had four key fluorophores, including three factors related to humic-like substances (HULIS) and one protein-like component. Thirdly, molecular characterization shows that CHON compounds were the most abundant species overall, followed by CHO and CHN compounds, and the significant presence of organosulfates in CS samples reaffirmed the importance of aqueous-phase formation. Finally, building upon the molecular characterization and light absorption measurement results, a machine learning approach was applied to identify the key BrC molecules and 31 compounds including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), oxyheterocyclic PAHs, quinones, and nitrogen-containing species, which can be a good reference for future studies."

Historically, climate models have categorizing organic particles as either non-absorbing or purely reflective. Our study shows that BrC can reduce the usual cooling effect of organic particles. While BrC is often linked to biomass burning, however, BrC from fossil fuels contributes significantly to atmospheric heating. 
 Brown carbon (BrC) plays a significant role in altering atmospheric radiation. Beyond biomass and biofuel combustion, recent studies identify fossil fuel sources – especially residential coal burning and vehicle exhaust – as major contributors to BrC. This underscores a gap in climate models, which often assume fossil fuel organic aerosols (OAs) are non-absorbing or treat all OA as light-scattering. In this study, we simulate BrC over the North China Plain (NCP) during a winter pollution event using the WRF-Chem model, incorporating explicit BrC absorption properties. The model aligns well with observed pollutant and aerosol levels, revealing an average near-surface BrC concentration of 5.2 µg m−3, contributing 16.4 % to aerosol absorption at 365 nm. Using a diagnostic adjoint approach, we estimate that BrC exerts a direct radiative effect (DRE) averaging −0.09 W m−2 at the top of the atmosphere, reducing the cooling effect of organic carbon by 28.0 % and producing a local warming effect of up to +0.40 W m−2. Coal combustion is the largest BrC source in the NCP in 2014, though secondary BrC also significantly impacts the regional radiation balance."

The Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment campaign sampled the western Pacific, the dominant longitudes for surface air lofted by convection to enter the global stratosphere. Aircraft measurements over multiple flights revealed persistent layers of biomass burning pollutants entering the lower stratosphere and originating from fires as far away as Africa and Indonesia. 
 Recent studies hypothesize that emissions from fires reaching the stratosphere can provide aerosols and aerosol precursors that initiate stratospheric ozone loss and lead to radiative heating of the stratosphere and cooling of the surface. Air from the troposphere enters the stratosphere primarily over the tropical western Pacific (TWP) during boreal winter. We report observations in the TWP of persistent, ubiquitous pollution in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) and lower stratosphere (LS) during the Airborne Tropical TRopopause EXperiment (ATTREX) campaign in February–March 2014. We found carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations increased by up to 65 % above background levels in the deep tropics (5° S–15° N; 16–17 km). Correlations of CO with hydrocarbon and halocarbon species indicated a biomass burning source, with the largest CO increases in cloud-free air. Satellite observations did not detect the thin layers of CO observed by the aircraft and revealed Africa, Indonesia, and the western and central Pacific as geographical hot spots for CO in the TTL. Backward trajectories also identified convective encounters in these areas, highlighting delivery of biomass burning pollutants to the TWP by both nearby and remote convection. Contributions from Africa and Indonesia were nearly 60 %, with transport timescales of 10 d to several weeks. Our study confirms that air in the TTL over the TWP is affected by emissions from distant fires that can rapidly reach the tropical LS, the principal source region for air entering the global stratosphere, supporting the view that fires in tropical regions can impact stratospheric composition and temperature."

Our approach utilizes a portable and cost-efficient sensor array with advanced data handling, employing commercially available sensors to measure CO2, CO, NO2, SO2, PMs, VOC, NOx, cookstove and ambient temperature, relative humidity, and pressure. We developed hardware and software to gather and process sensor data and control the temperature cycle using the BME688 sensors. The field deployments reveal that CO2 emission from a cooking event is ∼2.3 ± 1.5 kg CO2 per family. Extrapolating this data, the total emissions from biomass (e.g., fuelwood, crop residues, animal dung, and charcoal) for household cooking in rural areas of India are estimated to be around 0.6 ± 0.4 teragrams (Tg) of CO2 per day. The integration of dual BME688 sensors, leveraging the standard Bosch Software Environmental Cluster library and temperature cycling, achieves an impressive 95% accuracy in fingerprinting emissions from different fuel types.

However, few studies have comprehensively examined how urban form and environmental factors influence air pollution exposure and its spatial inequality. This study investigates how urban and environmental factors affect particulate matter pollution (PM1, PM2.5, and PM10) and its spatial inequality across 85 counties in Fujian, China. Twelve indicators across urban form, socio‐economic, and environmental domains were analyzed using principal component analysis and partial correlation networks. Our results show that while overall air pollution levels exhibit substantial variability, spatial inequality in exposure does not always correlate directly with these levels. Notably, while urbanized counties display higher pollution exposure, significant disparities in pollution distribution are observed within regions of similar pollution levels. Urban and socio‐economic features such as population density and road density are strongly correlated with higher pollution exposure, especially in more urbanized areas. In contrast, environmental factors, such as vegetation coverage and precipitation, significantly mitigate pollution levels. Principal component analysis reveals that development density and environmental changes primarily drive overall pollution levels, while economic activity and segregation contribute to the spatial inequality of exposure. Network analysis further corroborates that high‐density urban development exacerbates pollution exposure, while socio‐economic segregation contributes to uneven distribution across the population. Our findings underscore the need for integrated urban planning strategies that address these urban and environmental factors to reduce air pollution inequality and promote more equitable urban environments."

Giang,Incorporating Community Knowledge Into Analysis of Air Quality Monitoring Network Data,"We conducted a pilot study to explore methods of incorporating qualitative community knowledge into quantitative assessment of temporal and spatial air quality patterns in a neighborhood in Vancouver, British Columbia. We deployed a low‐cost sensor network measuring NO, NO2, and PM2.5. We used a variety of sources of community knowledge to complement a timeseries analysis and spatial model: a survey by the residents' association; odor reports from a citizen science project; and data from a community mapping event. Community knowledge highlighted, among other sources, areas where cars and heavy‐duty vehicles idle, locations of construction, and locations of wood stoves. When creating a “traditional” land use regression (LUR) using easily accessible, and publicly available data sources, and a “community” LUR that uses community‐reported air pollution sources, model fit was improved in the community LURs for NO2 and NOx. This suggests that community knowledge can provide insight into sources that are not well captured in commonly used, publicly available data sets due to their transient and informal nature. Not all community‐reported short‐term events corresponded to peaks in monitor data, which could reflect that reports were more correlated with unmeasured pollutants. We suggest that future studies collecting community knowledge on short‐term pollution events through community mapping lower barriers to participation (i.e., through hosting a series of drop‐in events, providing childcare, or timing any event to coincide with neighborhood‐wide events). With these examples, we showcased ways to include community knowledge in quantitative air pollution studies and highlight opportunities to expand on these methods."

 Aerosol-Cloud Interactions (ACI) plays a crucial role in the Earth's energy balance and significantly contribute to global climate change. However, the radiative forcing due to ACI remain highly uncertain, in both observational and model-based studies. In this study, we utilize an observational approach to quantify the effective radiative forcing due to ACI (ERFaci) over the Northern Indian Ocean (NIO) during 2003–2021. The results show that warm marine boundary layer clouds exert a negative forcing (cooling effect) at the Top of the Atmosphere (TOA), driven by both cloud albedo effect (intrinsic forcing) and cloud fraction adjustment (extrinsic forcing). In details, on a basin-scale, the annual mean intrinsic radiative forcing is about 17 % stronger over the Bay of Bengal (BoB: −0.48 ± 0.52 Wm−2) than over the Arabian Sea (AS: −0.41 ± 0.37 Wm−2). In contrast, extrinsic forcing is almost similar over both the basins (AS: −0.66 ± 0.39 Wm−2; and BoB: −0.64 ± 0.68 Wm−2). Annually extrinsic forcing is 61 % higher than intrinsic forcing over the AS and 33 % higher over the BoB. However, on a seasonal basis, the relative difference increases up to 269 % (101 %) and 304 % (197 %) during winter (post-monsoon) over the AS and BoB, respectively. These seasonal variations are further supported by positive correlations between cloudy-sky albedo (⁓ 0.02–0.06) and low-level liquid cloud fraction (⁓ 0.02–0.04) with the aerosol index (AI) across the region. The shortwave components of ERFaci (SWRFaci) dominate the annual mean NetRFaci, contributing approximately 106 % and 80 % over the AS and BoB, respectively. The strong SWRFaci over the NIO could be attributed to two main factors: an increase in anthropogenic pollution during the study period or, possibly a retrieval bias inherent in satellite-based observation. Thus, if the former, our ERFaci estimates can serve as useful reference estimates for assessing ACI effects in regional model simulations."

However, the mechanisms that influence the decadal change of the SAH remain unclear. Results based on reanalysis data and climate model experiments indicate that with increased emission of anthropogenic aerosols (AAs), the contribution of external forcing to the SAH strengthened in the late 1960s and exceeded its internal variability. The transition of the Interdecadal Pacific oscillation (IPO) from the cold to the warm phase and increased AAs jointly promoted decadal decline in the SAH in the late 1970s through air‐sea processes and radiation effects, respectively. Notably, the transition of the IPO from the positive to the negative phase around 2000 tended to enhance the SAH. However, this was offset by the larger contribution from high emission of AAs, which promoted a continuously weak SAH. The contribution of AAs might still dominate the SAH changes at the beginning of this century. However, as the emission of AAs declines in the future, the influence of AAs on the SAH might weaken. The IPO is expected to play the dominant role in the decadal variation of the SAH from the 2040s under the low‐emission Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP1‐2.6)."

Zhang,Impact of Microphysical Parameterizations on Satellite All‐Sky Infrared Data Assimilation and Practical Predictability of Hurricane Harvey (2017),"Satellites provide the majority of observations of tropical cyclones (TCs) when they are over the open ocean. These observations are under‐utilized in operational global and regional forecasting models as most of the cloudy and precipitation‐affected observations are discarded. Recent works have shown that assimilating all‐sky infrared (IR) radiances from geostationary satellites improves TC track, intensity, and rainfall forecasts. This study examines how two different cloud microphysical parametrization schemes impact all‐sky IR radiance assimilation and subsequent forecasts of Hurricane Harvey. Because model hydrometeor fields that are used to simulate IR radiances are strongly constrained by the model microphysics scheme, Harvey's dynamic and thermodynamic structure become very different when changing the microphysics schemes, which also leads to changes in subsequent intensity forecasts. Sensitivity forecasts suggest that intensity forecast errors in this study are primarily controlled by uncertainties in initial conditions, which are influenced by microphysics schemes as they simulate model priors differently when assimilating all‐sky IR radiance. On the other hand, the microphysics schemes used during the free forecasts generally have a smaller impact on Harvey's intensity forecast errors."

To quantify the aerosol effects on OMB, we utilized the Modern‐Era Retrospective Analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA‐2) data to calculate the mass densities of different aerosol types (dust, organics, sulfates, and carbonates). These parameters are then incorporated into the advanced radiative transfer modeling system (ARMS) to simulate the brightness temperatures (BT) and Jacobians for the longwave channels of the FengYun‐4B (FY‐4B)/GIIRS. For a sandstorm event on 9 April 2023, simulation results indicate a positive correlation between OMB and aerosol optical parameters (e.g., aerosol mass density, particle size, and aerosol optical depth). The inclusion of aerosols generally results in smaller OMBs. In particular, the bias in GIIRS is reduced by 1.11 K when the dust aerosols are included. In general, both JT and JQ are sensitive to the changes in dust aerosol. Simulated BT sensitivity is most responsive to the temperature of aerosol and particulate layers. Moreover, accounting for the effects of dust aerosols in the one‐dimensional variational retrieval (1D‐VAR) system significantly enhanced the accuracy of temperature profile retrievals in dust‐affected regions. Compared to retrievals that did not consider aerosol effects and the GIIRS Level‐2 product, the temperature retrieval results were improved, especially in aerosol peak layers.

 Dust aerosols are transported over long distances before reaching the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), where they mix with local pollutants, resulting in unique physicochemical properties, such as a high aging degree. An analysis of the annual trend of dust events in the YRD reveals an increasing impact of dust aerosols in the region. This study investigates the effect of dust aerosols on cloud liquid water content (CLWC) in the YRD. During dust events, CLWC exhibits a significant decline, decreasing by approximately 42.3 % compared to background levels. To further assess this impact, both the Fixed Effects (FE) model and the Structural Equation Model (SEM) are employed, confirming the substantial inhibitory effect of dust aerosols on CLWC. The FE model estimates that dust aerosols contribute to a 25.37 % reduction in CLWC. Moreover, model results suggest that relying solely on aerosol optical depth (AOD) data, without considering coarse-mode aerosol optical depth (CAOD), may obscure the pronounced influence of dust aerosols. The SEM results further reveal that the fitting coefficients between AOD and CAOD can differ by up to 50 %, highlighting the potential underestimation of the inhibitory effects of dust aerosols. This study underscores the necessity of incorporating particle size information in aerosol-climate effect research to improve the accuracy of assessments."

 Exposure to fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from woodsmoke is a national and global public health concern. While wood heat use is increasing in the Northeast U.S., exposure to woodsmoke in rural valleys in this region remains understudied. Low-cost sensors have recently emerged as a promising strategy to better assess PM2.5 exposure in communities across the globe. However, real-world, long-term community air monitoring studies deploying low-cost sensors are lacking. Such studies are necessary to validate performance over time for the goals of assessing exposure trends and providing practical guidance to future community-scale projects. Here, we evaluated PM2.5 community-wide exposure over four years in a rural, woodsmoke impacted community that deployed a Purple Air network. We determined significant differences between the PM2.5 regulatory reference monitor and Purple Air PM2.5 concentrations across the community, over multiple heating seasons, at both hourly (p < 0.01) and 8-h average time intervals (p < 0.001). PM2.5 was especially elevated in the evenings (6 p.m.–2 a.m.), with a maximum 1-h average of 81.7 μg/m3 and a maximum 8-h average of 78.7 μg/m3. Consistent with other performance evaluations in the literature, we determined Purple Air sensors have low bias after correction (2.4 % Normalized Mean Bias Error [NMBE], 3.3 μg/m3 Root Mean Square Error [RMSE]). Co-located sensors were reliable in harsh winter conditions for up to three years. We suggest quality assurance, data management, correction model selection, and citizen science partnerships are critical considerations for sensor network deployments aiming to assess long-term exposure and health."

 Upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) aerosols are long-lived and play an essential role in the global radiation budget and climate, primarily contributed by volcanic eruptions and wildfires. This study explored two UTLS aerosol perturbation events over Wuhan (30.5°N, 114.4°E) in 2021, observed using ground-based lidar and multiple spaceborne instruments. The first event, on 16–17 April, involved a stratospheric aerosol layer at altitudes of 14.0–15.3 km, originating from the La Soufrière volcano eruption (13.33°N, 61.18°W) on 9 April. The volcanic aerosols were rapidly transported eastward across the Northern Hemisphere tropics, spanning half the globe within a week. Particle depolarization ratio δp values were 0.10–0.15 and 0.06–0.10 for each day, respectively, indicating that some particles remained relatively fresh due to the short transport time; aerosol backscatter coefficient was 2 × 10−5–8 × 10−5 km−1 sr−1. The second event occurred from 20 to 24 July, involving a prominent aerosol layer at altitudes of 16.5–17.0 km. For the first time, UTLS aerosols over central China were linked to a Siberian wildfire event nine days earlier, which released substantial smoke particles. The smoke plume was transported along a clockwise path influenced by the Asian monsoon anticyclone, enhancing the stratospheric aerosol optical depth (sAOD) to 0.006–0.010, approximately double the background sAOD (0.0044) over Wuhan. A layer-mean δp of 0.08 suggested the dominance of partially aged, non-spherical smoke particles.

 Water vapor is significant in numerical weather prediction. As an important water vapor content indicator, precipitable water vapor (PWV) exhibits a strong correlation with actual precipitation. Limited by the measurement mechanism and the distribution of sensors, the existing measurements suffer from issues such as low spatial-temporal resolution and discontinuous observation. In this study, the PWV retrieval method from geosynchronous synthetic aperture radar (GEO SAR) image is proposed based on map drift (MD) autofocus method. By leveraging the navigation signal to deduce water vapor, we attempt to estimate the phase delay to measure PWV. The method utilizes the phase error caused by tropospheric propagation as valuable information. Continuous PWV measurement over a large area is achieved through single observation, compared with navigation signal measurement. Zenith hydrostatic delay (ZHD) is calculated and brought in phase compensation to obtain imaging result. Zenith wet delay (ZWD) is calculated by estimating quadratic phase by MD algorithm, and then PWV can be retrieved with conversion coefficient. Taking Hong Kong region, which experiences heavy rainfall, as the study area, and combining data from International GNSS Service (IGS), the Hong Kong Observatory, and the FY-3D satellite, the PWV retrieval accuracy is verified. The proposed algorithm can retrieve all-weather, full-time, high spatial-temporal resolution PWV data."

Precisely quantifying these effects requires accurately representing smoke injection height in climate and air quality models. However, existing parameterizations of smoke injection height often diverge from actual observations, commonly underestimating smoke injection height from extreme burnings. In this study, we improve a widely used smoke injection model by integrating two critical processes: aerosol radiative absorption and atmospheric convection. The new parameterization, optimized and validated by satellite measurements of smoke extinction profiles above active fires, achieves a 10% reduction in root mean square error and an over 95% reduction in mean bias compared to its predecessor. Such improvements are especially pronounced in tropical and shrubland‐dominated regions.

We implemented a recently developed parameterization which relates the number flux of sea spray aerosols to nanophytoplankton cell abundances in the mesoscale model WRF‐Chem and evaluated the impact on the prediction of sea spray aerosols (SSA) number concentrations and cloud properties over the Southern Ocean. Compared to SSA concentrations simulated using the whitecap function available in the model, the use of a function derived from recent observations in the Southern Ocean leads to a decrease in predicted SSA number concentrations (by ∼46%–47% over the domain); this further translates into a decrease in the cloud droplet number concentrations and a decrease (respectively an increase) of the liquid cloud water path (CWP) and rain water path (RWP). A strong increase in SSA number concentrations is predicted when the influence of marine biota is taken into account (by 172%–343%), with a concurrent clear increase of the number of cloud droplets and a subsequent increase (decrease) of the CWP (RWP). Detailed comparison of model outputs and measurements further demonstrates that accounting for the role of marine biological activity is essential to predict more realistic SSA number concentrations and spatio‐temporal variability. Comparisons of modeled vertical profiles of CWP and RWP with remote sensing measurements are also ameliorated with the account of marine biology."

Gero,Strengthening Atmospheric Greenhouse Effect at the Arctic North Slope of Alaska Site Evidenced by Long‐Term Records of the Downwelling Longwave Radiance Spectrum,"Arctic amplification, the accelerated warming of the Arctic compared to lower latitude, remains poorly understood, particularly regarding the role of clouds. In this study, we analyze 26 years of downwelling longwave radiation (DLR) measurements from an Extended‐range Atmospheric Emitted Radiance Interferometer (E‐AERI) at the US Department of Energy's North Slope of Alaska site. Our analysis reveals a pan‐spectral increase in DLR under all sky conditions, primarily driven by an enhanced greenhouse effect from thick/low clouds and greenhouse gases. We find that the observed DLR trends are primarily driven by radiance changes within individual sky conditions, rather than changes in cloud fraction, suggesting fundamental shifts in atmospheric emissivity and/or temperature. Comparative analysis between the Southern Great Plains (mid‐latitude) and North Slope of Alaska (high‐latitude) sites demonstrates that clouds impact the longwave surface energy balance differently between the two locations. In the Arctic, the pan‐spectral increase in DLR trend dampens out the radiative cooling of the warming surface, contributing significantly to Arctic amplification. Consistent positive trends are found in the far‐infrared, a spectral region sensitive to even small changes of the dry and cold Arctic's atmosphere and of significant interest in the current warming context. Additionally, we observe a relatively weaker DLR trend in the ozone absorption band under every sky condition, indicating a tropospheric ozone radiative forcing in the Arctic climate."

Samset;Camilla W. Stjern;Manoj Joshi;Laura J. Wilcox;Robert J. Allen;Wei Hua;Shuanglin Li,Physical processes influencing the Asian climate due to black carbon emission over East Asia and South Asia,"Black carbon (BC) aerosol is emitted from the incomplete combustion of biomass and fossil fuels. We found that Asian BC leads to strong local cooling and drying. Reductions in precipitation primarily depend on the thermodynamic effects due to solar radiation absorption by BC. The combined thermodynamic and dynamic effects shape the spatial pattern of precipitation responses to Asian BC. These results help us further understand the impact of emissions of anthropogenic aerosols on Asian climate. 
 Many studies have shown that black carbon (BC) aerosols over Asia have significant impacts on regional climate but with large diversities in the intensity, spatial distribution, and physical mechanism of regional responses. In this study, we utilized a set of systematic regional aerosol perturbations (SyRAPs) using a reduced-complexity climate model, FORTE2 (Fast Ocean Rapid Troposphere Experiment version 2), to investigate responses of the Asian climate to BC aerosols over East Asia only, South Asia only, and both regions at once and to thoroughly examine related physical processes. Results show that regional BC aerosols lead to strong surface cooling, air temperature warming in the low-level troposphere, and drying over the perturbed areas, with seasonal differences in magnitude and spatial distribution. Atmospheric energy budget analysis suggests that reductions in local precipitation primarily depend on the substantial local atmospheric heating due to shortwave absorption by BC. Increases in dry-static-energy (DSE) flux divergence partly offset the reduced precipitation over North China in summer and most of China and India in the other three seasons. Decreases in DSE flux divergence lead to a stronger reduction in precipitation over South China and central India in summer. Changes in DSE flux divergence are mainly due to vertical motions driven by diabatic heating in the middle and lower troposphere. BC perturbations also exert non-local climate impacts through the changes in DSE flux divergence. This study provides a full chain of physical processes of the local climate responses to the Asian BC increases and gives some insights to better understand the uncertainties in model responses."

Burrows;Hartmut Bösch,A study of measurement scenarios for the future CO2M mission: avoidance of detector saturation and the impact on XCO2 retrievals,"Optical detectors have a maximum signal (saturation). Exceedance means that the measurement has to be discarded. We investigate where saturation will occur for the future European satellite mission dedicated to CO2 monitoring (CO2M) and strategies to avoid saturation. Saturation impacts coverage and precision, both of which are important for estimation of local CO2 emissions. We find that taking two pictures per sampling should be sufficient to avoid saturation for CO2M, with some impact on CO2 precision. 
 The direct and indirect release of carbon dioxide (CO2) by human activities into the atmosphere has been the main driver of anthropogenic climate change since the industrial revolution. The Paris Agreement from 2015 requires regular country-based reports of greenhouse gas emissions. Inverse modeling of observed concentrations of greenhouse gases is one important approach to verify  reported emissions. The future constellation of Copernicus Anthropogenic CO2 Monitoring (CO2M) satellites is dedicated to greenhouse gas measurements with high spectral and spatial resolution and wide coverage. The requirements for the performance of the instruments and retrieval algorithms for the column-averaged dry-air mole fraction (XCO2) are stringent in order to identify, assess and monitor CO2 emissions from space. In this study, we analyze the impact of avoiding detector saturation on the precision and spatial coverage of XCO2. We use the Fast atmOspheric traCe gAs retrievaL (FOCAL) algorithm, which has been selected to be one of the operational greenhouse gas retrieval algorithms to be implemented within the CO2M ground segment. In order to avoid saturation, the number of read-outs per sampling time can be increased and the signals can be co-added on board, which we refer to as “temporal oversampling” in this study. We use a subsampled 1-year dataset of simulated radiances to define the temporal oversampling factors (OSFs) that are sufficient to avoid detector saturation and then apply the defined OSF combinations globally. We find that OSFs larger than 1 will lead to a significant decrease in the number of saturated observations, with some impact on the median XCO2 precision, concluding that OSFs larger than 1 should be considered for the satellite mission. These results are based on simulated radiances. Consequently, the real impact on  precision should be analyzed in more detail during the commissioning phase of the satellite."

The new Paranal Airglow Line And Continuum Emission model calculates the emission spectrum and its variability with an unprecedented accuracy. Relying on a large spectroscopic data set from astronomical spectrographs and theoretical molecular/atomic data, this model is valuable for airglow research and astronomical observatories. 
 Below about 2.3 µm, the nighttime emission of the Earth's atmosphere is dominated by non-thermal radiation. Excluding aurorae, the emission is caused by chemical reaction chains that are driven by the daytime photolysis and photoionisation of constituents of the middle and upper atmosphere by hard ultraviolet photons from the Sun. As this airglow can outshine even scattered moonlight in the near-infrared regime, the understanding of the Earth's night-sky brightness requires good knowledge of the complex airglow emission spectrum and its variability. However, airglow modelling is very challenging, as it would require atomic and molecular parameters, rate coefficients for chemical reactions, and knowledge of the complex dynamics at the emission heights with a level of detail that is difficult to achieve. In part, even the chemical reaction pathways remain unclear. Hence, the comprehensive characterisation of airglow emission requires large data sets of empirical data. For fixed locations, this can be best achieved by archived spectra of large astronomical telescopes with wide wavelength coverage, high spectral resolving power, and good temporal sampling. Using 10 years of data from the X-shooter echelle spectrograph in the wavelength range from 0.3 to 2.5 µm and additional data from the Ultraviolet and Visual Echelle Spectrograph at the Very Large Telescope at Cerro Paranal in Chile, we have succeeded in building a comprehensive spectroscopic airglow model for this low-latitude site with consideration of theoretical data from the HITRAN database for molecules and from different sources for atoms. The Paranal Airglow Line And Continuum Emission (PALACE) model comprises nine chemical species, 26 541 emission lines, and three unresolved continuum components. Moreover, there are climatologies of relative intensity, solar cycle effect, and residual variability with respect to local time and day of year for 23 variability classes. Spectra can be calculated with a stand-alone code for different conditions, including optional atmospheric absorption and scattering. In comparison to the observed X-shooter spectra, PALACE shows convincing agreement and is significantly better than the previous, widely used airglow model for Cerro Paranal."

 This study reports the accuracy and uncertainty of aerosol optical depth (AOD) retrievals for the dark target (DT) algorithm over Africa. Three AOD products from the Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), the NOAA-20 Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), and the Suomi-NPP (SNPP) VIIRS were evaluated against ground-based Aerosol Robotic Network (AERONET) observations during the period from 2018 to 2023. The validation results indicate that all three products show good validation accuracy in northern Africa, with a slight underestimation in southern Africa. However, it is worth noting that a severe systematic underestimation was observed for all three products in western Africa. Although the correlation coefficients (R) between these three products and the AERONET observations in western Africa are all greater than 0.9, they exhibit significant negative mean biases (MB) of less than −0.18 and root mean square errors (RMSE) exceeding 0.25. Subsequently, an in-depth analysis of error dependence was conducted to explore the underlying causes of this underestimation in this region. The analysis reveals that the aerosol model assumptions and surface reflectance estimation in the DT algorithm jointly lead to this underestimation. Specifically, the underestimation is more pronounced under conditions of strongly absorbing aerosols and sparse vegetation surfaces with high reflectance. Additionally, it was found that as the scattering angle (SCA) increases, the degree of AOD underestimation also intensifies. These results provide critical insights to guide the ongoing refinement of the DT algorithm in western Africa."

CAAs transported by Gobi dust were rich in alanine, glycine and glutamic acid. Glycine and leucine in Gobi Desert sources exhibited δ15N depletion by more than 6 ‰ compared to their values in urban PM2.5. Substantial protein-N deposition can be transported by the Gobi Desert to northern China over brief periods. 
 Asian dust can greatly influence the ecosystem's productivity and biogeochemical cycles by providing new nutrients. However, the transport of proteinaceous matter (combined amino acids, CAAs) by Asian dust to downwind ecosystems remains unclear. Here, the concentrations and δ15N values of individual CAAs in Gobi surface soil and vegetation and in PM2.5 samples from four cities in northern China were characterized. Proline dominated the total pool of CAAs in urban PM2.5 during non-dust periods, whereas CAAs transported by Gobi dust were rich in alanine, glycine and glutamic acid. The concentrations and percentages of these three CAAs in PM2.5 from northern China notably increased during dust periods. During non-dust periods, the δ15N values of individual CAAs in urban PM2.5 fell within their respective ranges in local urban sources, suggesting CAAs in PM2.5 were primarily influenced by local urban sources during non-dust periods. Compared to their values in urban PM2.5 during non-dust periods, glycine and leucine in Gobi Desert sources exhibited δ15N depletion by more than 6 ‰. During dust periods, glycine and leucine in urban PM2.5 all exhibited negative shifts in their δ15N values, confirming that Gobi dust is a significant source of CAAs in PM2.5 in northern China. The dry deposition of protein N from Gobi dust was calculated using nitrogen isotopic mass balance based on the δ15N values of glycine and leucine, yielding a value of up to 0.36 mgNm-2d-1. The rapid accumulation of such considerable protein N quantities may profoundly affect oligotrophic ecosystem productivity."

Murphy;Douglas Kinnison;Jian Guan,Two-years of stratospheric chemistry perturbations from the 2019–2020 Australian wildfire smoke,"The Australian 2019–2020 wildfires injected a substantial amount of smoke into the upper atmosphere, causing unusual chemical reactions that altered the chemical makeup of the upper atmosphere. This led to ozone depletion in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitudes that likely did not fully recover until 2 years after the initial event due to the persistent chemical effects of the smoke. 
 The very large pyrocumulonimbus events that occurred during the Australian summer of 2019–2020 caused extremely unusual partitioning of stratospheric chlorine in the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude and Antarctic regions not only in 2020 but also in 2021. This was likely caused by enhanced HCl solubility in organic species that increased heterogeneous chemistry. Here, we show that observed HCl and ClONO2 values remain outside the pre-wildfire satellite range, measured from 2005 until just prior to the event, in both the Southern Hemisphere midlatitude and Antarctic regions in 2021. Through model simulations, we replicate this prolonged multiyear chemical perturbation, in good agreement with observations. This was achieved by calculating the HCl solubility in mixed wildfire and sulfate aerosols consistent with assumptions of (1) liquid–liquid phase separation and (2) linear dependence on organic and sulfate composition. The model simulations also suggest that the Australian pyrocumulonimbus organic aerosols contributed to low midlatitude ozone values in 2020 and 2021. A marked, photochemically controlled seasonality of the chemical perturbations and ozone depletion is also observed and simulated, and its underlying chemical drivers are identified. This work highlights that lower concentrations of smoke still had profound effects on stratospheric heterogeneous chemistry more than a year after the 2019–2020 wildfire event."

The maximum light absorption coefficients were seen in summer due to gas flaring, which is the most significant source in the region. However, the increasing Siberian wildfires had a special share in carbon contribution at this high Arctic station, with a persistent smoke layer extending over the whole troposphere in summer. 
 The influence of aerosols on the Arctic system remains associated with significant uncertainties, particularly concerning black carbon (BC). The polar aerosol station “Island Bely” (IBS), located in the Western Siberian Arctic, was established to enhance aerosol monitoring. Continuous measurements from 2019 to 2022 revealed the long-term effects of light-absorbing carbon. During the cold period, the annual average light-absorption coefficient was 0.7 ± 0.7 Mm−1, decreasing by 2–3 times during the warm period. The interannual mean showed a peak in February (0.9 ± 0.8 Mm−1) then 10 times the lower minimum in June and exhibited high variability in August (0.7 ± 2.2 Mm−1). An increase of up to 1.5 at shorter wavelengths from April to September suggests contribution from brown carbon (BrC). The annual mean equivalent black carbon (eBC) demonstrated considerable interannual variability, with the lowest in 2020 (24 ± 29 ng m−3). Significant difference was observed between Arctic haze and Siberian wildfire periods, with record-high pollution levels in February 2022 (110 ± 70 ng m−3) and August 2021 (83 ± 249 ng m−3). Anthropogenic BC contributed 83 % to the total for the entire study period, and gas flaring, domestic combustion, transportation, and industrial emissions dominated. During the cold season, > 90 % of surface BC was attributed to anthropogenic sources, mainly gas flaring. In contrast, during the warm period, Siberian wildfires contributed to BC concentrations by 48 %. In August 2021, intense smoke from Yakutian wildfires was transported at high altitudes during the region's worst fire season in 40 years."

Its spectral slope contains information about the source region or transport paths of the observed aerosol. The extension to 1064 nm is a recent development led by our institute. We gathered previous observations and added new ones to provide the spectral slope for the most important aerosol types such as marine and continental aerosol, dust, smoke, and sulfate. We compared it to assumptions used for spaceborne backscatter lidars. 
 The extinction-to-backscatter ratio, also known as the lidar ratio, is an important quantity in active remote sensing with lidar. It is a key parameter in aerosol typing and an essential quantity to derive the extinction coefficient from elastic backscatter lidars like the spaceborne Cloud–Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations (CALIPSO) or ceilometer observations. The present study discusses the spectral dependence of the lidar ratio from the frequently measured lidar ratios at 355 and 532 nm to the rarely observed lidar ratio at 1064 nm. Therefore, a special focus is put on the rotational Raman lidar method applied to the emission wavelength of 1064 nm. We present a literature review on existing triple-wavelength lidar ratio observations and add new measurements for marine and continental aerosol. For cirrus clouds and marine and continental aerosol the spectral behavior is neutral; for sulfate aerosol, we see a decrease from 532 to 1064 nm. In the case of mineral dust, the lidar ratio slightly increases towards 1064 nm, and in the case of aged smoke an increase with wavelength is found. Furthermore, we observe an increase in the lidar ratio with relative humidity for continental aerosol and report hygroscopic growth factors. The findings are compared to the assumptions made in the CALIPSO version 4 automated aerosol classification and lidar ratio selection algorithm (Kim et al., 2018). We could confirm these assumptions for marine and sulfate aerosol. However, we see slight differences for mineral dust and continental aerosol and pronounced differences for elevated smoke."

The baseline Level 2 product was generated for the first 18 months of POSP measurements from December 2021 to May 2023 and is publicly available and registered at https://doi.org/10.57760/sciencedb.14748 (Chen et al., 2024c). The obtained POSP/GF-5(02) aerosol and surface products are validated and intercompared with the ground-based AERONET reference aerosol dataset and other independent satellite products, such as the NOAA-20 VIIRS/DB aerosol product and the MODIS MCD43 surface product. The results show generally good consistency of POSP products with AERONET, the VIIRS/NOAA-20 aerosol dataset, and the MODIS surface product. Moreover, the developed POSP product includes not only total aerosol optical depth (AOD) but also detailed properties of aerosols (aerosol size, absorption, layer height, type, etc.), along with full-surface bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), bidirectional polarization distribution function (BPDF), black-sky albedo, white-sky albedo, and normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI). These parameters are of high importance to constrain the Earth–atmosphere radiation budget. The retrieval of these properties seems to be possible due to the polarimetric capabilities and wide UV–VIS–NIR–SWIR spectral range of POSP observations and advances of the used GRASP/Models retrieval approach. Finally, some potential improvements for the POSP Level 1–Level 2 processing chain are identified, and the limitations and lessons learned are discussed."

These models are useful for studying the composition of the Earth's and other planets' atmospheres. Understanding the results of these models can be difficult. Here, we build on previous work to develop open-source code that can identify the reaction chains (pathways) that produce the results of these models, facilitating the understanding of these results. 
 We describe the development of Chempath, an open-source pathway analysis program for photochemical models.  This algorithm can help understand the results of complex photochemical models by identifying the most important reaction chains (pathways) for the production and destruction of a species of interest in a reaction system. The algorithm can also quantify the contributions of the pathways to the production and destruction of a species. Chempath is an open-source Python re-implementation of the algorithm developed by Lehmann (2004). However, Chempath does not include the balance of concentration changes and reaction rates that Lehmann's algorithm uses to eliminate imbalances due to numerical errors. Instead, Chempath quantifies the contributions of these imbalances to the production and destruction of a species.We demonstrate how to apply Chempath to both a simple box model and a one-dimensional photochemical model, using a reaction system for Earth's present-day atmosphere. Chempath can identify well-known chemical mechanisms for O3 production and destruction in these models, suggesting that this algorithm can be applied to understand photochemical models of less-well-known atmospheres, like past and exoplanet atmospheres."

Tracer release experiments were conducted at two urban sites, and the results showed that the vertical plume dispersion coefficient in urban surface has an exponential relationship with plume travel distance, despite the surface topology. The results were fitted to a new vertical dispersion parametrization: ln(Dz) = −2.42 × ln(x) + 6.28. Using the new vertical dispersion parametrization along with lateral dispersion widths mapped through mobile measurements, the CH4 emission rates of CNG fueling stations were determined, with an average of 2.5 (95% CI [0.21,30]) kg h–1 for normal operating conditions, and 0.56 (95% CI [0.07,4.4]) kg h–1 for stations under nonoperating conditions. A CH4 emission factor (EF) of CNG fueling stations in Beijing was calculated based on the measured CH4 emission rate and the annual CNG consumption in transportation, with an average of 0.010 (95% CI [0.001,0.087]) kg/kg.

The products of α-pinene ozonolysis measured experimentally are typically characterized by only their molecular formulas, while their structures and formation mechanisms often remain unclear. In this work, we theoretically map the oxidation pathways, structures, and formation time scales of the major first-generation products formed from α-pinene ozonolysis by calculating the H-shift and bond-scission reaction rate coefficients of the peroxy (RO2) and alkoxy (RO) radicals that arise under atmospheric conditions with different RO2 bimolecular reaction rates (kbi): polluted (kbi > 0.2 s–1), moderate (0.2 s–1 > kbi > 0.01 s–1), and pristine (kbi ≈ 0.01 s–1). In polluted environments, almost no RO2 unimolecular reactions are of importance and ozonolysis leads to nitrates and small fragmented products. By contrast, in moderate to pristine atmospheres, C10 highly oxygenated organic molecules (HOMs) with up to 12 oxygen atoms can form from either purely unimolecular or a combination of unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Our results suggest that explicit chemical mechanisms of α-pinene ozonolysis used ubiquitously in the literature require significant revision in their treatment of unimolecular-isomerization and stereoisomer-specific reactions."

NOx is not the only species that affects OH—isoprene, the most significant non‐methane hydrocarbon by total emissions, is oxidized by OH, which can deplete OH during periods of high emissions. Using satellite isoprene retrievals from the Cross‐track infrared sounder (CrIS), we find anomalously high isoprene columns during 2020, coincident with high methane growth. Isoprene's oxidation produces carbon monoxide, which can be transported over longer distances and decrease OH outside of isoprene source regions. Elevated isoprene concentrations may have contributed 13% (bounds: 10%–28%) of 2020's methane growth if we assume no change in NOx emissions in 2020. Since COVID‐19 decreased anthropogenic NOx emissions, this estimate is an upper‐limit and may depend on whether isoprene or NO emissions drove this isoprene anomaly."

 The derivation of Diurnal Temperature Cycle (DTC) models from geostationary satellite data plays a critical role in temperature monitoring of the landscape and thermal anomaly applications such as wildfire detection. This study compares the performance of physical-based and data-driven DTC models on 1,305 study sites across Australia, leveraging Himawari-8 AHI middle-infrared (MIR) band 7 data. The physical-based model, GOT09 (based on Göttsche and Olesen study), achieved the highest accuracy, with a mean validation Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.41 K, but its practical application was limited by a lower model generation rate (48.77%), especially under high cloud cover conditions. Among data-driven methods, the proposed TRI model (named after the first author) balances accuracy and practical feasibility, achieving a validation RMSE of 3.62 K and a generation rate of 85.07%. The TRI model consistently generated reliable DTCs under various environmental conditions, including high cloud cover, outperforming alternative data-driven models such as RW (from Roberts-Wooster study), XIE (from Xie et al. study), and HAL (from Hally et al. study). Additionally, the TRI model maintained reliability across diverse land cover and climate types, showing only minimal variations in performance. The study further highlights strategies for addressing cloud and data availability challenges, proposing methods such as the use of previous day’s DTC or adjusting training data criteria in cloudy conditions. These approaches ensure a continuous temperature background where continuity of measurements is required, such as for wildfire detection. Overall, the research underscores the importance of balancing accuracy and model generation rates in DTC modeling, particularly for real-time applications.

 The air quality in major cities has declined due to increasing urbanization and industrialization, resulting in serious health and crucial economic impacts. The presence of particulate matter in the atmosphere, specifically PM2.5 (fine) and PM10 (fine and coarse), creates a substantial threat to human health. Prediction of PM concentration levels using machine learning (ML) might help the government to prepare a better prevention and safety plan that can eventually lower the risk factor. The present study is based on predicting the PM concentration in Delhi–NCR (western Uttar Pradesh) by developing a ML model for PM2.5 and PM10 under different atmospheric conditions, including precipitation, wind speed, temperature, specific humidity, relative humidity, and surface pressure. We have developed a prediction model for two observational stations: the first industrial area (station 1) and the second urban area (station 2). The analysis of particulate matter indicates that seasonal fluctuation significantly influences air pollution levels in industrial areas. It was observed that 90 days of particulate matter concentration exceeded the permissible threshold established by NAAQS (PM2.5 = 60 μg/m3) during the winter season in 2020 and 61 days during the post-monsoon season in 2021. Meteorological parameters, such as temperature inversions and stagnant wind conditions, significantly contribute to pollutant accumulation, especially during the winter and post-monsoon seasons. The Neural Network and Random Forest models outperformed compared to other ML models, achieving R2 values of 0.74 for PM2.5 at station 1 and 0.84 for PM10 at station 2, indicating enhanced precision in explaining non-linear correlations between meteorological parameters and pollutant concentrations. According to the study and predictions, these innovative methods may improve the accuracy of particulate matter prediction and impact policymakers and decision-makers within pollution control agencies to improve air quality."

 Aerosols substantially influence microphysical processes within thunderclouds, potentially altering lightning flash rates and electrical characteristics. This research analyzed Cloud-to-Ground (CG) lightning data from the Indian Lightning Location Network (ILLN) for Maharashtra state (Western India) over the period 2014–2023. The seasonal proportion of positive CG lightning events and the underlying mechanisms contributing to their increased frequency have been investigated. The analysis revealed that the percentage of positive CG lightning peaked at approximately 40 % during the Indian Summer Monsoon (ISM) season and the post-monsoon period. These peaks coincided with elevated dust aerosol concentrations in the study area, which were associated with long-range transport of dust aerosols from the Arabian Desert and adjoining areas during the ISM. The high humidity during this period leads to a lower estimated cloud base height compared to the pre-monsoon season, likely facilitating the influx of abundant dust aerosols into thunderclouds. These dust particles act as efficient ice nuclei (IN), alter cloud microphysics, and enhance charge separation processes within thunderclouds. Positive CG lightning showed a significant upward trend, increasing by 141 % (2.41-fold rise) from 2014 to 2023, with an average annual rise of 4312 flashes during the ISM. Additionally, an increasing trend in Dust Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) and Ice Cloud Optical Thickness (ICOT) during the ISM emphasized the potential link between desert dust influx and the rise in positive CG lightning activity, suggesting a role for dust particles in ice formation within thunderclouds. The correlation between ICOT and positive CG lightning further confirmed that increased dust concentrations likely contributed to the rise in positive CG lightning activity. We propose that elevated dust concentrations near the cloud base promote ice crystal accumulation, fostering the development of a positive charge region in the lower portion of the mixed-phase region through a non-inductive charging mechanism. This environment likely contributes to the formation of tripole thunderclouds, characterized by a distinct lower positive charge region, commonly referred to as Inverted Polarity thunderclouds."

 Supermicron sea spray aerosols (SSA) play a crucial role in stratocumulus cloud microphysics and drizzle formation. However, our understanding of SSA's spatiotemporal distribution, production mechanisms, and fluxes in the marine boundary layer remains limited. This study introduces a novel approach to determine supermicron SSA production flux and number concentration at various heights above the ocean surface. Our method leverages Doppler lidar data, specifically attenuated backscatter and vertical velocity, collected at a 105 m range gate during the Eastern Pacific Clouds and Aerosols for Precipitation Experiment (EPCAPE) at Scripps Pier, La Jolla, California. To focus on nascent SSA, we analyzed data from periods with wind directions between 225° and 315° and wind speeds exceeding 4 m s−1. Cloud and precipitation events were excluded using relative humidity, backscatter thresholds, and 2D Video Disdrometer observations. Results show that calculated supermicron SSA number concentrations at 105 m ranged from 0.26 to 2.93 cm−3 for surface wind speeds between 4 and 6 ms−1. When exceeding the method's Limit of Detection, estimated production fluxes ranged from 0.20 to 1.53 cm−2 s−1.

 Global industrialization and urbanization have caused substantial emissions of reactive nitrogen (Nr) into atmospheric, marine, and terrestrial environments. Nitrous acid (HONO), a significant Nr species, exhibits a short lifetime yet has a strong environmental oxidation capacity. Atmospheric HONO production is primarily attributed to homogeneous or heterogeneous reactions of NOx and heterogeneous particulate nitrate reactions. Integrated observational and modeling studies demonstrate that atmospheric HONO critically modulates tropospheric ozone production and overall oxidation capacity through photolysis and reoxidation. The atmosphere-soil HONO exchange is mainly mediated by deposition and microbial activity. HONO cycling across atmosphere-soil boundaries perturbs soil acid-base balance and gas-liquid partitioning, thereby modifying physicochemical properties of soil and restructuring microbial community composition. Photolysis of NOx and particulate nitrate is the main source of HONO formation at the ocean-atmosphere interface, while heterogeneous reactions of NOx with nitrate particles are key processes in marine HONO formation. The sea surface microlayer inhibits HONO dissociation, which may affect its environmental persistence and interactions. Ocean acidification and oxidation-capacity changes are possible consequences of the mutual conversion of HONO in atmosphere-ocean environments. Future studies should elucidate heterogeneous transformation pathways and cross-media migration dynamics of HONO, and quantify its environmental-health impacts."

We found that the contribution of model-derived secondary reactants and unconstrained primary hydrocarbons to total OH reactivity was significantly higher during high ozone episodes (HOE) at 50.5 %, compared to 38.8 % during low ozone episodes (LOE). Aromatic compounds contributed more to OH reactivity during high PM₂.₅ episodes (HPME, 20 %) than during low PM₂.₅ episodes (LPME, 14.5 %). The ROx radical recycling rates were approximately 2.5 to 7.5 times higher than primary production rates during HOE, compared to LOE. Additionally, the RO₂ + NO reaction accounted for a larger share of daily mean O₃ production during HOE (50 %) than during LOE (46 %). Conversely, O₃ photolysis contributed more to daily mean O₃ loss during LOE (37 %) than during HOE (33 %). Finally, a Random Forest model revealed that meteorological and atmospheric chemical conditions together enhanced ozone formation by approximately 63 % (other parts could be explained by the concentrations of precursors). This study sheds light on how various atmospheric conditions and pollutants interact to form secondary pollution, offering valuable insights for more effective pollution control strategies."

Herbert;Andrew I. L. Williams;Philipp Weiss;Duncan Watson-Parris;Elisabeth Dingley;Daniel Klocke;Philip Stier,Regional variability of aerosol impacts on clouds and radiation in global kilometer-scale simulations,"Clouds exist at scales that climate models struggle to represent, limiting our knowledge of how climate change may impact clouds. Here we use a new kilometer-scale global model representing an important step towards the necessary scale. We focus on how aerosol particles modify clouds, radiation, and precipitation. We find the magnitude and manner of responses tend to vary from region to region, highlighting the potential of global kilometer-scale simulations and a need to represent aerosols in climate models. 
 Anthropogenic aerosols are a primary source of uncertainty in future climate projections. Changes to aerosol concentrations modify cloud radiative properties, radiative fluxes, and precipitation from the microphysical to the global scale. Due to computational constraints, we have been unable to explicitly simulate cloud dynamics in global-scale simulations, leaving key processes, such as convective updrafts, parameterized. This has significantly limited our understanding of aerosol impacts on convective clouds and climate. However, new state-of-the-art climate models are capable of representing these scales. In this study, we used the kilometer-scale ICOsahedral Nonhydrostatic (ICON) Earth system model to explore the global-scale rapid response of clouds and precipitation to an idealized distribution of anthropogenic aerosol via aerosol–cloud (ACI) and aerosol–radiation (ARI) interactions. In our simulations over 30 d, we find that the aerosol impacts on clouds and precipitation exhibit strong regional dependence. The impact of ARI and ACI on clouds in isolation shows some consistent behavior, but the magnitude and additive nature of the effects are regionally dependent. Some regions are dominated by either ACI or ARI, whereas others behaved nonlinearly. This suggests that the findings of isolated case studies from regional simulations may not be globally representative;  ARI and ACI cannot be considered independently and should both be interactively represented in modeling studies. We also observe pronounced diurnal cycles in the rapid response of cloud microphysical and radiative properties, which suggests that the usefulness of using polar-orbiting satellites to quantify ACI and ARI may be more limited than presently assumed. The simulations highlight some limitations that need to be considered in future studies. Isolating kilometer-scale aerosol responses from internal variability will require longer averaging periods or ensemble simulations. It would also be beneficial to use interactive aerosols and assess the sensitivity of the conclusions to the cloud microphysics scheme."

Hernandez;Leslie Tanaka;Alejandro Dunnick,Measurement report: Diurnal variability in NO2 and HCHO lower-tropospheric vertical profiles in southeastern Los Angeles,"This work uses spectroscopy to examine the vertical distribution of nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde in southeastern Los Angeles, USA, a region heavily impacted by ozone pollution. We examine how both the amount and vertical profile of the two species vary throughout the day, finding that differences between the two species impact the utilization of satellite-based measurements to diagnose ozone production chemistry and that these impacts are variable depending on the time of day. 
 Ground-level ozone in excess of the United States National Ambient Air Quality Standards remains a prevalent issue across Southern California, particularly in the summer months. To improve our understanding of the vertical distribution of ozone precursors in Southern California, we used ground-based multi-axis differential absorption spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements in Whittier, California, to simultaneously retrieve both near-surface mole fractions and vertical column densities (VCDs) of both NO2 and HCHO. Ratios of HCHO to NO2, commonly referred to as FNR, derived from satellite-based measurements are used to diagnose ozone production chemistry over regions without consistent surface-based measurements. While VCDs of NO2 are well correlated with TROPOMI observations over the study period (R=0.73), HCHO VCDs and FNRs derived from MAX-DOAS observations are less well correlated (R=0.48 and 0.59, respectively). These observations also showed differing diurnal cycles between near-surface mixing ratios and VCDs due to variability in the vertical profile; this diurnal behavior will be increasingly critical to understand given the ongoing shift from Sun-synchronous to geostationary satellite observations.  Using ground-based measurements, we determined FNRs using both surface mole fractions and VCDs, finding that FNRs derived from surface mole fractions are generally lower than those derived from column-based measurements. Evaluating the ozone exceedance probability as a function of FNR for both quantities suggests that the transition from volatile organic compound (VOC)-limited to NOx-limited regimes may begin at lower FNR values than those derived from satellite-based measurements in East Los Angeles. We find that these differences in FNRs derived from ground-based and satellite-based measurements are driven by variability in the vertical distribution of HCHO. These impacts are most pronounced in late afternoon, when ozone exceedances are most prevalent."

Traditional methods have many limitations. This study introduces a new method to measure how each factor contributes to uncertainty. It gains insights into the role of each variable and works for all multi-factor systems. As an application, we analyzed how aerosols affect solar radiation and identified the key factors. These analyses can improve our understanding of the role of aerosols in climate change. 
 The IPCC's assessment report shows that the radiative forcing of aerosol–radiation interactions still involves significant uncertainty. The commonly used method for factor uncertainty estimation is the one-at-a-time (OAT) method, which evaluates factor sensitivity by controlling the change in a single variable while keeping others constant. The outcomes from the OAT method require high data quality to ensure accuracy, and the results are only valid near the selected constant. This study proposes a new method called the Constrained Parameter (CP) method to quantify the uncertainty contribution of factors in a multi-factor system. This method constrains the uncertainty of a single factor between two Monte Carlo simulations and evaluates its sensitivity by analyzing how this change affects output uncertainty. The most significant advantage of the CP method is that it can be applied to any data distribution, and its results can reflect the overall data characteristics. The proportion of factor interactions in the factor uncertainty contributions can be obtained by comparing the results calculated by the CP method and the OAT method. As an application of the CP method, it performs a detailed analysis of aerosol–radiation interaction factors' uncertainty contributions. The top three most sensitive factors are the complex refractive index of aerosol shell materials, light-absorbing carbon parameters, and Mie theory parameters. Due to their high sensitivity and low observational precision, these factors represent significant sources of uncertainty in aerosol–radiation interactions. These factors need to be prioritized for operational observation programs and model parameter inputs."

Wilson,Observing atmospheric rivers using multi-GNSS airborne radio occultation: system description and data evaluation,"This paper describes an airborne radio occultation (ARO) observation system installed on a reconnaissance aircraft that uses GPS signal refraction in the atmosphere to retrieve information about the temperature and moisture in the storm environment as far away as 400 km surrounding the flight track. The characteristics and quality of 1700 ARO refractivity profiles were assessed. These observations are collected to help understand atmospheric rivers and improve their forecasting. 
 Atmospheric rivers (ARs) are narrow filaments of high moisture flux responsible for most of the horizontal transport of water vapor from the tropics to mid-latitudes. Improving forecasts of ARs through numerical weather prediction (NWP) is important for increasing the resilience of the western United States (US) to flooding and droughts. These NWP forecasts rely on the improved understanding of AR physics and dynamics from satellite, radar, aircraft, and in situ observations, and now airborne radio occultation (ARO) can contribute to those goals. The ARO technique is based on precise measurements of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) signal delays collected from a receiver on board an aircraft from setting or rising GNSS satellites. ARO inherits the advantages of high vertical resolution and all-weather capability of spaceborne RO observations and has the additional advantage of continuous and dense sampling of the targeted storm area. This work presents a comprehensive ARO dataset recovered from 4 years of AR Reconnaissance (AR Recon) missions over the eastern Pacific. The final dataset is comprised of ∼ 1700 ARO profiles from 39 flights over approximately 260 flight hours from multiple GNSS constellations. Profiles extend from aircraft cruising altitude (13–14 km) down into the lower troposphere, with more than 50 % of the profiles extending below 4 km, below which the receiver loses or cannot initiate signal tracking. The horizontal drift of the tangent points that comprise a given ARO profile greatly extends the area sampled from just underneath the aircraft to both sides of the flight track (up to ∼ 400 km). The estimated refractivity accuracy with respect to dropsondes is ∼ 1.2 % in the upper troposphere, where the sample points are closely colocated. For the lower troposphere, the agreement is within ∼ 7 %, which is the level of consistency expected given the nature of atmospheric variations over the 300–700 km separation between the lowest point and the dropsonde."

Gregory Huey,Year-Round Analysis of Multiphase Sulfate Production in Aerosol Particles in East Asia,"Missing sulfate production pathways have been implicated as the cause of model underestimates of sulfate during haze events in East Asia. We add multiphase oxidation of SO2 in aerosol particles by H2O2, O3, NO2, HCHO, and O2, catalyzed by transition metal ions (TMIs), to the GEOS-Chem model and evaluate the model with (1) year-round ground-based observations in Seoul, South Korea, (2) airborne observations from the KORUS-AQ field campaign, and (3) fall and winter ground-based observations in Beijing, China. Multiphase chemistry contributes 14% to 90% to total sulfate production depending on the location and season and increases model daily average sulfate by 2 to 3 μg m–3, with maximum daily increases up to 12 μg m–3. From winter to summer, oxidation pathways shift, with the largest fraction of multiphase sulfate production occurring during spring and summer due to oxidation by H2O2. Multiphase oxidation of SO2 by the H2O2 pathway reduces gas-phase H2O2 concentrations by −40% in spring, which improves model agreement with H2O2 airborne observations. Oxidation pathways also shift between cities, in particular the contribution from the TMI and NO2 pathways, which are more important in Beijing than in Seoul. This is due to higher levels of transition metals, and a larger impact of an overly shallow mixed layer in Beijing compared to Seoul. The implementation of multiphase aerosol chemistry in GEOS-Chem here allows for the use of this chemistry in other models that can address boundary layer errors, including WRF-GC and CESM-GC. The analysis presented here shows that this chemistry is important to the simulation of sulfate year-round, not only during haze events, and is unique in showing coupled gas- and aerosol-phase impacts of multiphase chemistry."

The Cloud Profiling Radar and Cloud‐Aerosol Lidar with Orthogonal Polarization carried by these satellites together retrieve detailed vertical structure of clouds, allowing for an objective decomposition of tropical clouds into distinct regimes. The identified cloud regimes are overall robust except that an increasing number of redundant high‐cloud clusters are produced as the specified number of clusters is increased. This redundancy arises because geometrically thin clouds with slightly different altitudes can be mathematically distant from one another in the clustering procedure despite their morphological similarity, suggesting that an excessive number of clusters only generates unrealistic subclasses of high clouds. Objective evaluation metrics indicate that the most appropriate number of clusters is four, where the clusters may be labeled as sparse multilayer clouds, low cloud, high cloud, and deep convective regimes. A five‐cluster classification is also deemed as reasonable, where a fifth regime of congestus clouds joins the other four regimes, practically equivalent to the four‐cluster solution."

 Open biomass burning has major impacts on the Earth system, including on air quality via the emission of primary fine particulate matter (PM2.5). Its effect on secondary inorganic PM2.5 formation is comparatively little investigated. Simulations with the EMEP MSC-W WRF atmospheric chemistry transport model reveal that global biomass burning emissions lead to elevated annual mean ammonium nitrate (NH4NO3) concentrations in densely populated regions where biomass burning mostly does not occur. These regions include eastern USA, northwestern Europe, the Indo-Gangetic Plain and eastern China, where NH4NO3 conditional on biomass burning emissions constitutes between 29% and 51% of the annual mean PM2.5 conditional on biomass burning emissions. Biomass burning emissions of CO, NOx (NO and NO2) and volatile organic compounds perturb the HOx (OH and HO2) cycle globally, such that there is increased oxidation of anthropogenic NOx to HNO3. This results in additional contributions to local-scale secondary NH4NO3 in areas with high emissions of anthropogenic NOx and NH3. These teleconnections increase, by up to a factor of two, the contribution of biomass burning emissions to long-term PM2.5 concentrations, which measurements alone cannot identify as an impact of biomass burning activity. This may become relatively more important as anthropogenic sources of PM2.5 are reduced and as the wildfire component of biomass burning increases under climate change."

 Boreal forest is an important source of atmospheric aerosol particles, making clouds more reflective in a warmer climate. However, little is known about the aerosol effect on the scattering of radiation under a cloudy sky, which can have a cooling effect by enhancing the carbon uptake of boreal ecosystems. Here we show observational evidence that higher natural aerosol loadings associated with warmer conditions increase diffuse radiation in the presence of cumulus clouds and further invigorate photosynthesis in the boreal forest. The enhancement of photosynthesis occurs in the morning and evening or under clouds with cloud fraction 0.4–0.8, when moderate vapor pressure deficit keeps stomata in foliage open and the diffuse fertilization effect is maximized. The total effect of high aerosol loading is a further increase of the daily carbon uptake under cumulus clouds by 12% of the possible diffuse fertilization enhancement in the ecosystem. Our results provide observational support for the atmosphere-biosphere photosynthesis-based feedback, not only under clear sky but also under cumulus clouds frequently observed over boreal forest in summer.

 As a key precursor of radicals and ozone (O3), formaldehyde (HCHO) affects the atmospheric oxidative capacity of the troposphere. Herein, we investigated seasonal variation of HCHO levels, sources, sinks, and its impact on O3 based on 17-month online measurements of HCHO and other trace gases at an urban site in Beijing. The average mixing ratio of HCHO during the warm season was 6.09 ± 3.37 ppbv, marking an increase of approximately 50 % compared to the cold season. During the warm season, HCHO accounted for 26.6 ± 6.9 % of the average mixing ratio and 34.6 ± 8.3 % of the OH reactivity for total volatile organic compounds (VOCs), approximately double the levels observed in 2011. The positive matrix factorization analysis reveals that photochemical production accounted for 71.4 % of the average HCHO level during the warm season, while vehicular exhaust contributed 50.6 % during the cold season. A budget analysis of HCHO production (PHCHO) and destruction (DHCHO) rates using a box model based on observations (OBM) shows that during the daytime in the warm season, PHCHO was close to DHCHO, suggesting a near closure of the HCHO budget. During the cold season, DHCHO surpassed PHCHO, possibly driven by primary emissions. The dominant HCHO production pathways were reactions of alkoxyl radicals with oxygen, while its major destruction processes were the reaction with OH radical and self-photolysis during both seasons. The relative incremental reactivity (RIR) values of nitrogen oxides determined using the OBM were negative during the summer. However, these values showed a significant increase from 2011 to 2022, indicating that while O3 production in urban Beijing was primarily VOC-limited, the influence of NO titration on O3 decreased over the decade. The RIR value of HCHO increased by 50 % from 2011 to 2022. Moreover, in 2022, HCHO has become the second most important VOC for O3 formation, following isoprene. This underscores its crucial role in shaping future O3 control measures."

 Quantitative understanding of temporal distribution of submicron-charged particles is essential for estimating both the radiative forcing and the efficiency of particle deposition in human airways. To elucidate their behavior in the atmosphere, the number concentrations of charged and non-charged particles were measured at Noto Peninsula, Japan, to estimate the charge distribution of submicron atmospheric particles using a system that combines a parallel-plate particle separator and optical particle counters. The average charge number (pave) of particles and standard deviation (1σ) were obtained by fitting the particle charge distribution with a Gaussian distribution, representing the shift toward positive or negative and width broadening of the distribution, respectively. During summer, the particle charge distribution shifted toward the negative and the width increased. This change was likely due to collisions with negative cluster ions originating from the local vegetation and the Pacific Ocean under conditions of high negative polar conductivity in the atmosphere. During winter, the pave values were close to zero, and the width decreased. This change may arise from the balanced atmospheric electrical conductivity. The number concentrations of negatively charged and non-charged particles increased in summer and winter, respectively; their chemical compositions were primarily organic matter and sulfate, respectively.

 A new assimilation module for AGRI (Advanced Geostationary Radiation Imager) carried on Fengyun-4B (FY-4B) is developed within the WRFDA (Weather Research and Forecasting model's Data Assimilation) system. The impacts of assimilating FY-4B AGRI clear-sky and all-sky data are evaluated with cycling assimilation experiments for the typhoon Doksuri (2023) and Talim (2023) forecast. For typhoon Doksuri, compared with the benchmark experiment, AGRI assimilation brings a better analysis and forecast for atmospheric variables (wind, temperature and humidity). Meanwhile, clear error reductions for typhoon track and intensity forecasts are achieved with clear-sky and all-sky AGRI assimilation. The positive impact on landing precipitation prediction is also obtained by verifying with GPM (Global Precipitation Measurement) precipitation data. Moreover, AGRI all-sky assimilation yields better typhoon forecasts than clear-sky assimilation. In addition, the channel selection sensitivity for AGRI assimilation is also assessed with group experiments. It is suggested that with the assimilation of a new water vapor channel at 7.42 μm, which is newly added in FY-4B, multiple-channel assimilation shows greater benefit for forecast than single-channel assimilation. The same positive impact of AGRI assimilation is also present in typhoon Talim (2023) forecast. Overall, the all-sky assimilation of FY-4B AGRI water vapor channels data is beneficial for the typhoon forecast."

While atmospheric CO2 mole fraction measurements can be used to assess CUP changes, atmospheric transport and asynchronous timing across regions reduce the accuracy of the estimates. Forward model experiments show that only ~ 50 % of prescribed shifts in CUP timing applied to surface fluxes (ΔCUPNEE) are captured in simulated CO2 mole fraction data at monitoring sites like the Barrow Atmospheric Baseline Observatory. 
 The carbon uptake period (CUP) refers to the time of each year during which the rate of photosynthetic uptake surpasses that of respiration in the terrestrial biosphere, resulting in a net absorption of CO2 from the atmosphere to the land. Since climate drivers influence both photosynthesis and respiration, the CUP offers valuable insights into how the terrestrial biosphere responds to climate variations and affects the carbon budget. Several studies have assessed large-scale changes in CUP based on seasonal metrics from CO2 mole fraction measurements. However, an in-depth understanding of the sensitivity of the CUP as derived from the CO2 mole fraction data (CUPMR) to actual changes in the CUP of the net ecosystem exchange (CUPNEE) is missing. In this study, we specifically assess the impact of (i) atmospheric transport, (ii) interannual variability in CUPNEE, and (iii) regional contribution to the signals that integrate at different background sites where CO2 dry air mole fraction measurements are made. We conducted idealized simulations where we imposed known changes (Δ) to the CUPNEE in the Northern Hemisphere to test the effect of the aforementioned factors in CUPMR metrics at 10 Northern Hemisphere sites. Our analysis indicates a significant damping of changes in the simulated ΔCUPMR due to the integration of signals with varying CUPNEE timing across regions. CUPMR at well-studied sites such as Mauna Loa, Utqiaġvik (formerly Barrow), and Alert showed only 50 % of the applied ΔCUPNEE under non-interannually varying atmospheric transport conditions. Further, our synthetic analyses conclude that interannual variability (IAV) in atmospheric transport accounts for a significant part of the changes in the observed signals. However, even after separating the contribution of transport IAV, the estimates of surface changes in CUP by previous studies are not likely to provide an accurate magnitude of the actual changes occurring over the surface. The observed signal experiences significant damping as the atmosphere averages out non-synchronous signals from various regions."

The rates of alkane oxidation by chlorine (Cl) radical in the early morning exceeded those by OH radical, significantly promoted the formation of ROx and ozone (O3), and further enhanced the atmospheric oxidation capacity levels. 
 Nitryl chloride (ClNO2) is an important precursor of chlorine (Cl) radical, significantly affecting ozone (O3) formation and photochemical oxidation. However, the key drivers of ClNO2 production are not fully understood. In this study, the field observations of ClNO2 and related parameters were conducted in a coastal city of Southeast China during the autumn of 2022, combining with machine learning and model simulations to elucidate its key influencing factors and atmospheric impacts. Elevated concentrations of ClNO2 (>500 ppt) were notably observed during nighttime in late autumn, accompanied by increased levels of dinitrogen pentoxide (N2O5) and nitrate (NO3-). Nighttime concentrations of ClNO2 peaked at 3.4 ppb, while its daytime levels remained significant, reaching up to 100 ppt and sustaining at approximately 40 ppt at noon. Machine learning and field observations identified nighttime N2O5 heterogeneous uptake as the predominant pathway for ClNO2 production, whereas NO3- photolysis may contribute to its daytime generation. Additionally, ambient temperature (T) and relative humidity (RH) emerged as primary meteorological factors affecting ClNO2 formation, mainly through their effects on thermal equilibrium and N2O5 hydrolysis processes, respectively. Ultraviolet (UV) radiation was found to play a dual role in ClNO2 concentrations around noon. Box model simulations showed that, under high-ClNO2 conditions, the rates of alkane oxidation by Cl radical in the early morning exceeded those by OH radical. Consequently, volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation by Cl radical contributed ∼19 % to ROx production rates, thereby significantly impacting O3 formation and atmospheric oxidation capacity. This research enriched the understanding of ClNO2 generation and loss pathways, providing valuable insights for the regulation of photochemical pollution in coastal regions."

We found that a new type of data from the Greenhouse Gas Observing Satellite (GOSAT), which contains information about methane in the lowest layer of Earth's atmosphere, could provide reliable estimates of recent methane emissions when combined with atmospheric modelling. Therefore, the use of such data is encouraged to improve emission quantification methods and advance our understanding of methane cycles. 
 Satellite-driven inversions provide valuable information about methane (CH4) fluxes, but the assimilation of total column-averaged dry-air mole fractions of CH4 (XCH4) has been challenging. This study explores, for the first time, the potential of the new lower-tropospheric partial column (pXCH4_LT) GOSAT data, retrieved by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA), to constrain global and regional CH4 fluxes. Using the CarbonTracker Europe-CH4 (CTE-CH4) atmospheric inverse model, we estimated CH4 fluxes between 2016–2019 by assimilating the JAXA/GOSAT pXCH4_LT and XCH4 data and surface CH4 observations independently of each other. The Northern Hemisphere CH4 fluxes derived from the pXCH4_LT data were similar to the estimates derived from the surface observations but were underestimated by about 35 Tg CH4 yr−1 (∼ 6 % of the global total) using the XCH4 data. For the Southern Hemisphere, the estimates from both GOSAT inversions were about 15–30 Tg CH4 yr−1 higher than those derived from surface data. The evaluations against independent data from the Atmospheric Tomography Mission aircraft campaign showed good agreement in the lower-tropospheric CH4 from the inversions using the pXCH4_LT and surface data. However, from these inversions, the modelled north–south gradients showed significant overestimation in the upper troposphere and stratosphere, possibly due to relatively uniform inter-hemispheric OH distributions that control CH4 sinks. Overall, we found that the use of the JAXA/GOSAT pXCH4_LT data shows considerable potential in constraining global and regional CH4 fluxes, advancing our understanding of the CH4 budget."

However, inconsistencies between measurements and radiative transfer simulations were found recently, and, so far, there has been no consensus on how to deal with these appropriately. In this study, long-term long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (LP-DOAS) observations were analysed and very good agreement with laboratory measurements was found. 
 Absorption of light in the atmosphere by collision-induced absorption (CIA) by two oxygen molecules O2–O2, in the following referred to as O4, can be used to derive properties of aerosols and clouds from remote sensing observations. In recent years, inconsistencies between the measured atmospheric O4 absorption and radiative transfer simulations were found for Multi-AXis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy (MAX-DOAS) measurements. In the presented study, over two years of observations from a long-path (LP-) DOAS instrument deployed at the German research station Neumayer, Antarctica, are analysed. While MAX-DOAS instruments measure spectra of scattered sunlight at different elevation angles, LP-DOAS utilises an artificial light source and the atmospheric absorptions are measured along a fixed (and well-defined) light path close to the surface. Further, the pristine measurement location allows one to investigate the relation between measured and modelled O4 absorption over a large range of temperatures (−45 to +5 °C). Overall good agreement is found between the retrieved O4 absorption cross-sections covering the absorption band at 360 nm and laboratory measurements. While the best agreement is obtained for the Finkenzeller and Volkamer (2022) cross-sections, deviations at cold ambient temperatures (below ca. −25 °C) are observed for the Thalman and Volkamer (2013) cross-sections. Other O4 absorption bands could not be investigated because these are not (fully) within the spectral range of the measured spectra. This study strongly supports the accuracy of commonly used O4 absorption cross-sections in DOAS analyses, while more work is needed to understand the earlier reported inconsistencies in MAX-DOAS observations."

 The stratospheric gravity waves generated by tropical cyclones (TC-SGWs) are useful for the monitoring of tropical cyclones (TCs) and are also important for the gravity-wave parameterization in numerical models, as they represent a distinct type of gravity waves. Previous studies on TC-SGWs have not characterized TC-SGW global distribution and corresponding local structure related to the background wind. Here we show the global distribution of the TC-SGWs based on 21 years of Atmospheric Infrared Sounder observations, and reveal three global hotspots of the waves as the North Atlantic-Northeast Pacific, the Northwest Pacific, and the South Pacific-Southern Indian region. We also characterize the local structure of the three hotspots and find that although displaying diverse anisotropic structures, they are all shaped by the combination of filtering and refraction effects of the background wind. Our findings provide a guide for global TC-SGW hotspots and demonstrate the contributions of the background wind, which can further provide a preliminary guide for TC monitoring through satellite observations of TC-SGWs."

 The CE318-T sun–sky–moon photometer enables continuous diurnal and nocturnal observations of aerosol optical properties, addressing the long-standing global challenge of lacking detailed nighttime analysis and continuous day–night variation records of aerosol optical characteristics. This study, based on long-term aerosol optical property data from Beijing and continuous diurnal observation data from AERONET CE318-T, investigates the multi-time scale variation characteristics of aerosol optical properties in the urban area of Beijing, including long-term changes (2003–2023), and short-term (2018–2023) annual, seasonal, and diurnal variations. It focused on analyzing the continuous diurnal variation characteristics of aerosol optical depth (AOD) and the Ångström index (AE) and their underlying mechanisms. The results demonstrated a significant decreasing trend in aerosol optical depth at 440 nm (AOD440) from 2003 to 2023, accompanied by a declining proportion of coarse particles. The increasing single-scattering albedo (SSA) indicated the slower downward trend of absorption. For the diurnal variation characteristics from 2018 to 2023, it was found that the hourly means in AOD440 generally exhibited lower levels during the day, with an upward trend, reaching a maximum value of 0.46 at 16:00. During nighttime, the AOD440 levels were higher than during the day but showed a downward trend, decreasing to a minimum value of 0.28 at 5:00. The diurnal variation of AOD440 presented obvious seasonal variation characteristics, continuously decreasing during daytime in summer and at night in autumn and winter. It was found that this variation pattern was related to meteorological conditions and local circulation.

 Wildland fires emit pollutants such as fine particulates (PM2.5), and ozone (O3) precursors that can adversely impact air quality. To better understand processes that directly influence smoke transport and plume chemistry, this study leveraged a coupled fire-atmosphere model (WRF-SFIRE-Chem) to quantify the contributions of wildfire smoke to O3 relative to regional anthropogenic emissions. Coupled fire-atmosphere-chemistry simulations were also used to examine how aerosol radiative feedbacks, i.e., smoke shading, modifies smoke transport and plume chemistry. This study investigated a major smoke episode that occurred during the record-breaking 2020 western U.S. wildfire season. Overall, WRF-SFIRE-Chem was able to reproduce the evolution of a regional smoke plume for the August 2020 smoke event. Sensitivity simulations from WRF-SFIRE-Chem show that O3 contributions from wildfire smoke (21 ± 4.4 ppb) were much larger than O3 enhancements from regional anthropogenic emission sources (11 ± 1.3 ppb). Smoke shading also had a large impact on meteorology where incoming solar radiation and 2-m temperature underneath the smoke plume decreased by ∼400 W m−2 and 4 °C, respectively. Smoke shading also altered smoke transport and reduced O3 concentrations within the smoke plume by up to 10 ppb. These results suggest that sizable enhancements in O3 can occur, even in the absence of regional anthropogenic emissions. This research also highlights the importance of accounting for smoke shading within chemical transport models, which proved to be important in the context of both smoke transport and plume photochemistry."

Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) from wildfire smoke contributes to cardiorespiratory morbidity and mortality, adverse birth outcomes, mental health stressors, and disruptions to food security and traditional livelihoods. However, quantifying health risks remains difficult due to sparse monitoring, challenges in isolating wildfire-specific pollution, and limited long-term exposure assessments. We developed a historical air quality dataset for Alaska using a hybrid approach that integrates GEOS-Chem atmospheric modeling with ground-based data to estimate daily wildfire-attributable PM2.5 at a 0.625° × 0.5° resolution from 2003 to 2020. We aggregated these estimates by census tract and derived metrics to quantify long-term wildfire smoke exposure, then combined these estimates with social vulnerability data to identify populations disproportionately affected. Alaskans experienced an average of 3.5 million person-days of moderate and >800 000 person-days of dense smoke exposure annually. In years when over 2 million acres burned, 86%–98% of census tracts recorded at least 1 d of moderate smoke, and up to 73% experienced dense smoke. Northern Interior Alaska had over 300 cumulative days of poor air quality (∼10% of summer days) over the 18 year period, with smoke waves lasting as long as 43 d. Tracts identified as having high smoke exposure and high smoke vulnerability were generally in rural Interior Alaska; however, urban tracts in Interior and Southcentral were also identified. High-exposure census tracts had statistically greater proportions of housing cost-burdened residents and women of childbearing age. This study highlights the need to move beyond traditional fire metrics and adopt measures that better capture the full scope of human exposure. Our approach provides a framework for assessing health risks and integrating public health into climate adaptation and fire management especially in wildfire-prone regions where observations are sparse."

Although interprovincial agricultural trade can alleviate regional food supply pressures, substantial uncertainties persist regarding the associated ammonia (NH3) emission transfers and their impacts on air quality and human health. Here we fill this gap using a linear programming model to simulate interprovincial trade flows of 26 individual agricultural products, combined with high-resolution NH3 emission inventories and air quality simulation. We found that interprovincial trade-related NH3 emissions reached 2.94 Tg in 2019, accounting for 28.1% of total agricultural NH3 emission, with predominant transfers from eastern and southern China to northern and central China. These trade-related NH3 emissions contributed 2.6 μg m−3 to annual PM2.5 concentrations and caused 252 016 associated premature deaths. Mortality response to trade-related NH3 emissions exhibited spatial heterogeneity across China, driven by regional variations in population density and PM2.5 sensitivity to NH3 emissions.

We propose a new Lagrangian metric based on the density of transport barriers, attracting/repelling coherent structures, to analyze mixing in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model. Our metric is a promising tool for stratospheric analysis, consistent with commonly used metrics to quantify mixing while also providing the advantage of reflecting Lagrangian transport in physical latitude. 
 The study of mixing in the stratosphere is important for understanding the transport of chemical species and the dynamics of the atmosphere. How best to quantify this mixing is not settled, however. In recent years, Lagrangian coherent structures (LCSs) have emerged as a valuable tool for examining mixing in fluid flows, and in this work, we present a stratospheric mixing metric based on the LCS framework. We identify LCSs associated with the transport of air masses and quantify the amount of mixing between different regions of the atmosphere in the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model (WACCM). Our results show that LCSs provide a powerful approach to analyze mixing in the stratosphere and can be used to identify regions of high and low mixing as well as to study the dynamics of the atmosphere. The results are compared with those obtained by two other tools to quantify mixing: the commonly used effective diffusivity and the recently introduced isentropic eddy diffusivity. We find qualitative agreement between these metrics for much of the stratosphere, although there are regions where they clearly disagree. A significant advantage of the LCS mixing metric is that it reflects Lagrangian transport in physical latitude rather than the equivalent latitude coordinate needed to calculate effective diffusivity, and we discuss other advantages and disadvantages of these methods."

Marais;Gongda Lu;Robert G. Ryan;Bastien Sauvage,Characterization of reactive oxidized nitrogen in the global upper troposphere using recent and historic commercial and research aircraft campaigns and GEOS-Chem,"This study uses reactive nitrogen observations from NASA DC-8 research aircraft and the In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) campaigns to characterize reactive nitrogen seasonality and composition in the global upper troposphere and to diagnose the greatest knowledge gaps from comparison to a state-of-the-science model, GEOS-Chem, that need to be resolved for climate, nitrogen cycle, and air pollution assessments. 
 Reactive oxidized nitrogen (NOy) in the upper troposphere (UT) influences global climate, air quality, and tropospheric oxidants, but this understanding is limited by knowledge of the relative contributions of individual NOy components in this undersampled layer. Here, we use sporadic NASA DC-8 aircraft campaign observations, after screening for plumes and stratospheric influence, to characterize UT NOy composition and to evaluate current knowledge of UT NOy as simulated by the GEOS-Chem model. The use of DC-8 data follows confirmation that these intermittent data reproduce NOy seasonality from routine commercial aircraft observations (2003–2019), supporting the use of DC-8 data to characterize UT NOy. We find that peroxyacetyl nitrate (PAN) dominates UT NOy (30 %–64 % of NOy), followed by nitrogen oxides (NOx≡ NO + NO2) (6 %–18 %), peroxynitric acid (HNO4) (6 %–13 %), and nitric acid (HNO3) (7 %–11 %). Methyl peroxy nitrate (MPN) makes an outsized contribution to NOy (14 %–24 %) over the Southeast US relative to the other regions sampled (2 %–7 %). GEOS-Chem, sampled along DC-8 flights, exhibits much weaker seasonality than the DC-8, underestimating summer and spring NOy and overestimating winter and autumn NOy. The model consistently overestimates peroxypropionyl nitrate (PPN) by ∼ 10–16 pptv or 10 %–90 % and underestimates NO2 by 6–36 pptv or 31 %–65 %, as the model is missing PPN photolysis. A model underestimate in MPN of at least ∼ 50 pptv (13-fold) over the Southeast US results from uncertainties in processes that sustain MPN production as air ages. Our findings highlight that a greater understanding of UT NOy is critically needed to determine its role in the nitrogen cycle, air pollution, climate, and the abundance of oxidants."

Flynn,Atmospheric processing and aerosol aging  responsible for observed increase in  absorptivity of long-range-transported  smoke over the southeast Atlantic,"Tiny atmospheric particles from wildfire smoke impact the climate by interacting with sunlight and clouds, the extent of which is uncertain due to gaps in understanding how smoke changes over time. We developed a new method using remote sensing instruments to track how these particles evolve during atmospheric transport. Our results show that the ability of these particles to absorb sunlight increases as they travel. This discovery could help improve predictions of future climate scenarios. 
 Biomass burning aerosol (BBA) from agricultural fires in southern Africa contributes about one-third of the global carbonaceous aerosol load. These particles have strong radiative effects in the southeast Atlantic (SEA), which depend in part on the radiative contrast between the aerosol layer in the free troposphere (FT) and the underlying cloud layer. However, there is large disagreement in model estimates of aerosol-driven climate forcing due to uncertainties in the vertical distribution, optical properties, and life cycle of these particles. This study applies a novel method combining remote sensing observations with regional model outputs to investigate the aging of the BBA and its impact on the optical properties during transatlantic transport from emission sources in Africa to the SEA. Results show distinct variations in extinction Ångström exponent (EAE) and single-scattering albedo (SSA) as aerosols age. Near the source, fresh aerosols are characterized by low mean SSA (0.84) and high EAE (1.85), indicating smaller, highly absorbing particles. By isolating marine contributions from the total column during BBA transport across the SEA, our analysis reveals an initial decrease in BBA absorptivity, with mean FT SSA of 0.87 after 6–7 d, followed by increased absorptivity with mean FT SSA of 0.84 after 10 d, suggesting enhanced absorption due to chemical aging. These findings indicate that BBA becomes more absorbing during extended transport across the SEA, with implications for reducing model uncertainties. Our remote-sensing-based results agree well with previous in situ studies and offer new insights into aerosol–radiation interactions and the energy balance over the SEA."

Naphthenic acid fractional compounds (NAFCs), a complex mixture of alkyl-substituted acyclic and cycloaliphatic organic acids, are natural bitumen components known for their ecological toxicity and are concentrated during the extraction process into tailings ponds, where they are assumed to remain confined to the aqueous phase. Here, we quantify the emissions of up to 275 NAFCs to the atmosphere from a tailings pond and from facility-wide operations at major OS facilities. The results indicate that, despite the absence of NAFC air emissions in inventories, large quantities are emitted to the atmosphere, likely originating from surface photochemical and/or biodegradation processes. Emission rates across entire operations ranged from 3509 to 7286 kg h–1, translating to annual emissions of 1163–2660 tonnes from both primary and secondary sources. The findings imply that NAFC air emissions may serve as a key pathway for these chemicals to enter the environment, potentially impacting downwind ecosystems."

However, the fate of newly formed particles and their potential impact on climate are largely unknown. Here we use in situ aircraft measurements of aerosol size distributions collected in the UTLS over the eastern ASM region, combined with Lagrangian trajectory modeling and satellite‐derived convection, to show that NPF events primarily occur downstream of convection in the upper troposphere (below the tropopause) between 350 and 360 K potential temperature levels. While the majority of air parcels containing NPF events descend into the lower troposphere, approximately 20% of NPF event parcels ascend into the stratosphere and thereby may contribute as a source of material to the stratospheric aerosol layer."

Nitrogen-containing organic carbon compounds were identified as key light absorbers. These results improve understanding of brown carbon sources and help refine climate models. 
 Atmospheric brown carbon (BrC) can significantly affect Earth's radiation budget by its wavelength-dependent absorption in the ultraviolet–visible (UV–vis) range. BrC consists of a wide variety of organics with different optical properties, making accurate climate modeling essential for understanding its radiative impact. Here, we conducted a field campaign during the summer in Shenzhen, China, to investigate the optical properties and molecular characteristics of BrC from diverse particle sources using both online and offline measurements. BrC mass concentrations were determined based on either thermally desorbed organic carbon or water-soluble organic carbon (WSOC), and the corresponding mass absorption cross-sections (MACs) were calculated accordingly. Different sources of BrC, including those from secondary production associated with ozone pollution, urban transportation, and biomass burning, were identified through meteorological data and particle chemical compositions. The results show that the MAC of BrC varied across sources, with BrC from biomass combustion exhibiting the highest MAC at 370 nm (3.42 ± 0.41 m2 g−1) and secondary BrC associated with ozone pollution showing the lowest (1.25 ± 0.56 m2 g−1). Nevertheless, secondary BrC exhibited the highest absorption Ångström exponent (AAE), while the BrC from biomass burning had the lowest AAE. Molecular analysis revealed that species in the CHON family from biomass burning demonstrated the strongest light absorption. Our results provide valuable insights for quantifying the source-specific optical properties of BrC, enhancing the accuracy of climate models."

The outcome of this work is the documentation of the emission inventory of particulates (PM10 and PM2.5) and gaseous emissions (SO2, CO, NOx, NH3, and volatile organic compounds (VOCs)) from the agricultural industry, particularly crop production. Further, the emissions of elemental carbon (EC), organic carbon (OC), and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are part of particulate matter (PM), were calculated along with greenhouse gases (CO2, CH4, and N2O) coming from the agricultural sector for 2021, with projections for 2051. Total greenhouse gas emissions in 2021 were 408 Tg, while PM10 and PM2.5 emissions were approximately 2.5 and 1.1 Tg, respectively. The health impact of primary agricultural PM2.5 was quantified, revealing an estimated approximately 4 million disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and 0.13 million deaths attributable to these emissions in 2021. The findings highlight the urgent need to reduce emissions at their source and ensure sustainable agricultural practices.

By leveraging improved simulations of O3 and its precursors by LES, compared to the mesoscale WRF model, we derive and compare two O3 sensitivity indicators: the formaldehyde-to-nitrogen dioxide ratio (FNR) and the ratio of radical loss via NOX reactions to total primary radical production (LN/Q). Specifically, we use LN/Q to inform the threshold for FNR, the latter being a more commonly used and accessible indicator, although it is subject to significant uncertainties. We demonstrate that O3 production in the Houston urban area transitions from a nearly homogeneous early morning VOC-limited regime to a NOX-limited regime by midday. Using the LN/Q indicator, we identify that a range of 0.6 < FNR < 1.8 falls in the transition zone of O3 formation regime.

 The Arctic has warmed significantly faster than the rest of the globe, leading to rapid sea ice decline. Anthropogenic aerosols are traditionally viewed as cooling agents that do not contribute to Arctic sea ice loss. Here we investigate how aerosol-induced changes in atmospheric circulation patterns contribute to Arctic sea ice decline using a fully-coupled global earth system model. We compared single forcing experiments to examine individual and combined effects of greenhouse gases and anthropogenic aerosols. Aerosols contribute to intensification of the North Pacific anticyclone, which enhances heat transport into the Arctic through the Bering Strait. When combined with greenhouse gas-induced warming, aerosols have a greater impact on Arctic sea ice decline in the western Chukchi Sea compared to when either forcing acts independently. This compound effect challenges the traditional view of aerosols as solely cooling agents, demonstrating that anthropogenic aerosols can accelerate Arctic sea ice melting.

 NOx plays a vital role in tropospheric ozone formation, OH radical recycling, and acts as a precursor to the formation of particulate nitrate (pNO3-), a major reactive nitrogen species. pNO3- mainly forms via four pathways: oxidation of NO2 by OH (P1), N2O5 hydrolysis (P2), reactions with VOCs (P3), and ClO (P4). However, studies on its sources and formation mechanisms are limited. This study uses dual isotopes (δ18O and δ15N) of pNO3- to explore the sources of NOx and dominant pNO3- formation pathways over Patiala, a semi-urban site in the northwestern Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP), during a large-scale paddy residue burning. Day-time δ15N and δ18O averaged −5.0 ± 2.4 ‰ and 52.1 ± 6.2 ‰, while night-time values were −0.13 ± 5.7 ‰ and 60.0 ± 8.4 ‰, respectively, reflecting enhanced nighttime partitioning due to cooler temperatures. Further, P1 (79.6 ± 7.2 %) and P2 (16.1 ± 7.5 %) dominated pNO3- formation; P3 and P4 were negligible (<5 %). During the study period, the major sources of NOx were traffic exhaust (38 ± 18 %), biomass burning (29 ± 18 %), followed by emissions from coal-fired power plants (20 ± 11 %) and soil (13 ± 9 %). Our study, the first of its kind over India provide valuable insight into NOx transformation processes under specific seasonal and emission conditions. While these results improve the understanding of pNO3- formation and may aid in refining regional NOx inventories, they are representative of the particular location and time frame of sampling and may not reflect source contributions in other regions or during periods without episodic biomass burning influence."

 Several countries are working to reduce their anthropogenic CO2 emissions to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement. However, evaluation of the carbon reduction efforts is hindered by the larger uncertainties in the currently available datasets. Therefore, it is imperative to explore new efficient and reliable methods to estimate carbon emissions accurately. This study proposed a novel method to estimate global gridded anthropogenic CO2 emissions using satellite datasets. The methodology included the development and integration of two machine learning models, i.e., RXCO2 (Reconstruct XCO2) and REMI (Reconstruct EMIssion), to achieve the objective. RXCO2 utilized the CO2 products from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) model and the Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 (OCO-2) satellite to produce a daily global long-term regular gridded column-averaged dry-air model fraction of CO2 (XCO2) dataset with a spatial resolution of 1°. The predicted XCO2 dataset was thoroughly validated against the ground-based and satellite-derived XCO2 observations, and good consistency was observed among the datasets. Further, the XCO2 anomalies were derived using the predicted XCO2 dataset and were utilized in the second model (REMI) along with tropospheric NO2 column, nighttime light, and population density to predict annual gridded anthropogenic CO2 emissions at a spatial resolution of 1° for 2021 and 2022. The model achieved high accuracy with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.96 and a root mean squared error (RMSE) of 100.3 tons. The predicted results were comprehensively compared with the anthropogenic CO2 emissions provided by established inventories and good agreement was observed among the datasets."
