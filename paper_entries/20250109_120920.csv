10.5194/acp-25-199-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文描述了使用SAPRC机制生成系统MechGen推导挥发性有机化合物（VOCs）大气反应机制的科学依据。MechGen可以推导包含C、H、O或N原子的绝大多数有机化合物的机制，包括有机物与OH、O3、NO3和O3P的初始反应，以及光解反应，以及所形成的各种中间体的反应。该论文详细介绍了MechGen中使用的估算速率常数和推导气相反应机制的方法，这些方法在过去20多年来一直用于开发用于空气质量模型的SAPRC机制。论文还指出了MechGen中需要改进的领域，以及需要进一步实验、理论或机制发展研究以改进对挥发性有机化合物大气反应机制预测的主要不确定性领域。总的来说，该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它为改进空气质量模型和更准确地模拟大气成分，特别是VOCs及其与其他大气成分的反应，提供了重要基础。这对于利用卫星观测和地面监测数据进行空气质量监测和预测至关重要。,"['Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs)', 'Air quality modeling', 'Atmospheric chemistry', 'Mechanism generation', 'Gas-phase reactions', 'OH radical', 'NO3 radical', 'O3', 'Photolysis', 'Air quality monitoring']",William P. L. Carter;Jia Jiang;John J. Orlando;Kelley C. Barsanti,Derivation of atmospheric reaction mechanisms for volatile organic compounds by the SAPRC mechanism generation system (MechGen),"This paper describes the scientific basis for gas-phase atmospheric chemical mechanisms derived using the SAPRC mechanism generation system, MechGen. It can derive mechanisms for most organic compounds with C, H, O, or N atoms, including initial reactions of organics with OH, O3, NO3, and O3P or by photolysis, as well as the reactions of the various types of intermediates that are formed. The paper includes a description of areas of uncertainty where additional research and updates are needed. 
 This paper describes the methods that are used in the SAPRC mechanism generation system, MechGen, to estimate rate constants and derive mechanisms for gas-phase reactions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the lower atmosphere. Versions of this system have been used for over 20 years in the development of the SAPRC mechanisms for air quality models, but this is the first complete documentation of the scientific basis for the chemical mechanisms it derives. MechGen can be used to derive explicit gas-phase mechanisms for most compounds with C, H, O, or N atoms. Included are reactions of organic compounds with hydroxy (OH) and nitrate (NO3) radicals, O3, and O3P; photolysis or unimolecular reactions; and the reactions of the radicals they form in the presence of O2 and oxides of nitrogen (NOx) at lower-atmospheric temperatures and pressures. Measured or theoretically calculated rate constants and branching ratios are used when data are available, but in most cases rate constants and branching ratios are estimated using various structure–reactivity or other estimation methods. Types of reactions include initial reactions of organics with atmospheric oxidants or by photolysis; unimolecular and bimolecular reactions of carbon-centered, alkoxy, and peroxy radicals; and those of Criegee and other intermediates that are formed. This paper documents the methods, assignments, and estimates currently used to derive these reactions and provides examples of MechGen predictions. Many of the estimation methods discussed here have not been published previously, and others have not been used previously in developing comprehensive mechanisms. Our knowledge of atmospheric reactions of organic compounds rapidly and continuously evolves, and therefore mechanism generation systems such as MechGen also need to evolve to continue to represent the current state of the science. This paper points out areas where MechGen may need to be modified when the system is next updated. This paper concludes with a summary of the major areas of uncertainty where further experimental, theoretical, or mechanism development research is most needed to improve predictions of atmospheric reaction mechanisms of volatile organic compounds."
10.5194/acp-25-157-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了ERA5再分析数据中温度和相对湿度偏差对飞机尾迹（contrail）形成分析的影响。研究者利用IAGOS的机载观测数据对ERA5数据进行了对比分析，发现ERA5数据中存在相对湿度偏差。为了解决这个问题，研究者提出了一种多元分位数映射（QM）方法来校正ERA5数据的偏差，提高了对飞机尾迹形成的估计精度。研究结果表明，QM方法有效地降低了温度和相对湿度偏差，使得ERA5数据对飞机尾迹形成的预测结果与IAGOS观测结果更加一致。这项研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用了卫星数据同化（ERA5再分析数据来源于多种卫星和地面观测数据）和机载观测数据来研究大气成分（水汽）的变化及其对气候的影响。飞机尾迹作为一种重要的气候影响因素，其形成与大气温度、湿度等气象条件密切相关，因此该研究对改进气候模型和预测气候变化具有重要意义。,"['Atmospheric water vapor', 'Contrail formation', 'Temperature', 'Relative humidity', 'Satellite data assimilation', 'Climate impact', 'ERA5 reanalysis', 'IAGOS observations', 'Quantile mapping', 'Bias correction']",Kevin Wolf;Nicolas Bellouin;Olivier Boucher;Susanne Rohs;Yun Li,Correction of ERA5 temperature and relative humidity biases by bivariate quantile mapping for contrail formation analysis,"ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis and airborne in situ observations from IAGOS are compared in terms of the representation of the contrail formation potential and the presence of supersaturation. Differences are traced back to biases in ERA5 relative humidity fields. Those biases are addressed by applying a quantile mapping technique that significantly improved contrail estimation based on post-processed ERA5 data. 
 Aviation contributes to global emissions of carbon dioxide, aerosol particles, water vapor (WV), and other compounds. WV promotes the formation of condensation trails (contrails), which are known for their net warming effect on the climate. Contrail formation is often estimated using the Schmidt–Appleman criterion (SAc) together with meteorological data from the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) ERA5 atmospheric reanalysis model. We compare ERA5 output of temperature and relative humidity in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere with 5 years of In-service Aircraft for a Global Observing System (IAGOS) observations over the North Atlantic. Good agreement was found for the temperature fields, with a maximum bias of −0.4 K (200 hPa level), while larger biases were found for relative humidity of up to −5.5 % (250 hPa level). Using original ERA5 data, conditions prone to contrail formation occurred 50.3 % and 7.9 % of the time for non-persistent and persistent contrails, respectively, while 44.0 % and 12.1 % were flagged in the IAGOS data. We propose a multivariate quantile mapping (QM) correction to remove systematic biases by post-processing ERA5 temperature and relative humidity fields with respect to contrail formation. The QM correction was applied to post-process ERA5 data, reducing the temperature bias to less than 0.1 K and the relative humidity bias to less than −1.5 %, resulting in 44 % and 10.9 % of the data points now being flagged for non-persistent and persistent contrail formation, respectively. Our bias correction generalizes well compared to the IAGOS observations. How it generalizes outside the IAGOS regions remains to be investigated."
10.5194/acp-25-143-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了阿拉斯加中部Poker Flat研究区2016年4月至2020年12月期间黑碳(BC)和一氧化碳(CO)的长期观测数据。研究发现，BC和CO浓度峰值同时出现，表明两者具有共同的来源，例如森林火灾。通过FLEXPART-WRF模式的溯源分析，证实了阿拉斯加和加拿大西部 boreal 森林火灾对高浓度BC的贡献。更重要的是，研究发现观测到的BC/ΔCO比值与阿拉斯加和加拿大观测到的火辐射功率(FRP)之间存在正相关关系(r=0.44)。这表明BC和CO的排放比值与森林火灾的强度和时间进程有关，并提示可以利用FRP改进BC的排放因子和/或清单。研究建议将FRP整合到未来的自下而上排放清单中，以更好地了解在快速变化的北极气候下，频繁发生的森林火灾对污染物动态的影响。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它利用地面观测数据结合卫星观测数据（FRP）分析大气成分（BC和CO），评估森林火灾排放对空气质量的影响，并改进排放清单。,"['Black carbon', 'Carbon monoxide', 'Aerosol', 'Air quality', 'Forest fire', 'Satellite observation', 'Fire radiative power (FRP)', 'Emission inventory', 'Atmospheric composition']",Takeshi Kinase;Fumikazu Taketani;Masayuki Takigawa;Chunmao Zhu;Yongwon Kim;Petr Mordovskoi;Yugo Kanaya,"Long-term observations of black carbon and carbon monoxide in the Poker Flat Research Range, central Alaska, with a focus on forest wildfire emissions","Boreal forest wildfires in interior Alaska represent an important black carbon (BC) source for the Arctic and surrounding regions. We observed BC and carbon monoxide (CO) concentrations in the Poker Flat Research Range since 2016 and found a positive correlation between the observed BC / ∆CO ratio and fire radiative power (FRP) observed in Alaska and Canada. Our finding suggests the BC emission factor and/or inventory could be potentially improved by using FRP. 
 Forest wildfires in interior Alaska represent an important black carbon (BC) source for the Arctic and sub-Arctic. However, BC observations in interior Alaska have not been sufficient to constrain the range of existing emissions. Here, we show our observations of BC mass concentrations and carbon monoxide (CO) mixing ratios in the Poker Flat Research Range (65.12° N, 147.43° W), located in central Alaska, from April 2016 to December 2020. The medians, 10th percentile ranges, and 90th percentile ranges of the hourly BC mass concentration and CO mixing ratio throughout the observation period were 13, 2.9, and 56 ng m−3 and 124.7, 98.7, and 148.3 ppb, respectively. Sporadically large peaks in the BC mass concentration and CO mixing ratio were observed at the same time, indicating influences from common sources. These BC peaks coincided with peaks at other comparative sites in Alaska, indicating large BC emissions in interior Alaska. Source estimation by FLEXPART-WRF (Flexible Particle Dispersion–Weather Research and Forecast) confirmed a contribution of boreal forest wildfires in Alaska and western Canada when high BC mass concentrations were observed. For these cases, we found a positive correlation (r=0.44) between the observed BC/ΔCO ratio and fire radiative power (FRP) observed in Alaska and Canada. This finding implies that the variability of the BC and CO emission ratio is associated with the intensity and time progress of forest wildfires and suggests that the BC emission factor and/or inventory could be potentially improved by FRP. We recommend that FRP be integrated into future bottom-up emission inventories to achieve a better understanding of the dynamics of pollutants from frequently occurring forest wildfires under the rapidly changing climate in the Arctic."
10.5194/acp-25-183-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇论文研究了花粉对降水的影响。花粉作为大气中的重要生物气溶胶，其浓度在高浓度时能够影响云的形成和降水过程。研究使用了UCLALES-SALSA大型涡流模拟器，模拟桦树花粉对液相和混合相云的影响。结果表明，在高花粉浓度的情况下，花粉能够增强液相和混合相云的降水；而较低浓度下，花粉对降水的影响不显著。花粉破裂释放的细小冰核粒子在冰核化过程中起着重要作用。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，例如，可以通过卫星遥感监测花粉浓度及其时空分布，并结合大气成分分析，更好地理解花粉对气候和天气过程的影响。,"['Pollen', 'Aerosol', 'Cloud', 'Precipitation', 'Ice Nucleating Particles', 'Satellite remote sensing', 'Air quality monitoring', 'Atmospheric composition']",Marje Prank;Juha Tonttila;Xiaoxia Shang;Sami Romakkaniemi;Tomi Raatikainen,Can pollen affect precipitation?,"Large primary bioparticles such as pollen can be abundant in the atmosphere. In humid conditions pollen can rupture and release a large number of fine sub-pollen particles (SPPs). The paper investigates what kind of birch pollen concentrations are needed for the pollen and SPPs to start playing a noticeable role in cloud processes and alter precipitation formation. In the studied cases only the largest observed pollen concentrations were able to noticeably alter the precipitation formation. 
 Large primary bioparticles such as pollen can be abundant in the atmosphere; for example near-surface pollen concentrations above 10 000 particles per cubic metre can occur during intense pollination periods. On one hand, due to their large size (10–100 µm), pollen can act as giant cloud condensation nuclei and enhance the collision–coalescence process in clouds that leads to drizzle formation. On the other hand, in humid conditions pollen is known to rupture and release many fine particles that can increase the cloud stability by reducing the droplet size. Additionally, both whole pollen grains and the sub-pollen particles released by pollen rupture are known to act as ice-nucleating particles (INPs). Due to these complex interactions, the role of pollen in modulating the cloud cover and precipitation remains uncertain.We used the UCLALES-SALSA (UCLA Large-Eddy Simulation Code and Sectional Aerosol module for Large-Scale Applications) large eddy simulator for simulating birch pollen effects on liquid- and mixed-phase clouds. Our simulations show that the pollen concentrations observed during the most intense pollination seasons can locally enhance precipitation from both liquid- and mixed-phase clouds, while more commonly encountered pollen concentrations are unlikely to cause a noticeable change. The liquid precipitation enhancement depended linearly on the emitted pollen flux in both liquid- and mixed-phase clouds; however, the slope of this relationship was case-dependent. Ice nucleation happened at a relevant degree only if the process of rupturing pollen producing large number of fine ice-nucleating particles was included in the simulations. The resulting precipitation saturated for the highest INP concentrations. Secondary ice formation by rime splintering had only a minor effect in the considered 1 d timescale."
10.5194/acp-25-243-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,这篇研究论文探讨了土地覆盖变化对大气有机气体、气溶胶和辐射效应的影响。研究使用了一个耦合化学-气候-植被模型，比较了当前的土地覆盖（森林被砍伐用于农作物和放牧）与自然植被和极端重新造林情景。结果发现，植被变化显著影响全球BVOC排放和有机气溶胶，但对总气溶胶、云和辐射效应的影响相对较小。研究中使用了土地利用方案来限制树木植物功能类型（PFT）覆盖，并评估了两种情景：（1）比较当前的土地覆盖与潜在的自然植被（PNV）覆盖；（2）极端重新造林情景。研究发现，与PNV情景相比，当前的森林砍伐导致BVOC排放减少26%，生物源SOA（bSOA）减少29%，总有机气溶胶（OA）减少9%。而极端重新造林情景则导致BVOC排放增加22%，bSOA增加26%，总OA增加6%。对于当前的森林砍伐情景，估计总辐射效应（气溶胶+云）为正（增暖），而对于极端重新造林情景，则为负（降温）。虽然文章没有直接提及具体的遥感技术或卫星观测，但其研究结果对利用卫星观测数据进行大气成分分析和空气质量监测具有重要参考价值，因为土地覆盖变化是影响大气成分的重要因素，而卫星遥感是监测土地覆盖变化的重要手段。,"['Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs)', 'Secondary organic aerosols (SOAs)', 'Organic aerosols', 'Radiative effects', 'Land cover change', 'Atmospheric chemistry', 'Climate modeling', 'Satellite observations (implied)']",Ryan Vella;Matthew Forrest;Andrea Pozzer;Alexandra P. Tsimpidi;Thomas Hickler;Jos Lelieveld;Holger Tost,"Influence of land cover change on atmospheric organic gases, aerosols, and radiative effects","This study examines how land cover changes influence biogenic volatile organic compound (BVOC) emissions and atmospheric states. Using a coupled chemistry–climate–vegetation model, we compare present-day land cover (deforested for crops and grazing) with natural vegetation and an extreme reforestation scenario. We find that vegetation changes significantly impact global BVOC emissions and organic aerosols but have a relatively small effect on total aerosols, clouds, and radiative effects. 
 Biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) are emitted in large quantities from the terrestrial biosphere and play a significant role in atmospheric gaseous and aerosol compositions. Secondary organic aerosols (SOAs) resulting from BVOC oxidation affect the radiation budget both directly, through the scattering and absorption of sunlight, and indirectly, by modifying cloud properties. Human activities have extensively altered natural vegetation cover, primarily by converting forests into agricultural land. In this work, a global atmospheric chemistry–climate model, coupled with a dynamic global vegetation model, was employed to study the impacts of perturbing the biosphere through human-induced land use change, thereby exploring changes in BVOC emissions and the atmospheric aerosol burden. A land use scheme was implemented to constrain tree plant functional type (PFT) cover based on land transformation fraction maps from the year 2015. Two scenarios were evaluated: (1) one comparing present-day land cover, which includes areas deforested for crops and grazing land, with potential natural vegetation (PNV) cover simulated by the model, and (2) an extreme reforestation scenario in which present-day grazing land is restored to natural vegetation levels. We find that, compared to the PNV scenario, present-day deforestation results in a 26 % reduction in BVOC emissions, which decreases the global biogenic SOA (bSOA) burden by 0.16 Tg (a decrease of 29 %), while the total organic aerosol (OA) burden decreases by 0.17 Tg (a reduction of 9 %). On the other hand, the extreme reforestation scenario, compared to present-day land cover, suggests an increase in BVOC emissions of 22 %, which increases the bSOA burden by 0.11 Tg and the total OA burden by 0.12 Tg – increases of 26 % and 6 %, respectively. For the present-day deforestation scenario, we estimate a positive total radiative effect (aerosol + cloud) of 60.4 mW m−2 (warming) relative to the natural vegetation scenario, while for the extreme reforestation scenario, we report a negative (cooling) effect of 38.2 mW m−2 relative to current vegetation cover."
10.5194/amt-18-115-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究了利用地球静止环境监测光谱仪（GEMS）观测首尔都市地区二氧化氮（NO2）对流层垂直柱浓度（TropVCD）的日变化和季节变化特征。研究发现，NO2的TropVCD值及其日变化模式在不同季节存在显著差异，这与光化学过程和气象条件以及氮氧化物排放有关。例如，一月NO2浓度在15:00达到峰值，而七月在14:00达到最低值。此外，研究还比较了使用不同化学传输模型（TM5和WRF-Chem）的先验NO2数据反演结果，发现虽然不同模型模拟的NO2浓度差异很大，但反演得到的NO2 TropVCD日变化模式却基本一致，表明卫星观测数据在决定NO2 TropVCD日变化方面起主导作用。该研究充分利用了GEMS卫星提供的时空连续大气数据，对提高空气质量监测精度和理解城市地区NO2污染的时空分布具有重要意义。,"['Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2)', 'Tropospheric Vertical Column Density (TropVCD)', 'Air Quality Monitoring', 'Satellite Observation', 'Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS)', 'Diurnal Variation', 'Seasonal Variation', 'Seoul Metropolitan Area', 'Chemical Transport Model']",Seunghwan Seo;Si-Wan Kim;Kyoung-Min Kim;Andreas Richter;Kezia Lange;John P.

Also, varying a priori data have substantial impacts on the observed NO2 columns. The a priori data from different chemical transport models resulted in differences of up to −18.3 %. Notably, diurnal patterns of observed NO2 columns are similar for all datasets, although their a priori data exhibit contrasting diurnal patterns. 
 The Geostationary Environment Monitoring Spectrometer (GEMS), launched in 2020, provides both temporally and spatially continuous air quality data from geostationary Earth orbit (GEO). This study first investigates the seasonal variations and diurnal behavior of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) tropospheric vertical column densities (TropVCDs) over the Seoul metropolitan area (SMA) using GEMS data, retrieved by the IUP-UB algorithm. We find that the magnitude of the NO2 TropVCDs and their diurnal behavior have significant seasonal dependences. In January, the highest NO2 TropVCD values in the range 27.5–28.9×1015 molec.cm-2 during the four seasons were observed at 15:00 local time (LT) and NO2 TropVCD increases from the first retrieved values at 10:00 LT. On the other hand, we find the lowest values (7.4–8.8×1015 molec.cm-2) are at ∼14:00 LT in July. The VCD values in July increased up to 10:00 LT and then decreased until 14:00 LT but then began to increase again. These different diurnal behaviors of the TropVCDs in the different seasons reflect the differences in photochemical and meteorological conditions as well as the emissions of NOx. Photochemical transformations are typically more rapid in July and slower in January. The absolute values and diurnal behavior of NO2 TropVCDs are significantly influenced by the wind speed, except in July. Moderate (wind speed ≥3 m s−1) or strong wind (wind speed >5 m s−1) reduced the magnitude of the diurnal behavior in January, implying that the NO2 plumes were transported downwind. Finally, we compared the retrieved NO2 TropVCDs by using different a priori NO2 data simulated by TM5 and WRF-Chem, calculated using the most recent emission inventories. Although simulated VCDs from WRF-Chem and TM5 show differences of up to a factor 2.75, retrieved NO2 TropVCDs using each a priori data have almost identical values and diurnal behaviors, except in July. Notably, the diurnal behavior of the retrieved NO2 TropVCDs is independent of that from the two chemical transport models, indicating that observations of slant column densities are the dominant factor in determining the diurnal behavior of NO2 TropVCDs. Changes in the model horizontal resolution and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission inventory do not significantly affect the retrieved NO2 TropVCDs in this study. However, when the a priori NO2 vertical profile was fixed as the values at 13:45 LT, the diurnal patterns of NO2 TropVCDs showed significant changes, with differences of up to −18.3 %."
10.5194/amt-18-73-2025,True,Atmospheric Measurement Techniques,这篇论文研究了Sentinel-5P卫星搭载的TROPOMI传感器观测到的气溶胶数据中云影效应的影响。研究人员使用云影检测算法和三维辐射传输模型模拟，发现云影对气溶胶吸收指数(AAI) 的平均影响很小，接近于零。虽然云影区域的反射率在340-380nm波段显著增加（比周围区域更蓝），但传统的AAI算法能够部分自动校正这种效应。模拟结果表明，这种校正并非完美无缺，有时会产生一些小的偏差，其大小取决于云的特性。因此，研究结论认为，对TROPOMI AAI进行云影校正可能复杂且不必要。总的来说，这项研究关注的是利用卫星遥感技术监测大气气溶胶，特别是改进气溶胶数据处理算法，以提高空气质量监测的精度。,"['absorbing aerosol index', 'TROPOMI', 'Sentinel-5P', 'air quality monitoring', 'cloud shadow effect', 'radiative transfer']",Victor J.

Pier Siebesma,Cancellation of cloud shadow effects in the absorbing aerosol index retrieval algorithm of TROPOMI,"Our study investigates the impact of cloud shadows on satellite-based aerosol index measurements over Europe by TROPOMI. Using a cloud shadow detection algorithm and simulations, we found that the overall effect on the aerosol index is minimal. Interestingly, we found that cloud shadows are significantly bluer than their shadow-free surroundings, but the traditional algorithm already (partly) automatically corrects for this increased blueness. 
 Cloud shadows can be detected in the radiance measurements of the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI)  on board the Sentinel-5P satellite due to its high spatial resolution and could possibly affect its air quality products. The cloud-shadow-induced signatures are, however, not always apparent and may depend on various cloud and scene parameters. Hence, the quantification of the cloud shadow impact requires the analysis of large data sets. Here we use the cloud shadow detection algorithm DARCLOS to detect cloud shadow pixels in the TROPOMI absorbing aerosol index (AAI) product over Europe during 8 months. For every shadow pixel, we automatically select cloud- and shadow-free neighbour pixels in order to estimate the cloud-shadow-induced signature. In addition, we simulate the measured cloud shadow impact on the AAI with our newly developed three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer algorithm MONKI. Both the measurements and simulations show that the average cloud shadow impact on the AAI is close to zero (0.06 and 0.16, respectively). However, the top-of-atmosphere reflectance ratio between 340 and 380 nm, which is used to compute the AAI, is significantly increased in 95 % of the shadow pixels. So, cloud shadows are bluer than surrounding non-shadow pixels. Our simulations explain that the traditional AAI formula intrinsically already corrects for this cloud shadow effect via the lower retrieved scene albedo. This cancellation of cloud shadow signatures is not always perfect, sometimes yielding second-order low and high biases in the AAI which we also successfully reproduce with our simulations. We show that the magnitude of those second-order cloud shadow effects depends on various cloud parameters which are difficult to determine for the shadows measured with TROPOMI. We conclude that a potential cloud shadow correction strategy for the TROPOMI AAI would therefore be complicated if not unnecessary."

Nowak;Marie Lothon;Donald H. Lenschow;Szymon P. Malinowski,The ratio of transverse to longitudinal turbulent velocity statistics for aircraft measurements,"According to classical theory, the ratio of turbulence statistics corresponding to transverse and longitudinal wind velocity components equals 4/3 in the inertial range of scales. We analyse a large number of measurements obtained with three research aircraft during four field experiments in different locations and show that the observed ratios are almost always significantly smaller. We discuss potential reasons for this disagreement, but the actual explanation remains to be determined. 
 The classical theory of homogeneous isotropic turbulence predicts that the ratio of transverse to longitudinal structure functions or power spectra is equal to 4/3 in the inertial subrange. For the typical turbulence cascade in the inertial subrange, it also predicts a power law scaling with an exponent of +2/3 and -5/3 for the structure functions and the power spectra, respectively. The goal of this study is to document the statistics of those ratios and exponents derived from aircraft observations, quantify their departures from theoretical predictions, and point out the differences among the aircraft.We estimate the transverse-to-longitudinal ratios and the scaling exponents from in situ high-rate turbulence measurements collected by three research aircraft during four field experiments in two regimes of the marine atmospheric boundary layer: shallow trade-wind convection and subtropical stratocumulus. The bulk values representing the inertial subrange were derived by fitting power law formulae to the structure functions and to the power spectra computed separately for the three components of the turbulent wind velocity measured in horizontal flight segments. The composite scale-by-scale transverse-to-longitudinal ratios were derived by averaging over the segments at common non-dimensional scales.The variability in the results can be attributed to how the wind velocity components are measured on each aircraft. The differences related to environmental conditions, e.g. between characteristic levels and regimes of the boundary layer, are of secondary importance. Experiment-averaged transverse-to-longitudinal ratios are 23 %–45 % smaller than predicted by the theory. The deviations of average scaling exponents with respect to the theoretical values range from −34 % to +47 % for structure functions and from −24 % to +22 % for power spectra, depending on experiment and velocity component. The composite scale-by-scale transverse-to-longitudinal ratios decrease and increasingly depart from 4/3 with decreasing scale, in contrast to previous experimental studies on local isotropy. The reason for the disagreement in transverse-to-longitudinal ratios between the observations and the theory remains uncertain."

ARMTRAJ data include ensemble run statistics that enhance consistency and serve as uncertainty metrics for air mass coordinates and state variables. ARMTRAJ will soon become a near real-time product that will accompany past, ongoing, and future ARM deployments. 
 Ground-based instruments offer unique capabilities such as detailed atmospheric, thermodynamic, cloud, and aerosol profiling at a high temporal sampling rate. The U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility provides comprehensive datasets from key locations around the globe, facilitating long-term characterization and process-level understanding of clouds, aerosol, and aerosol–cloud interactions. However, as with other ground-based datasets, the fixed (Eulerian) nature of these measurements often introduces a knowledge gap in relating those observations with air-mass hysteresis. Here, we describe ARMTRAJ (https://doi.org/10.5439/2309851, Silber, 2024a; https://doi.org/10.5439/2309849, Silber, 2024b; https://doi.org/10.5439/2309850, Silber, 2024c; https://doi.org/10.5439/2309848, Silber, 2024d), a set of multipurpose trajectory datasets that helps close this gap in ARM deployments. Each dataset targets a different aspect of atmospheric research, including the analysis of surface, planetary boundary layer, distinct liquid-bearing cloud layers, and (primary) cloud decks. Trajectories are calculated using the Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model informed by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts ERA5 reanalysis dataset at its highest spatial resolution (0.25°) and are initialized using ARM datasets. The trajectory datasets include information about air-mass coordinates and state variables extracted from ERA5 before and after the ARM site overpass. Ensemble runs generated for each model initialization enhance trajectory consistency, while ensemble variability serves as a valuable uncertainty metric for those reported air-mass coordinates and state variables.

The product reconstructed sea surface pCO2 from 1993 to 2021 using machine-learning and environmental data, capturing seasonal cycles, regional variations, and long-term trends of pCO2 for coastal carbon research. 
 Insufficient spatiotemporal coverage of observations of the surface partial pressure of CO2 (pCO2) has hindered precise carbon cycle studies in coastal oceans and justifies the development of spatially and temporally continuous pCO2 data products. Earlier pCO2 products have difficulties in capturing the heterogeneity of regional variations and decadal trends of pCO2 in the North American Atlantic Coastal Ocean Margin (NAACOM). This study developed a regional reconstructed pCO2 product for the NAACOM (Reconstructed Coastal Acidification Database-pCO2, or ReCAD-NAACOM-pCO2) using a two-step approach combining random forest regression and linear regression. The product provides monthly pCO2 data at 0.25° spatial resolution from 1993 to 2021, enabling investigation of regional spatial differences, seasonal cycles, and decadal changes in pCO2. The observation-based reconstruction was trained using Surface Ocean CO2 Atlas (SOCAT) observations as observational values, with various satellite-derived and reanalysis environmental variables known to control sea surface pCO2 as model inputs. The product shows high accuracy during the model training, validation, and independent test phases, demonstrating robustness and a capability to accurately reconstruct pCO2 in regions or periods lacking direct observational data. Compared with all the observation samples from SOCAT, the pCO2 product yields a determination coefficient of 0.92, a root-mean-square error of 12.70 µatm, and an accumulative uncertainty of 23.25 µatm. The ReCAD-NAACOM-pCO2 product demonstrates its capability to resolve seasonal cycles, regional-scale variations, and decadal trends of pCO2 along the NAACOM. This new product provides reliable pCO2 data for more precise studies of coastal carbon dynamics in the NAACOM region.

The study satisfied the urgent demands for precise control of crop yield information. 
 Accurate monitoring of crop yield is important for ensuring food security. However, exiting yield datasets with a coarse spatial resolution are inadequate for capturing small scale spatial heterogeneity. Current yield estimation methods, such as machine learning models or the assimilation of remotely sensed biophysical variables into crop growth models, depend heavily on ground observations and involve significant computational costs. To solve these problems, a hybrid framework coupling the World Food Studies Simulation Model (WOFOST) and the Gated Recurrent Unit model (GRU) was proposed to generate a 20 m soybean yield dataset in Northeast China from 2019 to 2023 (NortheastChindaSoybeanYield20m). A soybean growth dataset was first generated based on the WOFOST that simulated various production scenarios (climates, crop varieties, soil types and agro-managements). The GRU model was then trained for characterizing relationships between model simulated LAI and soybean yield. The trained model was then applied for soybean yield estimation in Northeast China using time series LAI of different growth stages derived from Sentinel-2. The accuracy of the dataset was evaluated by in-situ measured and statistical data. The overall accuracy was 287.44 kg ha-1 and 272.36 kg ha-1 in the root mean squared error (RMSE) for field and regional scale, respectively. Stable results were achieved through the years with mean relative error (MRE) on average of 11.46 % in municipal scale and 7.94 % in provincial scale. Results demonstrated that the model was able to capture spatial-temporal variation of soybean yield.

The comparison of CNSIF with tower-based SIF observations, tower-based GPP observations, MODIS GPP products, and other SIF datasets has validated CNSIF's ability to capture photosynthetic activity across different vegetation types and its potential for estimating carbon fluxes. 
 Satellite-derived solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) offers valuable opportunities for monitoring large-scale ecosystem functions. However, the inherent trade-off between satellite scan range and spatial resolution, along with incomplete spatial coverage and irregular temporal sampling, limits its broader application. In this study, we developed a 500-m spatial resolution monthly SIF dataset for the China region (CNSIF) from 2003 to 2022, using a data-driven deep learning approach based on high-resolution apparent reflectance and thermal infrared data. The results indicate that CNSIF effectively captures the spatial patterns of vegetation photosynthetic activity and exhibits a positive annual growth trend of 0.054. Comparisons with tower-based observations validated the ability of CNSIF to track changes in photosynthetic intensity over time across different ecosystems. Furthermore, the strong correlation (R2_2016 = 0.768, R2_2020 = 0.743; P<0.001) between CNSIF and the MODIS monthly Gross Primary Production (GPP) product demonstrates its potential for estimating carbon flux.

We found that runoff parameterizations greatly affect nitrate–nitrogen runoff simulated using an Earth system land model. Our simulations predicted increased nitrogen runoff in the LMRB during Hurricane Ida in 2021, albeit less pronounced than the observations, indicating areas for model improvement to better understand and manage nutrient runoff loss during hurricanes in the region. 
 When the nutrient level in the soil surpasses vegetation demand, nutrient losses due to surface runoff and subsurface leaching are the major reasons for the deterioration of water quality. The lower Mississippi River basin (LMRB) is one of the sub-basins that deliver the highest nitrogen loads to the Gulf of Mexico. Potential changes in episodic events induced by hurricanes may exacerbate water quality issue in the future. However, uncertainties in modeling the hydrologic response to hurricanes may limit the modeling of nutrient losses during such events. Using a machine learning approach, we calibrated the land component of the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM), or ELM, version 2.1, based on the water table depth (WTD) of a calibrated 3D subsurface hydrology model. While the overall performance of the calibrated ELM is satisfactory, some discrepancies in WTD remain in slope areas with low precipitation due to the missing lateral flow process in ELM. Simulations including biogeochemistry performed using ELM with and without model calibration showed important influences of soil hydrology, precipitation intensity, and runoff parameterization on the magnitude of nitrogen runoff loss and the leaching pathway. Despite such sensitivities, both ELM simulations produced reduced WTD and increased runoff and accelerated nitrate–nitrogen runoff loading during Hurricane Ida in August 2021, consistent with the observations. With observations suggesting more pronounced effects of Hurricane Ida on nitrogen runoff than the simulations, we identified factors for model improvement to provide a useful tool for studying hurricane-induced nutrient losses in the LMRB region."

In particular, green roofs can provide numerous environmental benefits, such as urban cooling, water retention and carbon sequestration. The aim of this research is to develop a new module for calculating green roof CO2 fluxes within a model that can already simulate hydrological and thermal processes of such roofs. The calibration and evaluation of this module take advantage of long term experimental data. 
 Green roofs are promoted to provide ecosystem services and to mitigate climate change in urban areas. This is largely due to their supposed benefits for biodiversity, rainwater management, evaporative cooling, and carbon sequestration. One scientific challenge is quantifying the various contributions of green roofs using reliable methods. In this context, the green roof module already running in the Town Energy Balance urban canopy model for water and energy exchanges was improved by implementing the CO2 fluxes and the carbon sequestration potential. This parametrisation combines the ISBA (Interaction Between Soil Biosphere and Atmosphere) photosynthesis, biomass and soil respiration module with the green roof module in order to quantify the net CO2 amount emitted or fixed by the green roof over a time period. The parametrisation was fully achieved by using data of an extensive Sedum non irrigated green roof located at the Berlin BER airport in Germany from 2016 to 2020. The five years of measurements were used to do a sensitivity analysis of the photosynthesis module parameters in order to classify the parameters according to their influence, followed by a calibration over the most important parameters and evaluation. Results show a good agreement of the simulated leaf area index and CO2 fluxes with in situ observations, with good diurnal, seasonal and inter-annual variability, even if the model tends to be overly responsive on the day to day variability. The model reproduces well the Net Ecosystem Exchange which provides a reliable estimation of the annual carbon sequestration. Those results are encouraging in quantifying the potential of carbon sequestration of green roofs and open up the possibility of applying the new parametrisation on a city-wide scale to evaluate green roof scenarios."

Thus, this study mapped Pb, Ca, and Mg distributions in Chinese cabbage leaves following PM2.5-Pb stress using synchrotron and fast micro-X-ray fluorescence. Findings revealed that PM2.5-Pb was transported and localized in guard cells, the epidermal cell wall, and chloroplasts. X-ray absorption near-edge structure revealed that Pb(CO3)2·Pb(OH)2 in PM2.5 was converted to Pb(OH)2, glutathione-Pb (GSH-Pb), and PbC2O4 in Chinese cabbage leaves. GSH-Pb proportion in the low Pb accumulation (LPA) variety Chinese cabbage leaves was 2.13 times higher than that in the high Pb accumulation (HPA) variety. Glutamate concentration decreased by 44.53% in the LPA variety leaves under PM2.5-Pb stress, increasing GSH-Pb efflux symplasm and reducing Pb accumulation. X-ray fluorescence mapping of Ca and Mg in leaves indicated chlorophyll biosynthesis inhibition in the HPA variety leaves but not in the LPA variety leaves.

While bench-scale studies have advanced mechanistic understanding of char’s behavior and potential effects, translating these findings to complex ecosystems remains challenging. This is mainly due to the complexities of microbial communities and the unique properties of various ecosystems. Factors like char aging and patina formation, and environmental parameters including oxygen and moisture availability, pH, and organic matter content can significantly affect char electrochemical properties and microbial interactions. This highlights the need for a broader understanding of char redox processes to predict and effectively manage unintended environmental impacts or enhance beneficial effects. Long-term monitoring of complex systems amended with char is also needed to determine whether char accumulation has long-term redox effects on microbial ecosystem services, including biogeochemical cycling. Predictive understanding of these processes would inform the production of chars to enhance beneficial processes such as increased soil productivity, and provide new opportunities for engineered environmental remediation. Here, we summarize how char redox properties affect well-defined microbial systems and discuss key factors that determine whether the effects of char redox properties are enhanced or attenuated in complex systems. We also identify critical knowledge gaps about chars’ role in microbial redox processes that are important for environmental sustainability and postulate that managing char’s redox properties, such as electron donating, accepting, or conducting ability, is an emerging opportunity to influence microbial ecosystem services."

Nanofiltration (NF) membranes are effective in separating organic compounds and monovalent salts, but they typically exhibit an excessive rejection of divalent salts. Modifying the charge characteristics of NF membranes can improve salt permeation; however, the role of charge spatial distribution in governing salt transport behavior is not fully understood. In this study, we developed a mix-charged NF membrane with a horizontal charge distribution by employing interfacial polymerization combined with a polyester template etching and solvent-induced polyamine intercalation strategy. The ratio of positive to negative charge domains in the membrane can be precisely controlled by adjusting the aqueous monomer ratio and polyamine modifier type. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) depth profiling and separation layer thickness analysis confirmed the complete penetration of polyamines into the separation layer, providing direct evidence of the formation of horizontally distributed charge domains. This unique charge distribution results in a high charge density and a near-electroneutral surface, which facilitates the permeation of the divalent salts. The size-dependent “plug-in” modification and covalent cross-linking further reduce pore size, enhancing rejection of small organic molecules. Additionally, the membrane demonstrated exceptional antifouling performance against both negatively and positively charged pollutants, attributed to its unique charge distribution and smooth surface. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further revealed that weak electrostatic interactions and a tightly bound hydration layer contribute to the membrane’s superior antifouling properties.

Biodegradable polymers, while promising for reducing environmental impact, account for less than 2% of total polymer production. To expand the availability of biodegradable polymers, research has explored structure-biodegradability relationships, yet most studies focus on specific polymers, necessitating further exploration across diverse polymers. This study addresses this gap by curating an extensive aerobic biodegradation data set of 74 polymers and 1779 data points drawn from both published literature and 28 sets of original experiments. We then conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of experimental conditions, polymer structure, and the combined impact of polymer structure and properties on biodegradation. Next, we developed a machine learning model to predict polymer biodegradation in aquatic environments. The model achieved an Rtest2 score of 0.66 using Morgan fingerprints, detailed experimental conditions, and thermal decomposition temperature (Td) as the input descriptors. The model’s robustness was supported by a feature importance analysis, revealing that substructure R−O−R in polyethers and polysaccharides positively influenced biodegradation, while molecular weight, Td, substructure −OC(═O)− in polyesters and polyalkylene carbonates, side chains, and aromatic rings negatively impacted it.

However, understanding the underlying chemical mechanisms still faces challenges due to the limited interpretability of the ML models. In this study, interpretable ML models were established to predict the second-order rate constants between hydroxyl radicals (•OH) and organics (k•OH). It was found that the energy of the highest occupied molecular orbital (EHOMO), the number of aromatic rings (NAR), and the number of carbon atoms of organics (NC) have important impacts on k•OH. The positive correlation between k•OH and EHOMO can be explained by the regularity of electrophilic reaction, while the relationship between k•OH and NAR and NC seems to be related with reactive sites. Furthermore, a rapid judgment method for reaction mechanism was developed based on an unsupervised learning approach which automatically divided organics into three clusters. Additionally, this methodology was applied to the reaction between organics and sulfate radicals. This study offers a rational model for predicting reaction mechanisms and provides more insights into the impact of organic structures on the reaction mechanism from the perspective of big data."

Ma,Lower Cadmium Bioavailability and Toxicity in Japonica Rice than in Indica Rice: Mechanisms and Health Implications,"Cadmium (Cd) is efficiently transferred from soil to food crops, notably rice. Research indicates that indica rice grains may accumulate more Cd than japonica cultivars; however, differences in Cd bioavailability (the fraction of ingested rice Cd absorbed into the systemic circulation) and toxicity remain unexplored, thus hindering a comprehensive understanding of exposure and health risks. To address this, a mouse bioassay was conducted to evaluate the relative bioavailability (RBA) of Cd in 35 samples each of japonica and indica rice, determining which type exhibits lower Cd bioavailability. The results revealed a significantly lower mean Cd-RBA in japonica rice (49.6 ± 7.8%) compared to indica rice (65.6 ± 12.2%). This disparity is attributed primarily to the 1.25- and 1.37-fold higher concentrations of calcium (Ca) and iron (Fe) in japonica rice, which enhanced Ca and Fe absorption from the intestine and reduced duodenal expression of Ca and Fe transporters by 1.8–5.9 times in mice consuming japonica rice, thereby decreasing Cd transcellular transport. Additionally, japonica rice consumption promoted beneficial gut probiotics (Bifidobacterium pseudolongum and Lactobacillus reuteri) and metabolites, particularly short-chain fatty acids and peptides, potentially increasing mineral absorption and reducing Cd uptake. Moreover, mice fed japonica rice exhibited 1.35–1.47 times higher gene expression of intestinal tight junctions, enhancing intestinal barrier function and reducing extracellular Cd transport. Consequently, consuming Cd-containing japonica rice was associated with lower oxidative stress, inflammation, and cancer risks in mice compared to indica rice consumption. This study significantly enhances our understanding on the health risks associated with Cd in different rice subspecies."

Some LIG AIS configurations show higher skill than PI AIS configurations in simulating the inter‐core differences.

However, the upper layer current anomalies are weakly southward in September–October 2015 and strongly northward in April 2016 through April 2017. These anomalies of the Makassar Strait throughflow in the upper layer are found to be induced mainly by Indian Ocean Kelvin waves forcing sea surface height anomalies off the south Java coasts. The sub‐thermocline current anomalies are found to be generated by the westward and downward propagation of interannual Rossby waves from the central equatorial Pacific during and after the 2015/2016 El Niño.

Here, by comparing a high‐ and low‐resolution state‐of‐the‐art model CESM1, it is found that the double‐ITCZ bias is largely reduced in the high‐resolution CESM1. The key reason is the realistic colder sea surface temperature (SST) over the southeast Pacific (SEP) in the high‐resolution model. This realistic SEP SST is mainly due to a spuriously deeper mixed layer with a more realistic wind, as the sensitivity of mixed layer depth to wind is overestimated in both versions of CESM1. The better representation of terrain, such as Andes Mountains, elevates warm advection from inland to the coastal region, which maintains the inversion structure favorable for low cloud. The resultant increased coastal cloud in the high‐resolution CESM1 causes the colder coastal SST, thus improving the wind and deepening the mixed layer."

The measured fluxes from water to headspace (F) varied with water mass type, with lowest fluxes observed with Subtropical and Subantarctic waters and highest fluxes from Frontal waters. Measured DMS fluxes were consistent with fluxes calculated using a two‐layer model and seawater DMS concentrations. The MeSH:DMS flux ratio was 11%–18% across the three water mass types, confirming that MeSH may represent a significant unaccounted contribution to the atmospheric sulfur budget, with potentially important implications for marine aerosol formation and growth in models. Combining data from the ASITs and ambient surface seawater identified significant Spearman rank correlations for both dissolved DMS and MeSH with nanophytoplankton cell abundance (pvalue < 0.012), suggesting an important role for this phytoplankton size class in determining regional DMS and MeSH emissions. Applying a nanophytoplankton‐based parameterization to estimate DMSw provided good agreement with a recent DMS climatology. Consequently, the observed relationship between DMSw, MeSHw and nanophytoplankton cell abundances may be applicable for modeling atmospheric fluxes."

The resulting tephrostratigraphic framework includes ash deposits sourced from volcanic arcs across the Northern Hemisphere and is an exceptional resource for correlating and dating paleoenvironmental records. It also provides an opportunity to explore more novel questions regarding the controls on ultra‐distal tephra (volcanic ash >3,000 km from source) dispersal and deposition. Here, we examine temporal patterns in the tephrostratigraphy of northeastern North America to test the legitimacy of a previously noted change in ash deposition frequency at the Early Mid Holocene transition. We integrate five new cryptotephra records into the existing framework to improve its temporal and spatial extent and report further occurrences of widespread cryptotephra deposits including Mt. St. Helens We, Jala pumice, White River Ash east, Ruppert tephra, Mt. St. Helens Yn and Mazama Ash. Reexamination of the combined tephrostratigraphy using breakpoint analysis shows a significant increase in the frequency of ashfall after ca. 9,000 (7,860–9,650) cal yr BP (calendar years before C.E. 1950). We discuss this change in relation to volcanic and environmental controls of fine ash dispersal and preservation. We reject hypotheses relating to eruption frequency or depositional processes in favor of changing atmospheric transport patterns and tephra dispersal—possibly caused by the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet. Our study is a novel example of how tephrostratigraphy can be used beyond traditional correlative and dating studies, in this case indicating large‐scale changes in atmospheric circulation through time."

Variations in the concentration of atmospheric dust have established links to global climate over geologic timescales and to regional biogeographic shifts over seasonal timescales. Constraining atmospheric dust variability is thus of high value to understanding oceanographic systems, especially vast, constitutively low‐nutrient subtropical gyre ecosystems and high‐nutrient/low‐chlorophyll ecosystems where availability of the trace element iron is a dominant ecological control. Here we leverage the MERRA‐2 reanalysis product to examine over four decades of surface‐level atmospheric mineral dust concentrations in a domain of the subtropical North Pacific centered at Ocean Station ALOHA. This study region has been sampled regularly since the mid‐1980s and was the site of the Hawaii Aerosol Time‐Series (HATS) project in 2022–2023. Two unequal semi‐annual periods of elevated dust evident in the long‐term results are described and constrained. We look for evidence of shifts in total and seasonal atmospheric dust abundances or in the timing of the onset of the dominant spring/summer dusty period, finding year‐to‐year variations but little evidence for long‐term trends. We observe significant but complex relationships between the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) index and both dust and precipitation.

The development of these hypofunctional T cells and of their precursors was considered to require stimulatory conditions met only upon persisting exposure to antigen and inflammation. In sharp contrast, we found similar T cell populations in the early phase of acute infections1,2. At that stage early developing TCF1+ precursor population shows an unexpected diversity, which includes precursors of normal memory T cells but also cells with a phenotype, gene-expression, and epigenetic profile that resembles precursors of exhausted T cells found in chronic infections. We demonstrate that high ligand affinity promotes, and PD-1 signaling restricts the development of these precursors. While these exhausted precursors are initially frequently found, they decline without being completely lost in infections the immune system resolves. We therefore concluded that precursor T cells with at least two distinct phenotypes are preemptively generated irrespectively of the outcome of the infection."

 Oncogenic mutations that drive colorectal cancer can be present in healthy intestines for long periods without overt consequence1,2. Mutation of Adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc), the most common initiating event in conventional adenomas3, activates Wnt signalling, hence conferring fitness on mutant intestinal stem cells (ISCs)4,5. Apc mutations may occur in ISCs that arose by routine self-renewal or by dedifferentiation of their progeny. Although ISCs of these different origins are fundamentally similar6,7, it is unclear if both generate tumours equally well in uninjured intestines. Also unknown is whether cis-regulatory elements are substantively modulated upon Wnt hyperactivation or as a feature of subsequent tumours. Here, we show in two mouse models that adenomas are not an obligatory outcome of Apc deletion in either ISC source but require proximity of mutant intestinal crypts. Reduced crypt density abrogates, and aggregation of mutant colonic crypts augments, adenoma formation. Moreover, adenoma-resident ISCs open chromatin at thousands of enhancers that are inaccessible in Apc-null ISCs not associated with adenomas. These cis-elements explain adenoma-selective gene activity and persist, with little further expansion of the repertoire, as other oncogenic mutations accumulate. Thus, cooperativity between neighbouring mutant crypts and new accessibility at specific enhancers are key steps early in intestinal tumourigenesis."

 This study examines the origin and differentiation of stem-like CD8+ T cells that are essential for sustained T cell immunity in chronic viral infections and cancer and also play a key role in PD-1 directed immunotherapy1-10. These PD-1+ TCF-1+ TOX+ stem-like CD8+ T cells, also referred to as precursors of exhausted T cells8,9, have a distinct program that allows them to adapt to chronic antigen stimulation. Using the mouse model of chronic LCMV infection we found that virus specific stem-like CD8+ T cells are generated early (day 5) during chronic infection suggesting that this crucial fate commitment occurs irrespective of infection outcome. Indeed, we found that nearly identical populations of stem-like CD8+ T cells were generated early during acute or chronic LCMV infection, and that antigen was essential for maintaining the stem-like phenotype. We next performed reciprocal adoptive transfer experiments to determine the fate of these early stem-like CD8+ T cells after viral clearance versus persistence. Following transfer of day 5 stem-like CD8+ T cells from chronically infected into acutely infected mice, these cells downregulated canonical markers of the chronic stem-like CD8+ T cells and expressed markers (CD127 and CD62L) associated with central memory CD8+ T cells. Reciprocally, when day 5 stem-like cells from acutely infected mice were transferred into chronically infected mice these CD8+ T cells functioned like chronic resource cells and responded effectively to PD-1 therapy. These findings highlight the ability of these early PD-1+ TCF-1+ TOX+ stem-like CD8+ T cells to adapt their differentiation trajectory to either an acute or chronic viral infection. Most importantly, our study shows that the host is prepared a priori to deal with a potential chronic infection."

 C–H activation is the most direct way of functionalizing organic molecules. Many advances in this field still require specific directing groups to achieve the necessary activity and selectivity. Developing C–H activation reactions directed by native functional groups is essential for their broad application in synthesis1. Over the past decade, several generations of bifunctional ligands developed have enabled C(sp3)–H activation reactions of free carboxylic acids2, free aliphatic amines3, native amides4,5 and alcohols6. However, an effective catalyst for ketones and carboxylic esters remains to be realized. Here we report diverse methyl β-C−H functionalizations, including intermolecular arylation, hydroxylation and intramolecular C(sp3)–H/C(sp2)–H coupling of ketones and carboxylic esters with a monoprotected amino neutral amide (MPANA) ligand. The in situ generation of cationic Pd(II) complexes by the combination MPANA ligand and HBF4 is crucial for achieving the reactivity. The compatibility of these reactions with cyclic ketones and lactams provides a method to access spirocyclic and fused ring systems. Mechanistic experiments and density functional theory studies support the role of cationic Pd complexes with MPANA ligands in enhancing catalyst–substrate affinity and facilitating the C−H cleavage step.

 Polygenic genome editing in human embryos and germ cells is predicted to become feasible in the next three decades. Several recent books and academic papers have outlined the ethical concerns raised by germline genome editing and the opportunities that it may present1–3. To date, no attempts have been made to predict the consequences of altering specific variants associated with polygenic diseases. In this Analysis, we show that polygenic genome editing could theoretically yield extreme reductions in disease susceptibility. For example, editing a relatively small number of genomic variants could make a substantial difference to an individual’s risk of developing coronary artery disease, Alzheimer’s disease, major depressive disorder, diabetes and schizophrenia. Similarly, large changes in risk factors, such as low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and blood pressure, could, in theory, be achieved by polygenic editing. Although heritable polygenic editing (HPE) is still speculative, we completed calculations to discuss the underlying ethical issues. Our modelling demonstrates how the putatively positive consequences of gene editing at an individual level may deepen health inequalities. Further, as single or multiple gene variants can increase the risk of some diseases while decreasing that of others, HPE raises ethical challenges related to pleiotropy and genetic diversity. We conclude by arguing for a collectivist perspective on the ethical issues raised by HPE, which accounts for its effects on individuals, their families, communities and society4. We discuss the potential consequences and ethical concerns of polygenic genome editing of human embryos to alter specific variants associated with polygenic diseases, highlighting the possibility of reducing disease susceptibility while exacerbating health inequalities."

 Neurons in the hippocampus are correlated with different variables, including space, time, sensory cues, rewards and actions, in which the extent of tuning depends on ongoing task demands1–8. However, it remains uncertain whether such diverse tuning corresponds to distinct functions within the hippocampal network or whether a more generic computation can account for these observations9. Here, to disentangle the contribution of externally driven cues versus internal computation, we developed a task in mice in which space, auditory tones, rewards and context were juxtaposed with changing relevance. High-density electrophysiological recordings revealed that neurons were tuned to each of these modalities. By comparing movement paths and action sequences, we observed that external variables had limited direct influence on hippocampal firing. Instead, spiking was influenced by online action plans and modulated by goal uncertainty. Our results suggest that internally generated cell assembly sequences are selected and updated by action plans towards deliberate goals. The apparent tuning of hippocampal neuronal spiking to different sensory modalities might emerge due to alignment to the afforded action progression within a task rather than representation of external cues. Using high-density electrophysiological recordings, how internally generated cell assemblies are updated by action plans to meet external goals is explored."

 Histone H3 monoaminylations at Gln5 represent an important family of epigenetic marks in brain that have critical roles in permissive gene expression1–3. We previously demonstrated that serotonylation4–10 and dopaminylation9,11–13 of Gln5 of histone H3 (H3Q5ser and H3Q5dop, respectively) are catalysed by transglutaminase 2 (TG2), and alter both local and global chromatin states. Here we found that TG2 additionally functions as an eraser and exchanger of H3 monoaminylations, including H3Q5 histaminylation (H3Q5his), which displays diurnally rhythmic expression in brain and contributes to circadian gene expression and behaviour. We found that H3Q5his, in contrast to H3Q5ser, inhibits the binding of WDR5, a core member of histone H3 Lys4 (H3K4) methyltransferase complexes, thereby antagonizing methyltransferase activities on H3K4. Taken together, these data elucidate a mechanism through which a single chromatin regulatory enzyme has the ability to sense chemical microenvironments to affect the epigenetic states of cells, the dynamics of which have critical roles in the regulation of neural rhythmicity.

 Topological design of π electrons in zigzag-edged graphene nanoribbons (ZGNRs) leads to a wealth of magnetic quantum phenomena and exotic quantum phases1–10. Symmetric ZGNRs typically show antiferromagnetically coupled spin-ordered edge states1,2. Eliminating cross-edge magnetic coupling in ZGNRs not only enables the realization of a class of ferromagnetic quantum spin chains11, enabling the exploration of quantum spin physics and entanglement of multiple qubits in the one-dimensional limit3,12, but also establishes a long-sought-after carbon-based ferromagnetic transport channel, pivotal for ultimate scaling of GNR-based quantum electronics1–3,9,13. Here we report a general approach for designing and fabricating such ferromagnetic GNRs in the form of Janus GNRs (JGNRs) with two distinct edge configurations. Guided by Lieb’s theorem and topological classification theory14–16, we devised two JGNRs by asymmetrically introducing a topological defect array of benzene motifs to one zigzag edge, while keeping the opposing zigzag edge unchanged. This breaks the structural symmetry and creates a sublattice imbalance within each unit cell, initiating a spin-symmetry breaking. Three Z-shaped precursors are designed to fabricate one parent ZGNR and two JGNRs with an optimal lattice spacing of the defect array for a complete quench of the magnetic edge states at the ‘defective’ edge. Characterization by scanning probe microscopy and spectroscopy and first-principles density functional theory confirms the successful fabrication of JGNRs with a ferromagnetic ground-state localized along the pristine zigzag edge.

 The oxygen-sensitive molybdenum-dependent nitrogenase of Azotobacter vinelandii is protected from oxidative damage by a reversible ‘switch-off’ mechanism1. It forms a complex with a small ferredoxin, FeSII (ref. 2) or the ‘Shethna protein II’3, which acts as an O2 sensor and associates with the two component proteins of nitrogenase when its [2Fe:2S] cluster becomes oxidized4,5. Here we report the three-dimensional structure of the protective ternary complex of the catalytic subunit of Mo-nitrogenase, its cognate reductase and the FeSII protein, determined by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy. The dimeric FeSII protein associates with two copies of each component to assemble a 620 kDa core complex that then polymerizes into large, filamentous structures. This complex is catalytically inactive, but the enzyme components are quickly released and reactivated upon oxygen depletion. The first step in complex formation is the association of FeSII with the more O2-sensitive Fe protein component of nitrogenase during sudden oxidative stress. The action of this small ferredoxin represents a straightforward means of protection from O2 that may be crucial for the maintenance of recombinant nitrogenase in food crops.

 Plants lack specialized and mobile immune cells. Consequently, any cell type that encounters pathogens must mount immune responses and communicate with surrounding cells for successful defence. However, the diversity, spatial organization and function of cellular immune states in pathogen-infected plants are poorly understood1. Here we infect Arabidopsis thaliana leaves with bacterial pathogens that trigger or supress immune responses and integrate time-resolved single-cell transcriptomic, epigenomic and spatial transcriptomic data to identify cell states. We describe cell-state-specific gene-regulatory logic that involves transcription factors, putative cis-regulatory elements and target genes associated with disease and immunity. We show that a rare cell population emerges at the nexus of immune-active hotspots, which we designate as primary immune responder (PRIMER) cells. PRIMER cells have non-canonical immune signatures, exemplified by the expression and genome accessibility of a previously uncharacterized transcription factor, GT-3A, which contributes to plant immunity against bacterial pathogens. PRIMER cells are surrounded by another cell state (bystander) that activates genes for long-distance cell-to-cell immune signalling. Together, our findings suggest that interactions between these cell states propagate immune responses across the leaf. Our molecularly defined single-cell spatiotemporal atlas provides functional and regulatory insights into immune cell states in plants.

 The abundance and sequence of satellite DNA at and around centromeres is evolving rapidly despite the highly conserved and essential process through which the centromere directs chromosome inheritance1–3. The impact of such rapid evolution is unclear. Here we find that sequence-dependent DNA shape dictates packaging of pericentromeric satellites in female meiosis through a conserved DNA-shape-recognizing chromatin architectural protein, high mobility group AT-hook 1 (HMGA1)4,5. Pericentromeric heterochromatin in two closely related mouse species, M. musculus and M. spretus, forms on divergent satellites that differ by both density of narrow DNA minor grooves and HMGA1 recruitment. HMGA1 binds preferentially to M. musculus satellites, and depletion in M. musculus oocytes causes massive stretching of pericentromeric satellites, disruption of kinetochore organization and delays in bipolar spindle assembly. In M. musculus × spretus hybrid oocytes, HMGA1 depletion disproportionately impairs M. musculus pericentromeres and microtubule attachment to their kinetochores. Thus, DNA shape affects both pericentromere packaging and the segregation machinery. We propose that rapid evolution of centromere and pericentromere DNA does not disrupt these essential processes when the satellites adopt DNA shapes recognized by conserved architectural proteins (such as HMGA1). By packaging these satellites, architectural proteins become part of the centromeric and pericentromeric chromatin, suggesting an evolutionary strategy that lowers the cost of megabase-scale satellite expansion. Divergent satellite DNA shapes influence architectural protein binding and chromatin organization in two mouse species so that the satellites can be packaged and centromere function maintained, mitigating the evolutionary cost of satellite DNA expansion."

 Germline BRCA2 loss-of function variants, which can be identified through clinical genetic testing, predispose to several cancers1–5. However, variants of uncertain significance limit the clinical utility of test results. Thus, there is a need for functional characterization and clinical classification of all BRCA2 variants to facilitate the clinical management of individuals with these variants. Here we analysed all possible single-nucleotide variants from exons 15 to 26 that encode the BRCA2 DNA-binding domain hotspot for pathogenic missense variants. To enable this, we used saturation genome editing CRISPR–Cas9-based knock-in endogenous targeting of human haploid HAP1 cells6. The assay was calibrated relative to nonsense and silent variants and was validated using pathogenic and benign standards from ClinVar and results from a homology-directed repair functional assay7. Variants (6,959 out of 6,960 evaluated) were assigned to seven categories of pathogenicity based on a VarCall Bayesian model8. Single-nucleotide variants that encode loss-of-function missense variants were associated with increased risks of breast cancer and ovarian cancer. The functional assay results were integrated into models from ClinGen, the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics, and the Association for Molecular Pathology9 for clinical classification of BRCA2 variants. Using this approach, 91% were classified as pathogenic or likely pathogenic or as benign or likely benign.

 Frictional motion is mediated by rapidly propagating ruptures that detach the ensemble of contacts forming the frictional interface between contacting bodies1–7. These ruptures are similar to shear cracks. When this process takes place in natural faults, these rapid ruptures are essentially earthquakes8,9. Although fracture mechanics describe the rapid motion of these singular objects, the nucleation process that creates them is not understood10–19. Here we fully describe the nucleation process by extending fracture mechanics to explicitly incorporate finite interface widths (which are generally ignored20,21). We show, experimentally and theoretically, that slow steady creep ensues at a well-defined stress threshold. Moreover, as slowly creeping patches approach the interface width, a topological transition takes place in which these creeping patches smoothly transition to the rapid fracture that is described by classical fracture mechanics22–26. Apart from its relevance to fracture and material strength, this new picture of rupture nucleation dynamics is directly relevant to earthquake nucleation dynamics; slow, aseismic rupture must always precede rapid seismic rupture (so long as the initial defect in the interface is localized in both spatial dimensions). The theory may provide a new framework for understanding how and when earthquakes nucleate.

Of the net biodiversity effects, complementarity effects and selection effects contribute 65.6% and 34.4%, respectively. Complementarity effects increase with phylogenetic diversity, the mixing of nitrogen-fixing and non-nitrogen-fixing species and the functional diversity of leaf nitrogen contents, which indicate the key roles of niche partitioning, biotic feedback and abiotic facilitation in complementarity effects. More positive selection effects occur with higher species biomass inequality in their monocultures. Complementarity effects increase over time, whereas selection effects decrease over time, and they remain consistent across global variations in climates. Our results provide key insights into understanding global variations in plant diversity effects on productivity and underscore the importance of integrating both complementarity and selection effects into strategies for biodiversity conservation and ecological restoration. A meta-analysis of biodiversity effects on plant productivity found that complementarity effects increased over time whereas selection effects decreased, and both remained consistent across global variations in climate."

 Mimicking the superstructures and properties of spherical biological encapsulants such as viral capsids1 and ferritin2 offers viable pathways to understand their chiral assemblies and functional roles in living systems. However, stereospecific assembly of artificial polyhedra with mechanical properties and guest-binding attributes akin to biological encapsulants remains a formidable challenge. Here we report the stereospecific assembly of dynamic supramolecular snub cubes from 12 helical macrocycles, which are held together by 144 weak C–H hydrogen bonds3. The enantiomerically pure snub cubes, which have external diameters of 5.1 nm, contain 2,712 atoms and chiral cavities with volumes of 6,215 Å3. The stereospecific assembly of left- and right-handed snub cubes was achieved by means of a hierarchical chirality transfer protocol4, which was streamlined by diastereoselective crystallization. In addition to their reversible photochromic behaviour, the snub cubes exhibit photocontrollable elasticity and hardness in their crystalline states. The snub cubes can accommodate numerous small guest molecules simultaneously and encapsulate two different guest molecules separately inside the uniquely distinct compartments in their frameworks. This research expands the scope of artificial supramolecular assemblies to imitate the chiral superstructures, dynamic features and binding properties of spherical biomacromolecules and also establishes a protocol for construction of crystalline materials with photocontrollable mechanical properties. Left- and right-handed snub cubes show photocontrollable elasticity and hardness, in addition to the ability to encapsulate different small molecules in distinct compartments simultaneously, with potential applications in the development of advanced biomimetic materials."

 Metabolites derived from the intestinal microbiota, including bile acids (BA), extensively modulate vertebrate physiology, including development1, metabolism2–4, immune responses5–7 and cognitive function8. However, to what extent host responses balance the physiological effects of microbiota-derived metabolites remains unclear9,10. Here, using untargeted metabolomics of mouse tissues, we identified a family of BA–methylcysteamine (BA–MCY) conjugates that are abundant in the intestine and dependent on vanin 1 (VNN1), a pantetheinase highly expressed in intestinal tissues. This host-dependent MCY conjugation inverts BA function in the hepatobiliary system. Whereas microbiota-derived free BAs function as agonists of the farnesoid X receptor (FXR) and negatively regulate BA production, BA–MCYs act as potent antagonists of FXR and promote expression of BA biosynthesis genes in vivo. Supplementation with stable-isotope-labelled BA–MCY increased BA production in an FXR-dependent manner, and BA–MCY supplementation in a mouse model of hypercholesteraemia decreased lipid accumulation in the liver, consistent with BA–MCYs acting as intestinal FXR antagonists. The levels of BA–MCY were reduced in microbiota-deficient mice and restored by transplantation of human faecal microbiota. Dietary intervention with inulin fibre further increased levels of both free BAs and BA–MCY levels, indicating that BA–MCY production by the host is regulated by levels of microbiota-derived free BAs. We further show that diverse BA–MCYs are also present in human serum. Together, our results indicate that BA–MCY conjugation by the host balances host-dependent and microbiota-dependent metabolic pathways that regulate FXR-dependent physiology.

 Lithium (Li) metal batteries (LMBs) are promising for high-energy-density rechargeable batteries1–3. However, Li dendrites formed by the reaction between highly active Li and non-aqueous electrolytes lead to safety concerns and rapid capacity decay4–7. Developing a reliable solid–electrolyte interphase is critical for realizing high-rate and long-life LMBs, but remains technically challenging4,8. Here we demonstrate that adding excess m-Li2ZrF6 (monoclinic) nanoparticles to a commercial LiPF6-containing carbonate electrolyte of LMBs facilitates the release of abundant ZrF62– ions into the electrolyte driven by the applied voltage, converting to t-Li2ZrF6 (trigonal) and creating a stable solid–electrolyte interphase in situ with high Li-ion conductivity. Computational and cryogenic transmission electron microscopy studies revealed that the in situ formation of the t-Li2ZrF6-rich solid–electrolyte interphase markedly enhanced Li-ion transfer and suppressed the growth of Li dendrites. As a result, LMBs assembled with LiFePO4 cathodes (areal loading, 1.8/2.2 mAh cm−2), three-dimensional Li–carbon anodes (50-µm-thick Li) and Li2ZrF6-based electrolyte displayed greatly improved cycling stability with high capacity retention (>80.0%) after 3,000 cycles (1C/2C rate).

 The oestrogen receptor (ER or ERα), a nuclear hormone receptor that drives most breast cancer1, is commonly activated by phosphorylation at serine 118 within its intrinsically disordered N-terminal transactivation domain2,3. Although this modification enables oestrogen-independent ER function, its mechanism has remained unclear despite ongoing clinical trials of kinase inhibitors targeting this region4–6. By integration of small-angle X-ray scattering and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy with functional studies, we show that serine 118 phosphorylation triggers an unexpected expansion of the disordered domain and disrupts specific hydrophobic clustering between two aromatic-rich regions. Mutations mimicking this disruption rescue ER transcriptional activity, target-gene expression and cell growth impaired by a phosphorylation-deficient S118A mutation. These findings, driven by hydrophobic interactions, extend beyond electrostatic models and provide mechanistic insights into intrinsically disordered proteins7, with implications for other nuclear receptors8.

 Diversity-generating retroelements (DGRs) create massive protein sequence variation (up to 1030)1 in ecologically diverse microorganisms. A recent survey identified around 31,000 DGRs from more than 1,500 bacterial and archaeal genera, constituting more than 90 environment types2. DGRs are especially enriched in the human gut microbiome2,3 and nano-sized microorganisms that seem to comprise most microbial life and maintain DGRs despite reduced genomes4,5. DGRs are also implicated in the emergence of multicellularity6,7. Variation occurs during reverse transcription of a protein-encoding RNA template coupled to misincorporation at adenosines. In the prototypical Bordetella bacteriophage DGR, the template must be surrounded by upstream and downstream RNA segments for complementary DNA synthesis to be carried out by a complex of the DGR reverse transcriptase bRT and associated protein Avd. The function of the surrounding RNA was unknown. Here we show through cryogenic electron microscopy that this RNA envelops bRT and lies over the barrel-shaped Avd, forming an intimate ribonucleoprotein. An abundance of essential interactions in the ribonucleoprotein precisely position an RNA homoduplex in the bRT active site for initiation of reverse transcription. Our results explain how the surrounding RNA primes complementary DNA synthesis, promotes processivity, terminates polymerization and strictly limits mutagenesis to specific proteins through mechanisms that are probably conserved in DGRs belonging to distant taxa.

 Piezoelectric materials directly convert between electrical and mechanical energies. They are used as transducers in applications such as nano-positioning and ultrasound imaging. Improving the properties of these devices requires piezoelectric materials capable of delivering a large longitudinal strain on the application of an electric field. A large longitudinal strain of more than 1% is generally anticipated in suitably oriented single crystals of specific compositions of ferroelectric materials1. Polycrystalline piezoceramics typically show a longitudinal strain of approximately 0.2–0.4%. We demonstrate that when the thickness of a polycrystalline piezoceramic is reduced to such an extent that a large fraction of the grains are in the triaxial–biaxal crossover regime, the domain-switching fraction increases considerably. If the positive and the negative surfaces of the piezoceramic respond to electric fields symmetrically, as in the classical PbZrxTixO3, a longitudinal strain of approximately 1% can be achieved in a 0.2 mm disc of the morphotropic phase boundary composition (a 300% increase from a thickness of 0.7 mm). We show that oxygen vacancies in piezoceramics cause asymmetrical switching at the positive and negative surfaces, which causes thin piezoceramics to bend. We expect these findings will encourage further engineering of these mechanisms across different piezoelectric material systems, opening new applications for electromechanical actuation. We find that if the thickness of a polycrystalline piezoceramic is reduced such that a large fraction of the grains are in the triaxial–biaxal crossover regime, the longitudinal strain is enhanced and the piezoceramic bends."

 Sequencing-based genetic tests have uncovered a vast array of BRCA2 sequence variants1. Owing to limited clinical, familial and epidemiological data, thousands of variants are considered to be variants of uncertain significance2–4 (VUS). Here we have utilized CRISPR–Cas9-based saturation genome editing in a humanized mouse embryonic stem cell line to determine the functional effect of VUS. We have categorized nearly all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in the region that encodes the carboxylate-terminal DNA-binding domain of BRCA2. We have generated function scores for 6,551 SNVs, covering 96.4% of possible SNVs in exons 15–26 spanning BRCA2 residues 2479–3216. These variants include 1,282 SNVs that are categorized as missense VUS in the clinical variant database ClinVar, with 77.2% of these classified as benign and 20.4% classified as pathogenic using our functional score. Our assay provides evidence that 3,384 of the SNVs in the region are benign and 776 are pathogenic. Our classification aligns closely with pathogenicity data from ClinVar, orthogonal functional assays and computational meta predictors. We have integrated our embryonic stem cell-based BRCA2-saturation genome editing dataset with other available evidence and utilized the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association for Molecular Pathology guidelines for clinical classification of all possible SNVs. This classification is available as a sequence–function map and serves as a valuable resource for interpreting unidentified variants in the population and for physicians and genetic counsellors to assess BRCA2 VUS in patients.

 Breast cancer is a highly heterogeneous disease whose prognosis and treatment as defined by the expression of three receptors—oestrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2; encoded by ERBB2)—is insufficient to capture the full spectrum of clinical outcomes and therapeutic vulnerabilities. Previously, we demonstrated that transcriptional and genomic profiles define eleven integrative subtypes with distinct clinical outcomes, including four ER+ subtypes with increased risk of relapse decades after diagnosis1,2. Here, to determine whether these subtypes reflect distinct evolutionary histories, interactions with the immune system and pathway dependencies, we established a meta-cohort of 1,828 breast tumours spanning pre-invasive, primary invasive and metastatic disease with whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing. We demonstrate that breast tumours fall along a continuum constrained by three genomic archetypes. The ER+ high-risk integrative subgroup is characterized by complex focal amplifications, similar to HER2+ tumours, including cyclic extrachromosomal DNA amplifications induced by ER through R-loop formation and APOBEC3B-editing, which arise in pre-invasive lesions. By contrast, triple-negative tumours exhibit genome-wide instability and tandem duplications and are enriched for homologous repair deficiency-like signatures, whereas ER+ typical-risk tumours are largely genomically stable. These genomic archetypes, which replicate in an independent cohort of 2,659 primary tumours, are established early during tumorigenesis, sculpt the tumour microenvironment and are conserved in metastatic disease. These complex structural alterations contribute to replication stress and immune evasion, and persist throughout tumour evolution, unveiling potential vulnerabilities.

 Transcriptional regulation, which involves a complex interplay between regulatory sequences and proteins, directs all biological processes.

Here we introduce GET (general expression transformer), an interpretable foundation model designed to uncover regulatory grammars across 213 human fetal and adult cell types1,2. Relying exclusively on chromatin accessibility data and sequence information, GET achieves experimental-level accuracy in predicting gene expression even in previously unseen cell types3. GET also shows remarkable adaptability across new sequencing platforms and assays, enabling regulatory inference across a broad range of cell types and conditions, and uncovers universal and cell-type-specific transcription factor interaction networks. We evaluated its performance in prediction of regulatory activity, inference of regulatory elements and regulators, and identification of physical interactions between transcription factors and found that it outperforms current models4 in predicting lentivirus-based massively parallel reporter assay readout5,6. In fetal erythroblasts7, we identified distal (greater than 1 Mbp) regulatory regions that were missed by previous models, and, in B cells, we identified a lymphocyte-specific transcription factor–transcription factor interaction that explains the functional significance of a leukaemia risk predisposing germline mutation8–10.

 The cratonic crust contains abundant mineral deposits of metals such as gold, copper and rare earths1–5 and is underlain by a thick mantle lithosphere rich in the volatiles carbon, sulfur and water6–8. Although volatiles are known to be key components in metallogenesis9, how and where they are distributed in the cratonic lithosphere mantle and their role in the initial enrichment of metals have not been sufficiently explored. Here we compile sulfur and copper contents of global cratonic peridotites, identifying sulfide-rich and copper-rich continental roots at depths of 160–190 km at cratonic margins. Our new high-pressure experiments show that carbonated silicate melts originating from the asthenosphere lose silicate components during reaction with lithospheric peridotite, evolving to carbonatite melts that become concentrated at cratonic margins. Sulfur solubility in melts substantially decreases as the SiO2 content of melts decreases during this process, forcing sulfide precipitation and the formation of sulfide-rich continental roots at the base of the mantle lithosphere. The migration of carbonated melts towards cratonic margins replenishes the continental roots there with sulfur, explaining the co-location of magmatic metal deposits with carbonatites close to cratonic margins. These findings highlight the notable role of carbonated melts in metallogenesis and provide a potential platform for metal ore exploration.

 The development of the human neocortex is highly dynamic, involving complex cellular trajectories controlled by gene regulation1. Here we collected paired single-nucleus chromatin accessibility and transcriptome data from 38 human neocortical samples encompassing both the prefrontal cortex and the primary visual cortex. These samples span five main developmental stages, ranging from the first trimester to adolescence. In parallel, we performed spatial transcriptomic analysis on a subset of the samples to illustrate spatial organization and intercellular communication. This atlas enables us to catalogue cell-type-specific, age-specific and area-specific gene regulatory networks underlying neural differentiation. Moreover, combining single-cell profiling, progenitor purification and lineage-tracing experiments, we have untangled the complex lineage relationships among progenitor subtypes during the neurogenesis-to-gliogenesis transition. We identified a tripotential intermediate progenitor subtype—tripotential intermediate progenitor cells (Tri-IPCs)—that is responsible for the local production of GABAergic neurons, oligodendrocyte precursor cells and astrocytes. Notably, most glioblastoma cells resemble Tri-IPCs at the transcriptomic level, suggesting that cancer cells hijack developmental processes to enhance growth and heterogeneity. Furthermore, by integrating our atlas data with large-scale genome-wide association study data, we created a disease-risk map highlighting enriched risk associated with autism spectrum disorder in second-trimester intratelencephalic neurons.

 Missense variants that change the amino acid sequences of proteins cause one-third of human genetic diseases1. Tens of millions of missense variants exist in the current human population, and the vast majority of these have unknown functional consequences. Here we present a large-scale experimental analysis of human missense variants across many different proteins. Using DNA synthesis and cellular selection experiments we quantify the effect of more than 500,000 variants on the abundance of more than 500 human protein domains. This dataset reveals that 60% of pathogenic missense variants reduce protein stability. The contribution of stability to protein fitness varies across proteins and diseases and is particularly important in recessive disorders. We combine stability measurements with protein language models to annotate functional sites across proteins. Mutational effects on stability are largely conserved in homologous domains, enabling accurate stability prediction across entire protein families using energy models. Our data demonstrate the feasibility of assaying human protein variants at scale and provides a large consistent reference dataset for clinical variant interpretation and training and benchmarking of computational methods.

 The concept of non-Hermiticity has expanded the understanding of band topology, leading to the emergence of counter-intuitive phenomena. An example is the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE)1–7, which involves the concentration of eigenstates at the boundary. However, despite the potential insights that can be gained from high-dimensional non-Hermitian quantum systems in areas such as curved space8–10, high-order topological phases11,12 and black holes13,14, the realization of this effect in high dimensions remains unexplored. Here we create a two-dimensional (2D) non-Hermitian topological band for ultracold fermions in spin–orbit-coupled optical lattices with tunable dissipation, which exhibits the NHSE. We first experimentally demonstrate pronounced nonzero spectral winding numbers in the complex energy plane with nonzero dissipation, which establishes the existence of 2D skin effect. Furthermore, we observe the real-space dynamical signature of NHSE in real space by monitoring the centre of mass motion of atoms. Finally, we also demonstrate that a pair of exceptional points are created in the momentum space, connected by an open-ended bulk Fermi arc, in contrast to closed loops found in Hermitian systems. The associated exceptional points emerge and shift with increasing dissipation, leading to the formation of the Fermi arc. Our work sets the stage for further investigation into simulating non-Hermitian physics in high dimensions and paves the way for understanding the interplay of quantum statistics with NHSE.

 Freshwater ecosystems are highly biodiverse1 and important for livelihoods and economic development2, but are under substantial stress3. To date, comprehensive global assessments of extinction risk have not included any speciose groups primarily living in freshwaters. Consequently, data from predominantly terrestrial tetrapods4,5 are used to guide environmental policy6 and conservation prioritization7, whereas recent proposals for target setting in freshwaters use abiotic factors8–13. However, there is evidence14–17 that such data are insufficient to represent the needs of freshwater species and achieve biodiversity goals18,19. Here we present the results of a multi-taxon global freshwater fauna assessment for The IUCN Red List of Threatened Species covering 23,496 decapod crustaceans, fishes and odonates, finding that one-quarter are threatened with extinction. Prevalent threats include pollution, dams and water extraction, agriculture and invasive species, with overharvesting also driving extinctions. We also examined the degree of surrogacy of both threatened tetrapods and freshwater abiotic factors (water stress and nitrogen) for threatened freshwater species. Threatened tetrapods are good surrogates when prioritizing sites to maximize rarity-weighted richness, but poorer when prioritizing based on the most range-restricted species. However, they are much better surrogates than abiotic factors, which perform worse than random. Thus, although global priority regions identified for tetrapod conservation are broadly reflective of those for freshwater faunas, given differences in key threats and habitats, meeting the needs of tetrapods cannot be assumed sufficient to conserve freshwater species at local scales.

 Proximity ferroelectricity is an interface-associated phenomenon in electric-field-driven polarization reversal in a non-ferroelectric polar material induced by one or more adjacent ferroelectric materials. Here we report proximity ferroelectricity in wurtzite ferroelectric heterostructures. In the present case, the non-ferroelectric layers are AlN and ZnO, whereas the ferroelectric layers are Al1−xBxN, Al1−xScxN and Zn1−xMgxO. The layered structures include nitride–nitride, oxide–oxide and nitride–oxide stacks that feature two-layer (asymmetric) and three-layer (symmetric) configurations1–3. Ferroelectric switching in both layers is validated by multimodal characterization methods, including polarization hysteresis, anisotropic chemical etching, second harmonic generation, piezo response force microscopy, electromechanical testing and atomic resolution polarization orientation imaging in real space by scanning transmission electron microscopy. We present a physical switching model in which antipolar nuclei originate in the ferroelectric layer and propagate towards the internal non-ferroelectric interface. The domain wall leading edge produces elastic and electric fields that extend beyond the interface at close proximity, reducing the switching barrier in the non-ferroelectric layer, and allowing complete domain propagation without breakdown. Density functional theory calculations of polymorph energies, reversal barriers and domain wall energies support this model. Proximity ferroelectricity enables polarization reversal in wurtzites without the chemical or structural disorder that accompanies elemental substitution, opening new questions and opportunities regarding interface-based ferroelectricity.

 It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimensions1–5. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside two dimensions, has been considered6 but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons7–9.

These new types of identical particle obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles that naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions, in which free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and are notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems and—more speculatively—the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particle.

 Mollusca is the second most species-rich animal phylum, but the pathways of early molluscan evolution have long been controversial1–5. Modern faunas retain only a fraction of the past forms in this hyperdiverse and long-lived group. Recent analyses6–8 have consistently recovered a fundamental split into two sister clades, Conchifera (including gastropods, bivalves and cephalopods) and Aculifera9, comprising Polyplacophora (‘chitons’) and Aplacophora. Molluscan evolution in toto is characterized by plasticity in body-plan characters10, but historically aculiferans have been interpreted as more conservative10,11. The few completely preserved aculiferan or aculiferan-like fossils from the early Palaeozoic12–19 have been largely regarded as transitional forms that inform questions of character polarity between the extant polyplacophoran and aplacophoran body forms20,21. The history of early aculiferans, and the morphological and ecological range that they occupied, remain inadequately sampled. Here we describe two new three-dimensionally preserved aculiferan species from the Silurian Herefordshire Lagerstätte22,23, which substantially extend the morphological and ecological range of the clade. Phylogenetic analyses indicate positions within a complex nexus of taxa and suggest reversals in the states of fundamental characters such as the presence of valves and the nature of the foot. In contrast to previous hypotheses of morphological conservatism, evolution in early aculiferans generated a profusion of unusual forms comparable to the diversification of other crown-group molluscs.

 Megathrusts, faults at the plate interface in subduction zones, exhibit substantial spatiotemporal variability in their slip behaviour. Many previous attempts to discern the physical controls on their slip behaviour have focused on individual variables, often associated with the physical properties of either the subducting plate (for example, its age and roughness) or the overriding plate (for example, its thickness and rigidity). Such studies, which are often location-specific or focused on single variables, have fuelled contrasting views on the relative importance of various physical properties on megathrust slip behaviour. Here we synthesize observations of the Alaska, Hikurangi and Nankai subduction zones to ascertain the main causes of the well-documented changes in interseismic coupling and earthquake behaviour along their megathrusts. In all three cases, along-trench changes in the distribution of rigid crustal rocks in the forearc, the geometry of the subducting slab and the upper-plate stress state drive considerable variability in the downdip width of the seismogenic zone. The subducting plate is systematically rougher in creeping regions, with fault-zone heterogeneity promoting a mixture of moderate to large earthquakes, near-trench seismicity and slow-slip events. Smoother subducting plate segments (with thicker sediment cover) are more strongly correlated with deep interseismic coupling and great (>Mw 8) earthquakes. In the three regions considered, there is no one dominant variable. Rather, we conclude that several physical properties affecting the dimensions and heterogeneity of megathrusts collectively explain observed along-trench transitions in slip behaviour at these subduction zones, and potentially at many other subduction zones worldwide. Multiple factors, including slab geometry and upper-plate stress state, determine the variation in slip behaviour along most megathrusts, according to a synthesis of observations of the Alaska, Hikurangi and Nankai subduction zones."

 Antiretroviral therapy (ART) improves the quality of life for those living with the human immunodeficiency virus type one (HIV-1). However, poor compliance reduces ART effectiveness and leads to immune compromise, viral mutations, and disease co-morbidities. Here we develop a drug formulation in which a lipid-based nanoparticle (LBNP) carrying rilpivirine (RPV) is decorated with the C-C chemokine receptor type 5 (CCR5) targeting peptide. This facilitates extended drug persistence within myeloid cells. Particle delivery to viral reservoirs is tracked by positron emission tomography. The CCR5-mediated LBNP cell uptake and retention reduce HIV-1 replication in human monocyte-derived macrophages and infected humanized mice (hu mice). Focused ultrasound with microbubbles mediated blood brain barrier (BBB) disruption allows the CCR5-targeted LBNP to penetrate the BBB and reach brain myeloid cells.

Here, the authors suggest targeting SE-dependent genes with synthetic ecteinascidins in tumors with heterogeneous transcriptional landscapes. 
 The plasticity of cancer cells facilitates their ability to adopt heterogeneous differentiation states, posing a significant challenge to therapeutic interventions. Specific gene expression programs, driven in part by super-enhancers (SEs), underlie cancer cell states. Here we successfully inhibit SE-driven transcription in phenotypically distinct metastatic melanoma cells using next-generation synthetic ecteinascidins. Through functional genomic methodologies, we demonstrate that these compounds inhibit the expression of genes encoding lineage-specific or ubiquitous transcription factors/coactivators by selectively targeting the CpG-rich sequences within their promoters and/or enhancers. This prevents the formation of transcription factor/coactivator condensates necessary for SE-dependent gene expression. Consequently, these compounds exhibit cytotoxic activity across distinct subpopulations of metastatic melanoma cells and inhibit tumor proliferation, including those resistant to current therapies. These findings extend to other cancers, like small cell lung cancer, recently approved for ecteinascidin-based treatment. Overall, our study provides preclinical proof that pan-inhibition of SE-dependent genes with synthetic ecteinascidins is a promising therapeutic approach for tumors with heterogeneous transcriptional landscapes.

Aggregation of nymphs with female adults benefits the herbivore by disarming plants’ indirect defenses. 
 Feeding and oviposition by phytophagous insects are both known to trigger defenses in plants. Whether these two defenses functionally interact remains poorly studied, although these interactions are likely important for pests with overlapping generations. Here we investigated the differences and interaction between feeding- and oviposition-induced plant defenses triggered by the brown planthopper (BPH, Nilaparvata lugens), which gregariously feeds and oviposits on rice. Analyses of host-plant transcriptomes, phytohormones, and direct and indirect defense compounds all show that BPH gravid females (GFs), but not nymphs and non-gravid females (NFs), strongly induce rice defenses. BPH nymphs and GFs prefer to feed on plants previously infested by nymphs over un-attacked plants, but are repelled by plants previously infested by GFs. Moreover, nymph feeding is found to reduce the attractiveness of rice plants to natural enemies and decrease egg parasitism by suppressing GF-induced volatiles that mediate indirect defenses in both growth chambers and paddies. Intergenerational interactions between oviposition- and feeding-induced plant defenses not only promote the development of the population of pest insects but may also contribute to the aggregation behavior of pest insects by suppressing oviposition-induced indirect plant defenses. Here the authors found that brown planthopper gravid females, but not nymphs and non-gravid females, strongly induce rice defenses.

 Advancements in high-throughput screenings enable the exploration of rich phenotypic readouts through high-content microscopy, expediting the development of phenotype-based drug discovery. However, analyzing large and complex high-content imaging screenings remains challenging due to incomplete sampling of perturbations and the presence of technical variations between experiments. To tackle these shortcomings, we present IMage Perturbation Autoencoder (IMPA), a generative style-transfer model predicting morphological changes of perturbations across genetic and chemical interventions. We show that IMPA accurately captures morphological and population-level changes of both seen and unseen perturbations on breast cancer and osteosarcoma cells. Additionally, IMPA accounts for batch effects and can model perturbations across various sources of technical variation, further enhancing its robustness in diverse experimental conditions. With the increasing availability of large-scale high-content imaging screens generated by academic and industrial consortia, we envision that IMPA will facilitate the analysis of microscopy data and enable efficient experimental design via in-silico perturbation prediction.

The device exhibits high brightness, stability, and encoding capacity, with promising uniqueness and reliability under UV exposure, high humidity, and temperature variations. 
 Physical unclonable functions (PUFs) are considered the most promising approach to address the global issue of counterfeiting. Current PUF devices are often based on a single stochastic process, which can be broken, especially since their practical encoding capacities can be significantly lower than the theoretical value. Here we present stochastic PUF devices with features across multiple length scales, which incorporate semiconducting polymer nanoparticles (SPNs) as fluorescent taggants. The SPNs exhibit high brightness, photostability and size tunability when compared to the current state-of-the-art taggants. As a result, they are easily detectable and highly resilient to UV radiation. By embedding SPNs in photoresists, we generate PUFs consisting of nanoscale (distribution of SPNs within microspots), microscale (fractal edges on microspots), and macroscale (random microspot array) designs. With the assistance of a deep-learning model, the resulting PUFs show both near-ideal performance and accessibility for general end users, offering a strategy for next-generation security devices.

Here, authors monitor the irreversible phase reconstruction process during perovskite degradation, guiding stability improvements for tin-lead perovskite and tandem solar cells. 
 Tin-lead perovskites provide an ideal bandgap for narrow-bandgap perovskites in all-perovskite tandem solar cells, fundamentally improving power conversion efficiency. However, light-induced degradation in ambient air is a major issue that can hinder the long-term operational stability of these devices. Understanding the specifics of what occurs during this pathway provides the direction for improving device stability. In this study, we investigate the long-term stability problem of tin-lead perovskites under irradiation, counterintuitively discovering an irreversible phase reconstruction process. In-situ photoluminescence spectroscopy is used to monitor the reconstruction process, which involves the reaction of oxygen with photoexcited electrons to form superoxide. It is proposed that Pb-rich regions appear on the surface after Sn2+ oxidation, and these Pb-rich regions are reconstituted from the yellow phase of formamidinium lead iodide to the black phase with prolonged irradiation. This study highlights the phase reconstruction process during the degradation of tin-lead perovskites, providing valuable insights into the superoxide degradation mechanism and guiding further stability improvements for narrow-bandgap tin-lead perovskites and tandem solar cells.

The authors elucidated its molecular structure, mapped its potential substrate binding interface, and uncovered that disease-associated mutations likely impair Rab18 binding. 
 The heterodimeric Rab3GAP complex is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Rab18 GTPase that regulates lipid droplet metabolism, ER-to-Golgi trafficking, secretion, and autophagy. Why both subunits of Rab3GAP are required for Rab18 GEF activity and the molecular basis of how Rab3GAP engages and activates its cognate substrate are unknown. Here we show that human Rab3GAP is conformationally flexible and potentially autoinhibited by the C-terminal domain of its Rab3GAP2 subunit. Our high-resolution structure of the catalytic core of Rab3GAP, determined by cryo-EM, shows that the Rab3GAP2 N-terminal domain binds Rab3GAP1 via an extensive interface. AlphaFold3 modelling analysis together with targeted mutagenesis and in vitro activity assay reveal that Rab3GAP likely engages its substrate Rab18 through an interface away from the switch and interswitch regions. Lastly, we find that three Warburg Micro Syndrome-associated missense mutations do not affect the overall architecture of Rab3GAP but instead likely interfere with substrate binding.

 Extreme climate events have increasingly threatened global terrestrial ecosystems in recent decades. In spring 2023, Southwest China (SWC) experienced unprecedented heatwaves and droughts. Using multiple satellite-based datasets, we found that these events led to the most significant declines in gross primary productivity (GPP) and the enhanced vegetation index (EVI) for the past two decades, with lagged effects persisting until August in the drought-affected area. Unlike the widespread and persistent drought of 2010, the record-breaking heatwaves in April and May 2023 sustained and intensified the drought stress. Elevated temperatures and suppressed precipitation, driven by anomalous atmospheric circulations, exacerbated the soil moisture (SM) shortages and increased the atmospheric vapor pressure deficit (VPD), restricting water availability and carbon uptake for vegetation photosynthesis. Our findings reveal that, during the 2023 extreme event in SWC, the decreases in forest productivity were primarily driven by low SM anomalies, while the decreases in the grassland and cropland productivity mainly resulted from abnormally high VPDs. This study highlights the combined effects of low SM and high VPD anomalies caused by a compound heatwave–drought event on vegetation growth in SWC and provides valuable insights for future assessments of regional extreme climate events on vegetation growth."

 Impacts of aerosol particles on clouds, precipitation, and climate remain one of the significant uncertainties in climate change. Aerosol particles entrained at cloud top and edge can affect cloud microphysical and macrophysical properties, but the process is still poorly understood. Here we investigate the cloud microphysical responses to the entrainment of aerosol-laden air in the Pi convection-cloud chamber. Results show that cloud droplet number concentration increases and mean radius of droplets decreases, which leads to narrower droplet size distribution and smaller relative dispersion. These behaviors are generally consistent with the scenario expected from the first aerosol-cloud indirect effect for a constant liquid water content (L). However, L increases significantly in these experiments. Such enhancement of L can be understood as suppression of droplet sedimentation removal due to small droplets. Further, an increase in aerosol concentration from entrainment reduces the effective radius and ultimately increases cloud optical thickness and cloud albedo, making the clouds brighter. These findings are of relevance to the entrainment interface at stratocumulus cloud top, where modeling studies have suggested sedimentation plays a strong role in regulating L. Therefore, the results provide insights into the impacts of entrainment of aerosol-laden air on cloud, precipitation, and climate."

 Severe convective storms and tornadoes rank among nature’s most hazardous phenomena, inflicting significant property damage and casualties. Near-surface weather conditions are closely governed by large-scale synoptic patterns. It is crucial to delve into the involved multiscale associations to understand tornado potential in response to climate change. Using clustering analysis, this study unveils that leading synoptic patterns driving tornadic storms and associated spatial trends are distinguishable across geographic regions in the U.S. Synoptic patterns with intense forcing featured by intense upper-level eddy kinetic energy and a dense distribution of Z500 fields dominate the increasing trend in tornado frequency in the southeast U.S., generating more tornadoes per event. Conversely, the decreasing trend noted in certain regions of the central Great Plains is associated with weak upper-level synoptic forcing.

This study investigates the impacts of LUC and GW on wet and dry extremes in the MC using Community Earth System Model (CESM)simulations, analyzing 55 years for LUC and 200 years for GW. We find that LUC-induced deforestation increases surface warming, enhancing atmospheric instability and favoring local convection, leading to more frequent heavy precipitation. Meanwhile, GW amplifies the atmosphere’s water-holding capacity, further intensifying wet extremes. Our findings reveal a “wet-get-wetter, dry-get-drier” pattern driven by different mechanisms: dynamic processes primarily influence wet extremes under LUC, while changes in evapotranspiration control dry extremes. In contrast, under GW, wet extremes are driven by dynamic processes, while dry extremes are influenced by reduced moisture availability and weakened atmospheric circulation.

 Mangroves are essential tropical ecosystems nurturing a wide range of marine biodiversity and counteracting global warming by sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide. Hence, the export mechanisms and fluxes of particulate and dissolved organic carbon and trace elements from mangroves directly influence coastal productivity, the global carbon cycle and thus global climate, which are, however, not well constrained. Here we find consistent radiogenic neodymium and hafnium isotopic compositions of porewater, sedimentary iron-manganese oxyhydroxides and coastal seawater, suggesting that the Amazonian mangrove belt supplies trace elements through porewater discharge, dissolution of iron-manganese oxyhydroxides and their interactions with seawater. Together, these processes supply 8.4 × 106 g yr-1 dissolved neodymium, equivalent to 64% of the total sources of neodymium to the Amazonian coastal seawater. Globally, mangrove systems along the continental margins contribute 6–9% of the net neodymium input to the ocean, which is similar to the contributions from atmospheric deposition. A contribution of this magnitude is potentially also the case for other trace elements, given the strong correlations between neodymium and iron (Pearson r = 0.92), and manganese (r = 0.75) concentrations across the entire river-ocean section, emphasizing the crucial role of mangrove system inputs in micro-nutrient cycling.

Humidity and winter temperature are two important climatic factors influencing carbon accumulation (Deviance explained 77.2%) and drought promotes Qianmutian peatland initial development.

 Fossil methane, a key component of the atmospheric greenhouse gas budget, is emitted by fugitive leaks from petroleum industry activities and natural geologic seepage. Since the gas from these two sources can exhibit similar isotopic compositions, differentiating them using atmospheric observations is often challenging. Here, we provide a conceptual model that helps distinguish the two sources. Using molecular and isotopic data from global seep and reservoir gas inventories, and new seep analyses from major hydrocarbon-bearing basins in California, we identify six post-genetic changes in gas chemistry. These changes include alterations of molecular ratios among alkanes (ethane, propane, and butane) and 13C enrichment of propane and carbon dioxide due to oxidation and secondary methanogenesis. Such changes are typical of seepage, and do not occur in deep reservoir gas that may leak during extraction and transport. Our model can aid in source attribution of fossil gas analyzed in airborne or field surveys and serve as a foundation for future work on regional emissions of natural gas.

 Quantitative vegetation structural parameters such as leaf area index (LAI), fractional vegetation cover (FVC), and leaf inclination angle (LIA) are important for controlling biophysical processes, such as carbon dynamics and transpiration. The generation of remote sensing vegetation structural products using geostationary satellite data may allow for near real-time monitoring of vegetation change and associated biophysical processes. However, operational algorithms for retrieving the vegetation structure from geostationary satellite imagery are rare. Herein we developed a bidirectional model of reflectance and difference vegetation index (DVI) which requires LAI and other vegetation parameters as inputs, allowing these parameters to be estimated via an optimization scheme. The developed radiative transfer model specifically considers the high-frequency and multi-angle features of geostationary satellite data to separate the sun-angle related variables from the sun-angle independent variables. This parameterization facilitates the retrieval of vegetation structural products by reducing the number of variables while maintaining the generality of the model. The inversion of this physical radiative transfer model produced daily LAI and FVC with a spatial resolution of 1 km from the bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) of Himawari-8 high-frequency observations for Australia. In contrast to most other readily available LAI products, this approach to generating Himawari-8 LAI did not rely on MODIS LAI or land cover data. Compared with field-measured data, the RMSE of Himawari-8 LAI was 1.009 and the bias was −0.354, and for FVC the RMSE was 0.132 and the bias was −0.014; these were more accurate than MODIS LAI and GLASS LAI, and GEOV3 FVC, respectively. The intercomparison of these products showed that the Himawari-8 LAI and FVC products performed well having realistic spatio-temporal distributions. For the first time, a mean leaf inclination angle (MLIA) product was generated only using satellite data. Similarity was found between the spatial patterns of MLIA and the land cover map over Australia. Independent validation data showed that the uncertainty of MLIA was generally less than 10°. The high-frequency nature of geostationary satellite imagery coupled with the radiative transfer model developed herein enables the derived vegetation structural products to facilitate improved monitoring of both short-term (i.e., daily to weekly) and long-term (i.e., seasonal to annual) vegetation dynamics."

In this study, a dual-polarization algorithm (DPA) for SM estimation is proposed to produce a global-scale, 1-km resolution SM dataset (S1-DPA) using the Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data. Specifically, a forward model was constructed to simulate the backscatter observed by the Sentinel-1 dual-polarization SAR, and SM retrieval was achieved by minimizing the simulation error for different soil and vegetation states. The produced S1-DPA data products cover the global land surface for the period 2016–2022 and include both ascending and descending data with an observation frequency of 3–6 days for Europe and 6–12 days for the other regions.

 Understanding the abiotic drivers of high-elevation forest physiognomy is essential for forecasting how mountain ecosystems will respond to emerging environmental pressures. Most prior studies of these relationships have relied on small samples of the full landscape, resulting in limited power to detect dominant covariates and their interactions. Here we report the first evaluation of abiotic influences on a complement of accurate, wall-to-wall estimates of conifer forest structure and composition at the watershed scale. In a subalpine conifer domain in the Colorado Rocky Mountains (USA), we developed a novel method for deriving stand structure metrics from waveform LiDAR data, which showed high fidelity with field inventory. We quantified the relationships between structural and compositional metrics and climate, topographic, edaphic, and geologic factors. Our results showed that peak snow water equivalent (SWE), snow disappearance rate, and elevation explained most of the variation in forest structure. The highest stand density, basal area, maximum canopy height, and quadratic mean diameter occurred in sites with SWE around one standard deviation below mean, but with long snow residence times. Stand density decreased linearly with elevation, while other metrics peaked between 3000 m.a.s.l. and 3200 m.a.s.l. Substrate properties had weaker influence. Continuous mapping of through-canopy forest structure enabled our novel findings of the dominant role of snowpack in explaining structural and compositional variation, and of elevation thresholds. Our reproducible approach facilitates assessment of forest-topoclimate relationships in other conifer-dominated landscapes and improves understanding of the baseline patterns controlling forest structure, which is needed for predicting long-term ecological change."

 Building extraction from very high-resolution remote-sensing images still faces two main issues: (1) small buildings are severely omitted and the extracted building shapes have a low consistency with ground truths. (2) supervised deep-learning methods have poor performance in few-shot scenarios, limiting the practical application of these methods. To address the first issue, we propose an asymmetric Siamese multitask network integrating adversarial edge learning called ASMBR-Net for building extraction. It contains an efficient asymmetric Siamese feature extractor comprising pre-trained backbones of convolutional neural networks and Transformers under pre-training and fine-tuning paradigms. This extractor balances the local and global feature representation and reduces training costs. Adversarial edge-learning technology automatically integrates edge constraints and strengthens the modeling ability of small and complex building-shaped patterns.

 The presence and variability of clouds have a significant effect on surface solar radiation (SSR). The range of cloud products currently available for SSR estimation vary in spatial and temporal resolution and accuracy. Since the effect of different cloud products on the accuracy of SSR estimation has not been adequately quantified in existing studies, this study evaluates the performance of four cloud products (Himawari-8, ISCCP, CERES, and MERRA-2) in estimating SSR and analyzes them in comparison with the MODIS cloud product. The accuracy of SSR estimation of the four cloud products is verified using measured data from BSRN and CERN ground-based observatories. The results show that Himawari-8 has the best performance with R-squared (R2) values of 0.94 and 0.74 and root mean square errors (RMSE) of 71.03 W/m2 and 141.36 W/m2 on the sub-daily scales at the BSRN and CERN sites, respectively. CERES and ISCCP have similar performances, but they vary by site and month. While MERRA-2 grossly underestimates SSR, probably related to misclassification of clear skies as cloudy and overestimation of cloud optical thickness under cloudy conditions. Compared to MODIS, Himawari-8 provides better agreement with MODIS results in cloud classification and cloud phase identification, while CERES provides better agreement with MODIS results in cloud optical thickness. Overall, Himawari-8 performs best in SSR estimation. This comprehensive assessment not only highlights the crucial role of cloud observations on SSR estimations but also details the strengths and weaknesses of each cloud product in enhancing the understanding of solar radiation dynamics."

 Short-term ambient ozone (O3) exposure is widely linked to heightened mortality risk, while its effects on life expectancy remain largely unstudied. This multi-city time-series study aims to assess the potential gain in life expectancy (PGLE) from reduced O3 concentrations in eastern China. Generalized additive model was applied to quantify city-specific effects of short-term O3 exposure on years of life lost (YLL), and associations at the provincial level were pooled through random-effects meta-analysis. By assuming that daily O3 level met the World Health Organization air quality guideline 2021 (WHO AQG 2021) and interim target 2 (IT-2), we estimated PGLE and attributable fraction (AF) of YLL on the basis of counterfactual analysis. Approximately 1.9 million nonaccidental deaths were included in the analysis. We observed a pooled estimate of 0.44% (95% confidence interval: 0.36%, 0.52%) in excess risk and 0.56 (0.39, 0.72) years increase in YLL (per million population) for each 10-μg/m3 rise in 2-day moving average O3. By reducing daily O3 concentrations to WHO IT-2 and WHO AQG 2021, we estimated that 0.13 million (AF = 0.56%) and 0.22 million (AF = 0.97%) years of YLL could be avoided per million population, equivalent to the PGLE of 0.054 (0.038, 0.070) years and 0.094 (0.066, 0.121) years for each death, respectively.

 The occurrence of disaster-producing hourly extreme precipitation events (HEPEs) is usually linked to certain atmospheric backgrounds. Using high-density automatic weather stations observations and ERA5 reanalysis, this study analyzed the synoptic patterns of HEPEs over the Yangtze-Huaihe River Basin with an objective classification method. Four primary atmospheric circulation patterns (accounted for over 71 % of HEPEs) are identified, including two mei-yu types differ in different temporal and spatial features, the deep trough type, and the post-mei-yu type. The two mei-yu types are responsible for nearly 50 % of all HEPEs with relatively large horizontal size, and the southwesterly low-level jets that influenced by the cyclone and Western North Pacific Subtropical High (WNPSH), are a representative feature of these two types during HEPEs. The deep trough type during HEPEs related to Northeast China Cold Vortex is characterized by a cold northerly flow collided with the warm southerly/southwesterly flows, resulting in a strong convergence. In contrast, the HEPEs in the post-mei-yu type exhibits an eastward WNPSH, with the convergence and updrafts over the study area are caused by the collision between the southerly cyclone flows and the northerly flows at low levels. During two mei-yu types and post-mei-yu type, the HEPEs (non-precipitation) showed a cyclone (an anticyclone) feature. Our findings demonstrate the significant impact of circulation types on HEPEs, highlighting the importance of understanding their characteristics and patterns, which would be helpful for disaster warning, forecasting, and management."

 Causal analysis of cloud microphysical variables constitutes an effective means for characterizing the microphysical attributes and causal mechanisms of precipitation clouds. Causal analysis methods primarily rely on Granger causality tests based on lagged variables and linear regression. However, most cloud physical precipitation processes are nonlinear. Herein, a novel hybrid approach involving information entropy, wavelet decomposition, and Liang–Kleeman information flow is introduced to enhance the dependability and effectiveness of causal analysis for the self-organizing process of precipitation clouds in this paper. Based on the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, a case study is conducted of the northward-moving process of Typhoon Maysak in 2020. Gridded data with 30-min intervals and a 6 km × 6 km resolution is extracted. Through empirical analysis, using the total cloud water content (TWC) and water vapor mixing ratio (QV) as the principal variable and atmospheric vertical velocity (OMG), precipitable water (PW) and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) as covariates, the hybrid causal analysis methodology is assessed. TWC and QV are direct and potential influencing factors of precipitation, respectively. Results indicate that the probability distributions of TWC and QV are significantly different at different stages. In the typhoon stage, typical self-organizing characteristics of high mean and low information entropy values are presented; in the tropical storm stage, information entropies increase, TWC increases, and QV decreases, with self-organizing characteristics weakening; in the tropical depression stage, both the mean and information entropies of TWC and QV show a significant decrease. Wavelet coherence analysis indicates that IEOLR and IEPW can better explain IETWC, and IEPW and IEOMG can better explain IEQV. There is a significant causal relationship between IETWC and IEPW at different time scales. At larger periodic scales, IEQV has significant causal relationships with IEOMG, IEPW and IEOLR. Overall, this approach provides insights into the complex causal relationships of cloud microphysical variables in a precipitation cloud system, broadening our understanding of these complex phenomena."

Conditional deletion of the glucose transportersGlut1and/orGlut3, in either the incipient pre-skeletal mesenchyme withPrx1Creor in chondrocytes withCol2Cre, disrupted interzone formation dose-dependently.

To determine the molecular mechanisms of rTMS and the brain regions they occur in, we used spatial transcriptomics to map changes to gene expression across the mouse brain in response to two commonly used rTMS protocols. Our results revealed that rTMS alters the expression of genes related to several cellular processes and neural plasticity mechanisms across the brain, which was both brain region– and rTMS protocol–dependent. In the cortex, the effect of rTMS was dependent not only on the cortical region but also on each cortical layer. These findings uncover the diverse molecular mechanisms induced by rTMS, which will be useful in interpreting its effects on cortical and subcortical circuits."

Despite being a target for drugs including general anesthetics and benzodiazepines, experimental structures have yet to capture an open state of classical synaptic α1β2γ2 GABAAreceptors. Here, we use a goal-oriented adaptive sampling strategy in molecular dynamics simulations followed by Markov state modeling to capture an energetically stable putative open state of the receptor. The model conducts chloride ions with comparable conductance as in electrophysiology measurements. Relative to experimental structures, our open model is relatively expanded at both the cytoplasmic (−2′) and central (9′) gates, coordinated with distinctive rearrangements at the transmembrane αβ subunit interface. Consistent with previous experiments, targeted substitutions disrupting interactions at this interface slowed the open-to-desensitized transition rate. This work demonstrates the capacity of advanced simulation techniques to investigate a computationally and experimentally plausible functionally critical of a complex membrane protein yet to be resolved by experimental methods."

Sensory cortex represents these temporal cues through two codes: the temporal sequences of neuronal activity and the spatial patterns of neuronal firing rate. However, it is unknown which of these coexisting codes causally drives sensory decisions. To separate their contributions, we generated in the mouse auditory cortex optogenetically driven activity patterns differing exclusively along their temporal or spatial dimensions. Mice could rapidly learn to behaviorally discriminate spatial but not temporal patterns. Moreover, large-scale neuronal recordings across the auditory system revealed that the auditory cortex is the first region in which spatial patterns efficiently represent temporal cues on the timescale of several hundred milliseconds. This feature is shared by the deep layers of neural networks categorizing time-varying sounds. Therefore, the emergence of a spatial code for temporal sensory cues is a necessary condition to efficiently associate temporally structured stimuli with decisions."

By upward transport in tropical regions, mercury enters into the stratosphere, but the contribution of the stratosphere to global mercury dispersion and deposition remains unknown. We find that between 5 and 50% (passing through the 400-kelvin isentropic surface and tropopause, respectively) of the mercury mass deposited on Earth’s surface is chemically processed in the lower stratosphere. Our results show the stratosphere as a unique chemical environment where elemental mercury is efficiently converted to long-lived oxidized species. Subsequent downward transport contributes substantially to the oxidized mercury burden in the troposphere. The results show that the stratosphere facilitates the global dispersion of large amounts of mercury from polluted source regions to Earth’s remote environments. We find that stratospheric transport is as important as tropospheric transport in interhemispheric mercury dispersion.

However, scarce studies have investigated polaron formation in low-dimensional materials with phonon polarity and electronic structure transitions. In this work, we studied polarons of tellurene, composed of chiral Te chains. The frequency and linewidth of the A1phonon, which becomes increasingly polar for thinner tellurene, change abruptly for thickness below 10 nanometers, where field-effect mobility drops rapidly. These phonon and transport signatures, combined with phonon polarity and band structure, suggest a crossover from large polarons in bulk tellurium to small polarons in few-layer tellurene. Effective field theory considering phonon renormalization in the small-polaron regime semiquantitatively reproduces the phonon hardening and broadening effects. This polaron crossover stems from the quasi–one-dimensional nature of tellurene, where modulation of interchain distance reduces dielectric screening and promotes electron-phonon coupling.

We present an advanced method that combines open-set deep learning (OSDL) with single-cell Raman spectroscopy to identify pathogens in real-world air containing diverse unknown indigenous bacteria that cannot be fully included in training sets. To test and further enhance identification, we constructed the Raman datasets of aerosolized bacteria. Through optimizing OSDL algorithms and training strategies, Raman-OSDL achieves 93% accuracy for five target airborne pathogens, 84% accuracy for untrained air bacteria, and 36% reduction in false positive rates compared to conventional close-set algorithms. It offers a high detection sensitivity down to 1:1000. When applied to real air containing >4600 bacterial species, our method accurately identifies single or multiple pathogens simultaneously within an hour. This single-cell tool advances rapidly surveilling pathogens in complex environments to prevent infection transmission."

Thomas,North Pontic crossroads: Mobility in Ukraine from the Bronze Age to the early modern period,"The North Pontic region, which encompasses present-day Ukraine, was a crossroads of migration, connecting the vast Eurasian Steppe with Central Europe. We generated shotgun-sequenced genomic data for 91 individuals dating from around 7000 BCE to 1800 CE to study migration and mobility history in the region, with a particular focus on historically attested migrating groups during the Iron Age and the medieval period. We infer a high degree of temporal heterogeneity in ancestry, with fluctuating genetic affinities to different present-day Eurasian groups. We also infer high heterogeneity in ancestry within geographically, culturally, and socially defined groups. Despite this, we find that ancestry components which are widespread in Eastern and Central Europe have been present in the Ukraine region since the Bronze Age. In short, our study reveals a diverse range of ancestries in the Ukraine region through time as a result of frequent movements, assimilation, and contacts."

Traditionally, photocatalysts and piezocatalysts have been used to generate ROS, but their utilization is limited by various environmental and physical constraints. This study introduces metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as modern thermocatalysts efficiently producing hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) from small temperature differences. Temperature fluctuations, abundant in daily life, offer tremendous potential for practical thermocatalytic applications. As proof of concept, MOF materials coated onto carbon fiber fabric (MOF@CFF) created a thermocatalytic antibacterial filter. The study compared three different MOFs (CuBDC, MOF-303, and ZIF-8) with bismuth telluride (Bi2Te3), a known thermocatalytic material. ZIF-8 demonstrated superior H2O2generation under low-temperature differences, achieving 96% antibacterial activity through temperature variation cycles. This work advances potential in thermoelectric applications of MOFs, enabling real-time purification and disinfection through H2O2generation. The findings open interdisciplinary avenues for leveraging thermoelectric effects in catalysis and various technologies."

However, identifying nonunitary superconductors remains challenging. We demonstrate that spin current driven by thermal gradients sensitively probes the nature of the condensate in nonunitary superconductors. Spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space induces the superconducting spin Seebeck effect, where a spin current is generated along thermal gradients without a thermoelectric charge current. Notably, the nonvanishing superconducting spin Seebeck effect provides a smoking gun evidence of nonunitary superconductivity because it reflects the spin polarization of the condensate in momentum space, irrespective of whether the net pair spin magnetization vanishes. At the same time, the spin chirality of the condensate induces the spin Nernst effect, where a spin current is generated perpendicular to thermal gradients in nonunitary superconductors. These spin caloritronic phenomena offer a definitive probe of nonunitary superconductors."

Several recent reports have demonstrated the emergence of “electron-donating” hydrides in tailoring the structure, electronic structure, and reactivity of metal nanoclusters. However, the number of such hydrides included in each cluster kernel is limited to one or two. There is even no structure model, neither theoretical nor experimental, for encapsulating a third electron-donating hydride into one cluster entity. Here, we present a structurally precise superatomic nanocluster, PtH3Cu23(iso-propyl-PhS)18(PPh3)4(PtH3Cu23), which contains three interstitial electron-donating hydrides. The molecular structure of PtH3Cu23describes the encapsulation of a PtCu12core that contains three interstitial hydrides in a distorted anticuboctahedral architecture, in an outer sphere consisting of copper atoms and thiolate and phosphine ligands. Density functional theory calculations reveal that the three hydrides in PtH3Cu23contribute their valence electrons to the cluster superatomic electron count of eight. In this regard, the cluster represents a rare Pt-included copper-hydride superatom with eight free electrons."
