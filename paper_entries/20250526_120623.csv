The next frontier is to build emulators for long climate simulations with skill across a range of spatiotemporal scales, a particularly important goal for the ocean. Our work builds a skillful global emulator of the ocean component of a state‐of‐the‐art climate model. We emulate key ocean variables, sea surface height, horizontal velocities, temperature, and salinity, across their full depth. We use a modified ConvNeXt UNet architecture trained on multi‐depth levels of ocean data. We show that the ocean emulator—Samudra—which exhibits no drift relative to the truth, can reproduce the depth structure of ocean variables and their interannual variability. Samudra is stable for centuries and 150 times faster than the original ocean model. Samudra struggles to capture the correct magnitude of the forcing trends and simultaneously remain stable, requiring further work."

However, the question of how Ti‐rich titanomagnetites, the primary remanence carriers in oceanic crust rocks, can faithfully preserve geomagnetic field information for tens of millions of years is not well understood. Here, we combine microscopic, micromagnetic, and rock magnetic analyses, including 14‐T high‐field measurements, to show that the magnetic micro‐anisotropy of a fresh pillow lava dredged from the Juan de Fuca Ridge is dominated by internal stress throughout its chilled margin to its interior. Internal stress, which is generated primarily by the contraction of hot lava erupting into cold seawater, increased the natural remanent magnetization in this lava by a factor of ∼3. We suggest that stress‐induced magnetic domain state transformation from multidomain to single vortex (or single domain) in extrusive pillow lavas significantly enhances oceanic crustal magnetic remanence strength and stability."

However, its role in sediment and organic carbon (OC) dynamics remains to be estimated. Our analyses of the inner Gulf of Thailand (IGoT) revealed that riverine sediment fluxes decreased from 6.6 to 5.4 Mt/yr after 1975, while sediment accumulation within the IGoT increased from 20.8 to 29.5 Mt/yr. The observed trend indicates major sediment contributions from coastal erosion, particularly from mangrove deposits. This process destabilizes coastal ecosystems and accelerates OC decomposition, that is, a low burial efficiency (16.8 ± 5.5%) leads to CO2 release. Extrapolating these findings globally, mangrove loss could release ∼175 Tg/yr CO2. As coastal erosion intensifies under sea‐level rise and human land‐use practices, preserving coastal ecosystems is critical for mitigating blue carbon loss and maintaining coastal stability and resilience."

However, variations in Pb isotopic compositions among different grain‐size fractions in sediments complicate their use. We examine the Nd‐Pb isotopic compositions of two sediment fractions (<2 μm and 30–63 μm) from the central Japan Sea during the last glaciation (26–12 ka BP). Our results indicate that these sediments primarily consist of aeolian dust transported by the East Asian Winter Monsoon. The <2 μm fraction exhibits more radiogenic Pb isotopes than the 30–63 μm fraction. This size‐dependent discrepancy in Pb isotopes is attributed to differences in sediment composition, governed by the incongruent weathering of minerals in source rocks and transport sorting. Comparisons of dust records from inland and marine archives reveal contrasting mechanisms that control Pb isotopic compositions. We propose that greater caution is necessary when using Pb isotopes in paleoclimatology and paleoceanography."

Li,Mechanisms Linking Stratospheric Gravity Wave Activity to Hurricane Intensification: Insights From Model Simulation of Hurricane Joaquin,"Previous studies based on satellite observations and model simulations have revealed a significant correlation between intense stratospheric gravity wave (GW) activity and hurricane intensification. This research further investigated the underlying mechanism of this correlation by analyzing the properties and propagation characteristics of stratospheric GWs excited by Hurricane Joaquin based on a Weather Research and Forecasting model simulation. By employing the 3‐D Stockwell wave analysis method, we found that GWs excited during hurricane intensification display relatively higher intrinsic frequencies, shorter horizontal wavelengths, and longer vertical wavelengths than during weakening. Analysis of these GWs' propagation using the GROGRAT ray‐tracing model revealed that they can reach the middle stratosphere rapidly within 20 min. This quick propagation enabled the observation of intense stratospheric GWs before the hurricane reached its peak intensity, offering a potential indicator for hurricane intensification. These findings strengthened the basis for considering stratospheric GW activity as a proxy for hurricane intensification under specific conditions."

FR and WR are produced within different environmental conditions, but their microphysical differences and the possible underlying causes remain unclear. We use polarimetric radar observations and the ERA5 reanalysis data to investigate the microphysical properties of convective cells (CCs) in FR and WR. Overall, both frontal and warm sector CCs produce maritime‐type convective rain, but FR events exhibit stronger convection intensity, larger raindrop sizes, and higher rain rates than WR events. The larger reflectivity above the freezing level and the higher occurrence frequency of large‐sized graupel in FR suggest more active riming process, which might be partly attributed to its stronger dynamic conditions (i.e., larger 0–3 km storm relative helicity and stronger 0–6 km shear) and higher supercooled liquid water content. Collisional coalescence serves as the primary growth mechanism for raindrops in both types of CCs below the melting layer. However, in frontal CCs having the top 10 percentile mass‐weighted mean raindrop diameters oversized raindrops undergo breakup. The ratio of ice and liquid water contents indicates that warm rain processes play a key role in the formation of rainfall particularly in WR. These findings provide new insights into the microphysical characteristics of heavy rainfall in the tropical monsoon region of South China."

Here, we quantify these unstable ENSO impacts on a global scale by calculating the range of possible correlation coefficients (CCs) between the Niño‐3.4 index and climate anomalies in boreal winter at each ∼1° grid point of the globe over any 31‐year running time windows during 1880–2014. In observations, the CCs between the Niño‐3.4 index and surface air temperature (SAT)/precipitation are significantly unstable at a 95% confidence level over 74.7%/73.6% of the globe, respectively, mainly over tropical Indian and Atlantic Oceans, Africa, Australia, North America, and Eurasia. Further Analyses on Community Earth System Model version 2 pacemaker simulations suggest that after the non‐ENSO‐related internal variability is largely removed, the simulated CCs are always significant over most of the tropics and North America. This suggests that internal variability is essential for driving unstable ENSO teleconnections over these regions mainly by modulating the Southern Oscillation and Pacific‐North American teleconnections. Our findings on the nonstationary impacts of ENSO have important implications for understanding and enhancing global seasonal forecast skill."

In this study, we investigated the characteristics of PM2.5 acidity and the underlying chemical mechanisms. The results showed that PM2.5 acidity exhibited weakly acidic patterns, with a bimodal pattern on seasonal scales, primarily due to high loadings of ammonium ions and frequent sandstorms. Sensitivity tests indicated that temperature had a more pronounced effect on aerosol acidity than relative humidity, owing to its significant influence on ammonium partitioning. Furthermore, PM2.5 acidity responded to changes in aerosol chemical composition, with sulfate and total ammonium (TNHx) being the most significant contributors, followed by total nitrate (TNO3) and total chloride (TCl). Sulfate modified aerosol acidity by preferentially promoting the formation of sulfate and bisulfate, which in turn regulated the partitioning of semi‐volatile species. TNO3 contributed to the dynamic equilibrium between sulfate and bisulfate by interacting with the partitioning of semi‐volatile species. Initially, TNHx triggered a sharp increase in aerosol acidity by preferentially utilizing sulfate; however, subsequent neutralization and partitioning between TNHx and of semi‐volatile acidic species limited further evolutions in acidity. The comprehensive analysis of key chemical species suggested that reducing PM2.5 pH can only be achieved through effective ammonia control. This study not only addresses theoretical gaps in the numerical simulations of aerosol acidity in ammonia‐rich environments but also enhances our understanding of the global differential distribution characteristics."

Our findings indicate that the overestimation of precipitation amounts caused by overestimated precipitation frequency in ERA5 is mitigated in WRF mainly through a reduction in light precipitation occurrences. This improvement is likely linked to increased temperatures and decreased relative humidity in the lower troposphere. Moreover, the much earlier precipitation peak in ERA5 is corrected in WRF, a result attributed to differences in related net water vapor transport onto the TP. Additionally, WRF provides a more accurate estimation of the percentage of short‐ and long‐duration precipitation events with only slight underestimations and overestimations, respectively, whereas ERA5 exhibits significantly larger errors. The relatively larger temperature changes in WRF, indicating increased solar heating, are likely responsible for the higher occurrence of short‐duration precipitation events. In contrast, the anticyclonic anomalies and northeastern wind anomalies in WRF reduce the persistence of long‐duration precipitation. Importantly, WRF also produces more realistic timings of precipitation with different durations compared to ERA5. For extreme precipitation, short‐duration extreme events dominate accounting for 50% of extreme precipitation. These events are better reproduced by WRF than by ERA5. Although WRF outperforms ERA5 in estimating the proportion and contribution of extreme events to total precipitation and in capturing their triggering timing, a slight underestimation persists in the simulated proportion and contribution."

These so‐called pan‐Atlantic extremes are necessarily mediated by the North Atlantic circulation. It is known that the Atlantic storm track modulates European windstorm occurrence, but it is unclear whether the American cold spells directly influence the storm track, or whether the cooccurrence of extremes is indirect—a result of a common large‐scale driver. In this study, cold spells over both central North America and northeast Canada are clustered with respect to the evolution of the large‐scale circulation over the North Atlantic. The direct contribution of cold spells to the European wind extremes is then ascertained using circulation analogs, so that different states of the North Atlantic storm track can be compared for days with and without cold spells. Consistent with previous work, two main pathways emerge from the analysis, called “zonal” and “wavy” for simplicity. For a wavy pathway, North American cold spell occurrence is directly associated with more frequent European wind extremes than expected from the Euro‐Atlantic flow, as a result of Rossby wave trains. For the other pathways, the common driver of storm track variability linked to the anomalous Atlantic circulation was sufficient to explain more frequent wind extremes across Europe, with no or little ascertainable contribution from the cold spells. This analysis clarifies that the causality of wintertime pan‐Atlantic extremes is flow‐dependent—either direct or indirect depending on the active dynamical pathway."

The complex interactions exist between binary TCs and impose challenges on TC track simulation and result in significant track prediction errors. Here, we use Typhoons Lekima and Krosa (2019) as an example of a binary‐TC system to examine the influences of binary‐TC interactions on their tracks. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting model with a cloud‐resolving (3 km resolution) TC‐downscaling simulation, it is found that precisely capturing feedbacks of Krosa's fine‐scale structures to the western Pacific subtropical high (WPSH) greatly improves the accuracy of track simulations of this binary‐TC system. Conversely, due to the larger distance between Lekima and the WPSH, the asymmetric convection in Lekima only has a limited influence on the WPSH, making a negligible effect on Krosa's track. The analysis of potential vorticity tendency suggests that Krosa's asymmetric convection mainly affects the TC tracks by changing the horizontal advection (HA), while the diabatic heating makes relatively small contributions. Further analyses suggest that the asymmetric convection of Krosa weakens the strength of β‐effect, thus diminishing its ventilation flows. This modification of ventilation flows changes the magnitude and direction of HA, consequently leading to Krosa's deceleration and zigzag motion. As Krosa's fine‐scale structures persistently interact with the environment, the western ridge of WPSH gradually gets enhanced and subsequently extends westward. This process further alters the β‐gyres and ventilation flows of Lekima, ultimately resulting in its northwestward turning."

Northwestern China (NWC), a typical arid region, faces uncertainty regarding future wetting or drying trends. A comprehensive assessment and projection of these conditions are crucial for water resource management. In this study, we employ a Lagrangian trajectory model, optimal fingerprint analysis, and a maximum covariance technique to evaluate wetting and/or drying trends in NWC over the historical (1981–2023) and future (2024–2099) periods. Our results show that over 80% of NWC experienced increases in air temperature, precipitation, and evaporation during the historical period. External and internal water vapor sources contribute 92% and 8%, respectively, to precipitation changes. Incoming water vapor predominantly originated from the North Atlantic (31.9%) and the South China Sea ‐ Bay of Bengal region (39.3%), with a strong positive correlation (r = 0.71) between Atlantic sea surface temperatures and precipitation minus evaporation in NWC. Water vapor enters NWC from the southern, northern, and western boundaries, while 83.4% escapes through the eastern boundary. The precipitation trend is strongly influenced by the combined effects of anthropogenic and natural forcings, accounting for 36.8% to the observed increase. Under a 1.5°C warming scenario, warming‐wetting regions shift northward, whereas higher warming levels (2°C, 3°C, 4°C) cause these regions to shift southeastward and shrink.

This study, taking the Manas River Basin (MRB) in Xinjiang China as the test bed, aims to quantify the uncertainties in hydrometeorological variables from the 24 NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX‐GDDP‐CMIP6) simulations and further reduce these biases using a Cycle‐Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN). The bias‐corrected CMIP6 data are then used to drive the Soil and Water Assessment Tool model calibrated with both runoff and snow water equivalent (SWE) through a dual‐objective approach for future projections. The results indicate that: (a) Model uncertainty brought by different climate models is the primary source of uncertainty in the original CMIP6 outputs. CycleGAN demonstrates substantial effectiveness in reducing model uncertainty; (b) Most subbasins of the MRB will experience absolute SWE reduction in the future, with changes varying significantly across elevation bands, decreasing to 30%–60% of baseline levels by the end of the century; (c) The runoff in the MRB has an increasing trend in the future, with projected increases ranging from 1.34% under SSP126 to 24.56% under SSP585. As the rain‐to‐snow ratio rises and snowmelt shifts earlier, low flows will increase during the dry period, elevating spring flood risks.

Most studies have focused on temperate and subtropical regions; however, results can vary due to different climate characteristics. This study examines Lanzhou, a representative of arid Northwestern China, to explore the nonlinear relationship between the built environment and physical activity among older adults, focusing on the role of green spaces. By using the XGBoost method, we analyze how green spaces and the 5D built environment affect physical activity levels among the obese and standard‐weight elderly populations in Lanzhou. Results indicate that green spaces significantly influence physical activity in both groups, with their effect surpassing other environmental and sociodemographic factors. Obese elderly individuals are more influenced by green space quality and accessibility, while standard‐weight individuals are more affected by the overall quantity and coverage of green spaces. Obese individuals also rely more on street greening compared with their standard‐weight counterparts. In addition, a diverse urban environment and appropriate public transportation distances are crucial for promoting physical activity among the elderly. Low temperatures inhibit physical activity more in obese elderly individuals. Our findings provide insights for policymakers, planners, and designers on optimizing green infrastructure to reduce obesity risks among the elderly in arid regions, ultimately enhancing the urban environment's effectiveness in promoting healthy aging."

 Coastal cities face increasing compound flood risks from human mobility patterns under climate change. In this study, we integrated dynamic population distribution models with numerical hydrodynamic modelling to examine mobility effects on flood risk in Hong Kong’s Kowloon area. We simulated flooding across 75 scenarios with matching rainfall and storm surge return periods (50, 100, 200 years) under current conditions and climate projections for 2060 and 2100 under intermediate and very high emission pathways. We found human mobility causes notable temporal shifts in risk distribution, with commercial areas experiencing higher daytime risk while residential areas face increased nighttime risk. Flood risk decreases with distance from coastlines, showing distinct variations between weekdays and weekends. The Night-Day Risk Ratio reveals weekday differentials ranging from 18.7% to 20.6% with minimal weekend variations, intensifying under future climate projections. These insights inform urban planning and flood management in coastal cities.

 This study integrates a dynamic plant growth model with a three-dimensional (3D) radiative transfer model (RTM) for maize traits retrieval using high spatial–spectral resolution airborne data. The research combines the Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer (DART) model with the Dynamic L-System-based Architectural maize (DLAmaize) growth model to simulate field reflectance. Comparison with the 1D RTM SAIL revealed limitations in representing row structure effects, field slope, and complex light–canopy interactions. Novel Global Sensitivity Analyses (GSA) were carried out using dependence-based methods to overcome limitations of traditional variance-based approaches, enabling better characterization of hyperspectral sensitivity to changes in leaf biochemistry, canopy architecture, and soil moisture. GSA provided complementary results to assess estimation uncertainties of the proposed traits retrieval method across growth stages. A hybrid inversion framework combining DART simulations with an active learning strategy using Kernel Ridge Regression was implemented for traits estimation. The approach was validated using ground data and HyPlant-DUAL airborne hyperspectral images from two field campaigns in 2018 and achieved high retrieval accuracy of key maize traits: leaf area index (LAI, R2=0.91, RMSE=0.42 m2/m2), leaf chlorophyll content (LCC, R2=0.61, RMSE=3.89 μg/cm2), leaf nitrogen content (LNC, R2=0.86, RMSE=1.13 × 10−2 mg/cm2), leaf dry matter content (LMA, R2=0.84, RMSE=0.15 mg/cm2), and leaf water content (LWC, R2=0.78, RMSE=0.88 mg/cm2). The validated models were used to generate two-date 10 m resolution maps, showing good spatial consistency and traits dynamics. The findings demonstrate that integrating 3D RTMs with dynamic growth models is suited for maize trait mapping from hyperspectral data in varying growing conditions."

Das,Estimating crop biophysical parameters from satellite-based SAR and optical observations using self-supervised learning with geospatial foundation models,"•Fusion of SAR, optical, and climate data improved VWC and crop height estimation. •VH polarization outperforms VV for soybean VWC, while both are important for corn. •Precipitation is a key factor for crop height, surpassing SAR and optical data. •Temporal modeling with Geospatial FMs enhanced VWC estimation across diverse fields. 
 Accurate knowledge of vegetation water content (VWC) and crop height is crucial for agricultural management, environmental monitoring, and for satellite-based retrieval algorithms for geophysical variables. Traditional methods to estimate VWC, primarily rely on optical indices, which has limitations of biomass saturation, and sensitivity to atmospheric conditions. This study introduces a novel application of geospatial foundation models (GFMs), leveraging extensive, unlabeled datasets through self-supervised learning to enhance the skill of VWC and crop height estimation. We developed a comprehensive model integrating Sentinel-1 A C-band SAR and Sentinel-2 A/B indices with weather parameters to estimate soybean and corn VWC and crop height.Our research study area spans a variety of climatic zones and management practices, from the humid continental climate of Iowa and Michigan to the subtropical environment of Florida, encompassing both irrigated and non-irrigated fields as well as diverse tillage practices. We compared the performance of Single-Task Learning GFM (STL-GFM), Multi-Task Learning GFM (MTL-GFM), and machine learning techniques including Random Forest (RF), and XGBoost (XGB) to evaluate their effectiveness in estimating VWC and crop height.Results demonstrated that STL-GFM outperforms other methods in accuracy and generalizability. For VWC estimation, STL-GFM achieved R2 values of 0.90 and 0.89 for soybean and corn, respectively. For crop height, R2 values reached 0.95 for soybean and 0.98 for corn. The integration of SAR, optical, and climate data provided more reliable estimations than using individual data sources.Feature importance analysis identified NDVI, NDWI, VH backscatter, and precipitation as key drivers for accurate VWC and height estimations. The red-edge band emerged as significant for VWC estimation but showed limited importance for height prediction. Notably, surface roughness demonstrated a noticeable impact on corn VWC and height estimations, while soil moisture exhibited less influence than initially anticipated. Notably, without directly incorporating soil moisture and surface roughness data, but by including diverse field conditions in training and validation, the STL-GFM model demonstrated strong generalization capabilities. This study highlights the potential of GFMs in advancing crop monitoring techniques, offering more reliable data for precision agriculture, and supporting sustainable farming practices across diverse agricultural landscapes."

 As one of the critical parameters in the land-atmosphere exchange processes, land surface temperature (LST) plays an essential role in various domains, such as climate change, urban heat island effect, disaster monitoring, and evaporation retrieval. Thermal infrared (TIR) remote sensing is one of the main approaches to obtaining LST on a large scale. For the sensors with only one TIR channel, the single-channel (SC) methods are commonly and effectively used to retrieve LST, as they are most suitable under such limitations. However, atmospheric correction is essential for the SC methods, which involves significant uncertainty and complexity. To reduce the atmospheric dependency of SC methods, this study proposes a Correlation-Hypothesis based Single-Channel (CH-SC) method to retrieve LST. In this method, the LST can be retrieved using the top-of-atmosphere (TOA) brightness temperature from a single TIR channel and the LSEs from two virtual adjacent channels, while atmospheric water vapor content (WVC) is used solely to assess atmospheric conditions. Consequently, the CH-SC method exhibits the least sensitive in atmospheric parameter errors compared to existing SC methods. This inherent robustness results in superior stability of retrieval accuracy, enhancing its practicality for real applications. Subsequently, the CH-SC method was applied to Landsat 7 data, alongside the mono-window (MW) method and generalized single-channel (GSC) method. The retrieved LSTs were compared with in-situ measurements for validation. As a result, the CH-SC method exhibited strong performance compared to in-situ measurements, with an RMSE of 2.83 K in SURFRAD sites and 4.02 K in BSRN sites, which was comparable to Landsat 7 LST product (3.15 K at SURFRAD and 4.26 K at BSRN) and outperforming other SC methods. Generally, compared to the existing methods, the proposed method exhibits minimal dependence on atmospheric information while ensuring superior accuracy and stability, even under high water vapor conditions. That holds significant application value, especially for the sensors with limited TIR channels to enable real-time on-orbit computation of LST."

 In this paper, we primarily design a novel system for measuring Meteorological Optical Range (MOR) called Multi-Modal Dual Reflection Transmissometer (MMDRT), which is based on a variant Beer Lambert Law. Conventional physical visibility meters, along with the latest digital image-based visibility measurement algorithms, exhibit drawbacks and limitations when subjected to varying geographical environments and fluctuations in sunlight exposure. To overcome the shortcomings of previous equipment and algorithms while avoiding environmental and temporal constraints, we conduct more detailed research on parameter settings for the original equipment and made more scientific improvements to it. First, we analyze the limitation and unsuitability of Beer Lambert Law. Second, we build a measurement system based on a variant Beer Lambert Law, which is utilized to capture the change of MOR. Third, a novel multi-model deep-learning algorithm combining images and atmospheric factors is proposed to learn the relationship between spot images taken by MMDRT, meteorological factors and MOR. New 6511 samples are used to test the performance of MMDRT.

 Atmospheric aerosols significantly influence global and regional climate by interacting with radiation and clouds. These interactions are difficult to represent in atmospheric chemistry models due to their dependence on aerosols' physicochemical properties associated with emission, aging, and removal processes. In the absence of precipitation, large uncertainties arise from the parameterization of aerosol dry deposition (ADD), which could lead to inaccuracies in the estimation of aerosol interactions.In this study, the WRF-Chem model is validated and used to assess (1) its sensitivity to emission sources’ representation and to four ADD schemes coupled with the MOSAIC 8-bin aerosol model (i.e., ADD1 – based on Binkowski and Shankar, 1995; ADD1E – based on Emerson et al., 2020; ADD101 – based on Peters and Eiden, 1992; and ADD301 – based on Zhang et al., 2001); and (2) the impact of ADD on size-resolved dust aerosol load, number, and optical depth during a Saharan dust event that affected the Iberian Peninsula between 7 and August 12, 2010.Results show that all simulation experiments using the different ADD schemes captured the observed horizontal and vertical aerosol layer's structure, concentration, and optical properties, with model skill significantly improving when all emission sources were considered. However, this agreement with observations results from compensating effects of different aerosol size distributions in all ADD schemes. In fact, only ADD1 could reproduce the observed coarse mode shape, with ADD1E and ADD301 largely overestimating the aerosol volume in the 5–10 μm diameter range. Bin-dependent relative differences in dust number, load, and AOD show that of all the schemes, ADD1 offers the best balance between predicted aerosol number in 0.078–1.25 μm range and aerosol load in 5.0–10.0 μm diameter range during the dust event."

 Spatially and temporally enhanced satellite precipitation products (SPPs) from the GPM mission offer a viable alternative to ground-based measurements. Although the SPPs have been extensively evaluated at specific time scales, such as hourly and daily, the temporally continuity feature of precipitation events is often overlooked. This study assessed and intercompared the performance of six GPM hourly SSPs, i.e. Early, Late and Final from IMERG, and NRT, MVK, NRT_GC (hereafter GC) from GSMaP, focusing on capturing three key precipitation properties (i.e. depth, duration and intensity) along with peak magnitude and timing, in order to obtain a comprehensive understanding of their capability and potential for precipitation monitoring and related hydrometeorological applications. The minimum inter-event time (MIT) approach, with a range of threshold values (i.e. 1, 2, 6, 10 and 24 h), was adopted to delineate precipitation events for the SSPs and the reference data (site observations and CLDAS datasets). IMERG and GSMaP products revealed their respective strengths in detection capacity of precipitation events, with IMERG achieving lower FAR and GSMaP showing higher POD. Despite comparable capabilities in estimating the depth of precipitation events by all the SPPs, IMERG products tended to be more effective in characterizing precipitation intensity and event peak while GSMaP better identified event duration. Notably, near/post real-time products outperformed gauge-corrected versions in certain aspects. Early was more capable of capturing event-based precipitation properties compared to the other IMERG products, especially for shorter MITs, suggesting the potential of near-real-time products in precipitation monitoring and early warning of associated hazards. In addition, MVK excelled in characterizing event duration, intensity, and peak magnitude within the GSMaP system, revealing the possible effectiveness of gauge-free satellite retrieval algorithms. Subregion analysis using the K-means clustering algorithm demonstrated the integrated influence of multiple factors on the performance of the SPPs, also with region-dependent sensitivity to a specific factor. The findings obtained from this study could provide new insights into the practical application and possible further enhancement of the GPM SPPs."

 This study comprehensively evaluates the performance of ERA5 and MERRA-2 reanalysis datasets in representing key meteorological parameters consisting of air temperature, mean sea level pressure, and relative humidity across Türkiye between 2010 and 2023. By comparing reanalysis data to observations from 116 meteorological stations, the analysis provides critical insights into their spatial and seasonal accuracy, revealing notable strengths and limitations. The findings confirm that ERA5 consistently outperforms MERRA-2 across all three parameters, exhibiting higher determination coefficients (R2), lower root mean square errors (RMSE), and reduced mean bias errors (MBE), particularly for air temperature and relative humidity. ERA5 demonstrated superior performance in temperature representation, with seasonal R2 values ranging from 0.85 to 0.91, while MERRA-2 exhibited lower performance, ranging from 0.75 to 0.86. Similarly, ERA5 outperformed MERRA-2 in relative humidity estimation, achieving R2 values between 0.50 and 0.75, compared to MERRA-2's lower range of 0.33 to 0.62. Both datasets performed comparably for mean sea level pressure; however, ERA5 achieved slightly lower RMSE and MBE values, particularly in winter and regions with complex topography, where MERRA-2 systematically underestimated pressure. The seasonal and spatial analyses highlight ERA5's finer spatial resolution and enable a more accurate representation of meteorological variability, particularly in topographically complex and coastal regions. Its reduced systematic biases and improved accuracy in transitional seasons underscore its suitability for high-resolution applications, such as urban climate modeling, air quality research, and hydrological simulations. Conversely, MERRA-2, with its coarser grid and pronounced biases in colder months, remains suitable for broader-scale climatological studies but may require bias correction for localized applications."
