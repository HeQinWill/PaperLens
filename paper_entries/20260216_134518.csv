Previous studies have shown that techniques using hydrated electrons can effectively degrade these compounds. However, such reactions typically necessitate alkaline and anaerobic conditions or involve the use of surfactants. Herein, we introduced a novel approach that utilized indole as the monomer molecule for in situ polymerization within the clay interlayer to generate polyindole. In the system, polyindole could both serve as the precursor to provide hydrated electrons and, with its own organic polymer structure, create a hydrophobic phase to effectively adsorb perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Without the need for surfactants, the “adsorption-concentration-reaction” strategy for PFOA could be realized. At the same time, as the degradation of PFOA by the generated hydrated electrons occurred mainly within the clay layers, the confinement effect could be harnessed to reduce the mass transfer of O2 and H+ from the solution to the layers. It thereby weakened the quenching of hydrated electrons and enhanced their utilization efficiency. Therefore, this study represents a novel attempt to use in situ polymerization for constructing a polyindole-based nanocomposite, offering a sophisticated solution for degradation of PFASs."
10.1021/acs.est.5c15686,True,Environmental Science & Technology,该论文研究了棕色碳（BrC）的组成和理化性质对城市PM2.5中单线态氧和有机三重态激发态的产生产生了哪些影响，这与大气环境遥感技术中的空气质量监测和大气成分分析密切相关。,"['brown carbon', 'PM2.5', 'singlet oxygen']",Yuting Lyu;Yitao Li;Ruihan Ma;Tianye Zhou;Nadine Borduas-Dedekind;Theodora Nah,Connecting Brown Carbon Composition and Physicochemical Properties of Aqueous Urban PM2.5 to their Photosensitized Production of Singlet Oxygen and Organic Triplet Excited States,"Oxidants, including singlet oxygen (1O2*) and organic triplet excited states (3C*) formed from the photoexcitation of brown carbon (BrC), drive many chemical processes in atmospheric waters. However, due to the chemical complexity of atmospheric BrC, many questions remain about the specific BrC chromophores and physicochemical properties that primarily control 1O2* and 3C* production. In this study, we present a framework for apportioning photosensitizers and predicting the production of 1O2* and 3C* based on measurable physicochemical properties of BrC. This is achieved by combining photochemical experiments with absorbance and fluorescence measurements and statistical modeling of a year-long data set of PM2.5 extracts from Hong Kong SAR, China. Parallel Factor and Non-negative Matrix Factorization analyses of the fluorescence data revealed that highly oxygenated organic aerosols were the main contributors to 1O2* production, whereas less oxygenated organic aerosols were the main contributors to 3C* production. Next, we developed Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Multiple Linear Regression models that successfully predicted 1O2* and 3C* steady-state concentrations ([1O2*]ss and [3C*]ss) and quantum yields ( ΦO2*1 and Φ3C*) from standard optical measurements. These models revealed that while [1O2*]ss and [3C*]ss depended on parameters that reflected the quantities of BrC chromophores, ΦO2*1 and Φ3C* were influenced by the specific types (i.e., quality) of BrC chromophores present. Overall, this combined approach provides a powerful tool for identifying key BrC chromophore components and specific physicochemical properties that drive 1O2* and 3C* production."

As climate change intensifies, compound dry-hot events (CDHEs) are projected to exert growing pressure on lake oxygen dynamics, yet their role in driving deoxygenation remains unclear. Using multisource data sets and machine learning, we analyzed surface dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics and the percent saturation (DO%sat) in 11,571 Chinese lakes from 2000 to 2020, quantified CDHE impacts, and projected future trajectories under Shared Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) scenarios. We found widespread and continuous deoxygenation in China, with 52.2% of lakes showing significant declines (average of −0.12 mg/L/decade and −1.28%/decade for DO and DO%sat, respectively), most pronounced on the Tibetan Plateau and Mongolian Lakes. Intensifying CDHEs, particularly in arid or semiarid regions, increasingly amplified lake surface deoxygenation through their duration and severity. Projections indicate nationwide declines of DO (0.73–1.01 mg/L) and DO%sat (4.08–10.73%) by 2099 under all SSP scenarios, with Tibetan Plateau lakes showing the most severe deoxygenation. From a long-term perspective, air temperature and precipitation dominate the climatic drivers of deoxygenation for low-elevation plain lakes, while wind speed and air pressure are key for high-altitude and semiarid region lakes. Our findings highlight the urgency of incorporating climate extremes into lake management water-quality planning to safeguard freshwater resources."

We calculate emissions for 17 fire-relevant compounds. Surface emissions exceeded those of clean controls, and emissions from a windowsill in a room without a PAC were ∼15× and ∼2× higher for benzene and toluene, respectively, than rates reported in the literature for comparable materials unaffected by smoke/soot. Particle filters installed in PACs at the start of the fire emitted aromatics at rates comparable to those reported in a study where filters operated for 200 days in a city. Emissions from activated carbon filters exceeded those of the particle filters tested as part of the present study by >3×. A windowsill in a room without a PAC off-gassed more VOC mass than a windowsill in a room with a PAC, suggesting that air cleaners can reduce surface contamination. Modeling with benzene emission rates from impacted surfaces in a hypothetical indoor space resulted in a predicted indoor concentration ∼6× greater than outdoors. This study shows surfaces act as persistent VOC sources following WUI fires and indicates indoor surfaces affect exposure during and after fire events."

Higgins;Agniv Sengupta;Luca Delle Monache,Physics‐Based Versus AI Weather Prediction Models: A Comparative Performance Assessment of Atmospheric River Prediction,"Machine learning (ML) poses a potential paradigm shift in weather forecasting, but critical questions arise regarding its ability to predict high‐impact weather events. This study evaluates five state‐of‐the‐art ML models—Aurora, GraphCast, PanguWeather, FourCastNetV2, FourCastNet—in forecasting U.S. West Coast atmospheric rivers (ARs), compared to the high‐performing physics‐based European Center for Medium‐Range Weather Forecasts' high‐resolution system (HRES) model. Analysis of 152 daily forecast cycles (November 2023–March 2024) reveals significant performance differences between the systems. While ML models often show better variable‐specific root mean square error (RMSE), HRES has superior AR detection skill for the first four forecast days. PanguWeather matches HRES skill beyond day four; other ML models lag slightly. Aurora consistently exhibits the lowest AR detection performance, despite strong variable‐specific RMSE metrics, highlighting a disconnect between RMSE performance and its ability to predict AR events. These findings underscore the need for phenomenon‐specific metrics for ML‐based numerical weather prediction model assessment and operational implementation."

Parker,Tropical TCV as a Process Diagnostic: Connecting Probability to Processes in km–Scale Models Via Moisture Budget Statistics,"Observations show a bimodal frequency distribution in total column vapor (TCV) over tropical oceans, with convective rainfall predominantly produced on the moist side of the frequency minimum between two modal peaks. Here we show a km–scale model of the tropics with explicit convection produces a bimodal TCV distribution, whereas the same model with parameterized convection does not. The parameterized model also fails to realistically confine rainfall to a moist mode. Using concepts from statistical mechanics we relate TCV frequency and tendency, and isolate process contributions to tendency in TCV phase‐space. Where bimodality is lacking, we find an incorrect relationship between moisture flux convergence and TCV in environments with little or no rainfall. The resulting lack of a strong gradient in TCV tendency with respect to TCV is inconsistent with that expected to maintain a TCV frequency minimum. Our results demonstrate value in the TCV distribution as a process diagnostic."

While sediment‐water interactions are widely recognized, quantitative understanding of sediment legacy effects remains limited. To address this gap, we developed a two‐layer sediment model integrated with a physical‐biogeochemical framework for the Pearl River Estuary to elucidate how legacy organic matter perpetuates hypoxia via benthic‐pelagic coupling. Results show that sediment oxygen consumption accounts for 44% of total oxygen depletion in low‐oxygen zones, increasing to 81% in near‐bottom waters. This oxygen demand is significantly supported by legacy organic matter, without which would reduce primary production by 68% and the hypoxic area by 53%. Furthermore, we demonstrate that sediment legacy effects amplify hypoxia sensitivity to nutrient loading and may lead to hysteresis and regime shifts if unaddressed. Therefore, effective hypoxia mitigation requires management strategies tailored to system‐specific sediment‐water coupling dynamics."

We use 2‐D thermo‐mechanical numerical experiments, coupling hydrous mantle melting with parameterized crustal accretion, to explore controls on magmatic lag: the delay between continental crustal break‐up and steady oceanic crustal accretion. Modeling results show that: (a) buoyant rise of subcontinental lithosphere up and toward the rift zone, which inhibits asthenosphere upwelling and decompression melting; (b) a weak mid‐lithospheric discontinuity lengthens magmatic lag by ∼15 Myr and widens the COT by >200 km; (c) the lateral distance over thick, depleted mantle influences rift magmatism is governed by lithospheric density and rheology; and (d) magmatic lag scales linearly with the density contrast between lithospheric mantle and asthenospheric mantle. Model outputs match observed COT widths from the central South Atlantic and conjugate Australia–Antarctica margins, linking inherited lithospheric mantle heterogeneity to melt starvation, mantle exhumation, and rifted‐margin architecture."

However, the role of vertical land motion (VLM)—particularly land subsidence—in shaping this coastal exposure remains poorly quantified. Here we present the first assessment of VLM across India's coastal zone, using 8 years of Sentinel‐1 Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) time series data (2016–2024). This comprehensive data set reveals widespread subsidence with several notable hotspots: Ahmedabad, Chennai, Amaravathi, Kochi, Kakinada, and Kolkata. The five major deltas along the east coast display extensive subsidence up to 20 mm/yr. Over 8.5 million residents live in coastal areas experiencing subsidence greater than 5 mm/yr. Our findings suggest that coastal subsidence in India is more extensive than previously recognized and poses a significant challenge for long‐term land‐use planning in coastal zones."

Based on adiabatic fraction (AF), such clouds can be divided into three regions: the adiabatic core, the skin (the diluted cloud edge), and the periphery, which lies between them, in terms of AF values. Despite its large volume and mass, the periphery is still poorly understood. This study shows that the periphery is equally supplied by air coming from the core and skin. However, periphery air flows mainly toward the skin, with limited transport into the core. The skin contributes to the periphery primarily through transport associated with the toroidal vortex. Each zone also exhibits distinct microphysical properties, including differences in droplet mean radius, variance, and relative dispersion."

Resolution analysis indicates a strong vertical smearing that biases estimates of the apparent lithospheric thickness, limiting the ability to discriminate between the half space and plate cooling models. Laterally, a pattern of anomalous bands in seismic velocity aligned with fracture zones points to additional lateral complexities in the lithosphere, complicating simple age‐trend analyses."

Using the state‐of‐the‐art aerosol‐climate model ECHAM6.3‐HAM2.3‐SALSA2.0: 10Be, we assess the impacts of three major volcanic eruptions: Agung (1963), El Chichón (1982) and Pinatubo (1991). All eruptions enhance stratospheric 10Be sedimentation, increasing atmospheric 10Be below the injection altitude for several months, followed by stratospheric 10Be depletion that takes years to recover. Increases in tropospheric 10Be and deposition coincide with periods of strong stratosphere–troposphere exchange. Aerosol‐induced sedimentation significantly enhances polar 10Be deposition subsequent to the Pinatubo and El Chichón eruptions but plays a limited role after the Agung eruption. Sensitivity experiments reveal that higher SO2 injections generally lead to nonlinear increases in global 10Be deposition. These results underscore the need to account for volcanic influences when interpreting and modeling polar 10Be records following major eruptions."

Krehbiel,The Microphysical Structure of Thunderstorms in the Horizontal Development of Lightning,"The shape of lightning channels reflects nature's intricate craftsmanship, shaped by intracloud electric fields influenced by the microphysical structure of thunderstorms. While previous studies have focused primarily on the relationship between vertically stratified charge structures and vertical lightning development, the relationship between thunderstorm microphysics and the horizontal development of lightning remains unclear. This study uses three‐dimensional radiation source data from the Lightning Mapping Array at New Mexico's Langmuir Laboratory and KABX radar data to examine how the types, number concentrations, and spatial arrangement of hydrometeors influence the horizontal development of lightning within a certain range of altitudes. The WRF‐Electric model is employed to validate the observations. The results show that horizontal microphysical heterogeneity alters the evolution characteristics of lightning channels: branching and acceleration often occur at boundaries between different types of hydrometeors, in regions with high particle number concentrations, and near regions of vertical ice. Simulations further reveal that turbulence strongly influences the distribution of hydrometeors and that the type of hydrometeor has a greater effect on the electric field variation than does the number concentration. This study establishes a clear correspondence between thunderstorm microphysics and the horizontal development of lightning, and clarifies how microphysical structure affects lightning development."

In recent years, the increasing frequency of extreme DSs has underscored the urgent need to better understand their historical characteristics and dominant drivers. Here, we examined a 64‐year observational record (1961–2024) of springtime DS in China, emphasizing the spatiotemporal variations of DS across different intensities. A significant nationwide decrease in the frequency of DSs has been observed, primarily attributed to a reduction in lower‐intensity (ODS; ordinary DS) events. The proportion of severe and extreme dust storms (SEDS) has significantly increased since the early 2000s, suggesting a transition toward fewer but more intense occurrences. Using machine learning with interpretable methods, we show that ODS are primarily driven by synoptic‐scale dynamics, whereas SEDS are more sensitive to land‐surface deficits. SEDS frequency increases sharply when evaporation reaches extremely low values (<50 mm) and top‐layer soil temperature exhibits rapid warming (exceeding 290 K), These conditions indicate a precipitation‐limited surface state, with strong winds serving as the final trigger for SEDS. The increases in SEDS since 1990 in northwestern China coincide with intensifying spring drought and strengthening wind extremes, while in North China, despite only modest increases in wind speed, persistent surface drying has sustained elevated SEDS activity. In contrast, the eastern Tibetan Plateau exhibits a clear decline, consistent with progressive wetting and a notable weakening of near‐surface winds. Our findings identify early‐warning predictors that can improve the interpretation and development of future dust‐storm projections under climate change."

Here, authors discover a histidine-rich coiled coil protein in mussel glue that challenges the prevailing understanding of how mussel stick tight, with the findings relevant to the design of improved glues. 
 Challenging to engineer in synthetic glues, wet adhesion is critical for many technical and biomedical applications. Mussels, however, have evolved underwater glues that adhere effectively onto slippery seashore surfaces. Past research on mussel adhesion highlights the importance of the post-translationally modified amino acid 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (DOPA), found in abundance in mussel glue proteins. Yet, DOPA alone is insufficient to match native adhesion in synthetic mimics. Here, we provide evidence that a previously uncharacterized histidine-rich protein (mefp-12) plays a crucial role in the formation, curing, and performance of mussel glue. Biochemical analysis localizes mefp-12 within vesicles of the mussel glue secretory glands, while AI-assisted modeling of its sequence predicts Zn-stabilized coiled coil conformation and several domains resembling zinc-finger motifs. In vitro investigation of a His-rich α-helical peptide from mefp-12 shows Zn- and pH-dependent liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), coalescence, and spreading over the substrate. Exposure to seawater pH induces subsequent self-organization of the fluid condensates into solid nanoporous networks resembling the structure of the native mussel glue. Based on these findings we gain a deeper mechanistic understanding of mussel glue formation and function that challenges the dominant DOPA-centric paradigm, providing inspiration for design of bio-inspired wet adhesives. Mussels are masters of sticking on wet surfaces. Here, authors discover a histidine-rich coiled coil protein in mussel glue that challenges the prevailing understanding of how mussel stick tight, with the findings relevant to the design of improved glues."

Here, authors develop a nano-platform that uses cerium ions to disrupt bacterial energy production and efflux pumps, restoring carbenicillin’s efficacy against drug-resistant P. aeruginosa. 
 The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance is a critical global health challenge that renders conventional antibiotics ineffective. Developing innovative strategies to resensitize drug-resistant pathogens to existing antibiotics represents a promising therapeutic approach. Here, we present a biomimetic nanoplatform (Ce-Car@EV NPs) through the rational integration of ginger-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) and a pH-responsive cerium-carbenicillin coordination nanoparticles (Ce-Car NCPs). This design enables prolonged circulation and targeted degradation in acidic infection sites, releasing Ce4+ ions and carbenicillin. The released Ce4+ ions penetrate the bacterial cells, where they disrupt ATP synthesis, impede oxidative phosphorylation, and inhibit the activity of efflux pump. By depleting ATP, blocking efflux pumps, and thereby reversing bacterial resistance, Ce4+ ions act as a potent adjuvant to carbenicillin. Here we show that this strategy effectively restores carbenicillin efficacy against drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa both in vitro and in vivo, establishing a therapeutic strategy leveraging metallic adjuvants to counteract antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial resistance is a growing concern in modern medicine.

 Understanding the relationship between vegetation productivity and soil accretion is critical for assessing the resilience of deltaic wetlands to relative sea-level rise. This study integrates airborne imaging spectroscopy from NASA's AVIRIS-NG sensor with field measurements from the Delta-X campaign to quantify herbaceous vegetation contributions to vertical accretion processes in the Mississippi River Delta's coastal wetlands. We developed imaging spectroscopy–based products for live above- and belowground carbon (AGC, BGC), and aboveground necromass (AGN; or non-photosynthetic vegetation), the latter being derived using a novel combination of spectral unmixing and Random Forest regression. These vegetation maps were evaluated alongside in situ soil accretion measurements—including surface sediment accretion, soil bulk density, organic matter content, and soil organic carbon density—derived from feldspar marker horizons. These data were sampled concurrently with airborne campaigns conducted in April and August 2021 to coincide with the early- and peak-biomass season conditions. While vegetation metrics explained a limited fraction of variability in total vertical accretion, AGC, AGN, and BGC together accounted for a substantial portion of the variance in soil bulk density and organic carbon density, indicating that vegetation-driven organic matter inputs exert a stronger control on soil mass and carbon storage than on short-term elevation gain. These results demonstrate that airborne imaging spectroscopy can resolve distinct vegetation pools that differentially influence wetland soil properties, providing new insight into the coupled vegetation–soil processes underpinning blue carbon dynamics. This highlights imaging spectroscopy's value for advancing landscape-scale assessments of wetland resilience and informing management strategies in sediment-deprived coastal basins."

 Post-fire vegetation recovery in boreal forests is shaped by the complex interactions among burn severity, ecological conditions, and climatic factors. Traditional pixel-based assessments often overlook the spatial configuration and shape of burned areas, potentially underestimating heterogeneity and misrepresenting recovery dynamics. Here, we developed a patch-level framework to quantify recovery time for the 2003 Siberian wildfire, examining the combined effects of patch morphology, burn severity, climatic factors, and topography. By 2023, 72.7% of burned patches had recovered, with an average recovery time of 12.2 years. Recovery was fastest in smaller, more compact patches, whereas larger and elongated patches recovered more slowly. Within patches, recovery time increased from edges toward interiors, indicating consistent edge-to-interior gradients. Climatic factors, particularly higher temperature and radiation, slowed recovery, whereas greater precipitation and soil moisture accelerated it. Burn severity also delayed regeneration, while topographic influences were minor in this low-relief landscape. These results demonstrate that patch morphology and climate jointly shape post-fire recovery and emphasize the importance of incorporating spatial configuration into forest resilience assessments and restoration planning. The patch-based framework provides a scalable, ecologically realistic approach applicable to fire-prone ecosystems worldwide."

 Estuarine fronts represent critical submesoscale oceanographic phenomena that govern material transport, pollutant dispersion, and ecosystem dynamics in coastal environments. In this study, we developed a comprehensive remote sensing framework for monitoring suspended sediment fronts and plume fronts in the Yangtze River Estuary–Hangzhou Bay transition zone, a region of exceptional ecological and economic significance. Leveraging the Google Earth Engine cloud computing platform, we developed an integrated multi-algorithm approach that combines spectral index enhancement, automated thresholding, clustering analysis, and edge detection techniques for high-precision front feature extraction from Landsat-8 and Sentinel-2 imagery spanning 2013–2024. Validation against high-resolution unmanned aerial vehicle imagery yielded root mean square errors (RMSE) of 7.3–13.4 m and discrete Fréchet distances of 23.5–29.6 m, confirming robust algorithmic performance with decameter-level accuracy suitable for submesoscale front detection. Our analysis revealed the occurrence of pronounced spatiotemporal variability in front distributions: suspended sediment fronts exhibit distinct seasonal patterns with nearshore concentration (0–2 km) and peak occurrence around Nanhui Shoal, while plume fronts demonstrate greater offshore extension (2–5 km). Mechanistic analysis revealed that tidal forcing is the primary factor controlling the front dynamics, with suspended sediment fronts favoring neap tide conditions and plume fronts peaking during spring tide floods. These findings advance the fundamental understanding of estuarine front dynamics and provide quantitative frameworks for coastal environmental management and sustainable development strategies."

 Rapid urbanization necessitates accurate 3D building data for effective urban planning and analysis. Building height provides critical vertical information reflecting urban morphology, land use intensity, and energy demand. However, high-resolution large-scale 3D datasets remain limited, particularly in the Global South, due to the high cost and complexity of traditional methods. Although machine learning approaches have been widely explored, they often underperform in dense urban areas and tend to underestimate tall buildings due to limited training data and generalizability. In this study, we propose a novel framework for large-scale building height estimation using only free remote sensing data. Leveraging 0.5 m resolution open-access satellite imagery and ICESat-2 photons, we construct an accurate parallel projection model for each image. It enables the generation of dense height points via triangulation across image pairs without additional geometric parameters. The height points are then integrated with 2D building footprints to reconstruct building height maps. Validation results of the full urban area in Nairobi, achieving a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.338 m, demonstrated the feasibility of our framework. The method also exhibits strong temporal consistency, with a maximum mean deviation of only 1.93 m across multi-temporal height maps. Experiment results in the three additional Global South cities (Medellín, Salvador and Jakarta), achieving mean absolute errors (MAE) of 3.867 m, 3.642 m, and 2.484 m, respectively, further confirmed the transferability of our framework. These results highlight our framework’s capability to deliver low-cost, accurate, and high-resolution 3D urban reconstruction, particularly in resource-constrained cities, providing a scalable tool for urban analysis, planning, and policy support."

 The steep eastern slope of the Tibetan Plateau (ESTP) is a key area for the construction of the Sichuan–Tibet Railway. Understanding the diurnal variation of summer precipitation is essential for both construction and operational safety. Using hourly CLDAS-V2.0 precipitation data from the National Meteorological Information Center for 2016–2021, this study examines the diurnal characteristics of summer precipitation over the steep ESTP. In combination with circulation classification, the underlying causes of this diurnal variation are also investigated from the perspective of regional precipitation events (RPEs). Results reveal a pronounced unimodal diurnal variation of precipitation over the steep ESTP, with a marked east–west contrast across 102°E in peak timing. The peak occurs near 18 local solar time (LST) in the western region (west of 102°E), whereas it shifts to around 23 LST in the eastern region (east of 102°E). The eastward RPEs, characterized by a west–east migration of the precipitation center, dominate the east–west peak-timing difference. Eastward RPEs can be further classified into two circulation types: a trough-dominated type (about 70%) and a western Pacific subtropical high type (about 30%). The east–west difference in precipitation peak timing arises from the temporal offset between moisture convergence and ascent, with anomalous ascent dominating under the trough regime and anomalous moisture convergence dominating under the subtropical high regime. These findings enhance understanding of diurnal precipitation over complex terrain and offer implications for hydrological risk assessment and railway planning."

 Coastal regions of India are characterized by rapidly evolving convective systems driven by complex land–sea interactions and orography, often producing high rainfall and intense thunderstorms. This study provides the first multi-region evaluation of three double-moment microphysics schemes (Thompson, Morrison, and WDM6) for pre-monsoon convective rainfall over distinct coastal climatic zones of India: Kerala, Odisha, and West Bengal. Using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, 45 simulations were performed for 15 rainfall events (2012–2024), with model outputs validated against multi-satellite observations (Kalpana, INSAT-3D, GPM) and ERA5 reanalysis. The assessment combined rainfall intensity, cloud-top evolution, vertically integrated moisture convergence (VIMC), and a group of thermodynamic stability indices (K Index, KI; Humidity Index, HI; Total Precipitable Water, TPW; and Total Totals Index, TTI), with detailed diagnostics for three recent high-impact events per region. Results reveal notable regional differences in scheme performance: Thompson shows optimal over Kerala (correlation: 0.70–0.76), Morrison over Odisha (0.67–0.78), and WDM6 over West Bengal (0.61–0.68). Beyond these local optima, WDM6 most consistently reproduces the observed regional differences in rainfall and convective parameters, while Morrison shows comparable rainfall skill but systematically overestimates instability. These findings highlight the critical need for region-specific microphysics tuning in convective rainfall forecasting, particularly in topographically complex coastal environments."

 Ongoing global climate change has yielded a myriad of catastrophic weather hazards, including extreme heat, drought, and severe fire weather conditions across global dryland environments. A massive wildfire ignited across the Texas Panhandle between 27 and 28 Feb 2024 (i.e., Smokehouse Creek Fire, the second largest wildfire in the US history), which consumed over 1,000,000 ha of land and resulted in an overall loss of greater than >$1 billion. Understanding aerosol mixing processes and the associated kinematics near the surface and within the nocturnal boundary layer (NBL) during such wildfire events is crucial for various applications, including predicting and monitoring environmental air quality (AQ), weather forecasting and transport and dispersion modeling. This study provides, for the first time, an empirical evidence of how a nocturnal cold front amplified the wildfire impact on AQ at a site located 250 km downwind of the second largest US wildfire, yielding hazardous concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5–250 μg m−3). Using a combination of lidar-derived aerosol backscatter, vertical velocity and horizontal wind profiles, 10 m-tower observations of meteorological parameters, radiosonde-derived thermodynamics, and near-surface PM2.5 measurements, our analyses revealed that narrow and intense updrafts (i.e., vertical velocity of up to 5–10 m s−1) along the leading edge of a nocturnal cold front triggered the entrainment of an elevated smoke plume (∼1500-2000 m above ground) down to the surface via broader and weaker downdrafts (−0.5 to −2.0 m s−1). This helped explain the transport and vertical mixing pathway of the wildfire plume near ground and aloft. Results reported enhance our understanding of NBL processes and provide critical insights for improving AQ forecasting and validating aerosol transport in dispersion models."
