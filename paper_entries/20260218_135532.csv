We tested this hypothesis using above-ground biomass trends from 2017 to 2024 across Spain, a region experiencing intensifying drought and extreme events as well as increasing wildfire pressure. Using statistical matching techniques that control for initial biomass conditions and climate exposure, we compared live biomass carbon conservation performance between PAs and non-PAs. PAs significantly outperformed non-PA counterparts, showing better live biomass carbon conservation in 70% of biomass-matched comparisons and maintaining this advantage in 59% of climate-controlled comparisons-representing a statistically significant 9% advantage over the null hypothesis. We find that most strict PAs (National Parks) have an enhanced effectiveness, showing better performance in carbon conservation in 85% of biomass-controlled and 68% of climate-controlled matches, respectively. This advantage demonstrates that protection status itself, not merely favorable location, can drive enhanced carbon conservation. Our results provide empirical support for PA expansion as an effective climate change mitigation strategy."

However, its radiative efficacy–defined here as globally averaged radiative forcing per unit of sulfur injection rate (SIR)–remains highly uncertain in model simulations due to complex particle size evolution and large variability in aerosol representation. In this study, we employ a state-of-the-art, size-resolved (sectional) advanced particle microphysics (APM) module within two global models (CESM2 and GEOS-Chem) to investigate the evolution and efficacy of stratospheric sulfate aerosols from both SO2 and accumulation mode sulfuric acid (AM-H2SO4) injection. Our comparison of SAI radiative efficacy based on various global models including the two APM-based (14 models in total for SO2 and 9 models for AM-H2SO4) shows a large spread, with lower and higher end values differing by a factor of ∼2.5–3. Our APM-based results for SO2 SAI efficacy, including its diminishing returns with increasing SIR, fall at the upper end of the inter-model spread. For AM-H2SO4 SAI, the APM-based models show significantly higher efficacy–by ∼50% to 200%–at lower SIR (⩽5 Tg(S) yr−1), followed by a steeper decrease in efficacy as SIR increases. Notably, the APM-based global model simulations show that AM-H2SO4 injections consistently exhibit higher efficacy than SO2 injections, yielding ∼55%–75% greater radiative forcing per Tg(S) yr−1 due to more favorable particle size distributions. Global sulfate burden increase, effective particle sizes, and particle size distributions based on different models are compared and possible reasons leading to different SAI efficacy are discussed. The new SAI efficacy findings, if confirmed in further studies and model intercomparisons, could have important implications for climate intervention strategies, cost-benefit analyses, and risk assessments."

These wind farms function by harvesting a part of the wind energy that is itself the main driver of upper-ocean mixing and near-surface circulation. It remains unclear what the local and regional impacts of offshore wind farm deployment could be on marine environments. Here we consider potential effects from future wind farm developments in the Baltic Sea, in particular quantifying the impacts on energy exchange across the air–sea interface. We use plans for future wind farm coverage as a basis to calculate turbine-modified surface winds, and implement these altered wind fields as forcing for a three dimensional ocean (and sea ice) model of the entire Baltic Sea. We run ten years of simulations and examine the mean anomaly across the ten years relative to a corresponding set of model runs with unaltered winds, focusing on energy exchange terms and on the mixed layer depth. Based on an idealized mixed layer energy budget, we identify two routes by which the wake effect alters vertical mixing in the upper ocean—mechanical wind work and buoyancy forcing—and ultimately show substantial reductions to mixed layer depth in the close vicinity of wind turbines. Our model outputs show that, despite far-reaching instantaneous wind-wakes, the time-averaged changes in winds and in upper ocean response are mostly limited to areas within a 10 km radius of the nearest wind turbine. This result suggests that even moderate changes to wind farm placement may considerably alter the local impact on the marine environment, highlighting the important role of careful spatial planning in regulating wind farm deployment."

While such events are projected to intensify and become more frequent, gaps remain in understanding which agrometeorological hazards are most strongly associated with yield anomalies and crop failures. Here, we use data from 1981–2016 to assess statistical associations between different hazard indices and yields of five major cereals (maize, millet, sorghum, rice and wheat) across SSA, combining national, subnational and gridded datasets. Drought- and heat-related indicators emerge as the dominant correlates of negative yield anomalies, with vapor pressure deficit (VPD) showing a consistent negative association across crops and scales. Yield anomalies in years classified as crop failures are more strongly linked to these hazards than overall interannual variability, indicating that severe yield losses are especially sensitive to agrometeorological extremes. Using interpretable machine-learning methods for maize and rice, two key staple cereals in SSA, we show that failure-year yield anomalies in maize are more strongly associated with drought-related indicators, whereas rice failures are more sensitive to temperature-related factors alongside drought metrics. Projections using combined Earth system and ensemble output of crop models reveal that under the high-emissions SSP585 scenario, both maize and rice-planting areas will face significant increases in heat and drought hazards by mid-century. Maize-growing regions are projected to experience a 1.8 °C rise in maximum temperature and a 0.14 kPa increase in VPD, while rice-growing areas may see a 1.5 °C rise in maximum temperature, a 15% increase in days above 35 °C, and a 0.13 kPa rise in VPD. These projected changes underscore the need for targeted risk management, improved agronomic practices and robust early warning systems to enhance the resilience of SSA’s agricultural sector in a warming climate."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae41d0,False,Environmental Research Letters,该论文主要关注交通政策和车辆排放，而不是大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['carbon emissions', 'GHG emissions', 'electric vehicle']",Jonn Axsen;Chandan Bhardwaj,Policy can downsize passenger vehicles and cut climate emissions,"The growing global market share of sport utility vehicles and other light-duty trucks is increasing the carbon and energy intensity of new passenger vehicles—cancelling out some of the benefits of efficiency improvements including electrification. Existing climate regulations can inadvertently support this trend, notably the attribute-based vehicle emissions standards (VES) that have less stringent requirements for larger vehicles. We utilize a model of demand and supply interactions to simulate a VES that is neutral regarding vehicle class and size, as well as a truck purchase tax and electric vehicle efficiency standard. Relative to the attribute-based version, a neutral VES can induce modest but additive reductions in GHG emissions and new vehicle mass. Additional instruments can further reduce vehicle emissions and size, and reduce battery capacity among electric vehicles. In short, careful policy design can help to reduce vehicle upsizing trends while contributing to GHG mitigation."

Forest harvesting fundamentally alters the physical structure and composition of forests, with consequences for climate regulation services. It can impact the land surface temperature (LST) both diurnally and seasonally, but the net LST impact of historical forest harvesting activities in Europe is as yet unknown. This study integrates satellite-derived data for LSTs and forest harvesting for the period 2004–2023 to unravel spatial and temporal patterns of the surface temperature response to harvesting disturbances in Europe. We find a consistent diurnal asymmetry: harvesting induces daytime warming alongside nighttime cooling across all seasons and forest types. However, the magnitude, net effect, and temporal evolution have strong heterogeneity. Regionally, daytime warming dominates in Southern Europe (+0.075 ± 0.007 °C, mean ± standard error; +0.719 °C at the 90th percentile), peaking in the summer (+0.103 ± 0.010 °C; +0.823 °C), while Eastern Europe shows the strongest annual nighttime cooling (−0.060 ± 0.005 °C; −0.937 °C). The response is weaker in Western Europe. Seasonally, net daily cooling prevails in the spring, whereas net warming dominates in the summer. The forest composition modulates the response: needleleaf forests show the strongest diurnal contrast, broadleaf forests exhibit the weakest daytime signal, and mixed forests display spring daytime cooling. After harvesting, most regions transition from initial postharvest warming toward longer-term cooling or neutrality after one or two decades, with the postharvest pattern varying regionally and by forest type. Overall, this study elucidates strong spatiotemporal variations in net microclimate responses to forest harvesting across Europe, driven by geography, seasonality, and forest composition. By explicitly characterizing how forest harvesting alters surface temperature across space and time, these findings contribute to improved region-specific forest management strategies that can better balance timber production with climate regulation and biodiversity conservation under changing environmental conditions."

To parse seasonal operational signatures, we compare the dynamics of natural lake and reservoir systems across North America using Surface Water and Ocean Topography (SWOT) satellite observations and derived discharge estimates. Overall, reservoirs and their adjacent river reaches exhibit significantly greater variability (in standard deviation) than their natural counterparts across almost all SWOT observed (e.g. water surface elevation) and inferred (e.g. discharge) variables. Natural lakes show strong same-day correlations between inflow and outflow discharge (median Spearman R = 0.8), whereas 76% of reservoirs exhibit maximum correlation when outflow is lagged, suggesting operations buffer seasonal flow variability. Our findings indicate operations not only affect reservoir dynamics themselves but also have upstream and downstream consequences, which, when integrated into models, will offer more realistic hydrologic conditions."
10.5194/acp-26-2531-2026,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,"该论文研究的是高空大气（mesopause）区域的温度周期性波动，涉及行星波（planetary waves）和旋转温度（OH*(3,1) rotational temperatures），这些都是大气环境遥感技术中的关键观测内容，与空气质量监测、大气成分分析等领域密切相关。","['mesopause', 'planetary waves', 'OH*(3,1) rotational temperatures']",Christoph Kalicinsky;Robert Reisch;Peter Knieling,Ground-based observations of periodic  temperature fluctuations in the mesopause  region with periods longer than 2 d,"Planetary waves are important for driving large scale circulations. We observed planetary waves in a ground-based data set spanning more than 30 years. The waves can be assigned to expected waves due to their periods. The wave activity is strongest in winter for waves with periods longer than 20 days and shows maxima around equinoxes for periods below 20 d. The long-term behaviour shows a quasi-20 year oscillation of the wave activity with respect to the magnitude of the wave amplitudes. 
 We analysed more than 30 years (1988–2021) of OH*(3,1) rotational temperatures observed from Wuppertal, Germany, with respect to periodic fluctuations (2 to 60 d) using the Lomb-Scargle periodogram. The main type of fluctuation observed in the last decades shows a period of about 28 d. Other periods which are frequently found in the observations lie in the period ranges around 2, 5 to 6, 8 to 12 d, and around 15 d and can likely be assigned to the quasi-2-day, the quasi-5-day, the quasi-10-day, and the quasi-16-day wave, respectively.The occurrence frequency of the waves is typically higher in winter time than in summer time because of the different wave filtering in summer and winter. This winter to summer difference holds for waves with longer periods, but it breaks off in the case of shorter periods below about 20 d. The occurrence frequency of these waves with periods below 20 d exhibit two smaller maxima around the equinoxes. A further division of these observations shows that waves with periods below 10 d account for the majority of observations in the month April to September. Waves with periods between 10 and 20 d are more equally observed throughout the year except for summer.The long-term behaviour of the wave activity indicates a quasi-bidecadal, which is likely driven by the amplitude of the waves."

The joint characterisation of ice particle size, shape, and optical response shows that these clouds reflect substantially more solar radiation than is typically represented in models. The observations provide an empirical basis for improving the physical realism of ice cloud optical properties in climate models. 
 Cirrus clouds play a critical role in the Earth's radiation budget, yet their shortwave optical properties remain poorly constrained. In particular, the short wave asymmetry parameter (g), which governs the angular distribution of scattered light, is particularly sensitive to ice crystal morphology, a property that varies widely in cirrus. To provide observational constraints on g and to investigate its relationship with ice microphysical properties, we analysed simultaneous in situ measurements of particle morphology and angular light scattering using the Particle Habit Imaging and Polar Scattering (PHIPS) probe. The measurements were obtained during the Cirrus in High Latitudes (CIRRUS-HL) campaign in June and July 2021, sampling both mid-latitude and Arctic cirrus across a range of cloud types and temperatures down to −63 °C. Across both regions, we found consistently low median asymmetry parameters, with a campaign-wide median of 0.738. The observed g values were largely insensitive to variations in temperature, humidity, and crystal aspect ratio, and showed only minor differences between ice habits. In contrast, a systematic decrease in g with increasing particle size was identified, median g ranging from 0.777 for sub-30 µm particles in mid-latitude cirrus to minimum values of 0.719 and 0.713 for 175 µm particles in mid-latitude and Arctic cirrus, respectively. The measured values are substantially lower than those commonly used in current radiative transfer schemes, suggesting that the shortwave warming effect of cirrus clouds may be overestimated in many climate models. These results provide improved observational constraints for the representation of ice cloud optical properties and support efforts to reduce uncertainties in cirrus cloud radiative forcing."

C. Prévost;Leighton A. Regayre;Jill S. Johnson;Doug McNeall;Sean Milton;Kenneth S. Carslaw,Detection of potential structural deficiencies in a global aerosol model using a perturbed parameter ensemble,"Climate models rely on uncertain adjustable parameters. We tested millions of combinations of these inputs to see how well the model matches real-world data. We found that no single set of inputs can match several observations at the same time, which suggests that the issue lies in the model itself. We developed a method to detect these conflicts and trace them back trace them to their source. The aim is to help modellers target improvements that reduce uncertainty in climate projections. 
 Understanding and reducing uncertainty in model-based estimates of aerosol radiative forcing is crucial for improving climate projections. A key challenge is that differences between model output and observations can stem from uncertainties in input parameters (parametric uncertainty) or from deficiencies in model code and configuration (structural uncertainty), and these two causes are difficult to distinguish. Structural deficiencies limit efforts to reduce parametric uncertainty through observational constraint because they prevent models from being simultaneously consistent with multiple observations. However, no framework exists to detect structural deficiencies and assess their impact on parametric uncertainty. We propose a workflow to identify structural inconsistencies between observational constraints and diagnose potential structural deficiencies. Using a perturbed parameter ensemble, we sample uncertainty in aerosols, clouds, and radiation in the UK Earth System Model (UKESM), and evaluate model bias against in-situ observations of sulfate aerosol, sulfur dioxide, aerosol optical depth, and particle number concentration across Europe. Applying observational constraints reveals inconsistencies that no combination of the perturbed parameters can resolve. For example, sulfate concentrations in different regions cannot be matched simultaneously, and enforcing a compromise between regions reduces skill across most variables. Additional examples include an inter-region inconsistency in SO2 and an inter-variable inconsistency between aerosol optical depth and sulfate. By examining the parameter sets retained by constraints, we trace inconsistencies to the parameterisations that may cause them and propose targeted changes to address the underlying deficiency. This approach offers a pathway for evidence-based model development that supports more robust uncertainty reduction and improves climate projection skill."

 The Yinchuan metropolitan area in northwest China, situated between the Tengger and Ulan Buh Deserts, is influenced by both natural dust and anthropogenic emissions. However, the evolution of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and its interaction with ozone (O3) under the region's arid climate remain poorly understood. This study integrates decadal observations (2015–2025) with in-situ measurements using an Aerosol Chemical Speciation Monitor and a Vocus Proton Transfer Reaction Mass Spectrometry during summer 2025 to elucidate the changing PM2.5–O3 relationship and sources of organic aerosols. A pronounced shift was identified: Phase I (2015–2018) featured a rapid decline in PM2.5 accompanied by a sharp O3 increase, while Phase II (2019–2025) exhibited stabilized PM2.5 and plateaued O3, indicating reduced O3 sensitivity to particulate controls. The average non-refractory PM2.5 concentration (16.8 µg m−3) was significantly lower than in eastern Chinese megacities, with organics accounting for ∼ 60 %. Positive matrix factorization resolved three organic aerosol factors, revealing dominant secondary organic aerosols (SOA, ∼ 74 %) derived from prolonged photochemical aging. Volatile organic compound analysis showed that anthropogenic and biogenic precursors, including urban terpenes and aromatic oxidation products jointly contributed to SOA formation. Back-trajectory and potential source analyses indicated that Yinchuan's summer air masses were mainly locally recirculated, with limited influence from long-range transport. These results demonstrate a regional transition toward SOA-dominated fine particles and decoupled PM2.5–O3 dynamics under cleaner conditions, highlighting the need for integrated VOC and oxidant controls to mitigate co-occurring O3 and PM2.5 pollution in arid northwest China."

Krieger,Photochemical and ozone-induced aging significantly alter the viscosity of aqueous trans-aconitic  acid aerosol particles,"Organic aerosols undergo changes when exposed to oxidants like ozone or UV (ultraviolet) light. This study looks at how both aging processes affect particle properties, using trans-aconitic acid as a proxy for secondary organic aerosols. We found that exposure to UV light and ozone causes mass loss and changes viscosity significantly, up to 4 orders of magnitude. This suggests that aged particles may take much longer than untreated particles to equilibrate under dry conditions. 
 Aging processes of organic aerosols, including reactions with gas phase oxidants, such as ozone (O3), as well as photochemical reactions, can significantly alter their physicochemical properties. While previous research has examined how photochemical aging and ozonolysis affect the physicochemical properties of organic aerosols, our study investigates the combined effect of photolysis and ozonolysis. We use aqueous trans-aconitic acid as a proxy for secondary organic aerosol particles (SOA), selected for its ability to absorb UV light and for containing a C=C double bond that is susceptible to ozonolysis. We observe significant mass loss in single particles levitated in an electrodynamic balance when exposed to either O3 or UV light (375 nm), as well as to both aging processes simultaneously, resulting from fragmentation reactions followed by the volatilization of some of the products. Viscosity measurements at 17 % relative humidity revealed an increase of nearly 4 orders of magnitude after both UV exposure and combined UV and O3 exposure at 60 % mass loss. Interestingly, continued UV-aging beyond 60 % mass loss resulted in a viscosity decrease, whereas combined UV and O3 exposure led to a further viscosity increase. Hygroscopicity exhibited only a modest decline after 20 % mass loss during UV-aging and remained constant with further UV exposure; this reduction was less pronounced when UV-aging occurred in the presence of O3. Overall, our results indicate that the mixing times within accumulation mode SOA particles may increase from 4 s to 4 h after aging under dry boundary layer conditions."

To address this gap, we studied an extreme wind gust event in Beijing on 30 May 2024. We used seven radar wind profilers to track how this gust developed. It formed when cold northeasterly air clashed with warm southerly winds as the storm moved downhill. Evaporation of rain cooled the air, boosting downward air movement and wind strength. The turbulence transferring energy from small to large eddies intensify winds. 
 Extreme wind gusts pose substantial threats to human safety and infrastructure, yet inadequate pre-onset observational constraints result in large uncertainties and inaccuracies in nowcasting and forecast. To address this gap, we conduct an in-depth investigation of a record-breaking surface gust event (wind speed > 35 m s−1) that occurred in Beijing during the early afternoon of 30 May 2024. We analyze the event's dynamical characteristics utilizing a high-resolution meteorological mesonet, which includes seven radar wind profilers (RWPs), a meteorological tower, automated weather stations, radar and satellite data. Multi-source observational analyses reveal that multicellular storm developed ahead of a convergence line, where northeasterly cold outflows collided with environmental southerly winds during their downhill propagation. Evaporative cooling drove the generation of extreme winds, reinforced by downward momentum transport and pressure gradient forcing. After reaching the plain, two convective segments subsequently merged into a well-organized squall system embedded with a midlevel mesovortex with intense rear-inflow jet. Low-level frontogenesis and shearing deformation provided favorable conditions for sustaining mesoscale convection, which in turn fueled small-scale turbulent energy processes. Turbulent inverse energy cascades – energy transfer from small to large eddies – intensified markedly as wind speeds increased. This study offers valuable insights into the multiscale dynamical processes governing convective evolution – captured by the RWP mesonet – that would otherwise remain inaccessible via other ways. Importantly, these findings support the validation of numerical simulation outputs, refinement of boundary-layer parameterization schemes in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models, and ultimately the enhancement of forecast skill for convection-associated extreme gust events."

Moyer,A systematic comparison of ACE-FTS δD retrievals with airborne in situ sampling,"Water molecules comes in several varieties, of which H216O is the most common. These varieties behave differently enough under freezing to create strong changes in the ratio of heavy to light water molecules. Here we compare observations of these ratios from satellites and high-altitude airborne instruments. These observations provide information about how air reaches the upper parts of the atmosphere, so it is important to reconcile difference between different modes of observations. 
 The isotopic composition of water vapor in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere (UTLS) can be used to understand and constrain the budget and pathways of water transport into that region of the atmosphere. Measurements of the water isotopic composition help further understanding of the region's chemistry, radiative budget, and the sublimation and growth of polar stratospheric clouds and high-altitude cirrus, both of which are also important to stratospheric chemistry and Earth's radiation budget. Here we present the first intercomparison of water isotopic composition (δD) using in situ measurements from the ChiWIS, Harvard ICOS, and Hoxotope instruments and satellite retrievals from ACE-FTS. The in situ data come from the AVE-WIIF, TC4, CR-AVE, StratoClim, and ACCLIP field campaigns, and satellite retrievals of isotopic composition are derived from the ACE-FTS v5.2 data set. We find that in all campaign intervals, satellite retrievals above about 14 km altitude are depleted by up to 150 ‰ with respect to in situ measurements. This difference persists even in transit flights through stratospheric air in high-latitude regions, which should be relatively free of observational biases present in other regions. We also use in situ measurements from the ChiWIS instrument, which has flown in both the Asian Summer Monsoon (AM) and the North American Monsoon (NAM), to confirm the isotopic enhancement in δD observed in satellite retrievals above the NAM."

Seasonal variations were observed, with continental aerosols prevailing in winter, dust transport peaking in spring (altitudes of 2–8 km), and biomass-burning aerosols increasing during summer.Analysis of 408 aerosol layers using the NATALI (Neural network Aerosol Typing Algorithm based on LIdar data) identified complex aerosol mixtures, with 63 high-resolution cases revealing a predominance of “dust polluted” and “continental smoke” types.In the lower troposphere, the extinction-related Ångström exponent shows a narrow mono-modal distribution with the peak at 0.9, indicating predominantly medium-sized particles, whereas in the high troposphere it becomes bi-modal, reflecting alternating occurrences of small and large particles.Lidar ratio values have a distribution peak at around 48–49 sr in both altitude regions, but their spread is much wider in the lower troposphere – revealing frequent layers of highly absorbing aerosols – while lofted layers in the high troposphere exhibit a narrower range typical of moderately absorbing particles. Distinct differences between fresh and aged biomass-burning aerosols (smoke) are identified through their altitude, depolarization, Ångström exponent, and lidar-ratio characteristics, demonstrating microphysical change during transport.FLEXPART (FLEXible PARTicle dispersion model) retro-plume simulations provided insights into aerosol source regions and transport patterns showing contributions from local emissions, long-range transported desert dust, and biomass burning events from Europe and North America.These findings emphasize the persistent influence of regional pollution and transported aerosols on air quality and climate. The integration of ground-based remote sensing and advanced retrieval algorithms like NATALI provides a robust framework for aerosol characterization, enhancing climate models and air quality assessments."

Rollins;Jake Vallow;Mingxi Yang;Pete M. Edwards,An intercomparison of aircraft sulfur dioxide measurements in clean and polluted marine environments,"Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a key precursor to aerosol formation, particularly in remote marine environments, ultimately affecting cloud properties and climate. Accurate quantification of atmospheric SO2 is therefore crucial. This work compares a custom-built laser-based instrument to two commercial SO2 analysers during measurements from a large research aircraft. Our results show that this custom-built system offers greater sensitivity at time resolutions required for aircraft measurements. 
 The University of York's laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) instrument for measuring sulfur dioxide (SO2) was compared to a commercial pulsed fluorescence (PF) analyser and iodide chemical ionisation mass spectrometer (I−CIMS) aboard the UK FAAM research aircraft in both remote and ship-polluted marine environments. In high SO2 concentration plumes, the LIF instrument and PF analyser compared well, but LIF was the only instrument capable of SO2 measurements in the remote marine boundary layer due to its campaign limit of detection (LoD, 3σ) of 0.07 ppb at 10 s compared with 0.4 ppb for the PF analyser. Quantification of SO2 using I−CIMS was challenging due to a significant interference, but good signal correlation with the other instruments was observed in polluted air masses. A comparison of response time was also made, for which the I−CIMS and LIF instrument proved much faster than the PF analyser with 3 e-folding times of 0.6, 2 and 17 s respectively. This work demonstrates the importance of sensitive instrumentation like the LIF system for quantifying low concentrations of SO2, such as over remote marine environments, at the time resolutions required for a fast moving platform. This is particularly relevant now as a result of more stringent sulfur emission regulations for shipping, and likely more so in the future as anthropogenic SO2 concentrations continue to decline."

Here, we develop a new simple climate model to help study this. We reduce the number of inputs so that our model can be connected to a model of the human causes of climate change. This way, we can study the interaction between climate change and society, including climate impacts. Our model broadly agrees with historical observations. 
 The new global Feedback-based knowledge Repository for IntegrateD Assessments version 2.1 (FRIDAv2.1) Integrated Assessment Model (IAM) seeks to study the dynamics of the coupled human-Earth system. Connecting anthropogenic emissions to the resultant climate response is one part of the two-way feedback within this system, with the resultant climate impacts the other. This paper documents both the Climate Module within FRIDAv2.1, and the modified version separately simulated as a standalone simple climate model termed FRIDA-Clim version 1.0.1. This approach, based loosely on the existing FaIR simple climate model, simulates the key radiative forcings and the resultant temperature response, with process-based representations of the carbon cycle across the ocean, land, and atmosphere. When connected within the FRIDA IAM, it features deep connections to the other modules, being affected by processes such as water use for irrigation and land use change. In both uses, i.e. with the climate response interactively connected to the upstream human drivers and downstream climate impacts within the FRIDA IAM (coupled) and when ran separately as FRIDA-Clim driven by exogenous forcings (uncoupled), its climate drivers are simplified as compared to FaIR. This is to allow for this reduced set of key drivers to be interactively simulated within FRIDA, tightly coupling the evolution of the social and climate systems within the full model. Both the Climate Module and FRIDA-Clim are fully calibrated to accurately reproduce observations of key climate variables, with a systematic exploration of the uncertainty in the climate response. Together with the rest of the FRIDA model, this module is used to incorporate climate change systematically in the FRIDA System Dynamics IAM. As a standalone climate model, FRIDA-Clim comprises a simple climate model, enabling fast calculation of the global climate response to forcing; to explore this, the response of the model to both idealised CO2 emissions experiments and plausible future scenarios is also presented here. This setup will allow FRIDA-Clim to contribute to inter-model simple climate modelling initiatives, helping to explore the structural uncertainty in this modelling domain."

However, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity in molecular assembly mechanisms and redox characteristics of DOM remains unclear, hindering the mechanistic understanding of landfill stabilization. Here, we develop a novel molecular modeling approach integrated with an ecological model to elucidate DOM molecular chemical heterogeneity, redox properties, and assembly dynamics across 20 year landfill layers. Ar–OH, quinone, Ar–COO–, Ar–SH, and Ar–NH2 are key redox sites. The enhanced electron transfer capacity of DOM during stabilization arises from synergistic electronic–structural interactions throughout its entire molecular framework rather than isolated redox sites, including ortho-positioned –NH2 and –OH, electron-withdrawing –COO– and electron-donating –OH adjacent to –SH on benzene rings, and π–π stacking. Molecules containing multiple redox sites and featuring extensively π-conjugated systems play a crucial role in enhancing the long-term stability of landfills. Ecological models revealed that stochastic processes dominate DOM molecular dynamics (>90%), while deterministic processes slightly strengthened with the stabilization process (from 8.55% to 9.18%), governing its chemical and redox properties. This research advances molecular-level insights into waste stabilization processes that will inform refined waste management strategies to mitigate landfill ecological impacts."

Here, we compared the effects of pristine and field-aged polyethylene SNs through a year-long exposure experiment with tea plants (Camellia sinensis). Both pristine and aged SNs impaired soil and plant health, but the adverse effects of aged SNs were more pronounced. Pristine SNs decreased soil pH and increased chromium content, while aged SNs further depleted soil available nitrogen, promoted stronger rhizosphere microbial restructuring, and induced ferroptosis-like lipid peroxidation in roots, leading to deterioration of tea quality. Beneficial rhizosphere groups such as Proteobacteria and Rozellomycota declined, while denitrifiers bacteria and saprotrophic fungi were enriched, aggravating nitrogen loss. These shifts disrupted the soil-plant C–N balance, impairing tea plant nitrogen metabolism, which in turn suppressed glutamate and theanine biosynthesis, reallocating metabolism toward bitter ester-type catechins, and ultimately reduced tea flavor and quality. Our findings show that aged SNs act as emerging agricultural pollutants, disrupting nitrogen metabolism across soil-root-leaf scales. Recognizing aged SNs as part of global plastic pollution highlights their dual agronomic and environmental risks, underscoring the need for sustainable management and recycling in high-value agriculture."

Here, we selected ferrihydrite and goethite, the active components of iron plaques, to elucidate this selective filtration. We demonstrated that under equimolar concentrations, ferrihydrite and goethite exhibited higher affinity for arsenate, substituting 31.36% to 46.99% of preadsorbed phosphate across pH 4.0–8.0. Then, our Raman spectroscopy and DFT calculations revealed that phosphate formed labile monodentate and outer-sphere complexes via charge reorganization and electrostatic interactions, facilitating its ready remobilization into the rhizosphere. In contrast, arsenate formed stable bidentate-binuclear complexes through significant electron redistribution and stronger Fe–As bonds, leading to its strong sequestration on rice root iron plaques. Furthermore, our DFS measurements directly quantified that the binding free energy of arsenate to Fe oxyhydroxides was 14.57–27.01% higher than that of phosphate. Finally, we confirmed that Fe plaques enhanced phosphate uptake while lowering arsenate bioavailability through Fe–As coprecipitation using rice hydroponic experiments. These findings offer valuable insights into phosphorus and arsenic cycling in paddies and suggest potential strategies for efficiently optimizing phosphorus utilization and arsenic sequestration in wetland plants."

Here, using long-term in vitro and in vivo exposure models with environmentally relevant doses combined with multiomics analyses, we show that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exert antithetical effects in HCC and normal hepatocytes. Whereas PFAS promote ferroptosis in normal cells, chronic exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and its replacement 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) markedly enhances ferroptosis resistance in HCC. Mechanistically, these contaminants bind to and activate STAT3, which transcriptionally upregulates GPX4, establishing a STAT3-GPX4 self-activating loop that suppresses lipid peroxidation and protects tumor cells from ferroptotic death. Notably, 6:2 Cl-PFESA shows stronger activity than PFOS, challenging its designation as a safer substitute. Our findings reveal a striking cell type-specific duality of PFAS action─inducing ferroptosis in normal hepatocytes but enabling evasion in HCC through signaling reprogramming. This dichotomy advances understanding of pollutant-cancer interactions, highlights the STAT3-GPX4 axis as a therapeutic vulnerability, and underscores the health risks posed by PFAS replacements."

This study established an N2O-saturated condition to evaluate the kinetics and mechanisms of 185-nm UV direct photolysis and defluorination of three PFAS subclasses: perfluorocarboxylates (PFCAs; CnF2n+1–COOH, n = 1–9), perfluorosulfonic acids (PFSAs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl ether carboxylic acids (PFECAs). PFCAs and PFECAs underwent significant direct photolysis, whereas PFSAs remain resistant. First-order direct photolysis rate constants strongly correlated with molar absorption coefficients (68–3396 M–1cm–1), exhibiting enhanced kinetics for longer-chain PFCAs (n > 7), PFECAs (n > 6), and multiether PFECAs. 185-nm quantum yields ranged from 0.12 to 0.28 mol/Einstein, resulting in 30–84% defluorination. Products analysis identified neutral gaseous transformation products (e.g., CnF2n+1H and CnF2n+2), indicating dominant C–C cleavage for PFCAs and combined C–O and C–C cleavage for PFECAs. Kinetic modeling revealed that the contribution of direct photolysis to overall PFAS degradation in 185-nm water photolysis increased with decreasing pH, accounting for 87% at pH 7 and 10% at pH 11, respectively.

The PFOS was transferred to honey, accumulated in bee tissue, and was detected in feces at all exposure concentrations. At the sublethal exposures, adult bee colonies in all treatments appeared healthy, colonies were sustained, brood was produced, and resources were stored, but adverse life stage development and intergenerational effects were evident even at the lowest exposure concentration of 5 μg L–1.

Here, we applied one- and two-dimensional high-field 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS) to investigate sources and transformations of solid-phase extractable  DOM along an Amazonian mangrove-fringed river-to-ocean transect. Relative abundances of aromatic compounds decreased from the river to the coastal ocean, whereas aliphatic compounds increased. NMR spectroscopic features, commonly associated with carbohydrates, are probably related to flavonoid- and lignin-derived structural motifs. These structural features were more readily detected by 1H NMR spectroscopy, whereas aromatics were more effectively detected by FT-ICR-MS. We tentatively identified polycyclic aromatic sulfur-containing compounds as being predominantly derived from urban areas, whereas sulfurized aliphatic compounds originated from sulfidic mangrove sediments. Surprisingly, while the number of DOM molecular formulas decreased along the river-to-coastal continuum, coastal marine DOM exhibited greater structural diversity than terrigenous DOM. Here, we showed that the interplay of distinct molecular pathways, particularly (photo)oxidation processes and sulfur incorporation, structurally diversifies DOM in coastal marine environments."

Experiments were conducted using two trapped gases (i.e., at residual nonwetting saturation), two grain sizes, and three aqueous velocities. Mass transfer characteristics including dissolved gas enrichment, dissolved gas breakthrough times, and changes in gas saturations were assessed by observation and by the ANOVA test to evaluate the overall mass transfer behavior dependence on these three system parameters. Results showed that partitioning of any one gas component is highly dependent on all other gas components and that mass transfer is not consistent with local equilibrium assumptions (LEA), even at aqueous velocities below where LEA was expected.

When applied in the Yellow River Estuary, this approach revealed key findings: Ecotoxicoproteomic analysis of sentinel species, crucian carp (Carassius auratus), identified membrane receptor integrin αvβ3 as a key biomarker linked to neurotoxicity-related AOs. An in vitro competitive binding assay revealed higher integrin αvβ3 binding activity in mainstream versus tributary samples. Comprehensive chemical analysis identified triethyl phosphate (TEP) as the primary causative toxicant, accounting for over 46% of integrin αvβ3 binding activity.

Herein, a ZrO2-supported Ru single-atom and WOx cluster (Ru1–WOx/ZrO2) catalyst with Ru–O–Zr and W–O–Zr dual interfaces was prepared, featuring abundant oxygen vacancies and highly active Zr-WOx clusters, which collaboratively facilitated the activation of reactant molecules. Ru1–WOx/ZrO2 exhibited excellent catalytic activity (T90% = 434 °C at a space velocity of 20,000 mL g–1 h–1) and outstanding durability for the typical hydrofluorocarbon (1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane, HFC-134a) removal under humid conditions, which significantly outperformed most of the previously reported catalysts for HFC-134a removal. The atomically dispersed Ru1 optimized the electronic structure of Zr and achieved the rational regulation of ZrO2 crystal phase, thereby forming coordination-unstable Zr4+/Ruδ+ (0 < δ < 4) sites and three-dimensional distorted Zr-stabilized WOx clusters. The structure with abundant redox centers closely coupled with multiple acid centers facilitated the migration of fluorine and stimulated the interaction of water with the surface adsorbed or lattice oxygen species to generate highly reactive oxygen species.

We established an automated Python-Aspen Plus-LCA workflow, systematically mapping variations in PA6 waste composition and key process parameters onto probability distributions of environmental impacts. Results show that the hydrothermal process has the highest impacts in six of nine categories, while the solvent-free, alkaline NaOH route consistently shows the lowest. Despite lower energy demands, the acidic H3PO4 process is not environmentally superior to the alcoholysis route. For the hydrothermal route, results are strongly driven by the water-to-feed ratio. However, its global warming potential (GWP) remains above that of fossil-based caprolactam. In contrast, the alcoholysis and acidic processes lower GWP by ∼35%, whereas the NaOH route achieves an ∼80% reduction to 1.46 kg CO2-eq/kg caprolactam. Although chemical recycling can mitigate impacts, no process consistently meets the net-zero emission carbon budget needed to limit global warming to 1.5 °C.

In a mother–infant cohort, we quantified four MEL derivatives in matched maternal urine (median: 31.9 ng/mL), maternal blood (1.10 ng/mL), amniotic fluid (15.0 ng/mL), and cord blood (2.01 ng/mL), demonstrating substantial fetal exposure. Transplacental transfer efficiencies of MEL, ammelide, and cyanuric acid (CYA) were 1.46, 1.36, and 1.64, respectively, and were inversely correlated with their log Kow values. Maternal MEL concentration was negatively associated with birth weight, particularly in female infants (10β = 90.5%, 95% CI: 83.0%, 98.9%), estriol mediating approximately 30.7% of this effect. BeWo assays demonstrated that MEL derivatives cross the placental barrier via combined passive diffusion and transporter-modulated processes, involving folate-related transporters together with multiple xenobiotic transport systems. In trophoblast cells, coexposure to MEL and CYA (1:9) at environmentally relevant concentrations suppressed estradiol and estriol secretion in a nonmonotonic, dose-dependent manner, accompanied by down-regulation of key steroidogenic enzymes and compensatory up-regulation of estrogen receptors. Overall, this study provides integrated evidence that MEL analogues may cross the placenta via nutrient-mimicking transport pathways and disrupt placental steroidogenesis, potentially impairing fetal growth."

Among 1945 metabolic features linked to PM2.5/O3 exposure and 271 correlated with GDM, 12 were confirmedly annotated. Incorporating these 12 metabolites into a classical risk factor-based receiver operating characteristic model increased area under the curve from 0.64 to 0.77 (p = 0.003). This study identifies PM2.5–O3 co-exposure as a controllable GDM risk factor, mechanistically linked to aspartate/asparagine and amino-sugar metabolic disruption. The identified exposure–responsive metabolites not only provide biological insights but also demonstrate translational potential for improving GDM risk prediction models."

Conventional processes for recovering Li from spent LIB leachate are energy-intensive or chemically demanding, compromising the environmental and economic viability. This study introduces an ecofriendly approach using capillary-driven three-dimensional (3D) evaporative crystallization within a porous cotton matrix. Low-solubility salts (CoCl2, MnCl2, and NiCl2) crystallize proximally, while highly dissolvable LiCl migrates toward the distal zone, achieving spatial separation on the crystallizer. Maximum selectivity reached 109.5 (Li/Co), 7.8 (Li/Ni), and 3.2 (Li/Mn) in the simulated leachate, corresponding to a 4.7-fold enrichment of Li abundance. A comparable selective Li separation was demonstrated for a real leachate, confirming the practical potential of the approach. The natural-physiochemical-process-induced 3D evaporative crystallization eliminates high energy or chemical inputs, providing a sustainable and low-cost pathway for selective Li recovery from variable spent LIB leachates."

Using validated, publicly available data, we computed the global distribution of populations with the highest indoor humid-heat risk and deprivation index and then employed the most widely adopted urban module of the Community Earth System Model (CESM) to estimate the electricity and carbon dioxide required to provide equitable air-conditioning cooling to these groups. Our results indicate that India exhibits the highest combined indoor humid-heat risk and deprivation index, while the top ten countries are dominated by low-income nations in Africa. If these regions were to receive equitable access to air-conditioning cooling, they would consume 1,652 terawatt-hours of electricity and generate an additional 607 million tons of carbon dioxide by 2050. Achievable mitigation pathways include improving building-envelope performance and enhancing the cooling coefficient of performance (COP) of air-conditioning systems, challenges that demand new building materials and next-generation air-conditioning technologies for energy efficiency. Given that some of our data are static, our results entail a degree of uncertainty; they are credible at the order-of-magnitude scale, and fully precise projections will be refined once dynamic data become available in the future."

We present a new basin‐wide 3‐D gravity model, updated by the most comprehensive sediment thickness and seismic observations, offering the first systematic view of crustal architecture. Since ∼45 Ma, the western Gakkel ridge (3°W–85°E), spreading at ∼10–14 mm/yr, has produced generally thin (2–4 km) crust. In contrast, the slower eastern Gakkel ridge (85–126°E; ∼6–10 mm/yr) generates basin‐wide robust volcanic crust 6–8 km thick. This “slower‐yet‐thicker” relationship challenges the classical spreading‐rate paradigm, showing that mantle fertility, elevated temperatures, and active upwelling—not spreading rate alone—govern crustal production at eastern part of Gakkel ridges."

However, the environmental factors controlling REY enrichment remain poorly understood, largely because paleoceanographic proxies are absent in pelagic clays. This study focused on two sediment cores with an ultra‐enrichment layer of REY (UELR) from the western and southeastern Pacific. Detailed rock magnetic and transmission electron microscope analyses revealed high magnetofossil abundance in the UELR. It is proposed that strong bottom currents triggered intense upwelling, enhancing primary productivity. This, in turn, stimulated both fish and magnetotactic bacteria reproduction, making the strong coupling between magnetofossils and phosphate, mainly from fish bones and teeth, which efficiently absorbed substantial REYs from seawater. Moreover, magnetic parameters related to eolian dust can also indicate REY composition and the enrichment environment. Therefore, environmental magnetism holds significant potential for investigating the mechanisms of deep‐sea REY enrichment."

The Lifted Index (LI) and its effective version (LI_eff) are the most robust predictors of lightning. Other useful parameters are CAPE in a hail growth zone (CAPE_HGL), cold cloud depth (Cold_layer), and equilibrium level temperature and height (EL_tmp, EL_hgt). 1–4 km relative humidity (RH_14 km) is important for thunderstorm development in warm environments, while in the cold season lightning is associated with stronger atmospheric flow.

This study applied a population balance method incorporating the transport (TR) effect to examine transport influence in three distinct regional (banana‐shaped) NPF events and one non‐regional NPF event in the Pearl River Delta region. In the non‐regional NPF event, particle changes due to transport closely align with observed particle concentration trends. In regional NPF events, the role of transport is also significant and cannot be overlooked. During the initial phase of NPF, transport exerts a positive effect, leading to an increase in particle concentration. However, as the boundary layer height increases, possible enhanced dilution led to a transition to a negative effect, resulting in particle loss. Ultimately, transport has a net positive effect in local new particle formation events, with the average contribution to particle concentration changes ranging from 47% to 68% across different cases. Incorporating the transport (TR) term reduced the root mean square error (RMSE) between simulated and observed particle number concentrations (NCN) by 28%–55% and increased the average coefficient of determination (R2) from 0.82 to 0.93 across the three cases. Moreover, including the TR term improved estimates of CCN concentration at 1.0% supersaturation (SS), though deviations persisted due to variations in background particle concentrations. Future studies should further investigate the size‐dependent influence of transport and its potential impact on CCN activation under lower SS to better constrain transport‐related processes in regional NPF events."

 The electrolytes of aqueous batteries are mostly acidic or alkaline, resulting in inevitable side reactions. More importantly, when batteries are disposed of, strongly acidic and alkaline solutions harm the environment. In this study, we synthesized covalent organic polymers as negative electrode materials for aqueous divalent ion (Mg2+ and Ca2+) storage, which exhibit favorable performance in electrolytes with a pH of 7.0 (the electrolytes are environmentally benign and can even be “brine” in tofu production). Polymers containing electron-donating linking bonds exhibit fast kinetics and low potential for use in aqueous Mg2+/Ca2+ batteries. In neutral electrolytes (pH = 7.0), Hexaketone-tetraaminodibenzo-p-dioxin covalent organic polymers exhibit 120,000 cycles and deliver specific capacities (up to 112.8 mA h g-1). The negative electrode was paired with a positive electrode, creating a full cell that has a voltage interval of 2.2 V and achieves a specific energy of up to 48.3 Wh kg-1, which is calculated on the basis of the total mass of the negative electrode, positive electrode, and electrolyte at the full cell level, together with long-term cycling stability over 120,000 cycles at a specific current of 20 A g-1.

This study shows that APOBEC3B is required for these breaks, by deaminating cytosines within R-loops at oestrogen receptor-regulated enhancers. 
 Oestrogen receptor (ER) activation leads to the formation of DNA double strand breaks (DSB), promoting genomic instability and tumour heterogeneity. The single-stranded DNA cytosine deaminase APOBEC3B (A3B) serves as a co-activator of ER and is implicated in inducing DSBs at transcriptional enhancers regulated by ER. Using whole-genome sequencing in an engineered cell model lacking base excision repair (BER) function, we demonstrate that A3B preferentially targets transcriptionally active regulatory regions in an R-loop-dependent manner. Strand-specific DNA:RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (ssDRIP-seq) and ssDNA-associated protein immunoprecipitation sequencing (SPI-seq) confirm that A3B binds to and deaminates ssDNA within R-loops, a process facilitated by ER transactivation. Furthermore, BER-mediated processing of A3B-induced uracil bases contributes to the formation of R-loop-associated DSBs, which are essential for ER-regulated gene activation. These findings establish a role for A3B in R-loop homeostasis and transcriptional regulation, with implications for understanding ER-driven genomic instability and potential therapeutic targeting of A3B. Oestrogen receptor activation generates DNA breaks at regulatory elements that control gene expression. This study shows that APOBEC3B is required for these breaks, by deaminating cytosines within R-loops at oestrogen receptor-regulated enhancers."

This study creates a uranium–graphdiyne material that promotes nitrogen adsorption and ammonia release, boosting ammonia yield. 
 The sustainable synthesis on ammonia at mild thermal conditions is a pivotal goal in catalysis, yet finding efficient alternatives to the energy-intensive Haber-Bosch process remains a great challenge. Here we show that a composite material comprising uranium and few-layer graphdiyne (U/GDY) catalyzes ammonia production with high efficiency at low temperature and pressure. We synthesize few-layer GDY in supercritical CO2 to create a stable scaffold that hosts uranium in specific valency and cluster states. Both experimental results and theoretical calculations reveal that the unique electronic interplay between the 5 f electrons of uranium and the conjugated structure of GDY optimizes the adsorption and activation of nitrogen. This synergism facilitates a favorable reaction pathway involving specific nitrogen recognition and efficient product release. Our findings demonstrate the potential of uranium-based composites in catalysis and offer a strategy for designing actinide-carbon hybrid materials in challenging chemical transformations.

Their simulations suggest that dense phytoplankton at the surface would have created a greener ocean which may have prevented sunlight from reaching subsurface levels and contributed to reduced ocean productivity. 
 Geological records suggest that marine phytoplankton might have arisen in the Proterozoic while zooplankton remained absent, and marine productivity was not excessively low. However, quantitative estimates of phytoplankton biomass and net primary productivity remain elusive. Here, we use the Community Earth System Model version 1.2.2, modifying biological module and boundary conditions, to simulate marine biogeochemical cycles in the Proterozoic. The simulations demonstrate that, within the expected range of nutrient levels, phytoplankton at sea surface was more than 2 times denser than present, sustaining a greener ocean due to the absence of predators. Heavier surface chlorophyll in the Proterozoic would block sunlight from reaching subsurface layers. This so-called self-shielding effect would decrease subsurface net primary productivity significantly. Simulations show that, through the combined influence of low nitrate level under a low-oxygen environment, the absence of diatoms, and self-shielding, the Proterozoic net primary productivity was only approximately 60% and 30% of the present level in warm (almost ice-free) and cold (sea-ice reaches around 30°N/S) periods, respectively. These findings are subject to uncertainties in model framework and Proterozoic nutrients levels; a slightly less green ocean or more productive ocean was possible if the phosphorus level was much lower or higher than the present level. Here, the authors leverage the Earth system model CESM1.2.2 to simulate Proterozoic marine biogeochemical cycles. Their simulations suggest that dense phytoplankton at the surface would have created a greener ocean which may have prevented sunlight from reaching subsurface levels and contributed to reduced ocean productivity."

Here, the authors instead show that robust non-integer values of thermal conductance can arise from equilibration dynamics as opposed to underlying non-trivial topology. 
 Considering a range of candidate quantum phases of matter, half-integer thermal conductance is believed to be an unambiguous evidence of non-Abelian states. It has been long known that such half-integer values arise due to the presence of Majorana edge modes, representing a significant step towards topological quantum computing. Here, we challenge this prevailing notion by presenting a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study where half-integer two-terminal thermal conductance plateau is realized employing integer quantum Hall states. Our proposed setup features a confined geometry of bilayer graphene, interfacing distinct particle and hole-like integer quantum Hall edges. Each segment of the device exhibits full charge and thermal equilibration. Our approach is amenable to generalization to other quantum Hall platforms, and may give rise to other values of fractional quantized transport. Our study demonstrates that the observation of robust non-integer values of thermal conductance can arise as a manifestation of mundane equilibration dynamics as opposed to underlying non-trivial topology.

 The deployment of green hydrogen in the global transition towards sustainable energy systems relies heavily on cost-effective renewables. Regions rich in renewable energy are usually along a seashore, although the direct electrolysis of seawater is still technically challenging. Moreover, the scarcity of freshwater poses significant costs for hydrogen production. Here we describe an electrolysis process with built-in seawater desalination in a porous-solid-electrolyte reactor. A three-chamber cell with bipolar membranes synergizes the acidic hydrogen evolution reaction, the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction and electrodialysis desalination processes. The use of a porous solid electrolyte in the cell facilitates reliable electrochemical equilibrium, resulting in a coupling factor of approximately 100% for electrolysis and desalination, which maintains the high kinetic current of the coupled electrochemical processes for a lower energy penalty. For seawater electrolysis, the optimized catalyst is robust against anodic Cl− corrosion and serves to enhance device reliability. Long-term cell operation with real seawater experienced negligible device degradation over 360 h. The current system can produce approximately 2.1 t of freshwater meeting potable standards for every kilogram of hydrogen generated, thus offering a feasible pathway to harnessing seawater for both clean water and green hydrogen.

 Jezero crater is located in Mars’ largest olivine-rich region, which is variously interpreted as lava flows, intrusive plutons, clastic sediments, or pyroclastics. In Jezero crater, several olivine-rich units have been investigated by the Perseverance rover, including an olivine cumulate in the crater floor (Séítah formation) and the enigmatic “Margin Unit”; an olivine- and carbonate-rich unit commonly interpreted as either a lake shore deposit or a local expression of the regional olivine-carbonate unit. We developed a method incorporating X-ray diffraction energy and spatial information to accurately determine the forsterite content (molar percentage of MgO/(MgO+FeOT)) of monocrystalline olivine encountered by Perseverance. Forsterite content in clastic sediments of the western Jezero fan indicate multiple olivine sources. In contrast, forsterite content analysed in the Margin Unit is similar to the Séítah formation, suggesting that at least some of the Margin Unit may represent an altered igneous cumulate with similar origins to the Séítah formation.

 Earth observations from satellites are the primary information source for Numerical Weather Prediction models. While some land surface variables, such as surface soil moisture, are assimilated to improve initial land conditions, the use of additional satellite-derived land surface and vegetation products remains limited partly due to systematic model biases. Here we examine the potential of satellite-derived land surface temperature and vegetation indicators to enhance near-surface temperature forecast skill. We build deep learning surrogate models for Numerical Weather Prediction using Long Short-Term Memory networks. Results show that including these satellite datasets improves temperature forecast skill globally across lead times from 1 to 12 days, with the largest improvements at 4-day lead time. Satellite-based predictors are the most relevant variables in about 60% of global grid cells. Among them, sun-induced fluorescence is the most important predictor, reflecting vegetation photosynthetic activity and its influence on surface energy partitioning and near-surface temperature.

 Whether drought-induced vegetation loss risk and ecosystem resilience in arid regions evolve synergistically or trade off remains unclear. Here, we project that medium-to-high risk areas in global drylands will expand by 9.9%–15.3% in the future. By developing a multi-model vegetation resilience trajectory diagnostic framework, we found that 57.4% of vegetated areas experienced declining resilience historically. In a low-emissions pathway, the fraction with declining resilience drops from 51.2% during 2015–2060 to 42.6% during 2061–2100, but rises to 64.8 ± 2.0% under medium- and high-emissions pathways. Rising risk is mainly driven by intensified atmospheric drought, while declining resilience results from weakened carbon dioxide fertilization and aggravated aridity. The centroids of high-risk and low-resilience regions will shift toward the northern margin of the Tibetan Plateau in Asia and southward in South America; ecologically sensitive zones with high risk and decreasing resilience (32.0–50.1% of drylands) warrant precise prevention and management. Over half of vegetated areas in global arid regions have lost ecosystem resilience, and this decline is projected to coincide with greater drought induced risk under future climates, based on a diagnostic analysis of multi model resilience trajectories."

 In 1976, the Motagua Fault along the North American-Caribbean plate boundary ruptured in a devastating M 7.5 earthquake. Despite its considerable scientific importance and its potential for catastrophic societal impact, very little is known about the seismic history of this major fault. Here, we show direct on-fault paleoseismic evidence for five ground-rupturing earthquakes on the Motagua Fault in the last 1,300 years that led to cultural and architectural adaptations. Radiocarbon ages of fault scarp-derived colluvial wedges, along with damage and repair at Maya and Colonial sites, provide constraints for three earthquakes during the 8th–13th centuries and two during the 18th-20th centuries, separated by a six-century interval of seismic quiescence. The research presented here provides new insight into the seismic character of the Motagua Fault and illustrates that earthquake recurrence on the fault is variable, allowing for improved estimation of current and future seismic risk in Guatemala.

 Land use and cover changes (LULCC) have profoundly influenced global soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, yet SOC responses to LULCC are among the largest but least quantified uncertainties in estimating land carbon emissions. Here we comprehensively estimated the LULCC-induced SOC changes over the past century using data from three widely recognized model inter-comparison projects. A refined multi-dimensional diagnostic framework was employed to dissect the underlying processes governing SOC changes following LULCC. Results revealed notable discrepancies among models. Despite varying magnitudes, soil carbon residence time consistently contributed negatively to LULCC-induced SOC changes. Conversely, net primary productivity (NPP)-driven SOC changes emerged as the largest source of uncertainty, predominantly fueling SOC gains in some model ensembles but depletion in others. Our findings underscore the need to better constrain simulated NPP and soil turnover processes to improve the accuracy of LULCC-induced SOC change predictions, pivotal for advancing global carbon management and climate mitigation strategies.

 Tropical forests enhance regional rainfall but a robust analysis of this benefit is lacking. Consequently, the rainfall generating services of tropical forests are rarely accounted for in policymaking. We synthesised observational and model-based values of the reduction in rainfall due to tropical deforestation to quantify rainfall generation. Across these studies, we estimate that each meter squared of forest contributes 240 ± 60 L each year to regional rainfall. The Amazon forest has an even stronger rainfall benefit, with each meter squared of forest contributing 300 ± 110 L each year. Using a simple approach that assumes a constant water unit price, we estimate that Amazon forest rainfall generation is worth US$59.40 per hectare annually and the Brazilian Legal Amazon delivers rainfall generation worth US$20 ± 7 billion annually. Recognizing the economic value of tropical forests’ rainfall provision will unlock crucial investment and transform policy discussions on payments for forest protection.

 Microbes in hyper-arid and oligotrophic ecosystems like Antarctica rely on energy from atmospheric trace gas oxidation to support persistence, primary production, and carbon mitigation. Hydrocarbon contamination is common around Antarctic research stations, yet its implications for these critical ecological processes are unknown. Here, we examined the soil microbial communities of Bunger Hills, East Antarctica, including the impact of a 40-year-old legacy petroleum spill. Metagenomic analysis and gas chromatography revealed significant shifts in microbiome composition and function in contaminated soils, including severely reduced hydrogen oxidation rates, and higher (14CO2) carbon fixation rates. We reconstructed 300 microbial genomes across 16 prokaryotic phyla, describing 24 novel candidate species. Our results demonstrate the long-lasting effects of pollutants on polar microbial ecosystems, highlight the role of trace gas scavengers and hydrocarbon degraders in regulating key ecological functions, and advance our understanding of anthropogenic impacts on microbial nutrient and energy acquisition in dry desert environments.

 Oxygen minimum zones are large-scale subsurface oxygen-deficient layers experiencing rapid reconfiguration under climate change, partly driven by changes in ventilation whose mechanisms remain poorly understood. Along the eastern South Pacific oxygen minimum zone, a subsurface salinity maximum associated with equatorial subsurface water creates thermohaline gradients that trigger salt-finger instabilities across the lower oxycline. Here we show, using high-resolution microstructure, velocity, and oxygen observations, that these instabilities enhance diapycnal mixing and drive significant oxygen fluxes into the oxygen-deficient layer. While the upper oxycline is dominated by shear-driven turbulence, strong stratification suppresses vertical mixing, resulting in low diffusivities where sharp oxygen gradients are present, whereas salt fingering below yields high diffusivities where gradients are weaker, leading to comparable oxygen fluxes across both boundaries. The widespread occurrence of salt-finger-favorable conditions across the eastern South Pacific suggests that this mechanism plays a persistent and previously unrecognized role in the oxygen minimum zone ventilation.

 Atmospheric drought stress limits mangrove photosynthetic activity, and this constraint can be further amplified by high salinity, yet their combined global effects remain poorly understood. Here, we integrated multi-source Earth observation and geoinformation datasets, including Sentinel-2 red-edge position (a proxy for canopy photosynthetic activity), vapor pressure deficit from TerraClimate, seawater salinity from Copernicus reanalysis, to investigate how salinity regulates the sensitivity of mangrove photosynthesis to atmospheric drought stress during 2019–2023. Datasets were harmonized and analyzed through reproducible geoinformation workflows at 10 m–0.5° resolutions, enabling large-scale coupling analyses between remote sensing proxies and climate drivers. We found that drought stress constrained mangrove photosynthetic activity worldwide, with stronger limitations in tropical savannahs than in tropical rainforests. Marine mangroves exposed to persistent high salinity were more sensitive than estuarine mangroves influenced by freshwater inflow. These results reveal a global pattern in which salinity amplifies atmospheric water constraints on mangrove photosynthesis. Mangroves in dry climates and high-salinity habitats are therefore most vulnerable to future warming and drying.

 Solar radiation is a fundamental driver of ecological and climatic processes, with downward surface solar radiation (DSSR), ultraviolet radiation (UVR), and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) exerting distinct influences on energy systems, human health, atmospheric environment, and ecosystem dynamics. However, high-resolution radiation data remain scarce due to the complexity and cost of nationwide observations. In this study, an advanced Transformer-based deep learning model (FT-Transformer) was developed based on multi-source data (e.g., ground observations, reanalysis data, and satellite products) to generate hourly 0.1° resolution datasets of DSSR, UVR, and PAR in China from 2005 to 2023, which achieved high accuracy with R2 values of 0.78–0.83, 0.87–0.89, and 0.96–0.98 at hourly, daily, and monthly levels, respectively. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were employed to provide interpretability of model estimations. These products are more reliable and accurate through independent validation against ground-based observations and comparisons with widely used products (e.g., CERES, CAMS, and ERA5). Spatiotemporal analyses of the reconstructed datasets indicate that DSSR and UVR exhibit significant increases across most regions after 2013 primarily driven by reductions in aerosol pollution, whereas PAR shows an overall declining tendency with pronounced regional contrasts. Attribution analysis suggests that interannual variations in aerosol loading and cloud cover explain a substantial fraction of DSSR and UVR variability in eastern and central China, accounting for approximately 80%–93% of the variance. These datasets are freely available to the public and provide a valuable resource for solar energy, climate, and ecosystem research."

Makhokha;Anzel De Lange;Liesl Dyson;Gregor Feig;Abri de Buys;Kathleen Smart,Long-term variability of planetary boundary layer heights derived from radiosonde and flux tower observations in South Africa,"•Surface heating is identified as a key trigger of boundary layer regime transition. •Boundary layers are found to be higher over dry inland regions than coastal regions. •Oceanic influence found to affect coastal boundary layer development. •Sensible heat fluxes found to drive boundary layer growth in convective conditions. •Latent heat fluxes promoted boundary layer growth over oceans and humid regions. 
 The planetary boundary layer (PBL) height is a crucial meteorological parameter for climate and air pollution dispersion studies. This paper examines the long-term variability of PBL heights across South Africa using daily soundings collected from eight atmospheric sounding stations and PBL height estimates from one South African Environmental Observation Network (SAEON) flux tower and three Expanded Freshwater and Terrestrial Environmental Observation Network (EFTEON) flux towers over the period from 2012 to 2024. PBL heights were estimated from the radiosonde vertical profiles using the parcel and surface-based temperature inversion methods. Mean convective boundary layer (CBL) heights ranged below 931 m along coastal areas and exceeded 1728 m over inland regions. In contrast, mean stable boundary layer (SBL) heights reach up to 363 m in inland and 764 m in coastal regions. Flux tower data indicated that the morning transition from SBL to CBL occurs between 0500 Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) and 0600 UTC, while the evening transition occurs between 1500 UTC and 1600 UTC. CBL heights typically peak during the spring and summer months and reach their minimum in autumn and winter. In contrast, SBL heights exhibit the opposite pattern, with maximum heights observed in autumn and winter and minimum heights in spring and summer months. Overall, CBL heights were generally higher over inland regions than coastal regions, while SBL heights remained relatively comparable across the regions."
