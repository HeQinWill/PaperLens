10.1088/1748-9326/adfe81,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究论文主要关注刚果盆地Cuvette Centrale泥炭地的森林砍伐和碳排放情况，利用全球森林变化数据分析了2001-2021年间的树木覆盖损失模式及其导致的碳排放。虽然涉及碳排放，但重点在于土地利用变化和泥炭地生态，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。因此，与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['deforestation', 'carbon emissions', 'peatlands', 'tree cover loss']",Shona J Jenkins;E T A Mitchard;E N Honorio Coronado;S E Page;O Emba Botuli;B Crezee;S A Ifo;Greta C Dargie;C E N Ewango;E Bokungu;S L Lewis,"Low, but gradually growing deforestation and carbon emissions from the Cuvette Centrale peatlands, 2001–2021","Earth’s largest tropical peatland, first mapped in 2017, is located within an immense wetland in the Congo Basin, the Cuvette Centrale, covering 167 600 km2. Here, for the first time, we estimate spatio-temporal tree cover loss patterns and the resultant carbon emissions in these forested peatlands using Global Forest Change data from 2001–2021. We find tree cover loss affected 1.4% of the peatlands over 20 years (0.07% yr−1), with 89% occurring in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC, 0.06% yr−1) and 11% in the Republic of the Congo (RoC, 0.008% yr−1). Though low, tree cover loss rates in the peatlands have increased 5x in the DRC and 2x in the RoC between the 2000’s and 2010’s, but are a fraction of the contemporary rate of peatland deforestation in Insular Southeast Asia and are 5x–7x lower than total tree cover loss rates in each country, respectively. The increase in the rate of tree cover loss and in the size of patches of tree cover loss over time and the occurrence of losses near access routes (settlements, roads and waterways) suggests increasing anthropogenic causes. Smaller loss patches are likely due to anthropogenic and natural causes. In the DRC, only 19% of patches were >0.1 km2 in the 2000’s; this rose to 81% in the 2010’s. We detected one anomalously large patch of deforestation (75 km2). A ground-truthed analysis of this patch shows that rice cultivation is driving deforestation on seasonally-flooded forest not underlain by peat and areas of peatland forest underlain by shallow peat. This is a previously unidentified threat to peatland degradation in the Cuvette Centrale. Deforested tropical peatlands can result in significant carbon emissions. We estimate that committed emissions are 108 (76.34–131.81) Tg CO2 from peat decomposition and aboveground biomass loss in the DRC between 2001–2021. Overall, tree cover loss, deforestation and carbon emissions are low compared to other regions with large areas of tropical peatlands, with 98.6% of the Cuvette Centrale peatlands being intact when considering tree cover loss. Ground-based studies including participation from residents of peatland-adjacent communities are acutely needed to validate our findings, improve peatland maps and prioritise local people in future management decisions, and prevent future greater losses."
10.1088/1748-9326/ae0051,False,Environmental Research Letters,该研究主要关注澳大利亚陆地生态系统呼吸作用（TER）对土壤湿度的响应，利用OzFlux网络中的通量塔数据和LPJ模型，分析了TER在不同气候条件下对土壤水分的依赖性。研究发现半干旱地区TER对土壤湿度的敏感性最强，并指出当前模型在模拟澳大利亚TER模式方面存在不足。虽然涉及CO2通量，但重点在于陆地生态系统而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。,"['terrestrial ecosystem respiration', 'soil moisture', 'CO2 flux', 'OzFlux network', 'LPJ model']",Eva-Marie Metz;Sanam N Vardag;Andrew F Feldman;Benjamin Poulter;Thomas Colligan;Brenden J Fischer-Femal;André Butz,Responses of terrestrial ecosystem respiration to soil moisture across Australia,"The terrestrial biosphere is the largest net sink of global CO2, but its sink capacity varies considerably from year to year depending on environmental conditions. Recent work has highlighted the importance of semi-arid ecosystems in interannually driving global concentrations of atmospheric CO2. We therefore need to better understand the dynamics and drivers of the CO2 fluxes and their modeling along semi-arid to humid gradients. Respiration is an even more uncertain flux compared to photosynthetic fluxes and its spatially variability is not well understood. Here we focus on terrestrial ecosystem respiration (TER) in Australia, and, specifically, on disentangling the impacts of temperature and soil water on TER. We use nighttime net ecosystem exchange data as a viable proxy for daily TER collected by 40 flux tower stations within the OzFlux network over the last 20 years in Australia. These stations cover a broad range of climatic conditions enabling us to analyze the dependence of TER on soil moisture under varying aridity and temperature conditions. We find that the sensitivity of TER to soil moisture is the strongest in semi-arid regions. In these moisture-limited locations, the TER sensitivity to soil moisture increases strongly with temperature. Soil respiration fluxes at humid stations are large but exhibit low sensitivity to high soil moisture levels indicating that TER at humid stations is not water-limited. Using the dynamic global vegetation model LPJ, we show that common model approaches assuming increasing TER with increasing soil moisture for all soil moisture levels perform poorly in reproducing the observed TER patterns in Australia due to interactions with carbon availability and representation of soil hydrology. Hence a more sophisticated description of the dependence of TER on soil moisture is necessary to capture TER dynamics under different climatic conditions accurately."

However, amid rapid digitalisation and decentralisation of energy systems, its limitations have become increasingly apparent, posing significant challenges for inclusive and equitable stakeholder engagement in the transition. Stakeholders including consumers, prosumers, energy communities, aggregators and electricity utilities, face unequal distribution of grid-related costs and benefits. There is thus a need to understand and address coupled grid-societal vulnerability (GSV). However, there is still no comprehensive study identifying factors influencing GSV and the corresponding challenges vis-à-vis stakeholders. Previous studies have predominantly focused on the disparities in access to hosting capacities for new renewable energy projects and grid congestion due to increased energy demand from households and businesses. We contribute to the literature by developing a comprehensive view of GSV through a systematic literature review of 185 peer-reviewed academic papers focusing on the European context. Three main factors influencing GSV are identified: grid constraints, cybersecurity risks, and regulatory barriers. A complex interrelationship exists between stakeholders in the electricity grid and, as a result, we find there are (in)direct implications of their grid challenges across stakeholders. Therefore, tackling GSV and inequalities in the energy transition requires an integrated solutions approach combining supportive policies, regulatory frameworks and market-based mechanisms with technological integration, innovations and consumer engagement."
10.5194/acp-25-11557-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究探讨了臭氧-气候相互作用如何影响北极平流层温度的长期变化。研究发现，在1980年至2000年期间，臭氧-气候相互作用在初冬提高了北极平流层温度，通过促进向上传播的波和Brewer-Dobson环流。相反，在冬末和春季，它通过减少臭氧的短波加热来降低北极平流层温度。这项研究强调了臭氧-气候相互作用对北极平流层温度趋势季节内逆转的影响。该研究使用了再分析数据集和地球系统模型（CESM）。,"['ozone', 'Arctic stratospheric temperature', 'Brewer-Dobson circulation', 'radiative heating', 'ozone depletion', 'climate interactions', 'reanalysis datasets', 'CESM', 'atmospheric composition']",Siyi Zhao;Jiankai Zhang;Xufan Xia;Zhe Wang;Chongyang Zhang,Effects of ozone–climate interactions on the long-term temperature trend in the Arctic stratosphere,"This study explores how ozone–climate interactions affect long-term Arctic stratospheric temperature (AST) changes by isolating the ozone–circulation coupling process. From 1980 to 2000, ozone–climate interactions raise AST in early winter by promoting upward wave propagation and Brewer–Dobson circulation, whereas they decrease AST in late winter and spring by reducing ozone shortwave heating. Our results highlight the impact of ozone–climate interactions on the intraseasonal reversal of AST trends. 
 Using reanalysis datasets and the Community Earth System Model (CESM), this study investigates the effects of ozone–climate interactions on the Arctic stratospheric temperature (AST) changes during winter and early spring. Before 2000, the AST increased significantly in early winter (November and December), which is contributed to by ozone–climate interactions. Specifically, ozone–climate interactions lead to a stratospheric state that enhances upward wave propagation and the downwelling branch of  Brewer–Dobson circulation. This leads to an adiabatic warming that significantly raises the AST. This dynamical heating overwhelmingly offsets the longwave radiative cooling effect associated with  increased ozone during early winter. In contrast, during late winter and spring, cooling trends in the Arctic stratosphere are predominantly driven by  reduced shortwave radiation heating associated with stratospheric ozone depletion. This study highlights the effects of ozone–climate interactions on the long-term trend in the AST."
10.5194/acp-25-11535-2025,True,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注火山爆发后注入平流层的二氧化硫（SO2）的衰减时间尺度。它利用三种不同的卫星观测数据产品来计算SO2在平流层中的衰减时间，并评估不同数据产品之间的不确定性。研究结果表明，SO2的衰减时间尺度存在显著差异，这限制了我们对火山爆发后SO2衰减过程的理解。该研究与大气环境遥感技术密切相关，因为它使用了卫星观测数据来研究大气成分的变化，特别是与空气质量和火山活动相关的成分。该研究还涉及大气成分分析，特别是SO2的氧化和气溶胶的形成过程。,"['sulfur dioxide', 'satellite observations', 'stratospheric aerosols', 'atmospheric composition', 'volcanic eruptions', 'air quality', 'SO2 decay timescale']",Paul A. Nicknish;Kane Stone;Susan Solomon;Simon A. Carn,Quantifying the decay timescale of volcanic sulfur dioxide in the stratosphere,"Large volcanic eruptions can inject teragrams of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the stratosphere, influencing stratospheric chemistry and Earth's climate. This work calculates decay timescales of volcanic gas-phase SO2 in the stratosphere using data from three satellite products. SO2 decay timescales vary significantly between the different products, and this uncertainty limits our ability to attribute an observed SO2 decay following an eruption to a specific chemical process. 
 The injection of sulfur dioxide (SO2) into the stratosphere and its subsequent oxidation to form sulfate aerosols after large volcanic eruptions can have profound effects on Earth's climate.  The removal of volcanic SO2 in the stratosphere is thought to be driven by its gas-phase oxidation by the hydroxyl radical (OH); once oxidized, it goes on to form sulfate aerosols. However, it has also been suggested that heterogeneous oxidation on ash could also be important or even dominant, which would imply the faster removal of SO2 and thus the faster formation of aerosols, at least in ash-rich plumes. Additionally, recent work uses an assumed exponential fit to determine the total SO2 mass loading following large eruptions; the quality of this fit translates directly to the accuracy of the mass loading estimate. It is therefore of interest to examine how accurately the SO2 decay timescale can be determined from observations and to compare observations to models. Here we evaluate the SO2 decay timescale and its uncertainties following several significant eruptions using three different sets of satellite observations and compare these to the CESM2-WACCM6 model. We show that defining an accurate baseline against which a volcanic injection can be quantified increases the variability and uncertainty in the estimated decay timescale for some satellite datasets.  While the typical decay timescale for SO2 is on the order of a few weeks to a month, we find that uncertainties across different altitudes and eruptions result in timescales that can vary by more than a factor of 2. This makes it difficult to attribute variations in the decay timescale to specific SO2-removal processes for the events examined."
10.5194/acp-25-11483-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该研究论文主要关注的是大气中新粒子形成（NPF）的过程，以及如何利用模型来更好地预测这一过程。论文比较了EC-Earth3模型和ADCHEM模型在模拟两个欧洲北方森林站点的粒子形成和增长方面的表现。研究发现，加入氨可以改善粒子增长的预测，但EC-Earth3模型在较暖月份仍然低估了粒子数量。虽然该研究与大气气溶胶有关，并涉及气溶胶-云相互作用，但它侧重于模型开发和验证，而非直接使用遥感技术（如卫星观测）进行大气成分分析或空气质量监测。因此，它与大气环境遥感技术的关联性不强。,"['New Particle Formation', 'Aerosol Number Concentrations', 'EC-Earth3 Model', 'ADCHEM Model', 'NH3-H2SO4 nucleation', 'Boreal Forest', 'Aerosol-cloud interactions']",Carl Svenhag;Pontus Roldin;Tinja Olenius;Robin Wollesen de Jonge;Sara M. Blichner;Daniel Yazgi;Moa K. Sporre,Seasonal differences in observed versus modelled new particle formation at two European boreal stations,"This study is an investigation of the model representation of how particles are formed and grow in the atmosphere. Using modelled and observed data from two boreal forest stations in 2018, we identify key factors for new particle formation to improve particle climate predictions in the global EC-Earth3 model. Comparisons with the detailed ADCHEM model show that adding ammonia improves particle growth predictions, though EC-Earth3 still greatly underestimates the number of particles during warmer months. 
 Realistic representation of atmospheric aerosol size distribution dynamics in large-scale climate models is important for developing accurate descriptions of aerosol–cloud interactions. Despite the dynamic nature of the distributions, which have large seasonal and diurnal changes, model evaluations often focus on the annual median size distribution. Using more comprehensive monthly and diurnal model illustrations can be crucial for evaluating model performance and potential aerosol effects for short-term variations. In this study, we assess the impact of a molecular model scheme for NH3–H2SO4 nucleation integrated in the Earth System Model (ESM) EC-Earth3, across different seasons, months, and days within the boreal climate during the year 2018. Measured number size distributions from two in situ boreal stations are used to evaluate and study particle formation and growth representation in EC-Earth3 over 2018. Additionally, we utilize results from the ADCHEM model, a state-of-the-art 1-D Lagrangian aerosol chemistry model. This allows us to compare EC-Earth3 against results from highly detailed model descriptions of aerosol formation and growth at the boreal stations. When comparing diurnal EC-Earth3 model results with in situ observations at an hourly temporal resolution, we establish that using solely organic–H2SO4 nucleation parameterization will underestimate the aerosol number concentrations. The newly added NH3–H2SO4 nucleation parameterization in this study improves the resulting aerosol number concentrations and the reproduction of particle formation events with EC-Earth3. However, from March to October, EC-Earth3 still underestimates particle formation and growth."
10.5194/acp-25-11517-2025,False,Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics,该论文主要研究利用全球导航卫星系统（GNSS）无线电掩星（RO）技术，结合物理观测数据，通过一种新的堆叠机器学习（SML）方法来预测全球电离层散发E层（Es）的强度。研究重点在于提高Es层强度预测的精度，从而更好地理解大气耦合过程，并应用于空间天气预报和电离层不规则性监测。虽然使用了卫星观测数据，但其核心是电离层物理现象的预测，而非大气环境遥感技术，如空气质量监测或大气成分分析。,"['ionospheric sporadic E layers', 'GNSS radio occultation', 'space weather forecasting', 'ionospheric irregularities monitoring']",Tianyang Hu;Xiaohua Xu;Jia Luo;Jialiang Hou;Haifeng Liu,Global ionospheric sporadic E intensity prediction from GNSS RO using a novel stacking machine learning method incorporated with physical observations,"Sporadic E (Es) layers are an irregularity in ionospheric E region. Their formation is related to multiple atmospheric physical and chemical processes. Accurate Es intensity prediction is significant for understanding atmospheric coupling. We proposed a novel stacking machine learning method incorporating physical observations to achieve higher-precision global Es intensity prediction than previous methods. Our results indicate the importance of considering related physical factors for Es prediction. 
 Sporadic E (Es) layers, the irregularities of enhanced electron density commonly occurring in the ionospheric E region, are affected by the interactions between distinct atmospheric layers. Es intensity (EsI) is a crucial parameter to describe Es layer characteristics, while there still lacks the method for high-precision EsI prediction due to its complex spatiotemporal variation and physical driving mechanisms. We propose a novel stacking machine learning (SML) method for global EsI prediction, which combines the advantages from different ML models to obtain better performance than using a single ML model. Various Es-related physical observations, including vertical ion convergence, gravity wave potential energy, and solar and geomagnetic indices, are incorporated as the inputs of SML together with the EsI derived from global navigation satellite system (GNSS) radio occultation (RO) measurements. SML performs well in both long-term and short-term EsI prediction and characteristics reconstruction. SML-predicted EsI is in good agreement with GNSS RO-derived EsI, with the mean error (ME) of 0.032 TECU km−1 and root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.158 TECU km−1. Taking ionosonde observations as reference, SML has the RMSE of 1.064 MHz, which is reduced by 20.1 %–40.5 % compared to existing prediction methods. The higher accuracy of our method than methods not incorporating physical observations illustrates the significance of considering multiple related physical factors when constructing the Es prediction model. The proposed method can be expected to provide valuable information for not only ionospheric irregularities monitoring and space weather forecasting but also the mechanisms of Es layer formation and atmospheric coupling."

Cold weather helps these species accumulate in aerosols by slowing their degradation and altering atmospheric chemical processes. This means colder regions might experience stronger and more persistent climate impacts. Our findings highlight the importance of local temperatures and pollution sources when tackling climate challenges. 
 Atmospheric humic-like substances (HULIS), a key component of brown carbon (BrC), significantly promote the light absorption of aerosols. However, their linkages to pollution sources and ambient temperature in cold environments remain unresolved. Here, we analyze wintertime urban aerosol samples in Changchun, northeast China, using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS). HULIS show a high light absorption efficiency (MAE365 = 1.81 ± 0.24 m2 g C−1) and high mass concentration (2.97 ± 1.54 µg C m−3), exceeding values reported from other global regions. Through UHPLC-HRMS/MS characterization, we identify 264 compounds at the molecular structure level, accounting for 38.2 %–78.1 % of the total HULIS mass. Compositional analysis demonstrates biomass burning and coal combustion are the main BrC sources during haze events. We screen out 39 strong BrC chromophores, mainly nitrophenols, that contribute 28.9 ± 10.4 % of the total light absorbance at 365 nm. Low ambient temperatures potentially enhance the accumulation of these strong BrC chromophores in the aerosol particles by suppressing photobleaching processes and altering thermodynamic reaction equilibria. These findings emphasize the potential of BrC to exert a more significant and persistent environmental effect in the cold-region atmosphere."

By investigating variations in the lifespan of end-use products, end-of-life handling practices, and emission factors, we partially reconcile the discrepancies between bottom-up inventories and top-down observational data. 
 An unexpected rise of trichlorofluoromethane (CFC-11) emissions has undermined the efforts behind the Montreal Protocol. However, the sources of these increased emissions, from CFC-11 banks to unreported production, remain contentious. Here, we enhanced the bottom-up dynamic material flow analysis model to characterize the stocks and flows of CFC-11, retrospectively and prospectively from 1950 to 2100. We find that dynamic changes in bank-related emissions could have led to an increased CFC-11 emissions from 2014 to 2018, implying an overestimation of unreported production. Under Scenario 2 (mid-range unreported production levels), long-term emission of banked CFC-11 will accumulate to 980 (600–1500) kilotons (kt), equivalent to 4.7 (2.9–7.1) gigatons (Gt) CO2, between 2025 and 2100. Scenario analysis highlights the potential to reduce up to 50 % of emissions through optimized end-of-life (EoL) management strategies. Our results call for further investigation into the lifespan and EoL processes of products containing ozone-depleting substances (ODSs) to reconcile emission estimates derived from bottom-up and top-down modeling approaches. The modeling approach could also be applied to estimate and project the bank-related emissions and impacts of other ODSs."

Raindrops are modeled as oblate spheroids, and backscattering properties are computed via the T-matrix method, including noise, turbulence, and spectral averaging effects. When comparing simulations with measurements, differences in the amplitudes of polarimetric variables are noted. This shows the challenge of using simplified shapes to model raindrop polarimetric variables when moving to millimeter wavelengths. 
 In this work, the T-matrix approach is exploited to produce simulations of spectral polarimetric variables (spectral differential reflectivity, sZDR, spectral differential scattering phase, sδHV, and spectral correlation coefficient, sρHV) for observations of rain acquired from slant-looking W-band cloud radar. The spectral polarimetric variables are simulated with two different methodologies, taking into account instrument noise and the stochastic movement of the raindrops, introduced by raindrop oscillations and by turbulence. The simulated results are then compared with rain Doppler spectra observations from W-band radar for moderate rain rate conditions. Two cases, differing in levels of turbulence, are considered. While the comparison of the simulations with the measurements presents a reasonable agreement for equi-volume diameters less than 2.25 mm, large discrepancies are found in the amplitude (but not the position) of the maxima and minima of sZDR and, more mildly, of sδHV. This pinpoints a general weakness in approximating raindrop as spheroids to simulate radar backscattering properties at the W-band."

Our study compared five satellite products that use ground-based PM10 data. Most products agreed on the daily dust distribution, with absorbing aerosol index (AAI) performing best under cloud cover. Overall, the Sentinel-5P AAI has the highest probability of correct detection (POCD) in dust events but is unstable and has a high probability of false detection (POFD). The FY4A/B infrared difference dust index (IDDI) has the lowest POCD, but it is relatively stable, and its POFD is low. 
 Satellite remote sensing provides a rich data source for the real-time and accurate acquisition of dust weather information in East Asia. However, there are few studies to evaluate whether these data can effectively and accurately reflect the dynamic process of dust weather. This study evaluates and compares the continuity, accuracy, and stability of five commonly used remote sensing products for monitoring dust weather in East Asia, based on recorded dust events (DEs) from 2019 to April 2025. The products evaluated are the Fengyun-4A/B (FY-4A/B) dust score (DST), infrared difference dust index (IDDI), Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) aerosol optical depth (AOD), Sentinel-5P absorbing aerosol index (AAI), and Himawari-8/9 AOD, using ground station PM10 concentration data. The results show that the daily spatial distribution of atmospheric dust presented by the five remote sensing products has good consistency. Notably, the AAI not only offers better continuity in depicting the spatial distribution of atmospheric dust compared to other aerosol products but also compensates for the shortcomings of other products that cannot detect UV-absorbing aerosols mixed with clouds. Based on the evaluation using ground station PM10 data, the mean probability of correct detection (POCD) for atmospheric dust during multiple DEs for Sentinel-5P AAI, MODIS AOD, Himawari-8/9 AOD, FY-4A/B DST, and IDDI products were 57.16 %, 45.18 %, 31.25 %, 22.78 %, and 12.41 %, respectively. The mean probability of false detection (POFD) values were 88.66 %, 88.61 %, 92.04 %, 69.9 %, and 67.69 %, respectively. Overall, the Sentinel-5P AAI has the highest POCD in DEs but is unstable. At the same time, it also has a high POFD. The FY-4A/B IDDI has the lowest POCD, but it is relatively stable, and its POFD is low."

They are useful in both fixed stations and mobile monitoring. Yet the performance faces great challenges due to environmental impacts and long-term drifts. Here, we conducted 30 months of co-located observations using such sensors with a reference instrument. After corrections of environmental impacts and drifts, the accuracy reached 1–3 ppm. We recommend standard gas calibration within 3–6 months. 
 Low-cost, medium-precision sensor (LCS) networks have emerged as a promising approach for CO2 monitoring under complex urban emission conditions. However, the field performance of these LCSs faces significant challenges from environmental factors (e.g., temperature, humidity) and long-term drifts caused by sensor degradation (e.g., light source aging). In this study, we performed 30 months of co-located observations using LCS units (named SENSE-IAP) alongside a Picarro reference analyzer to evaluate long-term field performance, which is essential for the correction and validation of mid–low-cost CO2 observation networks. The environmental correction system we developed effectively corrected the impact of daily environmental changes, which reduced the root mean square errors (RMSEs) from 5.9 ± 1.2 to 1.6 ± 0.5 ppm for SENSE-IAP. The corrections remained robust against seasonal environmental changes, maintaining daily RMSE typically within 1–3 ppm throughout the 30 months of observation. Long-term drifts, commonly occurred in LCS, produced biases of up to 27.9 ppm over 2 years. Furthermore, seasonal drift cycle contributed up to 25 ppm RMSE after 6 months of deployment. Although the environmental correction system could not address these errors, linear interpolation effectively calibrated the long-term drift, reducing the 30-month RMSE to 2.4 ± 0.2 ppm. To improve the accuracy of high-density CO2 networks using such LCSs, we recommend maintaining a calibration frequency preferably within 3 months and not exceeding 6 months, with optimal calibration performed during both winter and summer to ensure accuracy within 5 ppm. These findings indicate that SENSE-IAP instruments can operate long-term without requiring a return to the laboratory for re-calibration or frequent field standard gas calibration, thereby substantially reducing time, labor, and financial costs."

Moreover, a semi-automated code was also developed, which can be used to create a burn severity atlas of any other region in the world. The maps of this atlas can be used not only in fields related to fire ecology and management but also within research areas related to air, water, and soil. 
 Long-term burn severity assessment can support better pre- and post-fire management plans. In this study, the Portuguese Burn Severity Atlas was created, containing historical fires in Portugal from 1984 to 2022. As prerequisites, fire data were gathered and delimited for all years. Due to the availability of satellite images, for different years, different imageries from Landsat sensors (30 m) were applied. Exploratory analysis showed that burn severity estimates are significantly affected by the time lag between the satellite imagery acquisition and the fire date. We explicitly incorporated the effect of time lag into the degradation of burn severity estimates in the selection of the most suitable pre- and post-fire satellite images for each fire. Using Google Earth Engine, burn severity estimates were calculated for fires that were equal to or larger than 100 ha and that occurred from 1984 to 2022 with known dates (valid fires). Different indices were calculated, such as the differenced normalized burn ratio (dNBR), the relative dNBR (RdNBR), the relativized burn ratio (RBR), and a burn severity index that combines the dNBR with the enhanced vegetation index (dNBR-EVI). Overall, in Portugal, 4.85×106 ha burned over the 38-year period (1984–2022), with the burned area covering 3.29×106 ha being caused by valid fires (68 %). Among these, a total area of 3.18×106 ha had burn severity estimates via the applied indices (97 % of valid and 66 % of all fires). Results show that Portugal has experienced, on average, “high” burn severity throughout this period, with large percentages of dNBR pixels between 0.419 and 0.66 (32 %) and >0.66 (21 %). Estimates from different burn severity indices provided a more complete representation of the burn severity impacts. This atlas can be accessed at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.12773611 (Jahanianfard et al., 2025) and can be used by researchers to have a better understanding of historical fires and their corresponding impacts on vegetation cover, air, soil, and water quality, as well as to identify the most influential environmental and climatic drivers of burn severity."

Building on this, high‑resolution (0.5° × 0.5°) land surface air temperature (C‑LSAT HRv1) and diurnal temperature range (C‑LDTR HRv1) datasets for 1901–2023 were produced via thin-plate spline interpolation of the climatology fields and adjusted inverse distance weighted interpolation of the anomaly fields. 
 High-resolution climate datasets are of critical importance for the comprehension of spatial and temporal variations in climate and hydrology. However, their development is significantly influenced by the availability, density, and quality of observational data. Building on the China global land surface air temperature 2.0 (C-LSAT 2.0) station data, we collected and integrated nearly 3000 additional station observations and conducted quality control and homogenization processing to complete the updates to the C-LSAT 2.1 dataset. The coverage of the C-LSAT 2.1 dataset has been significantly enhanced, further improving the representativeness of global land diurnal temperature range (DTR) data with greater spatial heterogeneity. Compared to C-LSAT 2.0, C-LSAT 2.1 shows consistent overall trends, except for a slight post-2010 increase for the Southern Hemisphere LSAT anomaly. Furthermore, we employed a “thin-plate spline (climatology) and adjusted inverse distance weighted (anomaly fields)” technical framework to develop a high-resolution (0.5°×0.5°) LSAT (C-LSAT HRv1) and DTR (C-LDTR HRv1) dataset covering January 1901–December 2023. Apart from discrepancies in 1901–1950 due to the limited number of observational stations, the C-LSAT HRv1 and C-LDTR HRv1 datasets effectively capture global and regional variation patterns for subsequent periods.

The U.S. Department of Energy Atmospheric Radiation Measurement user facility has been making atmospheric measurements since the early 1990s, including measurements of turbulent fluxes using two well-established methods: the energy balance Bowen ratio and eddy covariance. This paper documents key aspects of these datasets, including their history, changes through time, and best use practices. 
 Processes mediating the coupling of terrestrial, aquatic, biospheric, and atmospheric systems influence weather, climate, and ecosystem dynamics via transfer of energy, momentum, water, and carbon (or other species). These exchange processes are quantified by measurements of near-surface turbulent fluxes. Understanding processes at these interfaces provides insight toward understanding and predicting current and future states within the Earth system. The Atmospheric Radiation Measurement (ARM) user facility has been conducting measurements of near-surface turbulent fluxes since the early 1990s at long-term fixed locations and shorter-term mobile deployments across the Earth. ARM has utilized two established methods for conducting these measurements: energy balance Bowen ratio (EBBR) and eddy covariance (EC). Primary measurements from the former include sensible and latent heat flux, while the latter also measures fluxes of momentum and carbon (primarily carbon dioxide, with methane fluxes measured at two locations to date). The EBBR systems have been deployed at 22 locations, and, to date, the EC systems have been deployed at over 50 sites, with plans for additional novel site locations in the future. Herein, the history, evolution, and key aspects of these instrument systems are documented, along with information on data quality assurance and post-processing, as well as best use practices. Additionally, three data validation experiments were recently conducted, and their key findings are summarized.

 Scale analysis based on coarse graining has been proposed recently as an alternative to Fourier analysis. It is now broadly used to analyze energy spectra and energy transfers in eddy-resolving ocean simulations. However, for data from unstructured-mesh models it requires interpolation to a regular grid. We present a high-performance Python implementation of an alternative coarse-graining method which relies on implicit filters using discrete Laplacians. This method can work on arbitrary (structured or unstructured) meshes and is applicable to the direct output of unstructured-mesh ocean circulation atmosphere models. The computation is split into two phases: preparation and solving. The first one is specific only to the mesh. This allows for auxiliary arrays that are then computed to be reused, significantly reducing the computation time. The second part consists of sparse matrix algebra and solving the linear system. Our implementation is accelerated by GPUs to achieve excellent performance and scalability. This results in processing data based on meshes with more than 10 million surface vertices in a matter of seconds. As an illustration, the method is applied to compute spatial spectra of ocean currents from high-resolution FESOM2 simulations."

We present a high-resolution (~10 km) ocean model that simulates seasonal and year-to-year variability in ocean, including currents, oxygen levels, and phytoplankton growth. This model is a powerful tool to study how climate change and human activities influence the northern Indian Ocean, which can be used for marine resource applications and management. 
 We introduce and evaluate the regional ocean model MOM6-COBALT-IND12 version 1 coupling the MOM6 ocean dynamics model to the Carbon, Ocean Biogeochemistry and Lower Trophics (COBALT) biogeochemical model at a horizontal resolution of 1/12°. The model covers the northern Indian Ocean (from 8.6° S to the northern continental boundaries), central to the livelihoods and economies of countries that comprise about one-third of the world’s population. We demonstrate that the model effectively captures the key physical and biogeochemical basin-scale features related to seasonal monsoon reversal, interannual Indian Ocean Dipole and multi-decadal variability, as well as intraseasonal and fine-scale variability (e.g., eddies and planetary waves), which are all essential for accurately simulating patterns of coastal upwelling, primary productivity, temperature, salinity, and oxygen levels. Well represented features include the timing and amplitude of the monsoonal blooms triggered by summer coastal upwelling and winter mixing, the strong contrast between the high evaporation/high salinity Arabian Sea and high precipitation/high runoff/low salinity Bay of Bengal, the seasonality of the Great Whirl gyre and coastal Kelvin upwelling/downwelling waves, as well as the physical and biogeochemical patterns associated with intraseasonal and interannual variability. Quantitatively, the model exhibits relatively small biases, as reflected by root mean square error (RMSE) values in key variables: sea surface temperature (0.25–0.3 °C), mixed layer depth (7–8.09 m), sea level anomaly (0.02 m), sea surface salinity (0.53–0.71 psu), vertical chlorophyll (0.03–0.3 mg m−3), subsurface temperature (0.33 °C), and subsurface salinity (0.07 psu). A major model bias (16 µmol kg−1 of oxygen) is the larger oxygen minimum zone simulated in the Bay of Bengal, a common challenge of ocean and Earth system models in this region. This bias was partly mitigated by improving the representation of the export and burial of organic detritus to the deep ocean (e.g., sinking speed, riverine lithogenic material inputs that protect organic material and burial fraction), and water-column denitrification (e.g., nitrate-based respiration at higher oxygen levels) using observational constraints. These results indicate that the regional MOM6-COBALT-IND12 v1.0 model is well suited for physical and biogeochemical studies on timescales ranging from weeks to decades, in addition to supporting marine resource applications and management in the northern Indian Ocean."

 Our study evaluates the impacts of an alternate snow cover fraction (SCF) parameterization on snow simulation in the Canadian Land Surface Scheme Including Biogeochemical Cycles (CLASSIC). Three reanalysis-based meteorological datasets are used to drive the model to account for uncertainties in the forcing data. While the default parameterization assumes a simple linear relationship between SCF and snow depth with no dependence on topography, the alternate parameterization accounts for the topographic effects of sub-grid terrain on SCF. We show that the alternate parameterization improves SCF simulated in CLASSIC during winter and spring in mountainous areas for all three choices of meteorological datasets. Annual mean bias, unbiased root mean squared area, and correlation improve by 75 %, 32 %, and 7 % when evaluated with MODIS SCF observations over the Northern Hemisphere. We also demonstrate that the improvements to simulated SCF lead to further improvements in variables related to surface radiation, energy fluxes, and the water cycle. Finally, we link relative biases in the meteorological forcing data to differences in simulated snow water equivalent and SCF. Assessment of simulations with different combinations of SCF parameterizations and meteorological datasets reveals the large impact of meteorological forcing on snow simulation in CLASSIC. Two out of the three meteorological datasets were bias-adjusted using observation-based datasets. However, simulations forced by the dataset without bias correction outperform relative to simulations forced by datasets with bias correction, suggesting that there are large uncertainties in the observation-based datasets and/or methods used for bias correction. This study underscores the importance of accounting for topographic effects of sub-grid terrain and accurate meteorological forcing on snow simulation in land surface models."

A trend reversal is identified: the amount, intensity and frequency of EHP all decreased during 1988–2003 but increased in 2004–2023, with the amount and frequency exhibiting significant rapid growth.

Comparable 87Sr/86Sr ratios for different tree species, cambial ages and root systems suggest that bioavailable Sr in wood is little affected by biotic factors.

This study evaluates representation of the MBL and clouds in the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) version 2. This study compares the E3SM simulation results with remote sensing and reanalysis data during the Cloud System Evolution in the Trades (CSET) field campaign to better understand the stratocumulus‐to‐cumulus cloud transition (SCT) over the northeast Pacific. E3SM results are extracted along the CSET Lagrangian trajectories. The comparison shows that the E3SM simulation applying horizontal wind nudging performs well in reproducing thermodynamic variables of the MBL and evolution trends of cloud variables along the trajectories. However, substantial overestimations of aerosol and cloud drop number Nd $\left({N}_{d}\right)$ are observed, which is explained as an issue with version 2 of the model. Cloud fraction (CF) does decrease from the Californian coast to Hawaii in the E3SM simulation, but most CF values indicate either an overcast or almost clear sky, which differs from satellite and reanalysis data. The effect of Nd ${N}_{d}$ overestimation on CF evolution is assessed via prescribed‐Nd ${N}_{d}$ simulations. Those simulations with Nd ${N}_{d}$ modifications show negligible CF changes. A comparison of estimated inversion strength (EIS) also shows that the simulated EIS values are similar to those of reanalysis data. Our study suggests that cloud macrophysics and boundary layer processes are more important in improving the simulation to capture the SCT than refining the model's thermodynamics or cloud microphysics."

Aknine,Toward Real‐Time Assessment of Infrasound Event Detection Capability Using Deep Learning‐Based Transmission Loss Estimation,"Accurate modeling of infrasound transmission loss is crucial for assessing the performance of the International Monitoring System, which monitors compliance with the Comprehensive Nuclear‐Test‐Ban Treaty by detecting atmospheric explosions. This modeling supports the design and maintenance of the operating monitoring network. State‐of‐the‐art propagation modeling tools enable transmission loss to be finely simulated using atmospheric models. However, the computational cost prohibits the exploration of a large parameter space in operational monitoring applications. To address this, recent studies made use of a deep learning algorithm capable of making transmission loss predictions almost instantaneously. However, the use of nudged atmospheric models leads to an incomplete representation of the medium, and the absence of temperature as an input makes the algorithm incompatible with long‐range propagation. In this study, we address these limitations by using both wind and temperature fields as inputs to a neural network, simulated up to 130 km altitude and 4,000 km distance. We exploit convolutional and recurrent layers to capture spatially and range‐dependent features embedded in realistic atmospheric models, improving the overall performance. The neural network reaches an average error of 4 dB compared to full parabolic equation simulations and provides epistemic and data‐related uncertainty estimates. Its evaluation on the 2022 Hunga Tonga‐Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption demonstrates its prediction capability using atmospheric conditions and frequencies not included in the training.

Previous laboratory and modeling studies have suggested that chemical aging of OA slows at lower temperatures due to increased particle viscosity, which hampers the diffusion of oxidants within the particle phase. However, evidence from field measurements has been lacking. For tackling the issue, we conducted atmospheric measurements of the molecular‐level chemical composition of OA using an online instrument in Beijing during wintertime. Unsaturated fatty acids from cooking such as oleic acid were detected. Apparent second‐order reaction rate constants (k2) of oleic acid with O3 were retrieved from the data, especially focusing on oleic acid emitted during dinnertime. The k2 values measured at cold winter nights in Beijing were found to be lower by an order of magnitude than those observed from residential cooking experiments at room temperature. The difference is quantitatively consistent with the temperature dependence of k2 for simulated cooking aerosol in previous laboratory studies. This result suggests that the chemical aging of ambient OA is influenced by temperature‐induced changes in viscosity, underscoring the need to account for temperature effects when estimating the fate of OA across the broad atmospheric temperature range."

Even within this relatively small area, the combination of natural climate variability and anthropogenic climate change creates significant spatial variation in extreme climate events. This study analyzes mean seasonal temperature and precipitation trends in the WMed using ECMWF Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) data from 1951 to 2020 taking into consideration the climatic heterogeneity of the region. A non‐hierarchical K‐Means clustering method was applied to delineate nine climatically homogeneous regions within the WMed. A timescale decomposition analysis was then conducted to disentangle long‐term, decadal, and interannual variability components of seasonal data. Results indicate that long‐term trends explain most of the total observed variance in temperature (∼65%), whereas interannual natural variability dominates observed precipitation (∼60%). These patterns vary seasonally, with the strongest warming trends along the Mediterranean coast of the Iberian Peninsula and northern Africa in summer and the most significant drying trends in the southwestern Mediterranean during both summer and winter. The influence of different modes of climate variability in the observed trends is assessed and appears to contribute to winter drying, but no evidence was found of its influence on warming trends. This study lays a foundation for future climate change detection and attribution efforts in the WMed, emphasizing the need for sub‐regional analysis due to the region's pronounced heterogeneity."

Here, we present an observing system simulation experiment framework to quantitatively evaluate a potential measurement network that combines column and surface observations for estimating urban CH4 emissions. We evaluate the observing systems from multiple perspectives, focusing on their ability to estimate monthly and interannual variability, and to attribute emissions to specific sectors. A multivariate linear regression analysis was performed to identify the sources of uncertainties in the posterior fluxes. A 10% annual rise in CH4 emissions from 2021 to 2023 was assumed to evaluate the capability of the observing system to capture interannual variability and trends. We found that MUCCnet, the world's first permanent urban ground‐based column greenhouse gas network with 5 stations, was able to capture the monthly and interannual variability and trends of CH4 emissions. The significant uncertainties in emission estimates from MUCCnet‐only inversions can be attributed to strong emissions from the Agriculture sector, which are far from the network deployment sites, or to limited observation coverage due to meteorological conditions. Surface in situ observations within the joint network can effectively reduce these uncertainties. The uncertainties in total CH4 emission estimates can be reduced by using observations from MUCCnet and a surface in situ network, leveraging the complementarity between the two platforms. Using the joint network configuration, the interannual variability and trend of CH4 emissions can be detected with low uncertainties."

Merino,Evaluation of WRF Model Performance for Hailstorms in Southern France Using DPR‐GPM Data,"Understanding and better predicting severe meteorological phenomena such as hailstorms is increasingly important because of their capacity to cause major socioeconomic losses. We analyzed seven case studies with confirmed hail on the ground. To do so, we used four microphysical parameterizations of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model (horizontal resolution 3 km) that incorporate hail formation. Predictive variables for hailstorm severity were extracted from the Dual‐Frequency Precipitation Radar‐Global Precipitation Measurement (DPR‐GPM) sensor, a novel and effective tool for monitoring extreme events. The main objective was to evaluate WRF model data by comparing them with DPR‐GPM observations during hailstorm days in southern France. For this, the SAL score was used, an object‐oriented method that robustly evaluates the simulations. To deepen the analysis, other metrics were calculated. The selection of microphysical parameterizations for simulating hail is challenging because of their specific assumptions and dependence on other model parameterizations. However, for southern France, the best parameterization for simulating maximum reflectivity in the vertical profile and vertically integrated precipitation water in the solid phase was the Milbrandt‐Yau Double‐Moment 7‐class. For vertically integrated precipitation water in the liquid phase, it was the WRF Single‐Moment 7‐class (WSM7), with WRF Double‐Moment 7‐class (WDM7) standing out in the localization of all three variables. In contrast, the NSSL 2–Moment 7‐class scheme generally showed poorer performance in hail prediction and simulation of the analyzed variables. Identifying optimal parameterizations for hailstorm prediction in southern France will enhance future simulations of extreme weather in the Mediterranean."

However, the impact of the boundary layer jets (BLJs), with their unique low‐level vertical wind shear structures and moisture transport properties, on cold pools remains incompletely understood. This study utilizes observations from the 356‐m high Shenzhen Meteorological Tower to compare cold pool characteristics under BLJ and non‐BLJ conditions during April to June from 2018 to 2020. A total of 54 cold pools are identified, with 26 influenced by BLJs. BLJ‐related cold pools typically exhibit weaker average temperature drops, more pronounced decreases in specific humidity, and higher turbulence transport compared to those unrelated to BLJs. The enhanced moisture transport by BLJs constrains rainfall evaporation, resulting in weaker cold pools. In addition, the strong wind shear associated with BLJs promotes upward energy transport and turbulence, further weakening the intensity of cold pool. These distinctions are particularly pronounced in cold pools associated with mesoscale convective systems rather than individual convective cells. These findings provide valuable insights into the complex interactions among cold pools, BLJs, and convection in South China."

 Advancing electromechanical resonators towards terahertz frequencies opens vast bandwidths for phononic signal processing. In quantum phononics, mechanical resonators at these frequencies can remain in their quantum ground state even at kelvin temperatures, obviating the need for millikelvin cooling typically required for GHz resonators. However, electrical actuation and detection at such high frequencies are challenging, primarily due to device miniaturization needed to support acoustic waves with nanometer-scale wavelengths. This requires thinning piezoelectric films to a thickness that matches the acoustic wavelength. In this work, we reduce the thickness of lithium niobate from 300 nm to 67 nm through several stages, and fabricate suspended Lamb-wave resonators at each thickness level. These resonators achieve resonant frequencies of nearly 220 GHz, doubling the previous record and approaching the terahertz threshold. While ultrathin films exhibit a clear advantage in frequency gains, they also experience increased acoustic losses. Our results suggest that future advances in terahertz nanomechanics will critically rely on mitigating surface defects in sub-100 nm thin films.

 Heterostructures of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offer unique opportunities in optoelectronics due to their strong light-matter interaction and the formation of dipolar interlayer excitons. Introducing a twist angle or lattice mismatch between layers creates a periodic moiré potential that significantly reshapes the energy landscape and introduces a high-dimensional complexity absent in aligned bilayers. Recent experimental advances have enabled direct observation and control of interlayer excitons in such moiré-patterned systems, yet a microscopic theoretical framework capturing both their thermalization and spatiotemporal dynamics remains lacking. Here, we address this challenge by developing a predictive, material-specific many-body model that tracks exciton dynamics across time, space, and momentum, fully accounting for the moiré potential and the complex non-parabolic exciton band structure. Surprisingly, we reveal that flat bands, which typically trap excitons, can significantly enhance exciton propagation. This counterintuitive behavior emerges from the interplay between the flat-band structure giving rise to a bottleneck effect for exciton relaxation and thermal occupation dynamics creating hot excitons. Our work not only reveals the microscopic mechanisms behind the enhanced propagation but also enables the control of exciton transport via twist-angle engineering. These insights lay the foundation for next-generation moiré-based optoelectronic and quantum technologies.

 Cyclic oligonucleotide-based antiphage signaling systems (CBASS) are widespread bacterial immune systems that trigger host suicide via cyclic nucleotide-activated effectors. The predominant strategy to induce cell death in CBASS is membrane disruption. Here, we demonstrate that patatin-like phospholipase CapV, the most abundant CBASS effector, relocates and cleaves membrane phospholipids at the cell pole upon 3’3’-cGAMP binding, inducing polarized membrane disruption and cell death. Using cryo-EM, we reveal that apo-CapV adopts both dimeric and tetrameric states, with its phospholipid-binding pocket occluded and locked in an inactive conformation. Binding to 3’3’-cGAMP induces filamentation and substantial conformational change of CapV, enhancing membrane binding via electrostatic interactions between its interspaced basic surfaces and the negatively charged phosphate moieties of phospholipids. Simultaneously, the rearrangement opens the phospholipid-binding pocket, enabling the accommodation of two fatty acid chains of phospholipid within distinct hydrophobic pockets. Our findings reveal a filament-dependent activation mechanism for phospholipase-mediated membrane disruption during antiviral response.

Here, the authors demonstrate 3D-localized optical merons by imprinting polarization textures onto the momentum-energy space of ultrafast light pulses. 
 Skyrmions, topologically non-trivial localized spin structures, are fertile ground for exploring emergent phenomena in condensed matter physics and next-generation magnetic-memory technologies. Although magnetics and optics readily lend themselves to two-dimensional realizations of spin texture, only recently have breakthroughs brought forth three-dimensional (3D) magnetic skyrmions, whereas their optical counterparts have eluded observation to date because their realization requires precise control over the spatiotemporal spectrum. Here, we demonstrate freely propagating 3D-localized optical skyrmionic structures with a non-trivial topological profile by imprinting meron polarization texture on open and closed spectral surfaces in the momentum-energy space of an ultrafast optical wave packet. Precise control over the spatiotemporal polarization texture of light – a key requisite for synthesizing 3D optical merons – is the product of synergy between novel methodologies in the modulation of light jointly in space and time, digital holography, and large-area birefringent metasurfaces. Our work advances the fields of polarization optics and topological photonics and may inspire new developments in imaging, metrology, optical communications, and quantum technologies.

Here, taking the well-studied van der Waals magnet, Fe3GeTe2, Li, Ding, Wang, and coauthors use NV-centre based magnetometry to study critical fluctuations. 
 Critical fluctuations play a crucial role in determining spin orders in low-dimensional magnetic materials. However, experimentally linking these fluctuations to scaling theory-and thereby uncovering insights into spin interaction models-remains a challenge. Here, we utilize a nitrogen-vacancy center-based quantum decoherence imaging technique to probe critical fluctuations in the van der Waals magnet Fe3GeTe2. Our data reveal that critical fluctuations produce a random magnetic field, with noise spectra undergoing significant changes near the critical temperature. To explain this phenomenon, we developed a theoretical framework showing that the spectral density exhibits 1/f noise characteristics near the critical temperature, transitioning to white noise behavior away from this regime. By experimentally adjusting the sample-to-diamond distance, we identified the crossover temperature between these two noise types. These findings offer an approach to studying phase transition dynamics through critical fluctuations, enabling precise determination of critical exponents associated with long-range correlations. This methodology holds promise for advancing our understanding of critical phenomena across diverse physical systems.

 Anecdotal evidence has suggested an association between psychiatric drugs and psoriasis, but consensus is absent due to contradicting reports, and the mechanism remains poorly defined. Here, we investigate the function of serotonin 2A receptor (HTR2A), a receptor commonly targeted by psychiatric drugs, in regulating psoriasis. HTR2A antagonistic drugs worsen psoriatic outcome, and HTR2A modulation reduces psoriatic inflammation. Using the Imiquimod-induced psoriasiform model, HTR2A-deficient mice manifest exacerbated inflammation. Hematopoietic cells, particularly monocyte-derived Langerhans cells (moLC), are involved in this phenotype. Mechanistically, the exacerbated inflammation is due to increased interleukin-23 (IL-23) secretion, and HTR2A suppresses this by inhibiting activation of the non-canonical NFκB pathway. Serotonin is the putative agonist modulating HTR2A, attenuating psoriatic inflammation. Lastly, our findings in mice are also validated clinically. Our data demonstrate that serotonin modulates HTR2A, attenuating psoriatic inflammation by suppressing IL-23 secretion via inhibiting the non-canonical NFκB pathway in moLCs.

 Volcanic eruptions are among the strongest climate drivers, yet their regional impacts on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) remain poorly constrained. Post-eruption amplified winter cooling in MENA is often attributed to a volcanically forced positive North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO), but the concurrent occurrence of El Niño–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) complicates attribution. Furthermore, summer climatic responses, including tropical warming and mid-latitude cooling, remain underexplored. Here, we present a pioneering research using a high-top coupled climate model (MIROC6) to assess volcanic-induced ENSO–NAO interactions and their regional climate impacts. We demonstrate that volcanic-induced NAO variability is the primary driver of post-eruption MENA winter cooling, with El Niño acting as a modulator rather than a fundamental trigger. We further reveal distinct summer climate anomalies, including suppressed precipitation over the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). These findings underscore the importance of high-top models to resolve stratospheric influences on post-volcanic climate variability."

 Coastal sea ecosystems are increasingly threatened by global change and human activities. Our understanding of these changes is limited, especially in dynamic coastal regions lacking thick sediment sequences. Iron-manganese concretions, biogeochemical precipitates on the seafloor, grow in non-depositional coastal areas and record numerous marine processes and environmental variability. Establishing reliable geochronology for these precipitates has been challenging. We combine anthropogenic lead accumulation, cobalt chronometry, and radiocarbon dating to develop a high-resolution Bayesian age model for a rapidly growing iron-manganese concretion from the Baltic Sea. The concretion core formed ca. 11,000 cal. BP, with overgrown material showing successively younger ages from 7500 years ago to recent decades. Analyses of microstructure, magnetic microscopy, and bulk mineral magnetic properties, trace elements, and iron isotopic composition reveal that the concretion records environmental variability over the past 7000 years. Our study may serve as a benchmark for paleoenvironmental records from coastal iron-manganese concretions.

 The gap between climate pledges and action remains wide, including in the United States, where politicization and misconceptions hinder action. Interactive simulations could help overcome this gap by enhancing knowledge about climate change and motivating action. But little is known about whether this approach increases knowledge about climate solutions or whether such gains persist over time and foster real-world action. Here we analyze the impact of the En-ROADS Climate Action Simulation on participants’ understanding of high-leverage climate solutions, affective engagement, intent to act, and real-world action. Data from 1246 participants show gains in climate knowledge and engagement, sustained over 6 months, and fostering real-world actions. These gains are not influenced by participants’ sociodemographic traits or sociopolitical values. These results, together with the simulation’s accessibility and adaptability to diverse settings, highlight its potential to foster informed climate action.

 Due to the negative environmental consequences of current land-use, and land’s important role regarding carbon, biodiversity and food security, there is an urgent interest in reforming land-use. Policy objectives for tree planting to sequester carbon and the protection of land to increase biodiversity require land reallocation, which leads to inevitable trade-offs. Here, we evaluate the trade-offs between three objectives for rural land: agricultural/forestry production, carbon sequestration and biodiversity, by calculating metrics for these three objectives on a 500 m grid covering Great Britain. We use a multi-objective optimisation that allows us to explore the full option space of possible land conversions and identify the land allocations that entail limited trade-offs. Our results show that current land-use in Great Britain is far from optimal for any combination of objectives. We identify the locations where carbon sequestration and biodiversity can be substantially improved without compromising overall agricultural production, provided conversions are located carefully.
