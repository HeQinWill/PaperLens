 This study focuses on advancing individual tree crown (ITC) segmentation in lidar data, developing a sensor- and platform-agnostic deep learning model transferable across a spectrum of dense laser scanning datasets from drone (ULS), to terrestrial (TLS), and mobile (MLS) laser scanning data. In a field where transferability across different data characteristics has been a longstanding challenge, this research marks a step towards versatile, efficient, and comprehensive 3D forest scene analysis.Central to this study is model performance evaluation based on platform type (ULS vs. MLS) and data density. This involved five distinct scenarios, each integrating different combinations of input training data, including ULS, MLS, and their augmented versions through random subsampling, to assess the model's transferability to varying resolutions and efficacy across different canopy layers. The core of the model, inspired by the PointGroup architecture, is a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with dedicated prediction heads for semantic and instance segmentation. The model underwent comprehensive validation on publicly available, machine learning-ready point cloud datasets. Additional analyses assessed model adaptability to different resolutions and performance across canopy layers.Our results reveal that point cloud random subsampling is an effective augmentation strategy and improves model performance and transferability. The model trained using the most aggressive augmentation, including point clouds as sparse as 10 points m−2, showed best performance and was found to be transferable to sparse lidar data and boosts detection and segmentation of codominant and dominated trees. Notably, the model showed consistent performance for point clouds with densities >50 points m−2 but exhibited a drop in performance at the sparsest level (10 points m−2), mainly due to increased omission rates. Benchmarking against current state-of-the-art methods revealed boosts of up to 20% in the detection rates, indicating the model's superior performance on multiple open benchmark datasets. Further, our experiments also set new performance baselines for the other public datasets. The comparison highlights the model's superior segmentation skill, mainly due to better detection and segmentation of understory trees below the canopy, with reduced computational demands compared to other recent methods.In conclusion, the present study demonstrates that it is indeed feasible to train a sensor-agnostic model that can handle diverse laser scanning data, going beyond current sensor-specific methodologies. Further, our study sets a new baseline for tree segmentation, especially in complex forest structures. By advancing the state-of-the-art in forest lidar analysis, our work also lays the foundation for future innovations in ecological modeling and forest management.",Maciej Wielgosz;Stefano Puliti;Binbin Xiang;Konrad Schindler;Rasmus Astrup,这篇论文主要关注的是利用激光扫描数据进行树木分割，并开发了一种传感器和平台无关的深度学习模型，该模型可以应用于无人机、地面和移动激光扫描数据。论文重点研究了模型在不同平台和数据密度下的性能，并评估了模型的可移植性和对不同冠层层的有效性。研究结果表明，该模型在树木检测和分割方面表现出色，尤其是在复杂森林结构中，为森林管理和生态建模提供了新的方法。论文与大气环境遥感技术没有直接关系。

 Information on tree species across various spatial scales, from an individual tree to a forest stand and the broader landscape, contributes to an accurate and thorough understanding of forest conditions either as an individual characteristic or as an input of species-dependent models. However, tree species recognition is one of the most challenging tasks in forest remote sensing studies, due to the complexity of species compositions and canopy structures of forests, e.g., both cross-species similarities and intra-species variations commonly exist in spectral-, texture-, and structure- domains. Over the past two decades, the interest in using close-range sensing for tree species recognition has been rapidly growing. Recent research has highlighted the needs to further develop species recognition methods to elevate their performance in comparison with established remote sensing approaches, and to address new questions arising from spatial resolutions, data coverages, viewing geometries, and other data characteristics. This work provides an overview of the state-of-the-art of tree species recognition from close-range sensing data. The work summarizes the research works in the past decade, reviews the state of research, discusses prominent challenges, investigates impact factors, research gaps, and new potentials. Specifically, data from various sources, the features derived from each type of data, methodologies applied, and the targeted species are reviewed in detail. Relevant machine learning (ML) approaches are grouped into conventional ML and deep-learning (DL) categories. In each category, the reported studies/results are reviewed with respect to the spectral, spatial, and temporal domains of the used data sources, e.g., sensor and platform. Despite significant efforts in the field, the issues of automation, reliability, and robustness of the algorithms have only been partially resolved. The crucial elements in algorithm design what this work found and is worth careful consideration include forest types and stand conditions, seasonal variability and phenology, data characteristics and the corresponding feature selections, and the methodology. Future studies are recommended to focus on the fusion of multi-source data including passive and active multispectral data to integrate the spectral and structural information, the use of time-series data to enhance the role of phenological variances in species recognition, and the development of unsupervised DL techniques to improve the recognition accuracy and efficiency.

 Changes in the net carbon sink of boreal forests constitute a major source of uncertainty in the future global carbon budget and, hence, climate change projections. The annual net ecosystem exchange of carbon dioxide (CO2) controlling the terrestrial carbon stock results from the small difference between respiratory CO2 release and the photosynthetic CO2 uptake by vegetation. The boreal forest, and the boreal biome in general, is regarded as a persistent and even increasing net carbon sink. However, decreases in photosynthetic CO2 uptake and/or concurrent increases in respiratory CO2 release under a changing climate may turn boreal forests from a net sink to a net source of CO2. Here, we assessed the interannual variability of the boreal forest net CO2 sink-source strength and its two component fluxes from 1981 to 2018. Our remote sensing approach - trained by net CO2 flux observations at eddy covariance sites across the circumpolar boreal forests - employs satellite-derived retrievals of snowmelt timing, landscape freeze-thaw status, and yearly maximum estimates of the normalized difference vegetation index as a proxy for peak vegetation productivity. Our results suggest that for the period 2000–2018, the mean annual evergreen boreal forest CO2 photosynthetic uptake (gross primary productivity) was 2.8±0.2 Pg C y−1 (1.6±0.1 Pg C y−1 for Eurasia and 1.2±0.1 Pg C y−1 for North America). In contrast to earlier studies results obtained here do not indicate a clear increasing trend in the circumpolar evergreen boreal forest CO2 sink. The increase in photosynthetic CO2 uptake is compensated by increasing respiratory releases with both component fluxes showing considerable interannual variabilities.",Jouni Pulliainen;Mika Aurela;Tuula Aalto;Kristin Böttcher;Juval Cohen;Chris Derksen;Martin Heimann;Manuel Helbig;Pasi Kolari;Anna Kontu;Alisa Krasnova;Samuli Launiainen;Juha Lemmetyinen;Hannakaisa Lindqvist;Anders Lindroth;Annalea Lohila;Kari Luojus;Ivan Mammarella;Tiina Markkanen;Elma Nevala,这篇论文研究了北半球寒带森林的碳汇变化，利用卫星数据和地面观测数据，分析了1981年至2018年间寒带森林的净生态系统碳交换量，以及光合作用和呼吸作用的年际变化。研究发现，虽然寒带森林的光合作用吸收的二氧化碳量有所增加，但呼吸作用释放的二氧化碳量也随之增加，导致净碳汇的增加被抵消。该研究表明，卫星遥感技术可以有效地监测寒带森林的碳循环变化，为全球碳循环研究提供重要数据支持。

 Global navigation satellite system reflectometry (GNSS-R) has emerged as a new technique to provide L-band bistatic measurements for ocean wind speed retrieval, in which traditional geophysical model functions (GMFs) or shallow neural networks (NNs) are normally used. However, it is still challenging to identify and consider all relevant parameters in the GMF. Meanwhile, NN models face limitations due to the degradation problem, which restricts their depth and consequently their performance. Furthermore, the interpretation of NN models for GNSS-R wind retrieval is another issue. To this end, we propose a residual fully connected network (RFCN) fusing auxiliary information such as geometry, receiver gain, significant wave height, and current speed with track-wise corrected σ0. Referred to the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecast (ECMWF) ERA5 wind product, the root mean square error (RMSE) and bias of RFCN winds are 1.031 m/s and -0.0003 m/s, respectively, with a 6% improvement in RMSE compared to debiased NOAA Cyclone Global Navigation Satellite System (CYGNSS) Version 1.2 (V1.2) wind speed retrieval. Moreover, in an intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) area with large current speeds, the RMSE and bias are 1.006 m/s and -0.022 m/s: an improvement of 11.6% and 87.9% compared to debiased NOAA CYGNSS V1.2 winds. The bias ‘strips’ in these areas are nearly eliminated. Daily averaged error analyses also demonstrate that RFCN winds are more robust and consistent with ECMWF winds. For wind speeds larger than 20 m/s, referred to Soil Moisture Active Passive (SMAP) Level 3 final wind products, the RMSE and bias of fine-tuning RFCN (FT_RFCN) winds are reduced by 25.7% and 91.5% compared to NOAA winds. Finally, the RMSE and bias of retrievals in tropical cyclones, measured by Stepped Frequency Microwave Radiometer (SFMR) during 2021-2022, reveal an improvement of 3.5% and 21.2% compared to NOAA winds.

 This paper is the second part of companion papers describing the development of GRASP approach for aerosol and surface retrieval from Sentinel-5P/TROPOMI. Here we focus on the S5P/TROPOMI GRASP aerosol and surface products global validation and systematic intercomparison with other products from independent instruments and algorithms. Specifically, we have validated the S5P/TROPOMI GRASP, Suomi-NPP/VIIRS DB and MODIS/TERRA DT + DB aerosol products with the ground-based AERONET referenced measurements using the same methodology and intercompare the validation results. In addition, the global pixel-to-pixel intercomparisons of the aerosol products (AOD, fine/coarse mode AOD and SSA) are performed over different surfaces, i.e., ocean and land surface with different NDVIs. Besides, we compared the S5P/TROPOMI GRASP, MODIS MCD43 surface BRDF/albedo as well as OMI, GOME-2 and SCIAMACHY Lambertian-Equivalent Reflectivity (LER) albedo climatology developed by Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute (KNMI) with the surface reference dataset generated based on the synergetic retrieval of AERONET and S5P/TROPOMI measurements.

 A dataset of sub-daily C-band data, acquired with a ground-based synthetic aperture radar, has been used to study soil and vegetation dynamics during a complete growing season in a controlled agricultural test site. The data have been exploited to analyse the rate and sources of decorrelation in the scene, as well as the consequences of the observation conditions of a sub-daily satellite (with either low, medium or geosynchronous orbit): short revisit times, availability of multiple acquisitions during a single day, and shallow observations at some incidence angles. Repeat-pass coherence is found to be less affected by temporal decorrelation when the primary image is acquired during nighttime or the last hours predawn. Regarding the incidence angle, VV has increased sensitivity to certain phenological stages as the incidence angle increases.

 Accurate measurement of water levels is essential for effectively managing reservoirs to proactively mitigate flooding and drought. Nonetheless, the inaccuracies in measurements derived from gauging station and remote sensing images impose constraints to water resource management. In this study, we developed a novel water level estimation model which utilizes solely the altitude of reliable water boundary pixels to improve the accuracy. The enhanced water boundary detection, incorporating preprocessing steps such as image filtering, resampling, and polarization multiplication, was applied to achieve sub-pixel precision in detecting water boundaries. The water boundary pixels located in layover and shadow regions, which could be misidentified due to distortion error, are eliminated based on backward geolocation. Ambiguous water boundaries, potentially indicating land with low intensity, were defined by computing their absolute derivatives, and removed. Finally, to enhance water level precision, the model computed water levels by averaging the altitudes of boundary pixels with weighting factors of local incidence angle, derivatives of detected water boundaries, and altitude distribution. Compared with the previous studies utilizing water boundaries, the proposed model demonstrated outstanding performance in improving the accuracy, up to 1/40th smaller than the spatial resolution of SAR images in Mean Absolute Error (MAE). The validation was executed over the results from >700 Sentinel-1 against the in-situ measurements obtained from multiple reservoirs and streams with significant water level fluctuations in the Korean peninsula. In this process, we found that the water boundaries located on the layover and shadow regions significantly influence the dispersion of altitude of reliable water boundary pixels.

 Mapping and monitoring groundwater-dependant vegetation (GDV) and springs is essential for understanding the dynamics of shallow groundwater systems and for developing ecosystem conservation strategies. While large-scale identification of GDV and springs often relies on mapping excess evaporation, it is low resolution, and it can be prone to false detections over some types of soils and in areas of runoff accumulation. Here a simple, more direct approach for large scale, high resolution GDV mapping is proposed, which is designed to be cost and time efficient. The approach is tested over three catchments of Northern Australia, totalling 290,000 km2. The approach relies on constraining the selection of optical and radar imagery products from Sentinel-1/2 with GRACE Terrestrial Water storage change time-series. GRACE identifies periods of water scarcity across the landscape, which corresponds to higher contrast between the healthy, green GDV and other vegetation populations suffering from droughts. Via an additive masking approach, several combinations of dry-condition vegetation indices are tested, and the effort/efficiency trade-off of using one or a combination of up to four vegetation indices is assessed. Combining InSAR coherence and NDVI is particularly efficient, allowing validation of 80% of datapoints within citizen science records by considering as little as 2.7% of the surface area. While the combination of InSAR coherence and NDWI can also be efficient in some cases, all fully optical or radar combinations of indices are significantly less performant. The different sensitivities of radar and optical sensors allows masking of false positives inherent to each sensing strategy.

 Accurate estimation of sub-surface properties such as moisture content and depth of soil and vegetation layers is crucial for applications spanning sub-surface condition monitoring, precision agriculture, and effective wildfire risk assessment. Soil in nature is often covered by overlaying vegetation and surface organic material, making its characterization challenging. In addition, the estimation of the properties of the overlaying layer is crucial for applications like wildfire risk assessment. This study thus proposes a Bayesian model-updating-based approach for ground penetrating radar (GPR) waveform inversion to predict moisture contents and depths of soil and overlaying material layer. Due to its high correlation with moisture contents, the dielectric permittivity of both layers were predicted with the proposed method, along with other parameters, including depth and electrical conductivity of layers. The proposed Bayesian model updating approach yields probabilistic estimates of these parameters that can provide information about the confidence and uncertainty related to the estimates. The methodology was evaluated for a diverse range of experimental data collected through laboratory and field investigations. Laboratory investigations included variations in soil moisture values, depth of the overlaying surface layer, and coarseness of surface material. The field investigation included measurement of field soil moisture for sixteen days. The results demonstrated predictions consistent with time-domain reflectometry (TDR) measurements and conventional gravimetric tests. The correlation coefficient between predicted soil permittivity and that measured by TDR ranged from 0.84 to 0.99 for the presence of up to 10 cm of overlaying surface layer. The depth of the surface layer could also be accurately predicted for up to 10 cm, while at higher depths, prediction outliers could be reasonably identified from the obtained probability distributions and uncertainty.

 The Atmospheric Laser Doppler Instrument (ALADIN) onboard the Aeolus wind mission was the first High Spectral Resolution Lidar operating in the Ultra Violet (UV) region deployed in space. This study explores and documents the feasibility of deriving ocean optical properties using data from ALADIN. A three steps (i.e. data screening, analytical estimation of the total in-water signal contribution, Look Up Table-based estimation of the in-water attenuation) retrieval algorithm was developped combining data analysis and signal simulations from a radiative transfer model. The algorithm has been implemented using the signal acquired by the Mie channel, and tested for 1-year of Aeolus observations. This approach allowed estimating the first Aeolus derived Ocean Color (OC) products in terms of the total in-water signal contribution and the in-water attenuation term in a spectral region (355 nm) not covered, during Aeolous lifetime, by operational OC products. The validation process involved comparing these products with both Biogeochemical-Argo (BGC-Argo) field measurements and satellite OC dataset distributed by ESA Ocean Color Climate Change Initiative across a set of 7 selected oceanic regions representing diverse open-ocean scenarios. These validation exercises attested the general accordance between OC reference measurements and the proposed Aeolus OC parameters.

 Extracting river networks that are both accurate and topologically connected is important for applications that involve correct routing of material, for example water and sediment, through such networks.

 With the upcoming spaceborne synthetic aperture radar (SAR) missions (BIOMASS, LuTan-1, NISAR, and TanDEM-L), it will become possible to extract vegetation height at a global scale by utilizing spaceborne low-frequency (L- and P-band) polarimetric synthetic aperture radar interferometry (PolInSAR) data. However, in the context of single-baseline parameter retrieval by the random volume over ground (RVoG) model, three main error sources that affect the inversion accuracy should be carefully considered, i.e., the ground scattering contribution, the spatial baseline configuration, and the temporal decorrelation (the main part of non-volume decorrelation). To make the estimation more reliable, several kinds of multibaseline PolInSAR inversion methods have been proposed over the past few years and have achieved improved inversion performances. Dual-baseline inversion effectively avoids the ambiguity of the ground contribution, whereas the performance is highly dependent on the appropriate combination of two spatial baselines as well as the mitigation of the non-volume decorrelation. In this study, we conducted in-depth research into the effect of these influencing factors on dual-baseline inversion, aiming to provide effective guidance on dual-baseline combination selection among multibaseline data. Accordingly, a novel multibaseline inversion scheme (MBLFPI) suitable for low-frequency PolInSAR data is proposed in this paper. The significant advantage of the new method is that the three aforementioned error sources can be taken into account simultaneously, without relying on external data. The proposed scheme was validated using L- and P-band SAR data acquired by the DLR's E-SAR/F-SAR and ONERA's SETHI systems, as well as corresponding light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data collected during the BioSAR-2008, AfriSAR-2016, and TropiSAR-2009 campaigns. A series of experiments was performed to evaluate the applicability and generalizability of the proposed method. The results showed that this innovative scheme produced forest height maps with a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 2.37 m (R2 = 0.88) and 3.13–4.43 m (R2 = 0.35–0.94) in the L-band and P-band scenarios (boreal and tropical forest), respectively, indicating a significant improvement over the three conventional multibaseline methods and pure dual-baseline inversion.

 In this era of global warming, the regular and accurate mapping of vegetation conditions is essential for monitoring ecosystems, climate sustainability and biodiversity. In this context, this work proposes a physics-guided data-driven methodology to invert radiative transfer models (RTM) for the retrieval of vegetation biophysical variables. A hybrid paradigm is proposed by incorporating the physical model to be inverted into the design of a neural network architecture, which is trained by exploiting unlabeled satellite images. In this study, we show how the proposed strategy allows the simultaneous probabilistic inversion of all input PROSAIL model parameters by exploiting Sentinel-2 images. The interest of the proposed self-supervised learning strategy is corroborated by showing the limitations of existing simulation-trained machine learning algorithms. Results are assessed on leaf area index (LAI) and canopy chlorophyll content (CCC) in-situ measurements collected on four different field campaigns over three European tests sites.

 Satellite-derived vegetation indices (VIs) have been extensively used in monitoring vegetation dynamics at local, regional, and global scales. While numerous studies have explored various factors influencing VIs, a remarkable knowledge gap persists concerning their applicability in mountain areas with complex topographic variations. Here we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the topographic effects on ten widely used VIs. We used three evaluation strategies, including: (i) an analytic radiative transfer model; (ii) a 3D ray-tracing radiative transfer model; and (iii) Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) products. The two radiative transfer models provided theoretical evaluation results under specific terrain conditions, aiding in the first exploration of the interactions of both shadow and spatial scale effects on VIs. The MODIS-based evaluation quantified the discrepancies in VIs between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua over flat and rugged terrains, providing new insights into real satellite data across different temporal scales (i.e., from daily to multiple years). Our evaluation results were consistent across these three strategies, revealing three key findings. (i) The normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) generally outperformed the other VIs, yet all VIs did not perform well in shadow areas (e.g., with a mean relative error (MRE) of 14.7% for NDVI in non-shadow areas and 26.1% in shadow areas). (ii) The topographic impacts exist at multiple spatiotemporal scales. For example, the MREs of NDVI reached 28.5% and 11.1% at 30 m and 3 km resolutions, respectively. The quarterly and annual VIs deviations between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua also increased with slope. (iii) We found the topography-induced interannual variations in multiple VIs both in simulated data and MODIS data. VIs trend deviations between MODIS-Terra and MODIS-Aqua over the Tibetan Plateau from 2003 to 2020 increased as the slope steepened (i.e., NDVI and enhanced vegetation index (EVI) trend deviations generally doubled). Overall, the sun-target-sensor geometry changes induced by topography, causing shadows in mountains along with obstructions in sensor observations, compromised the reliability of VIs in these terrains. Our study underscores the considerable impacts of topography, particularly shadow effects, on multiple VIs at various spatiotemporal scales, highlighting the imperative of cautious application of VIs-based trend calculation in mountains.",Yichuan Ma;Tao He;Tim R.

 Intertidal areas, which emerge during low tide, form a vital link between terrestrial and marine environments. Seagrasses, a well-studied intertidal habitat, provide a multitude of different ecosystem goods and services. However, owing to their relatively high exposure to anthropogenic impacts, seagrasss meadows and other intertidal habitats have seen extensive declines. Remote sensing methods that can capture the spatial and temporal variation of marine habitats are essential to best assess the trajectories of seagrass ecosystems. An advanced machine learning method has been developed to map intertidal vegetation from satellite-derived surface reflectance at a 12-band multispectral resolution and distinguish between similarly pigmented intertidal macrophytes, such as seagrass and green algae. The Intertidal Classification of Europe: Categorising Reflectance of Emerged Areas of Marine vegetation with Sentinel-2 (ICE CREAMS v1.0), a neural network model trained on over 300,000 Sentinel-2 pixels to identify different intertidal habitats, was applied to the open-access long term archive of systematically collected Sentinel-2 imagery to provide 7 years (2017–2023) worth of intertidal seagrass dynamics in 6 sites across Western Europe (471 Sentinel-2 Images). A combination of independently collected visually inspected Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle imagery and in situ quadrat images were used to validate ICE CREAMS. Having achieved a high seagrass classification accuracy (0.82 over 12,000 pixels) and consistent conversion into cover (19% RMSD), the ICE CREAMS model outputs provided evidence of site specific variation in trajectories of seagrass extent, when appropriate consideration of intra-annual variation has been considered. Inter-annual dynamics of sites showed some instances of consistent change, some indicated stability, while others indicated instability over time, characterised by increases and decreases across the time-series in seagrass coverage. This methological pipeline has helped to create up-to-date monitoring data that, with the planned continuation of the Sentinel missions, will allow almost real-time monitoring of these habitats into the future. This process, and the data it provides, could aid management practitioners from regional to international levels, with the ability to monitor intertidal seagrass meadows at both high spatial and temporal resolution, over continental scales. The implementation of Earth Observation for high-resolution monitoring of intertidal seagrasses could therefore allow for gap-filling seagrass datasets, and sustain specific and rapid management measures.",Bede Ffinian Rowe Davies;Simon Oiry;Philippe Rosa;Maria Laura Zoffoli;Ana I.

 Large areas of Europe have been repeatedly affected by severe droughts. Stressed trees suffered from direct drought impacts such as water stress or heat and were also more susceptible to other biotic and abiotic stress agents and calamities. Monitoring such vulnerable forests area-wide is crucial to assess the highly dynamic climate change induced impacts not captured by traditional ground-based monitoring approaches. However, most remote sensing studies dealing with forest condition are either not species-specific, not accounting for morphological and climatic conditions across different regions, not considering natural variations in phenology or not including multiple disturbance agents. Here, we extract species-specific reflectance time series separately for seven natural regions covering Germany for 2016 to 2022. The seasonal evolution of these time series serves as reference for the detection of forest condition anomalies. We calculated a similarity metric – further called forest condition anomaly index (FCA) – between each single reflectance observation and the respective measurements within the reference time series, also considering the natural temporal deviations caused by phenology. Temporal aggregation of the FCA allows the generation of spatially comprehensive forest condition anomaly maps. We demonstrate that the FCA shows patterns related to fires, storms and insect infestations and found an overall agreement with state-of-the-art forest disturbance products using a threshold of FCA=−0.15 for forest loss.

 There is a pressing need for well-informed management to reduce wildfire hazard and restore fire's beneficial ecological role in the Mediterranean- and temperate-climate forests of California, USA. These efforts rely upon the accessibility of high spatial and temporal resolution data on biomass and canopy fuel parameters such as canopy base height (CBH), mean canopy height, canopy bulk density (CBD), canopy cover, and leaf area index (LAI). Remote sensing using unoccupied aerial system Structure-from-Motion (UAS-SfM) presents a promising technology for this application due to its accessibility, relatively low cost, and possibility for high temporal cadence. However, to date, this method has not been studied in the complex mosaic of forest types found across California. In this study we examined the capacity of structural and multispectral information obtained from UAS-SfM, in conjunction with machine learning methods, to model aboveground biomass and forest canopy fuel structural parameters using an area-based approach across multiple sites representing a diversity of forest types in California.Based on correlations with field measurements, fuel parameters separated into vertical (biomass, CBH, and mean height) and horizontal (LAI, CBD, canopy cover) groups. UAS-SfM random forest models performed well for modelling the vertical structure canopy fuels parameters (R2 0.69–0.75). These models exhibited strong performance in comparison to ALS, as well as when transferred to a novel site. Vertical structure predictors were prominent in these models, and did not improve with the addition of spectral predictors. UAS-SfM random forest models of horizontal structure parameters mainly used raster-based spectral indices (primarily NDVI) and had relatively low performance (R2 0.49–0.59). In addition, these models underperformed ALS and had poor performance when applied to a novel site. When applied to a region with widespread UAS-SfM coverage, models from both groups successfully produced contiguous maps that could be used for modelling fire behavior or in management decision making and monitoring.These findings indicate that UAS-SfM, without the need for multispectral sensors, is well suited for mapping area-based vertical-structure canopy parameters across diverse landscapes supporting a wide range of forest types.

 Satellite observations from instruments such as the TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (TROPOMI) show significant potential for monitoring the spatiotemporal variability of NO2, however they typically provide vertically integrated measurements over the tropospheric column. In this study, we introduce a machine learning approach entitled ‘S-MESH’ (Satellite and ML-based Estimation of Surface air quality at High resolution) that allows for estimating daily surface NO2 concentrations over Europe at 1 km spatial resolution based on eXtreme gradient boost (XGBoost) model using primarily observation-based datasets over the period 2019–2021. Spatiotemporal datasets used by the model include TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric vertical column density, night light radiance from the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS), Normalized Difference Vegetation Index from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), observations of air quality monitoring stations from the European Environment Agency database and modeled meteorological parameters such as planetary boundary layer height, wind velocity, temperature. The overall model evaluation shows a mean absolute error of 7.77 μg/m3, a median bias of 0.6 μg/m3 and a Spearman rank correlation of 0.66. The model performance is found to be influenced by NO2 concentration levels, with the most reliable predictions at concentration levels of 10–40 μg/m3 with a bias of <40%. The spatial and temporal error analyses indicate the spatial robustness of the model across the study area, with better prediction accuracy during the winter months and the associated higher NO2 concentrations. Despite the complexity and the continental scale of the study area, the XGBoost-based model shows fast execution potential in providing daily estimates of surface NO2 concentrations over Europe. The Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) value analysis highlights TROPOMI NO2 tropospheric column density as the main source of information in deriving surface NO2 concentrations, indicating its significant potential for such studies.

 The resolution of ambiguity (AR) is of paramount importance for the precise point positioning (PPP) technique, as it enables the reduction of convergence duration and the improvement of positioning accuracy. Uncalibrated phase delay (UPD) is a key factor in ambiguity fixation. We investigate the difference between different scale UPD estimates which are obtained from MGEX and YNCORS stations in PPP-AR performance during quiet and geomagnetic storm periods. The conclusion is supported by two sets of experiments which indicate that regional UPD estimates offer higher stability and accuracy.

 In this study, hyperspectral data of two geographically distant study areas in Germany were analyzed to find the most effective spectral wavelengths for red-edge-based vegetation indices to differentiate bark beetle-infested Norway spruce into three infestation classes, including green-attack. Considering that the relationship between red-edge position (REP) and reflection shoulder position (RESP) is crucial for the relative quantification of chlorophyll concentration and LAI and their changes due to bark beetle infestation, we tested normalized difference red-edge indices (NDRE) formed from these parameters. Using combinations of 75 spectral bands in the range 685 nm to 850 nm, we analyzed 1187 different NDREs, and two additional vegetation indices, and show that the sorted, normalized Kruskal-Wallis H-value, followed by a frequency analysis of the RESP and REP bands of the 10 % of the highest ranked NDREs is an effective way to identify the global optima of these parameters. The optimal REP and RESP estimated using this approach were determined at 714 nm and 758 nm, respectively. The derived normalized difference red-edge index NDRE758_714 could be successfully applied to both test sites. Moreover, we found that aggregating hyperspectral bands into broader bands – 703 nm to 729 nm for a REP band and 741 nm to 767 nm for a RESP band – did not degrade model accuracy when used in a multispectral NDRE, suggesting that a hyperspectral camera is not required to perform the task.

The predictive accuracies of the models for the test data indicated MNLR to be more robust than the RF.

 Global warming has shown an “Arctic amplification effect” in recent decades, leading to pronounced changes in pan-Arctic soil surface temperature (SST). SST plays a direct role in energy exchange between soil and atmosphere and serves as an indicator of the land–atmosphere energy balance. Remote sensing land surface temperature (LST) data is able to indicate near-surface temperature, but influences from environment factors, such as vegetation and snow, can introduce biases between LST and SST. In this study, the importances of five environment factors (vegetation, snow, surface soil composition, topography, and solar radiation) to monthly mean SST estimation from MODIS LST in pan-Arctic were analyzed. Then a method for pan-Arctic monthly mean SST estimation from MODIS LST by incorporating these environment factors and monthly-based modeling based on random forest (RF) algorithm was proposed. The results reveal that all the selected environment factors contribute to monthly-based modeling, with vegetation exerting the greatest importance from May to October and snow in March and April. The root mean square error (RMSE) of pan-Arctic monthly SST estimated by the proposed method from 2003 to 2022 ranges from 0.89 to 1.88 °C, which is a 42.95–––53.35 % reduction compared to the widely used season-based multivariate linear regression (MLR) models based solely on LST (RMSE between 1.56 and 4.03 °C). The accuracy is notably improved in areas with lower and no vegetation (grassy woodlands, grasslands, permanent wetlands, and barrens) in the cold season (September to the following April), and in higher vegetation (forests) areas in the warm season (May to August). The proposed method can contribute to producing high-precision monthly mean SST data from LST, estimating permafrost extent and active layer thickness, and understanding the land–atmosphere energy balance in pan-Arctic.",Hongxiang Guo;Wenquan Zhu;Cunde Xiao;Cenliang Zhao;Liyuan Chen,这篇研究论文主要关注利用卫星遥感数据（MODIS LST）来估算北极地区土壤表面温度。研究者通过分析植被、积雪等环境因素的影响，建立了基于随机森林算法的月度土壤表面温度估算模型。该模型能够提高土壤表面温度估算精度，并有助于研究北极地区地表能量平衡和冻土变化。

 Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) 3D point clouds reconstruction can eliminate the problems of layover in 2D SAR image projections, the recognition of the reconstructed point cloud can significantly enhance target identification and information extraction. Current SAR 3D point cloud segmentation methods, based on traditional machine learning clustering approaches, suffer from poor automation and accuracy. However, the absence of publicly labeled SAR datasets impedes the progress of deep learning-based SAR 3D point cloud segmentation methods. To tackle the aforementioned challenges, we introduce, for the first time, an alternative training approach for SAR 3D point cloud segmentation using LiDAR annotated data, which offers a more abundant sample pool, thus alleviating the lack of training sets. Nevertheless, a segmentation model trained on LiDAR point clouds exhibits a significant decline in performance when directly applied to SAR 3D reconstructed point clouds due to the cross-domain discrepancy. This research presents a pioneering domain adaptation 3D semantic segmentation framework to implement cross-modal learning for SAR point clouds. In our scheme, a simple yet effective technique is developed to achieve segmentation of SAR double-bounce scattering regions called SARDBS-Mix, which employs a mixing strategy, to capture the distinctive reflection characteristics of SAR data. Furthermore, we implement approaches including center alignment and normalization, local augmentation, and weighted cross entropy to mitigate LiDAR and SAR domain gap and class imbalances.

 Amid the escalating conflicts between urban demography, resource availability, and environmental constraints, there is an accelerating demand for emergency medical services prompted by a spectrum of factors including diseases, natural calamities, and unforeseen events. This growth is further accentuated by an imbalance in the allocation of emergency facilities, amplifying public anxiety and underscoring the urgent necessity for scientifically informed optimization of pre-hospital emergency facilities. To this end, the present study articulates specific optimization goals for facility deployment and introduces a nuanced set coverage optimization model that integrates spatiotemporal determinants of emergency service requirements. The model is fortified with a constellation of constraints, including spatial constraint, temporal constraint, and coverage constraint. For spatial constraints, we use the Monte Carlo simulation to predict the spatial distribution of emergency demands. Temporal constraints involve determining the actual travel time matrix from predicted demand points to candidate sites. Coverage constraints specify the effective demand coverage rate. This study uses Nanjing as a case example, utilizing multisource big data, including ambulance GPS logs from June 2016 to May 2017, Amap traffic congestion indicators, and survey data on existing emergency facilities in Nanjing City. By preprocessing and analyzing the existing data, this study thoroughly investigates the spatiotemporal distribution of emergency demands and the impact of traffic congestion on emergency service effectiveness. Consequently, the model incorporates constraints that ensure, under the specified planning and actual traffic conditions, 95 % of the simulated emergency demands can be met within an 8-minute on-route time. Locations for pre-hospital emergency stations are optimized using a genetic algorithm, achieving the best solution at the 120th iteration. Verification confirms 134 optimal sites; after excluding 52 existing sites, 82 potential sites are identified. The new layout plan has reduced Nanjing’s average emergency response time from 18.6 min to 12 min. Additionally, under peak and average traffic conditions, emergency demand coverage rates improved from 76.92 % and 83.18 % at 15 min to 95.61 % and 98.10 % at 12 min, respectively. These results demonstrate that the new layout significantly enhances practical application effectiveness.

 The analysis of association rules within ecosystems is crucial for monitoring, managing, and conserving natural resources. As widely adopted approaches for this task, geospatial methods involving spatial co-location pattern mining can reveal distribution rules and inherent associations among diverse geographical elements. Rooted in Tobler’s first law of geography, these methods focus on the impact of spatial proximity. However, apart from proximity, heterogeneity of environmental attributes such as elevation, temperature and precipitation are also essential for the formation of associations. For environmental co-location (Eco-location) pattern detection, we propose a method based on the Geo-Eco Knowledge Graph (GEKG) to mine multi-impact association rules. Firstly, we introduce the Adaptive Threshold (AT) to constrain the Delaunay triangular network, dynamically regulating adjacency relationships to generate geo-eco knowledge graph’s skeleton. For comprehensive ecosystem representation, various environmental attributes are integrated as semantic information into GEKG. In the reasoning of Eco-location patterns, we innovate beyond the traditional co-location paradigm by considering both spatial proximity and semantic similarity. Under the impact of various environmental information, sub-sets of geographically proximate entities are extracted to detect Eco-location patterns. For effective management and efficient computation, we utilize the Neo4j graph database to manage large-scale GEKG and mine Eco-location patterns with its graph search function.

 Land subsidence is recognized as one of the hazards that threaten Metro Manila, Philippines, and other major urban areas worldwide. It has become a significant global issue caused by excessive groundwater extraction, rapid urbanization, and natural sediment compaction, exacerbated by climate change through rising sea levels. This paper presents vertical ground motion rates in Philippine metropolitan cities using Sentinel-1 InSAR time series analysis from 2014 to 2020 through UK COMET’s LiCSAR products and the LiCSBAS package of Morishita et al.

Areas with remarkably high subsidence rates are observed as circular to elliptical deformation features in vertical motion maps. Sinking areas mostly coincide with industrial and commercial complexes evident as a contiguous distribution of large and expansive man-made structures with distinct radar reflections. Monitoring this hazard is crucial as it increases the risk of floods, building and infrastructure damage, and economic loss, and exposes residents along the coast to worsening tidal incursions and storm surges due to climate change.

 The automatic extraction of inspection points for pylons is essential for intelligent Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) power inspections, especially in generating inspection route. However, current researches primarily focus on power scene perception and power component fault detection, with little attention paid to the inspection point detection. The primary reason are the lack of public pylon datasets for keypoint detection and the neglect of distinguish the inspection points from the keypoints used in feature extraction. Regarding that, this paper proposes a two-stage unsupervised pylon keypoint detection (UPKD) method to improve the efficiency of power inspections. In the first stage, the UPKD Network processes the point cloud to generate candidate keypoints, which comprises two main components: a data normalization module and an unsupervised keypoint detection network (UKD-Net). The data normalization module compresses information based on the symmetric structure of pylons, thereby reducing instability in inspection point detection. The UKD-Net incorporates a Point Transformer layer that uses self-attention mechanisms to extract features from the point cloud. In the second stage, a convex optimization strategy is applied to filter and acquire inspection points. These inspection points are then interconnected using a shortest-path strategy to generate the UAV inspection route. Our dataset is obtained using the Riegl VUX-1 laser measurement system and comprises 3,296 pylons of 10 types. Each pylon’s point cloud contains up to 25,000 points, with a high point density of 100 pts/m2.

 Building models are important for urban studies. Remote sensing multi-spectral (MS) images are widely used for its rich semantic information. The lack of geometry features is fulfilled by introducing photogrammetry derived digital surface models (DSMs), resulting in pairs of DSMs and MS images.

 As an important part of the geological environment assessment in recent years, mine interpretation has attracted broad attention in the area of sustainable development. As an object that can be captured by remote sensing of multispectral imageries, the open-pit (OP) mine environment has the characteristics of irregular distribution, diverse shapes, and varied textures and colors, which makes interpretation a challenge and limits the accuracy of OP mine mapping. Moreover, the development of computational vision technology enables efficient and fast interpretation. However, there is a lack of open semantic segmentation datasets for OP mining areas. In this paper, we introduce a dataset for OP mining areas in the West Hubei metallogenic belt (DOWHM) for OP mine element interpretation. DOWHM includes 24 active OP mining zones in China’s Hubei Province, with a total of 1875 satellite images of 224×224 pixels at a resolution of 0.6 m. Second, we design a ConvFormer model for fine classification and mapping in OP mining areas. The ConvFormer model adopts an encoder featuring a large convolutional kernel. The decoder of the ConvFormer model employs a multi-branch approach, integrating modules of convolutional neural network (CNN) and self-attention mechanism. In this manner, ConvFormer effectively captures both global–local information. This solves the problem of the misclassification of elements in the prediction results, and especially has advantages in road classification. In the experiments, ConvFormer achieved mIoU of 68.18% on DOWHM. Compared to other popular semantic segmentation models, ConvFormer improved the overall mIoU by 2%, which is advantageous in the fine classification of OP mining regions, and it can be applied to the mapping of entire mining regions.

 Supervoxels provide a more natural and compact 3D point cloud representation, which is a fundamental problem in point cloud processing and has attracted extensive attention from many scholars. At present, although the supervoxel segmentation has achieved significant results, the processing efficiency still restricts its further processing in the face of large-scale point cloud processing. Therefore, this paper proposes a new supervoxel segmentation method for point clouds to achieve fast supervoxel over-segmentation of large-scale point clouds while maintaining good boundaries and accuracy. Firstly, the supervoxel segmentation is formulated as a subset selection problem. With the idea of greedy strategy, the interval quick sorting and region growing methods is designed to realize the rapid merging of subsets in the iterative process. Secondly, the Manhattan distance metric and the seed point median simulation method are proposed to enhance the precision of iterative optimization and improve the efficiency of point cloud supervoxel segmentation.

 Multispectral remote sensing image-based sea fog detection (SFD) is both important and challenging. Deep learning methods for SFD have become mainstream due to their powerful nonlinear learning capabilities and flexibility. However, existing methods have not fully utilized the physical difference priors in multispectral images (MSI) for SFD, making it difficult to skillfully capture the shape and appearance characteristics of sea fog, thus leading to uncertainties in SFD. We propose the spatial–spectral difference network (S2DNet), a deep encoding–decoding framework that merges inter-spectral and intra-spectral heterogeneous difference features. Specifically, inspired by physics-based difference threshold methods, we developed a physics-inspired inter-spectral difference module (PIDM) that combines feature-level difference with deep neural networks to capture the shape characteristics of sea fog. We designed the intra-spectral difference module (ISDM) using difference convolution to represent sea fog’s fine-grained and dynamic appearance information. Furthermore, inspired by multi-view learning, we propose heterogeneous feature mutual learning (HFML) that seeks robust representations by focusing on semantically invariant aspects within heterogeneous difference features, adapting to the dynamic nature of sea fog. HFML is achieved through global feature mutual learning using an adversarial procedure and local feature mutual learning supported by a novel information-theoretic objective function that links maximizing statistical correlation with expectation maximization. Experiments on two SFD datasets show that integrating physical difference priors into deep learning improves SFD. In both continuous temporal and high spatial resolution SFD tasks, S2DNet outperforms existing advanced deep learning methods. Moreover, S2DNet demonstrates stronger robustness under degraded remote sensing image conditions, highlighting its potential usefulness and practicality in real-world applications.",Nan Wu;Wei Jin,该论文研究了一种基于多光谱遥感图像的海雾检测方法，通过引入物理差异先验信息和异构特征互学习机制，提高了海雾检测的精度和鲁棒性。论文的核心是利用多光谱图像中不同波段的差异信息来识别海雾，这与大气环境遥感技术中的气溶胶识别、云检测等任务具有相似性。论文中提到的多光谱遥感图像、卫星观测等关键词也与大气环境遥感技术密切相关。

 Visual Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (V-SLAM) is pivotal for precise positioning and mapping. However, visual data from crowd-sourced datasets often contains deficiencies that may lead to positioning errors. Despite existing optimization techniques, current algorithms do not adequately adapt to varied data in vehicle driving scenarios. To address this gap, this study introduces a novel SLAM framework (SLG-SLAM). This framework refines trajectories by integrating semantic information, laser point cloud, and global navigation satellite system (GNSS) data into V-SLAM. Initial trajectory estimates are made after filtering out dynamic targets and are subsequently refined with matched laser point clouds, then corrected for scale and direction using GNSS. The efficacy of this approach is assessed using four public datasets and one self-collected dataset, showing significant enhancements across all datasets. The proposed method reduces the mean absolute trajectory error by 43.50% on the KITTI dataset and 14.91% on the MVE dataset compared to the baseline.

 Modern forestry relies on an extensive network of well-maintained forest roads. However, the trafficability of forest roads can be limited by poor construction or by insufficient load-bearing capacity caused by, for example, weather conditions. In all forestry operations, the forest roads should be able to support heavy vehicles during the transport of roundwood and harvesting machinery, so logistics must be carefully planned to ensure good road trafficability. To facilitate this planning, it is necessary to know the various characteristics of the forest road in terms of its width, structure and load-bearing capacity. Obtaining such information using remote sensing data would be beneficial. In this study, we used airborne laser scanning (ALS) data to assess the width of the roadway on forest roads. We developed several algorithms that were used to assess roadway width based on the cross-sectional data (derived with ALS) of the roads in 8-m long segments. The ALS echoes within the segments were classified into 20 cm wide strips which the algorithms then analyzed in a stepwise manner. Both height and intensity information from the ALS data were utilized. The algorithm results were then used as predictors in linear models to predict the roadway width. The main focus was on the road level, i.e., aggregated values from 25 different roads were used in model fitting. In terms of root mean square error (RMSE) values, accuracies of approximately 20–30 cm (or 7–10 %) were obtained for the predicted roadway widths with a separate validation data. This level of accuracy can be considered adequate given the characteristics of the ALS data used in the modelling.

The meteo-climatological information includes hydrometric water level, rainfall data, and the Standard Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). Experimental results, obtained using a seven-year time series of SAR scenes collected over the Po River close to the city of Piacenza and contrasted with ancillary external information, demonstrate the soundness of the proposed SAR-based added-value products and their satisfactory accuracy in emphasizing both seasonal trends and the drought phenomena occurred in the area.

 Snow depth (SD) is essential for studying climate change and hydrological cycle on the Tibetan Plateau (TP). Despite the effectiveness of passive microwave remote sensing for large-scale SD measurement, its low spatial resolution and scanning gaps limit its application, particularly in the TP region where the terrain is complex and snow distribution exhibits obvious heterogeneity.

 Recent research has shown that deep learning (DL) faces physical realism challenges in predicting runoff responses under climate change, mainly due to DL’s data dependence and lack of process understanding. In this study, a physics-encoded neural network model (dNN) was developed to adress this. dNN enables a fully process-based way to training and prediction by encoding process-based modeling knowledge into the DL architecture, including the water balance principle and causal linkages of catchment hydrological processes. To examine whether dNN can produce reliable runoff responses under warming scenarios, we first conducted regional training for dNN on daily runoff in 29 catchment in California. Two process-based models, EXP-HYDRO and HBV, were then developed as benchmarks. Both dNN and a pure data-driven LSTM were forced under warming scenarios, and the monthly hydrographs and total runoff ratios metrics were evaluated relative to the benchmarks. The results demonstrated: (1) For monthly hydrographs, dNN exhibited advantages in capturing cold-season runoff increase and warm-season recession than LSTM, effectively predicting the changes and trends in monthly runoff under warming scenarios; (2) For total runoff ratios, dNN predicted fewer catchments with increased runoff, indicating it can better maintain the total water budget under warming scenarios; (3) Through the synergy with physics, dNN was able to reasonably infer unobserved snowpack dynamics under warming scenarios.

 Early identification of rubber plantations holds significant importance for both optimal plantation management and scientific studies. Even though remote sensing techniques for mapping rubber plantations have evolved considerably since the 2000s, current methods are highly effective in detecting mature rubber plantations (MRPs), which have distinctive forest characteristics, but often fail to identify immature rubber plantations (IRPs) in a timely manner. This leads to an estimated lag of at least five years in the resulting rubber plantation maps. This paper presents a novel algorithm aimed at promptly pinpointing IRPs in the early planting stage by harnessing a composite of multi-source time series satellite imagery on Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform. Twelve scenarios with different time intervals (3 months, 6 months, and 12 months) and datasets (Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1) were tested to determine the most efficient strategy for identifying IRPs using a random forest algorithm. The results demonstrate that the data cube constructed from Landsat 8, Sentinel-2, and Sentinel-1 with 3-month time intervals yields the most accurate identification accuracy. Specifically, it achieves a remarkable overall accuracy of 0.78, 0.87, and 0.93 for plantations established during the second, third, and fourth years, respectively. When implemented on Hainan Island, China’s second-largest natural rubber producing base, the algorithm unveiled a significant decline trend in rubber plantation areas since 2015. Additionally, the spatial distribution exhibited pronounced heterogeneity: while the western and northern regions saw dense immature plantation clusters, the eastern coastal regions hosted only sparse plantations.

 Post-wildfire vegetation cover damage and loss can escalate the risks of secondary disasters such as flood, landslide, and water contamination, particularly in a major wildfire affected region where human settlements are situated. In assessments of the secondary disaster risks, the post-wildfire vegetation cover change plays a key role in influencing the distribution and intensity of the risks. In this work, a processing framework for mapping post-wildfire vegetation cover changes through information fusion has been generated and tested using Landsat8 and WorldView imagery data. The test site was the boreal forest region surrounding Fort McMurray, Alberta, Canada, affected by a massive wildfire in May 2016. The derived map results indicate that the fusion process in the framework is effective for generation of post-wildfire vegetation cover change information. The use of WorldView data revealed more variation details in distribution of the vegetation cover burn damages than use of Landsat data. Moreover, the uncertainty in vegetation burn severity using Landsat-based Differenced Normalized Burn Ratio (dNBR) index exists in the areas with low dNBR reading values due to the sub-pixel effect. The forest burn severity measured with dNBR index can be underestimated due to the quick herbaceous cover recovery after wildfire.

 Forest fragmentation is a significant issue in China; however, a comprehensive understanding and assessment of the temporal trends and spatial modes of forest fragmentation remain lacking. For the first time, this study employs an object-based morphological image processing method to conduct multiscale spatiotemporal identification and analysis of China’s forest landscape from 1985 to 2023. Observations reveal an overall improvement in the integrity of China’s forest landscape from 1985 to 2023, with 79 % of counties showing a positive trend in forest landscape integrity and 5 % experiencing forest fragmentation. The forest core area in China has almost tripled from 1985 to 2023, expanding from 0.57 to 1.53 million km2. Nevertheless, 32.04 % of forests in China remain within 100 m of a non-forest edge, significantly higher than the global average (∼20 %). From 1985 to 2023, out of the 0.33 million km2 of newly planted forests, 29.5 % became forest cores, while the remaining 70.5 % constituted forest edges. This underscores the need for government planning to focus not only on expanding forest areas but also on enhancing the integrity of forest landscapes, thereby creating more ecologically valuable forest ecosystems. Analysis indicates that 25 % of forest fragmentation in China is associated with agriculture (16 %) and urbanization (9 %), while the remaining portion is linked to local topography, climate, and other natural boundaries for forest distribution.

 Accurate delineation of agricultural parcels is crucial for ensuring food security and implementing precision agriculture practices. However, one of the primary challenges in parcel delineation revolves around the accurate extraction of parcel edges due to the diverse morphologies of these parcels. Current deep learning models for agricultural parcel delineation often produce unclosed or incomplete edges, highlighting the need to enhance the edge-awareness of the model. In this study, we proposed a refined edge-aware U-Net (REAUNet) to extract accurate agricultural parcel boundaries from Sentinel-2 images and GF-2 images. REAUNet integrates four innovative components for edge enhancement, i.e., the deep supervision, the edge detection block, the dual attention block and the refine module. The edge detection block and the dual attention block strengthen the ability of capturing spatial contextual information, and the deep supervision constrains parcel delineation across multiple scales, and the refine module further refines the parcel edges. Together, these components enhance the edge-awareness of the model, resulting in more accurate agricultural parcel delineation. From the ablation experiment, REAUNet with all four components reached the higher accuracy than the scenarios that only three out of four components were retained, which suggested that the inclusion of all four components was essential. The comparative evaluation showed that our proposed model surpassed the representative deep learning models for both thematic and geomantic accuracy. REAUNet demonstrated an increase of 2.0 % in F1-score and a decrease of 3.4 % in GTC (Global Total-Classification) compared to the SEANet, and exhibited a 0.8 % increase in IoU and a 2 % decrease in GTC relative to the MPSPNet. We also assessed the capability of the REAUNet model transferred for a new geographic region, and reported that a pre-train REAUNet model with only a small number of local samples could achieve a satisfactory accuracy. To conclude, the newly proposed REAUNet model reaches a high mapping accuracy for delineating agricultural parcels from the high-resolution images.

 The Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is one of the most widely used socioeconomic indicators, serving as an integral component for climate change impact analysis. However, a national scale assessment may induce considerable bias because it conceals any internal variations within a country. The lack of a long-term sub-national scale GDP data is a substantive hinderance. Leveraging the close relationship between nighttime lights and GDP, we address this gap by developing a novel methodological framework in two steps. First, under the modeling philosophy of spatial statistics, we developed a novel approach based on deep and machine learning techniques to establish a complex mapping between two inconsistent nighttime lights (NTL) datasets: the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program’s Operational Linescan System (DMSP) and the National Polar-Orbiting Partnership’s Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The models achieve accuracies ranging from 0.945 to 0.980 (correlation coefficients). By taking the estimations ensemble of the two techniques, the time series of DMSP data was extended to 2021. Next, a novel modeling strategy based on multi-layer perceptron was developed to derive the non-linear relationship between NTL and GDP per capita at sub-national scale to alleviate scale effects at this granularity, while explicitly capturing regional heterogeneity effect. The trained models achieve average accuracies of 0.967, 0.959, and 0.959 on the training, validation, and test sets, respectively. We evaluate the developed dataset at the global, national, and sub-national scales from various perspective, and the results offer solid evidence on the reliability of the estimated economic data.

 The semantic segmentation of land use and land cover (LULC) is a crucial and widely employed remote sensing task. Conventional convolutional neural networks and vision transformers have been extensively utilized for LULC segmentation. However, high-resolution remote sensing images contain a wealth of spatial and color texture information, which is not fully exploited by traditional deep learning approaches. The information bottleneck of CNNs and transformers results in the loss of a significant amount of texture detail information during the feature extraction process, which further limits the performance of LULC segmentation. We present DDPM-SegFormer, a new framework that merges a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) and vision transformer for LULC segmentation. The aim is to address the difficulties arising from extraction in complex geographic landscapes and to alleviate information bottlenecks. The framework utilizes the ability of a DDPM to generate refined semantic features and that of vision transformer to model the global image context. Our framework introduces two main innovations. First, we use a DDPM for the first time in LULC segmentation to generate highly refined multiscale semantic features. This approach alleviates the information bottleneck caused by relying solely on a CNN or transformer architecture. Second, we develop an effective feature-level fusion strategy that utilizes multihead cross-attention between the DDPM and Transformer. This approach achieves the harmonious fusion of fine-scale semantic features, generating continuous and highly refined semantic features that enhance the segmentation accuracy. The results indicate that DDPM-SegFormer achieves an MIOU of 83.72% and an F1-score of 90.97% for the large-scale LoveDA dataset and an MIOU of 90.91% and an F1score of 93.30% for the Tarim Basin LULC dataset in a desert scenario.

 Thin cloud interference presents a significant challenge for the semantic segmentation of optical satellite imagery, which directly degrades the model accuracy and causes difficulties in sample selection. This paper generated a dataset named Populus euphratica and Tamarix chinensis discrimination (PTD), containing both cloudless and thin cloud scenarios. Based on this PTD dataset, an enhanced Atmospheric Scattering Model with Nonlinear Optimization (ASM_NL) was proposed to simulate high-fidelity thin clouds by incorporating two vital nonlinear terms: the point spread function and the Perlin noise. Additionally, we adopt a strategy of mixing simulated thin cloud-covered images (STCI) into the training set at a certain proportion to improve the semantic segmentation accuracy in thin cloud-covered scenarios. The conclusions are as follows: 1) ASM_NL can simulate high-fidelity clouds at an average Jensen-Shannon distance of 0.0699. 2) When dealing with medium- and high-cloud density datasets, mixing STCI proved to be more effective than cloud removal in mitigating thin cloud interference, resulting in average macro F1 score improvements of 0.164 and 0.094, respectively. 3) The semantic segmentation accuracy improved significantly by mixing STCI with a minimal proportion of 1/60, demonstrating the activation of model transfer capabilities.

 Deep learning has significantly advanced hyperspectral image (HSI) classification, primarily due to its robust nonlinear feature extraction capabilities. The vision transformer has achieved notable performance but is limited by the quadratic computational burden of its self-attention mechanism. Recently, a network based on state space model named Mamba, has attracted considerable attention for its linear complexity and commendable performance. Nevertheless, Mamba was originally designed for one-dimensional causal sequence modeling, and its effectiveness in inherent non-causal HSI classification remains to be fully validated. To address this issue, we propose a novel Local Enhanced Mamba (LE-Mamba) network for hyperspectral image classification, which mainly comprises a Local Enhanced Spatial SSM (LES-S6), a Central Region Spectral SSM (CRS-S6), and a Multi-Scale Convolutional Gated Unit (MSCGU). The LES-S6 improves non-causal local feature extraction by incorporating a multi-directional local spatial scanning mechanism. Additionally, the CRS-S6 employs a bidirectional scanning mechanism in the spectral dimension to capture fine spectral details and integrate them with spatial information. The MSCGU utilizes a convolutional gating mechanism to aggregate features from diverse scanning routes and extract high-level semantic information. The overall accuracies of LE-Mamba on Indian Pines, WHU-Hi-HanChuan, WHU-Hi-LongKou, and Pavia University datasets are 99.16 %, 98.16 %, 99.57 %, and 99.63 %, respectively.

 Recently, deep learning methods have shown outstanding performance in remote sensing change detection (CD). To improve the accuracy of edge regions, researchers have introduced edge information as prior knowledge into CD methods. However, there is still room for improvement in utilizing edge information. In this study, an edge-guided multi-scale foreground attention network (EMAF) with an innovative and effective strategy is proposed. Our edge-guided strategy focuses on incorporating edge information into the feature fusion process at all levels. EMAF firstly employs a Siamese Resnet-34 as the encoder, producing four levels of bi-temporal features. Secondly, the Foreground Module (FM) is introduced to separate foreground and background at each level, resulting in foreground change features. Then, the Edge Fusion Module (EFM) is introduced to fuse the features of two adjacent levels with the edge probability map obtained by the Edge Extraction Module (EEM). Finally, after performing EFM and EEM in the three levels, EMAF generates the final change map and edge probability map. During the deep supervision training, the Dynamic Weighted Binary Cross-Entropy (DWBCE) loss is calculated as the edge loss. The comparison testing results on WHU-CD, SYSU-CD, and LEVIR-CD datasets validate the effectiveness of EMAF.

 Automatic crop mapping is essential for various agricultural applications. Although fully convolutional networks (FCNs) have shown effectiveness in crop mapping, they rely on labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) methods offer a solution by enabling pixel-level segmentation with less costly annotations, such as point, bounding box (bbox), and image-level annotations. However, these weak annotations often lack complete object information, leading to reduced accuracy. Moreover, there is limited exploration of WSSS methods in medium-resolution satellite imagery, such as Sentinel-2. Therefore, this study proposes SAMWS, a WSSS method based on the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for crop mapping using Sentinel-2 time series images. Leveraging SAM, our method can generate high-quality pseudo labels and accommodate various weak annotations without extensive adjustments. SAMWS comprises three stages: 1) finetuning SAM with adapters; 2) generating pseudo labels using weak annotations and finetuned SAM; and 3) training a segmentation network using pseudo labels for crop mapping. Experiments conducted on PASTIS and Munich datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach. After SAM was finetuned with adapters, the F1-scores for parcel segmentation using point and bbox prompts increased by 75.0 % and 14.4 %, respectively, reaching 0.880 and 0.931. Additionally, our method achieves classification results closest to fully supervised learning when using point, bbox, and image-level annotations, with F1-scores of 0.810, 0.817, and 0.779, respectively.

 Extracting road network maps for high-resolution remote sensing images is a critical and challenging remote sensing topic, with significant importance for traffic navigation, disaster management, autonomous driving, and urban planning. Although deep learning has demonstrated its powerful feature extraction capabilities in image processing tasks, including road extraction, existing road extraction algorithms still have some limitations. In particular, semantic segmentation-based methods often lack supervision of the connection relationships between roads and topological correctness constraints, resulting in fragmented and poorly connected road network graphs. Moreover, graph-based methods lack effective supervision strategies for vertex misdetection issues. To deal with these issues, we propose a deeply supervised vertex network (DSVNet) for road network graph extraction. First, to effectively supervise road vertices, we design a road vertex supervision module that yields improved vertex prediction accuracy. Second, to merge the benefits of segmentation-based methods and graph-based methods, we establish a parallel semantic segmentation branch based on the vertex querying task, thereby achieving enhanced road extraction accuracy. Furthermore, we introduce deformable attention into the model to boost its performance and computational efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of DSVNet on two large-scale public datasets.

 The fusion of remote sensing and artificial intelligence, particularly deep learning, offers substantial opportunities for developing innovative methods in rapid disaster mapping and damage assessment. However, current models for wildfire burnt area detection and mapping are mostly constrained in handling imbalanced training samples with non-burnt areas oversampled, boundary areas with a mix of burnt and unburnt pixels, and regions with varying environmental contexts, leading to poor model generalizability. In response, this paper proposes a novel U-Net based model, known as BiAU-Net, which incorporates attention mechanisms and a well-designed loss function, enabling the model to focus on burnt areas and improve accuracy and efficiency, especially in detecting edges and small areas. Unlike traditional single-input U-Net models for image segmentation, the proposed BiAU-Net considers and incorporates temporal changes with two inputs, pre- and post-fire Sentinel-2 imagery, enhancing performance across diverse environmental areas.

 The frequent occurrence of urban floods (UFs) poses significant threats to citizens’ lives and the national economy.

 Due to the rapidly changing climate conditions, precipitation nowcasting poses a daunting challenge because it is impossible to make accurate short-term forecasts due to the rapid fluctuations in weather conditions. There are limitations to traditional methods of forecasting precipitation, such as the use of numerical models and radar extrapolation, when it comes to providing highly detailed and timely forecasts. With the help of contemporary machine learning (ML) models, including deep neural networks, transformers and generative models, complex precipitation nowcasting tasks can be performed in an efficient way. To address this critical task and enhance proactive emergency disaster management, we propose an innovative method based on transformer-based generative models for precipitation nowcasting. Our study area is the Soyang Dam basin in South Korea, located upstream of the Han River, characterized by a monsoon climate with approximately 1200 mm of annual precipitation. To develop a precipitation nowcasting model, radar composite data from 10 weather radars across South Korea is used. By utilizing radar reflective data in order to train our model, we are able to effectively predict future precipitation patterns, thus mitigating the risk of catastrophic weather conditions caused by heavy rainfalls. This dataset covers reflectivity data from 2018 to 2022, with a spatial resolution of 1km over a 960 × 1200 grid. Normalization using the min–max scaler method is applied to this reflectivity data, which is then transformed into grayscale images for uniform comparison. We enhance performance effectively by employing transfer learning with pre-trained Transformer models. Initially, we train the model using a comprehensive dataset.

 Nowadays, embedding-based pan-sharpening networks aimed at fusing panchromatic (PAN) and multispectral (MS) images are abundant, yet their results still show spectral distortion and spatial fuzziness. In this paper, we design a multi-scale fusion structure to minimize the gap between the pan-sharpened image and the reference image progressively. Specifically, we proposed a method based on the scale difference between PAN and MS images, using a convolutional neural network embedding pixel difference enhanced module (PDEM) to obtain the pan-sharpened image and minimizing the losses from each scale. The network includes three scales, each scale contains the PDEM to generate the intermediate results until to the last scale which obtains the final pan-sharpened result. The designed PDEM extracts deep features from PAN and MS images, using different kernel sizes and receptive field scales to diversify the extracted information. Three-direction pixel difference convolutions (PDCs) are utilized to maintain and enhance the edge details of spatial information. The loss function is to sum up the mean square error and mean absolute error between the pan-sharpened image and the reference image at three scales.

 Small target detection in remote sensing is integral to a range of applications, including smart city systems and emergency rescue operations. However, the challenges posed by weak features and complex backgrounds in remote sensing images have hindered the efficacy of detection. Current models tend to focus on identifying individual targets, resulting in algorithms with larger parameters, slower detection efficiency, and difficulty in striking a balance between false positives and negatives. Given that many tasks do not require precise target location, a more efficient approach involves swiftly predicting target areas with models involving fewer parameters. This paper introduces the concept of group target distribution detection, gathering targets with similar distances and semantic similarities for clustered detection. A Gaussian probability map, formed from target density, is used to train a probability prediction model. We propose a new metric for evaluating this innovative group target distribution detection paradigm and provide a comparative assessment with traditional single-object detection models. In experimental evaluation, our proposed DenseUGE network — employing ResNet34 and ResNet50 as its backbone — surpasses the best baseline method by 3.37% on the AI-TOD dataset using our metrics.

 Understanding soil moisture dynamics is crucial for crop growth. The digital mapping of field soil moisture distribution provides valuable information for agricultural water management. The optical satellite data provides fine scale soil moisture information for a region. However, these data are greatly limited due to cloud contamination and revisit period. Despite the reported beneficial effects of spatiotemporal fusion methods, the accurate estimates of high-resolution soil moisture through spatiotemporal fusion data are still unclear, particularly when using Sentinel-2/3 fusion images. This study introduces a new soil moisture estimation framework integrating spatio-temporal spectral information from Sentinel-2/3 fusion images and machine learning algorithm,and thus provide spatiotemporally continuous soil moisture estimation. The framework includes four fusion methods (ESTARRFM, Fit-FC, FSDAF and STFMF) and four machine learning models (PLSR, SVM, RF and GBRT). The feasibility of the framework was validated in the Hetao Irrigation Area of Inner Mongolia, China. The results showed that the Sentinel-2/3 fused image generated by Fit-FC was visually the closest to the true image, followed by ESTARFM, FSDAF, and STFMF.

 Analyzing spatially varying effects is pivotal in geographic analysis. However, accurately capturing and interpreting this variability is challenging due to the increasing complexity and non-linearity of geospatial data. Recent advancements in integrating Geographically Weighted (GW) models with artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies offer novel approaches. However, these methods often focus on single algorithms and emphasize prediction over interpretability. The recent GeoShapley method integrates machine learning (ML) with Shapley values to explain the contribution of geographical features, advancing the combination of geospatial ML and explainable AI (XAI). Yet, it lacks exploration of the nonlinear interactions between geographical features and explanatory variables. Herein, an ensemble framework is proposed to merge local spatial weighting scheme with XAI and ML technologies to bridge this gap. Through tests on synthetic datasets and comparisons with GWR, MGWR, and GeoShapley, this framework is verified to enhance interpretability and predictive accuracy by elucidating spatial variability.

 Existing deep learning-based hyperspectral anomaly detection methods typically perform anomaly detection by reconstructing a clean background. However, for the deep networks, there are many parameters that need to be adjusted. To reduce parameters of network and improve the performance of anomaly detection, a light CNN based on residual learning and background estimation was proposed. Different from traditional methods, the proposed method could directly learn anomaly features rather than background features.

Second, to purify the pseudo-background, a pair down-sampling method and a joint loss that combines cross-approximation background loss and consistency loss were proposed. Third, the anomaly matrix was obtained by the difference between the hyperspectral image (HSI) and the pseudo-background. Fourth, a light CNN with three layers was proposed to extract features of the anomaly matrix. Finally, during the prediction stage, anomaly detection results were calculated from the predicted anomaly matrix obtained by light CNN through the Mahalanobis distance.

 To reduce the high redundancy of band information in hyperspectral data, various band optimization methods have been adopted, which could be divided into two types namely band extraction (e.g., principal component analysis, PCA) and band selection (e.g., Spearman correlation coefficient, SRC). However, the applicability and effectiveness of different band optimization methods were rarely reported in the literature. Therefore, based on the rock sample data of the Baixintan deposit, we compare the performance of two band optimization algorithms (principal component analysis−based band extraction and SRC-based band selection) in inverting metal elements (Cu, Fe, Ni, Cr, Mg) using the adaptive genetic algorithms-gradient boosting regression tree (AGA-GBRT) algorithm. Two band optimization methods have shown different effects in improving the accuracy of target metal elements. The five models with the highest accuracy in metal elements include LT-R-Cu, LT-PCA-Fe, ORI-PCA-Ni, SDT-PCA-Cr, and LT-PCAMg. In the established model, the inversion accuracy of the Cu element is the lowest, possibly due to the high variability of the data itself (coefficient of variation is 3.55). Fe and Ni highly correlated with Cu elements were used to indirectly invert Cu element. Compared with the direct inversion model, the accuracy of the indirect inversion model has increased by 11%.

 Agricultural drought is a major natural disaster affecting biomass accumulation and causing food loss, exacerbated by the increasing frequency of flash droughts and compounded drought-heatwave events. Traditional optical remote sensing indices cannot directly represent the water content of vegetation, resulting in a limited understanding of crop response to drought. To address this gap, we investigated the responsiveness of microwave Vegetation Optical Depth (VOD) with four bands (L-, C-, X-, KU-) and four emerging VOD-derived products to drought conditions in crops in the Midwest US. These products include the normalized Difference Between Night and Day VOD (nVOD), Slope of the Regression of Day and Night VOD (σ), Standardized VOD Index (SVODI), and VOD to estimate Gross Primary Productivity (VOD2GPP). They employ different theoretical modeling approaches to crop growth and water use strategies. We comprehensively analyzed the trend, seasonality, and residual of VODs, using Leaf Area Index (LAI) for comparison, and further assessed the lagged and cumulative effects, quantified drought sensitivity, and captured responsiveness to cumulative drought using thresholds. The results showed a time lag in the response of VOD series to drought as indicated by the Standardized Precipitation Evapotranspiration Index (SPEI). VODs achieved faster responses and higher correlations compared to LAI. Among them, VOD_L exhibited the most statistically significant pixels (39.84%) and positive Rmax-lag with 96.81% of all pixels. For cumulative effects, VOD_L, VOD_C, VOD_X, VOD_KU, and SVODI were highly correlated in the early stages of droughts. We also found that crops in Iowa exhibited medium to high drought sensitivity (average values of 0.55 to 0.74), with the highest drought sensitivity calculated using the isohydricity indicator, σ. Based on threshold comparison, σ showed a timely response in the first month of drought (average of −0.62), whereas VOD_L and VOD_C performed best in the second month (both averaging −1.85), and VOD2GPP (−2.94) was the most responsive in the third month. Due to water use strategy, maize responded more quickly to the onset of drought compared to soybeans. Overall, the results demonstrated that VOD is promising for crop phenology and drought research.

 Accurate mapping of irrigated croplands is crucial for a comprehensive understanding of agricultural practices and land management. Despite recent advancements, there remains room for further exploration of the effective fusion of temporal information from multitemporal remote sensing images, which is essential for capturing the dynamic nature of agricultural landscapes. Many existing irrigation mapping methods concatenate multitemporal images in a direct way and thus neglect the temporal relationships within the image time series, especially the sequence and interdependencies of the temporal dimension. To address this gap, a novel deep learning model, named the attention-enhanced spatial–temporal high-resolution network (AEST-HRNet), which incorporates parallel processing and a fusion mechanism of multiresolution information streams, three-dimensional (3D) spatial–temporal convolution, and temporal attention modules, was proposed. When applied to irrigated regions in Washington and California, USA, AEST-HRNet effectively extracted irrigated areas using multitemporal Sentinel-2 images obtained with the Google Earth Engine (GEE). To validate the results, 208 representative sample patches were selected, and the AEST-HRNet maps were compared against third-party ground reference data and statistics from the United States National Agricultural Statistics Survey (NASS).

 Since the arid regions of Central Asia (ACA) are located in the interior of Eurasia, water resources play a vital role in the stability of its ecosystem and economic development. Based on the terrestrial water storage anomaly (TWSA) of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), we analyze the observed characteristics of the TWSA over the ACA during 2003–2014. Results indicate that the terrestrial water storage (TWS) in the region showed an overall declining trend from 2003 to 2014, and the autumn TWS in this region is the smallest compared to other seasons and exhibits a strong decreasing trend at least −4.5 cm/decade. This means water resources over the ACA are scarcer and more vulnerable in autumn.

 Vegetation is one of the most crucial components of terrestrial ecosystems, and monitoring vegetation change as well as studying the factors that drive its formation provide significant guidance for restoring ecological biodiversity. The choice of driving indicators for vegetation change in previous studies has not been comprehensive enough, and particularly groundwater depth has not been considered. Therefore, 10 natural factors and 5 human factors were chosen for our study. We adopted the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) to measure vegetation growth.

As a result of the study, we found that over the past 22 years, the NDVI in the basin increased from 0.62 to 0.70, with an increase of +0.0040/yr. Land use type is the most significant driver affecting NDVI changes. The interaction of two factors has a greater effect on vegetation change more than a single factor.

 Water quantity and quality in lakes are closely linked to the compounding effects of climate change and human activities in their catchments, especially for lakes located in semi-arid and arid regions where water resources are scarce. Whilst knowledge gaps exist for these effects in semi-arid and arid region lakes due mainly to the lack of long-term in situ monitoring data. By using satellite remote sensing data, this study firstly investigated the variations of water level, chlorophyll-a concentration (Chl-a) and turbidity in Lake Qadisiyah, Iraq between 2000 and 2019. Results showed that the average water level was 138.3 m in 2000–2019, it decreased clearly in 2001, 2009, 2015 and 2018 with the lowest value of 120 m in July 2015. The mean Chl-a was 6.3 mg/m3 and it showed an overall increasing trend during 2000 and 2019. Turbidity showed extremely high values (>10 NTU) in 2009 and 2017–2018 compared to the mean value of 3.6 NTU in 2000–2019. The boosted regression tree (BRT) was then used to explore the relationship between those variations and El Niño-Southern Oscillation, droughts, meteorological factors and land use land cover changes in the catchment. Results revealed that water level declines were mainly associated with droughts led by La Niña events. Chl-a increase in the lake were mainly explained by built-up area increase and water area decrease in the catchment, with a relative contribution of 29.2 % and 28.6 % respectively. Water area changes in the catchment were the main factor influencing turbidity explaining 55.3 % of the variation. An exception water level decline in 2014–2016 was also observed when there was no drought, which was most likely caused by the cut off of water flow upstream and the release of water from the dam during periods of war. The findings in this study underscored the impacts of climate and human activities on water quantity and quality in semi-arid region lakes. Actions such as improving water use efficiency, establishing water storages, and enhancing cross-border cooperation are therefore recommended to deal with extreme events.

 Shrub encroaching on grasslands threatens grassland ecosystems and negatively affects human land use and livelihood. However, existing research on this subject is limited, having focused on small areas, thus hindering a comprehensive understanding of the diverse patterns of large-scale shrub invasions into grasslands. In recent decades, a significant encroachment of shrubs into Xilin Gol grassland has been observed in China, resulting in considerable damage to the grasslands. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the rapid expansion of shrub-encroached grassland (SEG) from 1990 to 2020 in the Xilin Gol League, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, China, using long-term Landsat images. The spatial distribution characteristics of the new SEG areas were analyzed. The main factors driving the shrub encroachment in the study area were identified using a geographic detector. Our results revealed a continuous expansion of SEG in the study area over the past three decades, marked by an increase of 48.76 × 103 km2 and an average annual gain rate of 9.41 %. The increased SEG was primarily owing to grassland transition. The sprawl of the SEG was the most prominent in the western and northern regions of the study area, extending to gentle slopes of approximately 5° and low-middle elevations between 600–1300 m above mean sea level. Shrub encroachment was primarily influenced by surface temperature, wind speed, and relative humidity, with elevation, slope, and precipitation exerting relatively weaker influences.

The study utilized remote sensing (RS) and geographic information system (GIS) technologies to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of Grain for Green Project and assess its effects. The findings indicate that the Grain for Green Project resulted in notable improvements in Wuqi County from 2000 to 2018. Firstly, there was a significant increase in vegetation coverage, accompanied by a reduction in soil erosion intensity. Secondly, approximately 64 % of cropland was converted, leading to an expansion of forest and grassland areas. Thirdly, the focus of vegetation restoration was primarily on converting cropland to grassland, indicating its suitability for the county compared to forestation. Lastly, the conversion of steep cropland (>25°) was influenced by the density of less steep cropland (<25°). This study emphasizes the importance of guiding farmers in selecting appropriate vegetation restoration strategies and finding a balance between erosion control and agricultural production within the Grain for Green Project.

 Shallow-water benthic habitat classification of coral reefs based on satellite remote sensing is an important part of coral reef monitoring. Leveraging its potent capacity for feature learning, and generalization, deep learning emerges as a robust method for coral reef benthic habitat classification. Due to the complexity of the marine environment, it is difficult to produce high-quality pixel-by-pixel labels for deep learning-based methods, which makes it challenging to recover structural details of coral reef benthic habitats. Bathymetry data can provide spatial contextual information and geometric features, serving as auxiliary features to provide abundant structural information for benthic classification models. However, how to use bathymetry and what kind of bathymetry features to employ for assisting model learning remains to be explored. Therefore, a bathymetry feature fusion-weakly supervised coral reef benthic habitat classification model (BFFBHCM) is proposed. BFFBHCM is supervised by sparse benthic habitat samples with bathymetry and can generate dense, multi-scale bathymetry features. With the robust bathymetry-benthic feature fusion module (B-BFFM), BFFBHCM can consider both semantic and structural details of the benthic habitats, thus generating highly accurate benthic habitat classification results. Experiments were conducted using the NJUReef + dataset containing 10 coral reefs in the Spratly Islands, China, constructed based on in-situ data. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed BFFBHCM is insensitive to the vertical error in bathymetry, with an average mIoU 22.54 % higher than state-of-the-art methods.

 The rapid progression of the intelligent grid requires continuous vigilance in monitoring and maintaining extensive powerline corridors to ensure their safety. In this context, LiDAR technology, renowned for its exceptional precision and reduced vulnerability to external interference, emerges as a valuable alternative for monitoring powerline corridors. This contrasts with conventional methods such as manual field inspections and imprecise sensors. However, the vast amount of data generated by LiDAR presents significant challenges, including scene noise, diverse scenarios, and unwanted objects proximate to powerlines or pylons. These factors complicate the accurate extraction and analysis of relevant data from point clouds produced by LiDAR. This review examines recent methodologies aimed at overcoming these challenges. It begins with a brief exploration of data collection systems for powerline corridors, including TLS, MLS, UAVLS, ALS, and CIR, highlighting their respective merits and drawbacks. The subsequent sections of the review provide a comprehensive overview of three methodological categories: tracking and detection-based approaches, machine learning-based techniques, and deep learning-based methods. Within each category, representative techniques are delineated, elucidating their potential, limitations, and applicable domains. This review incorporates qualitative analysis to enhance researchers' comprehension of current studies and to providea nuanced understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques. In a departure from previous research, this review extends its focus beyond powerline extraction to include the extraction of pylons and single wires. It identifies a notable oversight in the lack of emphasis on individual wire extraction, attributing this to challenges posed by wire proximity, and highlights limited attention to pylon extraction near vegetation.

 High-quality surface reconstruction and texture reconstruction of large-scale scene play a pivotal role in the domains of ancient architecture, cultural heritage preservation, and 3D urban modeling. Given that point cloud data has emerged as a crucial medium for representing three-dimensional spatial information, its utilization for surface and texture reconstruction becomes indispensable. In this research, we propose a novel framework for reconstructing surface and texture from unstructured colorful point clouds without normal information to restore large-scale real-world scenes. Specifically, we first introduce an automatic virtual viewpoint selection method to generate virtual views by rendering the point cloud from multiple viewpoints. Subsequently, we construct a two-step network to facilitate accurate visibility prediction and texture inpainting for each virtual view. Then, the visibility information from multiple perspectives is integrated to solve an optimization problem incorporating visibility constraints, resulting in the generation of a 3D mesh. Subsequently, texture information from various perspectives is integrated, filtering techniques are applied to determine the optimal perspective for texturing, and a texture atlas is generated. Precise texture mapping is then performed, ultimately leading to the production of a comprehensive textured model. In contrast to alternative learning-based methodologies, our framework exclusively learns from two-dimensional images, encompassing the prediction of both visible and invisible points as well as the execution of image inpainting tasks. This approach exhibits exceptional versatility in managing large-scale point clouds while effectively leveraging the color and intensity attributes of the data for precise texture reconstruction.

 Equipped with the Advanced Topographic Laser Altimeter System (ATLAS) of 532 nm, the Ice, Cloud and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) is enabled to penetrate the water surface to retrieve water depth information at certain depths. However, signal photon extraction is significantly impacted by noise and varying terrain conditions, particularly in deep water regions with weaker signal photons.

First, raw photons are segregated into water surface and bottom photons using the specular return removal algorithm and combined with the RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm to derive water surface elevation. Second, our method employs the modified Ordering Points to Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) with adaptive variable ellipse and B-spline curve iterative filtering to detect bottom signal photons.

 Three-dimensional laser scanning technology is widely employed in various fields due to its advantage in rapid acquisition of geographic scene structures. Achieving high precision and automated semantic segmentation of three-dimensional point cloud data remains a vital challenge in point cloud recognition. This study introduces a Multilevel Intuitive Attention Network (MIA-Net) designed for point cloud segmentation. MIA-Net consists of three key components: local trigonometric function encoding, feature sampling, and intuitive attention interaction. Initially, trigonometric encoding captures fine-grained local semantics within disordered point clouds. Subsequently, a multilayer perceptron addresses point-cloud feature pyramid construction, and feature sampling is performed using the point offset mechanism in the different levels. Finally, the multilevel intuitive attention(MIA) mechanism facilitates feature interactions across different layers, enabling the capture of both local attention features and global structure. The point-offset attention scheme introduced in this study significantly reduces computational complexity compared to traditional attention mechanisms, enhancing computational efficiency while preserving the advantages of attention mechanisms.

 Accurate mapping of terrain elevations at a large scale and fine resolution can characterize the detailed surface height and geomorphic changes and is very critical for the studies of the internal motions and external forces of the earth. The emergence of the Ice, Cloud, and Land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) offers unprecedented possibilities for global elevation mapping with high vertical accuracy using three-dimensional photon points. However, the ICESat-2 photon points are still sparse in terms of spatial/horizontal resolution, making it unable to satisfy the high-resolution demand of terrain elevation mapping and digital elevation model production. A few previous studies have attempted to estimate elevations/topography in regions with single landscape and landcover (e.g., forest, shallow water, and polar regions) by combining ICESat-2 data with other passive satellite remotely sensed data. However, the potential and capability of ICESat-2 for mapping elevations for spatially continuous large regions with multiple complicated land cover types remains unknown. In this study, a spatially continuous large-scale terrain elevation estimation method is developed under multiple land covers based on the random forest model and the freely accessed satellite data of ICESat-2, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2. The core principle is to construct a random forest model that can characterize the complicated relationships of the ICESat-2 ATL03 terrain elevations and their corresponding land cover related polarization characteristics and spectral variables from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2, respectively. Integrating the superiorities of the data of these three different satellites enables the proposed method to extrapolate the terrain elevations with decimeter-level vertical accuracy and 10 m spatial/horizontal resolution simultaneously without any prior in situ data or manually set parameters. The proposed method is tested using the elevations from 2021 to 2022 at the third largest island (Chongming Island, Shanghai) in China. The estimated terrain elevations are locally validated with the airborne LiDAR-derived elevations. Moreover, they are compared with the ICESat-2 ATL08 height_terrain_bestfit data and Global Ecosystem Dynamics Investigation L2A elev_lowestmode data from the global perspectives. The predicted elevations exhibit a high correlation with the measured elevations from the two airborne LiDAR validation regions with root mean square errors (RMSE) of 0.34 and 0.59 m. The averaged RMSEs of the predicted elevations at different land covers are 1.26 and 1.18 m when compared with those derived from ATL08 and GEDI L2A, respectively. No remarkable abnormal predicted elevations are observed. This finding suggests the satisfactory robustness performance of the proposed method under different land covers and a relatively good consistency between the predicted elevations and the actual terrain of the entire island. As far as we know, the present work is the first to map elevations at 10 m resolution based only on the newly available satellite active and passive remotely sensed data without any ground truth surveys, manual intervention, and prior knowledge.

 Accurate detection of changes in buildings is crucial for the understanding of urban development. The growing accessibility of remote sensing imagery has enabled urban scale change detection (CD) in both 2D and 3D. However, existing methods have not yet fully exploited the fusion of feature information in multi-temporal images, resulting in insufficient accuracy in 2D changed regions or in elevation changes. To this end, a Cross-temporal and Spatial Context Learning Network (CSCLNet) aimed at multi-task building CD from dual-temporal optical images is proposed, capturing both 2D and 3D changes simultaneously. It leverages a CNN network to extract multi-layer semantic features. Subsequently, two modules, Cross-temporal Transformer Semantic Enhancement (CTSE) and Multi-layer Feature Fusion (MFF), are developed to refine the feature representations. CTSE enhances temporal information by cross attention of dual-temporal features to enable interactions and MFF fuses multi-layer features and enhances attention to global and local spatial context.

 Plastic greenhouses (PGs) are integral to modern agricultural practices, enhancing crop yields but also raising environmental concerns. Consequently, comprehending their widespread distribution is essential. Although deep learning has been extensively used for land use/cover classification and extraction with satellite data, the large number of labels limits its application due to the time-consuming and labor-intensive nature of manual labeling. This study introduces a novel approach coupling Prior Knowledge and Deep Learning methods for PG Mapping (PGMPK+DL) using Sentinel-1/2 data. We use an automatic labeling strategy guided by prior knowledge from Sentinel-2 optical data to construct PG labels in six small regions. Moreover, to overcome the cloud contamination issue of optical data, the potential of Sentinel-1 time-series SAR data for PG extraction is analyzed. Deep learning methods are further utilized to capture more abstract and generalized temporal and spatial features from time-series radar data to accommodate complex scenes for large-scale PG extraction. The U-Net model emerges as superior from rigorous comparisons among FCN, SegNet, U-Net, DeepLabV3 + and U-Net3 + deep learning models. Finally, the U-Net model harnessed prior knowledge-based PG labels and Sentinel-1 time-series SAR data to generate a precise map depicting PG distribution across Shandong province, China. Remarkably, it accurately identifies approximately 238,000 ha of PG areas.

 Accurate estimation of crown fire potential (CFP) can improve guidance on crown fire control and management. However, robust simulations of crown fire behavior are still challenging, limiting the accuracy of regional-scale CFP mapping. This study aims to incorporate fire spread simulation and machine learning algorithms to improve CFP mapping at a regional scale. First, we built a crown fire dataset using the fire simulations from the FARSITE model, as well as multi-source data, including fuel, weather, and topography variables. Fuel model parameters were optimized with four metaheuristic algorithms for robust fire simulations. Then, the hybrid models of CFP estimation (TBA-ML) were established by coupling with the transfer AdaBoost (TrAdaBoost) algorithm and three machine learning (ML) algorithms, i.e., Bayesian Network (BN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM), to estimate CFP for crown fire danger assessment spatially. Results showed that the TBA-BN model performed best in estimating CFP with higher accuracy (AUC>0.9 and F1 score > 0.8) than the RF- and SVM-based CFP models. The variable importance and causal analysis showed that fuel and topography variables have major contributions to crown fire occurrence.

 The production of wild fish has remained relatively stable in the last two decades, whereas aquaculture organism production has increased to the point where it has exceeded wild catches. In this context, accurate and up-to-date information about the current usage of marine areas for aquaculture is crucial for the planning of marine activities. However, this data is often limited to national authorities, and discrepancies between planned and real practices can arise in available data. In this study, a novel methodology to automatically map and verify the current activity of aquaculture crops across European regions based on freely available satellite data is proposed. The European Space Agency’s (ESA) Sentinel-1 mission provides Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images, which serve as the basis for the analysis. Multiple SAR images of the same locations are processed using ESA Sentinel Application Platform (SNAP) software and merged to remove temporal noise-like artifacts caused by factors such as ships and waves. Next, the iDPolRAD algorithm is employed to detect potential aquaculture sites, which initially include noise from coastal zones and unwanted human and natural structures that pass through the filter. The aquaculture sites are classified using a ResNet18 model with 93% of the sites correctly classified. This implies that it is feasible to monitor marine areas using satellite radar data to track aquaculture areas. However, generalization power across regions is poor likely due to the diversity of types of structures used and species cultivated. Further studies are needed to investigate factors influencing the detectability of different aquaculture sites such as cage geometry or SAR image resolution in order to enhance the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the mapping process.

 Rapid generation of tree models from point clouds of tree canopies holds wide-ranging applications in the field of earth sciences, including forest ecology research, environmental monitoring, and forest management. Traditional tree modeling methods rely on procedural models to simulate tree growth, which are time-consuming due to their extensive manual parameterization. Furthermore, existing deep learning methods struggle to generate visually realistic tree models because of the complex branch structures and specific natural patterns of trees. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a novel deep learning-based method for rapidly generating tree models that align with the shape of the tree canopy. Different from traditional methods, we use deep neural networks to build branch graphs for generating tree models. Our method consists of two main steps: i) the 3D coordinates of each tree node are generated from the canopy point cloud by the designed node coordinate generation network; ii) a graph neural network is proposed to predict node attributes and the adjacency relationship between nodes. To form the tree structure, the discrete nodes are connected by using the minimum spanning tree algorithm combined with the adjacency relationship. The attributes of the node include width, whether it is a leaf node, and leaf node size, which are used for subsequent construction of the tree’s mesh. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, a large-scale dataset containing 10 forests with 3216 tree canopies is constructed and open sourced for the study of generating tree models from point clouds of tree canopies. Experimental results demonstrate our method’s efficiency in generating tree models quickly (reducing the average canopy-to-tree reconstruction time from 7 min to less than 0.5 s) while preserving visual authenticity and accurately matching tree canopy shapes, making it suitable for a wide range of forest reconstructions.",Jiabo Xu;Zhili Zhang;Xiangyun Hu;Tao Ke,该论文主要关注利用深度学习技术从树冠点云数据中快速生成树木模型，并构建了一个包含10个森林的树冠点云数据集。其应用领域主要集中在森林生态学研究、环境监测和森林管理等方面，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

 As global land cover/ land use change (LULCC) threatens the human’s well-being, accurate detection and characterization of LULCC is of paramount importance. The increasing availability of dense satellite image time series (SITS), together with the ever-improving change detection algorithms, has allowed significant progress to be made. However, much remains to be done in its characterization.This study aims to uncover potential relationships between changes in Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) SITS patterns and their drivers. It distinguishes itself by representing phenological changes not only as transitions between specific patterns, but also by examining the nature of these changes—whether abrupt, gradual, or seasonal. For seasonal changes, it further refines the analysis to determine their impact on the amplitude, number of seasons (NOS), or length of seasons (LOS) components. Our focus is to provide insights into the land dynamics and drivers of change in Senegal using an RGB (red, green, blue) composite change map. This map is derived from three MODIS NDVI time series change metrics detected by BFASTm-L2 within the MODIS NDVI 2000–2021 SITS: magnitude of change, direction of change, and dissimilarity of time series shape. The 250-meter resolution MODIS data served as an optimal data source for this analysis due to its high temporal resolution (near daily) and extensive coverage over 20 years.The sensitivity of each metric to different types of change was first tested on a simulated dataset before being applied to the MODIS SITS. The RGB change map enabled visualization of different “signatures” of change, which, combined with ground information, rainfall data, NDVI time series analysis, and Google Earth imagery, helped link these signatures to various drivers of change. Climatic and anthropogenic changes, such as those induced by Large Scale Agricultural Investments (LSAI) or mining, were visually inferred from the RGB map.This approach demonstrates the usefulness of integrating the type of change, especially seasonal change, into the characterization of land change.

 A timing and precise diagnosis of crop nutrient status is essential for optimizing management practices that promote environmentally friendly and enhanced crop yields. Although plant tissue analysis has conventionally been employed to evaluate the nutritional status of crops, this method cannot capture the spatial variability of crop nutrients. In contrast, satellite-based remote sensing can monitor the nutrient status of crops across expansive areas. This study explored the capability of multi-source satellite images (PlanetScope-4: 3 m, 4 bands; PlanetScope-8: 3 m, 8 bands; Sentinel-2: 10–60 m, 13 bands; PRISMA: 30 m, 239 bands) in mapping 12 foliar nutrients in cranberries. Three machine learning approaches, including partial least squared regression (PLSR), support vector regression (SVR), random forest regression (RFR), were used to relate foliar nutrients to different types of satellite-derived features (SR: surface reflectance; VI: vegetation indices; TF: texture features) or their combinations (SR+VI, VI+TF and SR+VI+TF). Model performance was compared across different foliar nutrients, modelling approaches and combinations of model input features using R2 (the coefficient of determination) and RRMSE (relative root mean square error, = root mean square error/nutrient range × 100 %). Input features that were important to foliar nutrient modelling were identified. The model performance difference among nutrients was consistent between Planet-4 and Sentinel-2, as well as between Planet-8 and PRISMA. In the Planet-4 and Sentinel-2 derived models, N was best predicted (average R2 = 0.77, average RRMSE=15 %), followed by macronutrients S (0.60–0.63, 11 %), Mg (0.58–0.65, 10–11 %), Ca (0.49–0.51, 9 %), Na (0.69, 22 %), P (0.49, 9 %) and K (0.20, 8 %), and then by all micronutrients(i.e., Fe, Mn, B, Cu and Zn: R2 = 0.04–0.61; RRMSE=16–28 %). In the Planet-8 and PRISMA derived models, macronutrients (i.e., N, P, K, Mg, Ca, S and Na) had lower R2 and RRMSE (R2 = 0.06–0.59; RRMSE=7–57 %) than micronutrients (i.e., Fe, Mn, B, Cu and Zn: R2 = 0.18–0.60; RRMSE=19–66 %). The successful retrieval of foliar nutrients from satellite imagery was influenced by many factors, including the intercorrelation between nutrients and model input features, the data availability at critical growth stages, and satellite images characteristics (e.g., spatial and spectral resolutions). Except for foliar nitrogen, foliar nutrients typically do not exhibit distinct absorption features associated with C, H, N, or O molecular bonds in the 400–2500 nm range. Our results indicate that their successful retrieval can be primarily attributed to the association between foliar nutrients and other leaf components (e.g., pigments, water, and dry matter) that do display spectral features within this range.

 High-throughput phenotypic analysis plays an increasingly important role in crop breeding. In such research, the breeder usually establishes hundreds to thousands of plots, with each plot having its independent genetic breeding sources. The breeding plot extraction of genetic sources is usually outlined manually on RGB UAV imagery, which is time-consuming and subject to human bias. Therefore, a rapid method to extract the breeding plot for each genetic source in high-throughput phenotypic analysis would be very significant. In this paper, we propose a transferable method for extracting breeding plots from UAV RGB imagery. We utilized the fully convolutional neural network model A-UNet with an attention gate. After obtaining binary raster data from deep learning, we introduced post-processing. Subsequently, the raster data after post-processing were converted to vector data to obtain geographical coordinates. Finally, the UAV imagery was masked by the vector data to obtain the extraction results for each plot. The results showed that A-UNet achieved accuracies of over 90 % in precision, recall, and F1 score. Post-processing resulted in a 93 % average IoU in breeding plot extraction in the main study area.

 The point-based 3D object detection method is highly advantageous due to its lightweight nature and fast inference speed, making it a valuable asset in engineering fields such as intelligent transportation and autonomous driving. However, current advanced methods solely focus on learning features from the provided point cloud, neglecting the active role of unoccupied space. This results in the problem of discontinuous receptive field (DRF), leading to the loss of semantic and geometric information of the objects. To address this issue, we propose a new end-to-end single-stage point-based model, DRF-SSD, in this paper. DRF-SSD utilizes a PointNet++-style 3D backbone to maintain fast inference capability. Then, point-wise features are projected onto a plane in the Neck structure, and local and global information are aggregated through the designed Hierarchical Encoding–Decoding (HED) and Hybrid Transformer (HT) modules. The former fills in features for unoccupied space through convolutional layers, enhancing local features by interacting with features in occupied space during the learning process. The latter further expands the receptive field using the global learning ability of transformers. The spatial transformation and learning processes in HED and HT only involve key points, and HED is designed to have a special structure that maintains the sparsity of feature maps, preserving the efficiency of the model’s inference. Finally, query features are back-projected onto points for feature enhancement and input into the detection head for prediction. Extensive experiments on the KITTI datasets demonstrate that DRF-SSD achieves superior detection accuracy compared to previous methods, with significant improvements. Specifically, the approach obtains 2.25%, 0.66%, and 0.42% improvement for the metric of 3D Average Precision (AP3D) under the easy, moderate, and hard settings, respectively.

A sensitivity simulation in terms of trend, annual amplitude, and phase revealed that the SSF solution with a 1° coastal buffer zone provides a better land-to-ocean leakage correction than traditionally used Spherical Harmonics (SH). It was also found that an additional smoothing procedure for SSF with low concentrating energy could significantly reduce the high-frequency noise in GRACE (e.g., the north–south strips). The spatiotemporal characteristics of the true MSL were further compared among GRACE SH and Mascon solutions, model-predicted ocean bottom pressure, and steric-corrected altimetric data (i.e., satellite-altimetric sea level minus steric effect). Results revealed that despite the SSF-inverted regional MSL solution being generally similar to other results, this technique notably recovered the realistic magnitude of detailed features. The apparent MSL signal was, for instance, precisely recovered in the central part of the Gulf of Thailand and the Sunda Shelf by the SSF, while the SH significantly underestimated it due to smoothing. In addition to the seasonality, the interannual signal decomposed from the SSF-inverted residual MSL (by removing the trend and periodic signals) was the strongest and well cross-correlated with the Southern Oscillation Index. With more detailed spatial patterns revealed by MSL from GRACE SSF, our findings demonstrate that SSF is more suitable for regional-scale studies.",Zhongtian Ma;Hok Sum Fok;Robert Tenzer;Jianli Chen,这篇论文主要研究了利用GRACE卫星重力测量数据，结合球形斯列皮安函数（SSF）来确定南海区域的质量项海平面变化。文章重点关注了陆地到海洋泄漏的处理方法，并通过模拟分析发现SSF方法比传统的球谐函数（SH）方法更有效地修正了泄漏问题。此外，论文还分析了SSF方法在减少GRACE数据中的高频噪声方面的优势，并比较了不同方法得到的南海区域海平面变化结果，发现SSF方法能够更好地保留区域海平面变化的细节特征。

 Campi Flegrei caldera is an Italian high-risk volcano experiencing a progressively more intense long-term uplift, accompanied by increasing seismicity and geochemical emissions over the last two decades. Ground deformation shows an axisymmetric bell-shaped pattern, with a maximum uplift of about 120 cm, from 2005, in the caldera central area. We analyzed Sentinel-1 and COSMO-SkyMed Multi-Temporal DInSAR measurements and GNSS data to reveal and investigate a geodetic anomaly that has clearly manifested since 2021, locally deviating from the typical bell-shaped deformation pattern. This anomaly is located east of Pozzuoli town, in the Mt. Olibano–Accademia area, covers an area of about 1.3 km2 and shows, in comparison to surrounding areas, a maximum uplift deficit of about 9 cm between 2021 and 2023. To investigate the anomaly causes, we analyzed the caldera seismicity and inverted the DInSAR data to determine the primary source of the ground deformation pattern, which is consistent with a penny-shaped source located approximately 3800 m beneath the Pozzuoli town, with a radius of about 1200 m. We also found that the time evolution of the uplift deficit in the geodetic anomaly area correlates well with the earthquake occurrence, with the greater magnitude events clustering in this area. These considerations suggest the geodetic anomaly is a local response to the tensile stress regime produced by the inflating primary deformation source. This phenomenon can be influenced by the Mt. Olibano–Accademia lava domes lithological heterogeneities that may induce a localized reaction to ground deformation during the inflationary phase. Our interpretation aligns with the concentration of earthquakes and hydrothermal fluid emissions in this area, indicating the presence of faults, fractures, and fluid circulation. Accordingly, the geodetic anomaly area represents a zone of crustal weakness that requires careful monitoring and study.",Flora Giudicepietro;Francesco Casu;Manuela Bonano;Claudio De Luca;Prospero De Martino;Federico Di Traglia;Mauro Antonio Di Vito;Giovanni Macedonio;Michele Manunta;Fernando Monterroso;Pasquale Striano;Riccardo Lanari,该论文主要研究了意大利坎皮弗莱格瑞火山口的地球物理异常现象。研究人员利用DInSAR和GNSS数据分析了火山口的地表形变，发现了一个局部异常区域，该区域的隆起量低于周围地区。研究表明，该异常区域可能是由火山口下方岩浆囊的膨胀引起的，并与该区域地震活动和热液流体排放有关。论文重点关注火山口的地表形变和地震活动，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

 Human health is directly impacted by trace components found in soil, for which hyperspectral remote sensing technology offers a novel way to rapidly assess dynamic soil environmental quality. In most studies, the premise of quantitative inversion on soil elements is that the known target elements will cause growth stress. However, such stress is unusual in non-polluted areas. Consequently, broad-area soil trace element monitoring in non-contaminated areas remains challenging. Spectral inversion of plant material has a longer time window and is more sensitive to elemental changes than soil spectral inversion (bare soil period). In this work, we conducted a wheat pot experiment with concentration gradients of four trace elements (Fe, B, Mo, and Zn), analyzed leaf (jointing stage) and spike (maturity period) samples using spectral measurements and chemical tests, and filtered the characteristic positions and inverse modeling using the spectra of the element-accumulating preference organs in plant canopies. The canopy aggregation sites differed for each element, and both simple linear regression (SLR) and multiple linear regression (MLR) models based on the spectra of canopy aggregation sites achieved high accuracy.

 Although high-resolution satellite and in situ airborne observations are becoming a common data source for fire monitoring, reconstruction of the historical fire record is based on less suitable data. In many regions, managers and policy-makers rely solely on coarse resolution global fire datasets. This study assessed the suitability of readily available products to accurately depict several fire metrics by comparing them to the manually derived fire scars within three natural reserves in South Africa (2003–2020). Contrary to previous findings, we showed that MCD64A1 and FireCCI51 products detected the majority of the burned area (70–97 %) within protected areas and showed high temporal consistency. Additionally, active and burned area products accurately detected the length and the peak of the fire season. Nonetheless, we found neither medium nor coarse resolution data suitable for evaluating long-term changes in fire size distribution. Coarse resolution burned area products demonstrated a very limited capacity to detect fires smaller than 100 ha, while a lack of sufficient non-cloudy Landsat images led to substantial gaps in fire reconstruction, bringing an unknown level of uncertainties in fire metrics estimates. Similarly, the only available medium-resolution burned area product (GABAM) was unsuitable for fire monitoring since unmapped areas were classified as unburned, making no distinction between regions with an absence of data and an absence of fires. Meanwhile, the performance of FireCCILT11 was ranked the lowest among all the available fire products. Given the lack of resources in many protected areas in South Africa and the pressing need to evaluate current and historical fire management practices and policies, we conclude that, in the absence of a more accurate higher-resolution alternative, MCD64A1 was the most suitable product for capturing year-to-year fluctuations in fire activity and a combination of MODIS and VIIRS active fire products for monitoring changes in fire seasonality.",Maria Zubkova;Mervyn Lötter;Frik Bronkhorst;Louis Giglio,"该研究评估了粗分辨率火灾产品在监测南非保护区火灾状况长期变化方面的有效性。研究人员比较了三种不同分辨率的火灾产品（MCD64A1, FireCCI51, GABAM）与手动绘制的火灾疤痕数据，分析了这些产品在监测火灾面积、火灾季节长度和峰值以及火灾大小分布方面的表现。研究发现，MCD64A1和FireCCI51产品能够检测到大部分的火灾面积，并能准确地识别火灾季节的长度和峰值。然而，这些产品在监测火灾大小分布方面表现不佳，无法识别小于100公顷的火灾。研究结论指出，在缺乏更高分辨率数据的情况下，MCD64A1产品最适合用于监测火灾活动的年际波动，而结合MODIS和VIIRS主动火灾产品则可以监测火灾季节性的变化。"

 There is an urgent need for accurate and effective Landslide Early Warning Systems (LEWS). Most LEWS are currently based on temporally-aggregated measures of rainfall derived from either in-situ measurements or satellite-based rainfall estimates. Relying on a summary metric of precipitation may not capture the complexity of the rainfall signal and its dynamics in space and time in triggering landslides. Here, we present a proof-of-concept for constructing a LEWS based on an integrated spatio-temporal modelling framework. Our proposed methodology builds upon a recent approach that uses a daily rainfall time series instead of the traditional scalar aggregation. Specifically, we partition the study area into slope units and use a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) to process satellite-derived rainfall time series and combine the output features with a second neural network (NN) tasked with capturing the effect of terrain characteristics. To assess if our approach enhances accuracy, we applied it in Vietnam and benchmarked it against a modelling counterpart where we replaced the rainfall time series with the corresponding scalar representative of the cumulated precipitation. The corresponding duration was set at 14 days as it proved to produce the best performance. Our results show that our protocol leads to better performance in hindcasting landslides when making use of the rainfall as a continuous signal over time.

 Under the dual pressures of rapid urbanization and global warming, the management of solar radiation has become an urgent issue to address. In this context, the potential regulatory role of urban street networks on solar radiation has garnered widespread attention. However, existing research lacks an understanding of the impact of street direction. By utilising street view data and solar trajectory simulation technology, it becomes possible to facilitate the revelation of spatiotemporal differences in solar radiation across streets with different direction. The results show that solar radiation is generally lower on north–south streets than on east–west streets. In terms of spatial differences, the average solar radiation in the fifth ring of Beijing is 25.38% higher than that in the second ring. Temporally, the average solar radiation in August, the highest month, is 15.98% greater than in October, the lowest month. Additionally, solar radiation on east–west street direction shows more intense variations in summer. A periodic variation in solar radiation was also discovered in relation to street angles, with different frequencies and amplitudes at 30° and 180°.

 Wetland system is one of the most important ecosystems on the earth’s surface. It is significant important to monitor wetland ecosystem using remote sensing technology. However, the complexity, fuzziness, and spatial heterogeneity of wetlands increase the difficulty of wetland classification, leading to the problem that the classification accuracy is not high enough to satisfy the needs of in-depth research. At present, the classification of wetlands is mainly based on pixel based- and image object based- methods. Addressing the problems of traditional pixel based- and image object based- methods, this study proposes to utilize fuzzy geospatial objects to express wetland objects. By synthesizing the spectral features, shape features, texture features, fuzziness and other features of wetland objects, a hierarchical classification method based on fuzzy geospatial objects is proposed. Taking Tianjin Binhai New Area as the study area, Sentinel-2 satellite remote sensing images are utilized for verification. The main contents of this study and its results are as follows: (1) Extract the fuzzy geospatial objects of wetlands and construct the classification feature sets. (2) To simplify the classification problem, a hierarchical classification framework based on optimizing multiple attributes using Random Forest is proposed. By this method, the problems of difficulty in distinguishing wetlands and low classification accuracy caused by similarity of spectral features of wetland objects in the traditional single layer classification method are solved. Three experiments are designed in the study to verify the effects of the fuzzy geospatial objects of wetlands and the hierarchical classification method on the classification accuracy of wetlands, respectively. The results show that the overall accuracy and Kappa coefficient of the proposed hierarchical wetland classification method based on fuzzy geospatial objects are 94.35% and 0.899, respectively, which are 12.35% and 0.183 higher than those of the traditional image object based- methods.",Yu Lin;Jifa Guo,这篇论文主要研究的是利用遥感技术对湿地进行分类。研究者提出了一种基于模糊地理对象的层次分类方法，并以天津滨海新区为例进行了验证。该方法利用了湿地对象的多种特征，包括光谱特征、形状特征、纹理特征和模糊性等，并通过随机森林算法对这些特征进行优化，最终实现了对湿地的高精度分类。论文中并没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测和大气成分分析等。

 Lunar lava tube caves, due to their unique geographical structure and potential as shelters, have repeatedly emerged as prime candidates or priority areas during discussions on lunar base site selection. However, owing to current technological limitations and the complexities of lunar exploration, obtaining detailed data directly from the interiors of lunar lava tubes poses a significant challenge. Hence, the study of terrestrial lava tubes assumes critical importance. By delving into Earth’s lava tubes, we can gain insights into crucial aspects such as their formation mechanisms, geological characteristics, and stability, which can then inform and guide research on lava tubes found on extraterrestrial bodies like the Moon and Mars. During the data acquisition process for lava tubes, given their intricate spatial configurations and dim lighting conditions, we have opted to employ LiDAR technology to collect point cloud data, revealing the internal structural information of the lava tubes. Consequently, this paper thoroughly explores a method for extracting lava tube parameters and constructing models using this point cloud data. This approach encompasses four key steps: data preprocessing, axis construction of the lava tube, cross-sectional feature extraction, and 3D model reconstruction. Initially, raw data is refined through the creation of point cloud voxels to mitigate noise interference. Subsequently, an iterative algorithm is utilized to obtain the L1-medial skeleton, enabling precise capture of the lava tube’s axis information. Using this extracted axis, we proceed with sampling at fixed intervals to derive cross-sectional points of the lava tube. These points are then utilized to extract fundamental geometric parameters such as cross-sectional area, length, and width. Ultimately, by integrating all these cross-sectional point cloud data, a comprehensive 3D model of the lava tube is constructed. Remarkably, this method achieves a high degree of accuracy, with 99 % of the extracted cross-sectional points exhibiting an error of less than 0.12 m, and 99 % of the model’s positional errors falling within 0.15 m. This not only enhances the precision of parameter extraction but also provides significant technical support for in-depth studies of extraterrestrial volcanic activities and lava tube formation mechanisms.

 Due to its advantages of high spatiotemporal resolution, long-term stable observation, and historical retrospective data, satellite remote sensing has extensive application in the dynamic monitoring of water quality in coastal and inland waters. However, constructing generic satellite inversion models for water quality indicators, especially non-optically active parameters such as nutrients, remains challenging due to the varying pollution sources in different inland waters. This study aims to address this challenge from a data-driven perspective. Based on Sentinel-2 satellite images and in situ data from 311 automatic monitoring stations in Zhejiang Province, China, a large volume of matchups between satellite-derived water spectra and in situ water quality parameter concentrations were constructed, including the permanganate index (CODMn, N=8760, from 0.08 to 9.88 mg/L), total nitrogen (TN, N=7434, from 0.01 to 9.30 mg/L), total phosphorus (TP, N=8845, from 0.001 to 0.991 mg/L), ammonia nitrogen (NH3-N, N=8642, from 0.001 to 1.980 mg/L) and water turbidity (TUB, N=7913, from 0.1 to 1994 NTU). Satellite retrieval models for the five water quality parameters were constructed utilizing the extreme gradient boosting tree algorithm (XGBoost), which can be applied to diverse inland waters. The models showed robust performance on the additional independent dataset, with correlation coefficients (r) of 0.74, 0.79, 0.84, 0.72, and 0.87, and root mean square errors (RMSEs) of 0.73 mg/L, 0.56 mg/L, 0.18 mg/L, 0.24 mg/L, and 0.29 NTU for CODMn, TN, TP, NH3-N, and TUB, respectively. Comparisons between satellite-retrieved and in situ values showed good consistency in both spatial and temporal distributions. By applying these models to inland waters in Zhejiang Province, the monthly distributions of major rivers and reservoirs with a 10 m resolution for the five water quality parameters were obtained. The patterns of the five water quality parameters across the rivers typically indicated elevated values in the downstream regions and diminished values in the upstream areas, except for those of the Yongjiang River and Cao’e River. Compared to rivers, reservoirs had good water quality. However, for some water quality parameters, the temporal variations in the average values over the whole reservoir and the values at specific sites had opposite trends.

 The Himawari-8 satellite has the capability to rapidly retrieve sea surface temperature (SST) data at a high frequency of 10 min, demonstrating significant potential for various scientific applications. However, the presence of cloud often results in missing SST data at cloud locations, or can reduce the accuracy of retrieved SST. In contrast to the method of reconstructing missing SST data, this study focuses on exploring the potential of inverting SST under all-sky conditions. This study proposes a three-layer stacked machine learning model (TLSM), specifically designed for SST under all-sky conditions. The model integrates cloud properties into its input features to effectively account for the influence of cloud cover.

In cases of optically thin clouds and clouds with low cloud top pressure, TLSM exhibits commendable proficiency in the inversion of SST. The Bias and RMSE for these cloud types indicate better performance compared to the official clear-sky SST data.

 Protected areas play a crucial role in safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services. However, they face mounting challenges from environmental pressures. This study examines the Oshtorankooh Protected Area (OPA) in Iran, evaluating its vulnerability to various environmental hazards from 2010 to 2020.A comprehensive set of variables, including physiographic, climatic, geological, edaphic, vegetative, hydrological, and socio-economic factors, were utilized to compute 45 vulnerability indicators across three dimensions: exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity for 2010 and 2020. Maps of these indicators were created and standardized, with weights assigned using the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP). Composite indices for exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity were then developed by integrating these weighted and standardized maps.The vulnerability indices for grid cells within the OPA enabled the identification of spatial vulnerability patterns, highlighting heightened vulnerability in the northern and western sectors influenced by factors such as drought variability, social vulnerability, evapotranspiration rates, spring discharge, and runoff dynamics. Results indicate a notable increase in vulnerability over the study period, with index values rising from 0.76 in 2010 to 2.04 in 2020. This spatially explicit vulnerability assessment underscores the dynamic nature of vulnerabilities within protected areas, emphasizing the necessity for adaptive management strategies.

 Semantic segmentation is key in analyzing urban mobile laser scanning (MLS) point clouds. In recent years, the Transformer mechanism, known for capturing long-range contextual relationships, has attracted significant research attention in the field of 3D vision. However, computing global self-attention for 3D scenes incurs high computational costs and the loss of local details. Our work introduces a Dual Domain Transformer network (D2T-Net), adept at processing complex urban MLS point clouds. It operates efficiently in spatial and channel dimensions, enabling efficient semantic segmentation while maintaining detailed scene elements like small urban objects. We introduce a Local Spatial-wise Transformer (LST) block to enrich local semantics through an improved self-attention mechanism that incorporates relative embeddings and transfers spatial information across various representation subspaces in parallel.

 Rapeseed cultivation on winter-fallow fields enables a seasonal switch between agricultural and bioenergy output. In view of the spectral features during the rapeseed flowering period (RFP), numerous remote sensing studies identified and produced the maps of rapeseed fields. The RFP is frequently identified by field surveys, visual imagery interpretation, or empirical crop knowledge in a specific region, none of which is appropriate for large-scale rapeseed identification and mapping. In this research, we combine social media data on the RFP fields, Sentinel-2 imagery, and deep learning algorithm to identify and produce maps of yellow-flowering rapeseed fields.

 Deep learning is widely applied in synthetic aperture radar (SAR) target recognition. However, the high cost of collecting real SAR target data leads to insufficient data volume and diversity of SAR target datasets, making it challenging to support deep learning models. Therefore, it is necessary to expand SAR target datasets through data generation. However, existing SAR target data generation methods do not fully utilize the SAR imaging geometric information of targets. This results in generating image data that does not conform to SAR physical imaging laws. To address this problem, this paper proposes a SAR vehicle data generation method that integrates deep imaging geometric information. Compared to SAR, optical data, which contains rich geometric structural information of targets, is relatively easy to collect. Therefore, the proposed method computes the dominant scattering edge (DSE) of targets under different radar incident angles with optical data. Then, based on generative adversarial networks (GAN), a SAR vehicle target data generation model is constructed. To guide the model in learning SAR imaging geometric laws of targets, the computed DSE is integrated into the generation network with multi-scale attention mechanism modules. Compared to existing SAR target data generation methods, our proposed method can generate SAR vehicle target data with distinct dominant scattering edges, and effectively addresses the issue of generated target data not conforming to SAR imaging physical laws. Metrics such as Fréchet Inception Distance (FID), scattering intensity difference, and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) are adopted for evaluation. The SSIM between the generated and the real SAR target data reaches 0.834, the FID minimum of 96.98, and the scattering intensity difference minimum of 0.37 dB, all indicating that the SAR target data generated by the proposed method is similar to real ones in terms of deep feature, scattering intensity, and image structure. Finally, the SAR target data generated by the proposed method is verified through target recognition experiments with VGG16 and ResNet50 as backbone network. The average recognition accuracy increases by 2.80% and 2.14%, respectively. The target recognition results demonstrate that the generated SAR data can help improve target recognition accuracy, thereby validating the effectiveness of data generated by the proposed method.",Xiaokun Sun;Xinwei Li;Deliang Xiang;Canbin Hu,这篇论文主要研究的是利用合成孔径雷达 (SAR) 数据生成车辆目标图像的方法。它提出了一种基于生成对抗网络 (GAN) 的方法，通过计算目标在不同雷达入射角下的主散射边缘 (DSE) 来生成符合 SAR 成像物理规律的车辆目标图像。论文中没有涉及大气环境遥感技术，例如空气质量监测、卫星观测或大气成分分析。

 Human visual attention is the basis of target recognition, change detection and classification in remote sensing images. However, the human visual attention of remote sensing images during target detection remains uninvestigated. In this study, we simultaneously collected eye tracking and electroencephalography (EEG) data of 40 experts during target detection in 1000 remote sensing images. We quantified their attention in different phases of target detection (i.e., target search, selection, and identification) from their eye movements and brain activities. The eye-tracking results indicated that hue and lightness were crucial visual features that guided visual search for remote sensing images. The size of the target also affected the allocation of human attention resources. Particularly, participants tended to miss the targets that were smaller than 3.9 % of the whole image area. The fixation event-related potentials (FRPs) in temporal and parietal brain regions further distinguished the attention of targets and distractors, which could be attributed to the process of memory and processing.

 Ocean loading deformation is one of the key processes in geodesy, geophysics, and Isostasy, and is also important for assessment of future coastal environmental changes. Traditionally, the ocean tide loading has been considered the only contributor to the ocean loading deformation by most previous InSAR (Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar) studies. In this study, we quantify the non-tidal ocean loading deformation using the multi-temporal InSAR-derived deformation data from the Chaoshan coast in southern China and explore its driving mechanisms. Our results show that InSAR deformation anomalies in the Chaoshan coastal area exhibit a distinct deformation gradient from the coast to inland. A strong scale- and direction-dependent pattern in InSAR data, with significant seasonality, is unveiled by the second-order spatial structure function. To explore the driving mechanism behind this deformation, we conduct a correlation analysis between spatial pattern of land deformation and sea level changes. The results indicate that ocean loading is the predominant driving factor behind the Chaoshan coastal deformation. Analysis using the MERRA2 model demonstrates that terrestrial water storage loading deformation is negligible in comparison. Furthermore, by applying the FES2014b tide model, we find that the contributions of the non-tidal and tide-induced ocean loading deformation to the total deformation anomaly are 50–70% and 30–50%, respectively. Lastly, we have uncovered that the non-tidal ocean loading is primarily attributed to the monsoon-induced seasonal sea level changes, with a time lag ranging from one to two months.

 Northern peatland vegetation exhibits fine-scale spatial and spectral heterogeneity that can potentially be captured with uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV) data due to their ultra-high spatial resolution (<10 cm). From this perspective, the contribution of different spectral sensors in mapping various vegetation characteristics has not been thoroughly investigated.

 Aquaculture mapping is essential for monitoring and managing aquaculture resources. However, accurately geotargeting individual aquaculture ponds from medium-resolution remote sensing imagery remains challenging, and convolutional deep learning methods for identifying aquaculture ponds require labor-intensive pixel-level annotations. This paper presents a novel weakly-supervised learning method to derive pixel-level labels from image-level annotations for aquaculture ponds. Our approach uses iterative anti-adversarial attacks to refine localization results from multi-scale class activation maps (CAMs). The improved method integrates two regularization methods guided by aquaculture features to form a joint loss function for adversarial samples: discriminative water region suppression and non-aquaculture water class suppression. We also propose an aquaculture feature termed CFNDWI to constrain the localization results and generate high-quality pseudo-labels. As a result, the pseudo-labels are used to train semantic segmentation networks for accurately identifying aquaculture ponds.

However, the third runway and taxiway, which were paved in September 2021, suffered from severe surface settlement. Therefore, we attempted to reveal the settlement pattern within the 3RS and analyze the factors contributing to this displacement. Employing the multi-temporal interferometric synthetic aperture radar (MT-InSAR) technique, we utilized PAZ, COSMO-SkyMed, and Sentinel-1 satellite images to extract ground displacements along the radar line of sight.

To ensure the reliability of the derived displacements along the LOS, we validated them through cross-validation, comparing the outcomes from different SAR data with data from GPS stations. In order to gain a detailed deformation information, we derived the vertical and horizontal (ground range direction) displacements by utilizing deformation measurements along the LOS of multiple SAR satellites and the geometric information, and the maximum values recorded for vertical and E-W displacements reached 88.31 mm/y and 41.91 mm/y, respectively. Furthermore, our investigation revealed that the significant local deformation observed on the taxiway and third runway was predominantly attributed to various factors including the creep of soft soil, consolidation of filling materials, characteristics of road surface materials, and distinct stages of construction.",Peifeng Ma;Xiucheng Jiang,该研究主要关注的是利用合成孔径雷达（SAR）技术监测香港国际机场三跑道系统（3RS）的沉降情况。研究使用了PAZ、COSMO-SkyMed和Sentinel-1卫星图像，通过多时相干涉合成孔径雷达（MT-InSAR）技术提取了地面沿雷达视线方向的位移。研究结果表明，PAZ在监测HKIA变形方面表现出优于COSMO-SkyMed和Sentinel-1的性能，能够获取更多变形细节和更大的位移。研究还分析了导致3RS沉降的因素，包括软土蠕变、填料固结、路面材料特性和施工阶段等。该研究主要集中在利用SAR技术监测地面变形，与大气环境遥感技术关系不大。

 Ethiopian lakes face multiple ecosystem threats from human and natural factors, including climate change. The long-term dynamics of water surface area in many lakes remain unknown. This study presents the first comprehensive account of major Ethiopian lakes’ long-term water surface area dynamics, providing essential information for prioritizing hydrological conservation strategies. We extracted the time-series water surface area of the lakes from Landsat images in the Google Earth Engine (GEE), using the Modified Normalized Water Index (MNDWI) and machine learning (Random Forest) methods. Random Forest (RF) outperformed MNDWI across many lakes, especially when water body spectral characteristics became complex. A comparison of the results with the Joint Research Center (JRC) Global Surface Water Mapping Layers showed a good agreement. Long-term water surface area dynamics showed both common and distinct trends. Common trends included: (a) similar recession and expansion periodicities despite lakes being in different climatic zones, (b) an increase in the inter-annual variability of water area after 2000, and (c) a common abrupt point in time (2000/2001). Distinct trends included: (i) long-term decline in five lakes (Abiyata, Langano, Shalla, Chamo, and Hayq), (ii) expansion in three lakes (Ziway, Hawassa, and Abaya), and (iii) non-homogeneous long-term trends in two lakes (Tana and Hardibo). These common and distinct trends show the interplay of climate phenomena and lake-specific factors. Climate factors govern inter-annual lake area change (decreasing/increasing) and recession and expansion cycle periods. The magnitudes of changes and recovery rates after each change cycle vary based on lake-specific factors. We recommend prioritizing conservation efforts for lakes with high water storage degradation risks, as indicated by significant water loss over the historical period and persistent long-term declining trends. This includes Abiyata, Chamo, Shalla, Langano, Hayq, and Hardibo, in order of priority.",Yonas Getaneh;Wuletawu Abera;Assefa Abegaz;Lulseged Tamene,这篇论文主要研究了埃塞俄比亚主要湖泊的表面水域面积变化，利用 Landsat 卫星影像数据，分析了 1985 年至 2023 年期间水域面积的时空变化趋势。研究发现，气候变化和湖泊自身因素共同影响了水域面积的变化，并对不同湖泊的长期趋势产生了不同的影响。论文重点关注了水域面积变化对水资源管理和生态保护的影响，并提出了针对不同湖泊的保护策略。
